2025-06-27T15:55:46,"Weekly Crypto Regulation News Roundup: June 23-27, 2025","Bitcoin roared back to life this week, climbing to $105,000 following a truce announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump on June 23 as crypto regulation efforts across the globe continue in full force. The digital asset briefly touched $106,000 before settling at its current level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $105,064 — a welcome reprieve for investors who have weathered weeks of regulatory uncertainty and political tension. But it’s not just the price of Bitcoin making headlines this week. In Washington, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are ramping up their efforts to bring clarity and oversight to the U.S. crypto sector, with several key developments pointing to a turning point in digital asset regulation. Lummis: Two Crypto Bills Must Pass in 2025 Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a longtime proponent of responsible crypto legislation, has renewed her call for decisive action in Congress. Speaking with CNBC’s Joe Kernen on Squawk Box this week, Lummis emphasized the importance of passing both the GENIUS Act — focused on digital asset developments and user safety — and the much-anticipated crypto market structure bill. Senator Cynthia Lummis spoke with CNBC on Wednesday about the importance of passing crypto legislation before the year's end. #CynthiaLummis #CryptoLegislation https://t.co/dhmb7SKv6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 “I’m not saying combine them, but they both need to pass this year,” Lummis asserted, stressing the urgent need for legal clarity around stablecoins. Her remarks come amid bipartisan deliberations over how to reconcile separate House and Senate proposals into a unified framework that can win cross-chamber support. GOP Lays Groundwork for Crypto Market Rules In a separate but closely related development, senior Senate Republicans unveiled a set of foundational principles for digital asset regulation. Spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) , the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, the new guidelines aim to establish regulatory clarity while protecting investors. Senate GOP has laid out crypto market structure principles, clarifying regulation and oversight for digital assets. #CryptoRegulation #USSenate https://t.co/4hKf2Ktbim — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 “These principles will serve as an important baseline for negotiations on this bill,” said Scott, who was joined by Senators Thom Tillis, Bill Hagerty, and Cynthia Lummis in crafting the proposal. The document marks one of the clearest signs yet that the Senate is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with the House on comprehensive crypto legislation. The GOP principles are expected to influence the upcoming round of congressional negotiations and could shape the next wave of policy that governs everything from token classifications to consumer protections and compliance requirements for stablecoin issuers. COIN Act Targets Regulation of Politicians’ Crypto Profits Meanwhile, the intersection of politics and crypto has triggered a legislative response of its own. Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the COIN Act (Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure), which would ban presidents and their immediate families from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. Senator @SenAdamSchiff has introduced legislation that would bar the president, vice president, and their family members from crypto. #Crypto #Trump https://t.co/9niXxDMAc0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 The bill — clearly aimed at potential conflicts of interest — also mandates disclosure of any digital asset transactions exceeding $1,000. Violators could face up to five years in prison and civil penalties equivalent to the profits earned. Schiff’s legislation comes amid growing concerns over President Trump’s expanding involvement in the digital asset space. Trump-Linked Crypto Firm Prepares Stablecoin Audit Those concerns are far from hypothetical. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a cryptocurrency firm tied to Donald Trump, is stepping up efforts to bolster credibility. Co-founder Zak Folkman announced at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn that the company is preparing to release a third-party audit of its stablecoin holdings, alongside a new mobile app launch. Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial plans to release a stablecoin audit and debut a new app soon, co-founder Zak Folkman confirmed Wednesday. #Trump #WLFI https://t.co/yVPQqslR4F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 The audit, conducted by an independent accounting firm, is intended to boost transparency as WLFI faces mounting political and regulatory scrutiny. Folkman also hinted at upcoming changes to WLFI’s governance token, suggesting that enhanced token liquidity may be on the horizon. “I think everyone is going to be very, very happy,” he told the audience, stopping short of revealing concrete details. Trump Media Moves Ahead with $400M Buyback Rounding out the week’s Trump-crypto nexus, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. — the parent company of Truth Social — announced a $400 million share buyback plan. The buyback, approved by the board of directors, is positioned as a move to return value to shareholders while retaining strategic flexibility. @TrumpMediaTech has unveiled a $400M stock buyback and maintains a $2.3B Bitcoin reserve. #TrumpMedia #Bitcoin https://t.co/oCc9eMHuSo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 23, 2025 Also the company continues to guard a sizeable $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury, showing the president’s growing entanglement with the digital asset world. “The Board took a vote of confidence in our company, our stock, and our strategic plans,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media. Crypto Regulation To Face Crossroads Ahead Taken together, these developments show a pivotal moment for U.S. crypto regulation. From legislative momentum in Congress to headline-making moves by politically connected crypto firms, the digital asset landscape is rapidly evolving. While price action may grab the headlines, it’s the slow grind of regulatory clarity that will ultimately determine the shape and success of the U.S. crypto market.

2025-06-27T15:51:51,"Pi Coin Price Prediction – What’s Coming on June 28? Google Hype Sends Pi Up 38%","Pi Coin (PI) has bounced from a recent low in the past seven days ahead of a key event called Pi2Day, at which the developing team is expected to reveal its upcoming ecosystem initiatives. On June 21, the Pi Core Team teased what could be the central topic to be discussed and shared during tomorrow’s event as they pointed to Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis’s presentation at the Generative AI panel at the Consensus 2025 . This is an event hosted by CoinDesk where the future of cryptocurrencies and Web 3 projects is typically discussed. #PiNetwork rumored to have a Google Ai deal, announcement expected on Pi2Day (Pi app shows Google Ai icon). #IceNetwork ecosystem launch with surprise developments! Both projects set for massive moves and big breakouts! $Pi $ICE $ION #Pi #ice #Ion https://t.co/Yg4QoARG1B pic.twitter.com/iRoPVJFeyu — zuzu (@PiGlobal314) June 25, 2025 Users started to speculate that Pi could be about to reveal a partnership with Google. To support that theory, X user @PiGlobal314 compared the imagery of Pi’s latest tweet with the logo of Gemini – the search engine’s proprietary generative AI model. Surprisingly, the token went up by 38% right after that rumor gained traction across social media platforms and messaging boards. A partnership with Google would support a bullish Pi Coin price prediction . If that’s the case and they announce it officially, how high could PI go? Pi Coin Price Prediction: Pi Hits Key Support at $0.56 – Time for the Next Leg Up? Pi’s 4-hour chart shows that the strong boost produced by these rumors pushed the token above its 200-period exponential moving average (EMA). Although the token’s rise to these levels was met with strong selling pressure once it got to $0.67, this bullish breakout is a strong indication that the trajectory of the price trend has changed from bearish to bullish. In the past 4 hours, Pi has found strong support at $0.56 and could use this level as a launchpad for its next leg up. The key driver for Pi’s move toward $0.70 again, or possibly to a higher level, would be confirmation of what the community has been speculating about. A partnership with Google would give Pi a much-needed credibility boost. With Google as a top backer or even partner, a plausible Pi Coin price prediction would estimate a move to $1 at least. In the meantime, analysts emphasize that well-established assets like Bitcoin (BTC) could outperform smaller projects like Pi. One of the hottest crypto presales of the year called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) offers investors a way to generate passive income as the top crypto rises to make new all-time highs. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Introduces Innovative Rewards System Tied to Bitcoin’s Performance BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has created a fun way to earn Bitcoin tokens through a meme coin whose primary use case consists of distributing rewards to token holders. Its milestone-based roadmap is quite simple. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, every time that BTC adds an additional $25,000 to its price, a new reward will be unlocked. The first milestone is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. This should produce an immediate increase in the price of this meme coin. Next up, once the price of Bitcoin hits $150,000, token holders will get a direct BTC airdrop. You can take advantage of BTCBULL’s discounted presale price and reap the highest return once this meme coin is officially launched. To buy the token, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for it or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-27T15:35:39,"Is the crypto bull run here? Bitcoin wavers as traders take profits","Macroeconomic concerns and profit-taking are slowing down crypto’s momentum, but a bull run may be in the works Crypto markets are in recovery mode, but profit-taking and macroeconomic risks continue to weigh on sentiment. On Friday, June 27, Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $106,600, pulling back 1% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins saw similar performance, with the top 100 assets by market cap down about 1%. Bitcoin and major altcoins have mostly recovered their losses following the initial crash sparked by the Iran-Israel conflict. With the geopolitical tensions easing, the market correction appears to have concluded, with most tokens now posting modest declines rather than steep selloffs. Because of this, the recent strength in price action suggests that markets are normalizing. However, further bullish momentum will likely depend on key catalysts, especially in the regulatory and macroeconomic spheres. You might also like: Surprise Fed statement sparks hopes of Bitcoin and altcoin rally Rate cuts, regulation to fuel next crypto bull run Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a central role in crypto price dynamics. Currently, the Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates until at least September. According to analysts at B2BINPAY, this is limiting the performance of altcoins, unless a significant shift in monetary policy occurs. “The bigger picture? Macro uncertainty is keeping altcoins in check. Markets still see only a small chance of a Fed rate cut in July, though odds rise sharply for September. Until that’s clearer, BTC dominance at 62.5% keeps altcoin upside capped,” B2BINPAY analysts. Despite increasing pressure from the White House, the Fed remains committed to a cautious monetary policy, a stance unlikely to change unless President Donald Trump takes drastic action, such as replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That said, the more likely catalyst for the next crypto bull run may lie in regulatory developments. The U.S. Congress is set to deliberate on the Genius Act, a bill that could finally bring stablecoins out of the regulatory gray zone and offer much-needed clarity to the sector.

2025-06-27T15:31:09,"One of the Most Hawkish FED Members, Neel Kashkari, Announced the Month in Which He Expects a Rate Cut!","The Fed is expected to resume interest rate cuts, which have been paused since January, as soon as possible. However, despite the positive data, the Fed prefers to keep interest rates steady due to concerns about tariffs. At this point, the FED left interest rates unchanged in June. While the next interest rate cuts are expected to be made in July and September, the market expects the first interest rate cut of 2025 to be made in September. I Expect Two Interest Rate Cuts in 2025, The First in September! At this point, Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari announced that he expects two interest rate cuts in 2025. Kashkari said in an article published today that he expects two rate cuts in 2025, with the first likely to occur in September. Neel Kashkari, one of the most hawkish Fed members, noted that inflation had fallen, which would allow him to cut the policy rate twice starting in September. While the FED member mentioned the possibility of the first interest rate cut being made in September, he stated that the FED could pause the reduction policy if necessary if the tariffs have a negative impact. “I expect two interest rate cuts in 2025. At this point, the first cut could be in September. “But if the Fed cuts interest rates in September and the inflationary effects of the tariffs become apparent later, we may temporarily pause the rate cuts.” Finally, Kashkari said economic data so far suggest that the impact of tariffs on prices, activity or the labor market has been extremely modest, and inflation is making renewed progress toward the Fed's 2% target. Kashkari is known as one of the members of the FED who is hostile to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. At this point, the FED member describes cryptocurrencies as worthless, fraudulent and ridiculous. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-27T15:30:03,"Nasdaq Hits Record While Bitcoin, Gold Remain Under Pressure After Latest Macro Data","Bitcoin BTC continues to consolidate in the $102,000 to $108,000 range and gold is lower by 2% today and roughly 7% from its record high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has reached new all-time highs. A couple of U.S. macroeconomic data points Friday morning — though nearly two months old at this point — might have added to the modestly negative tone for BTC and gold. Personal income in May came in at -0.4%, falling short of the expected increase of 0.3%. Personal spending month over month printed at -0.1%, missing the forecast of a 0.1% increase. Maybe of more import to markets, the core PCE price index in the US, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is the Federal Reserve's chosen gauge of underlying inflation, rose by 0.2% in May compared to expectations of a 0.1% increase. On a year-over-year basis, core PCE prices rose 2.7% versus 2.6% expected. This data further supports the view that the economy may be heading toward stagflation. Noted goldbug and no-coiner Peter Schiff : ""Traders continue to sell gold even as this morning's release of weak economic data and stronger-than-expected inflation data pushed the dollar index to new lows.

2025-06-27T15:25:24,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Continues To Consolidate Around $107,000","Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating around $107,000 as it takes a breather after reclaiming key levels during the week. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened. A ceasefire announcement saw markets recover, reclaim $100,000, and push towards $105,000 on Monday. Despite a pause in the rally, analysts remain optimistic about a push to $110,000. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $107,000. Metaplanet Pushes Bitcoin Holdings Past $1.3 Billion After 1,234 BTC Purchase Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has purchased an additional 1,234 BTC worth $132 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 12,345 BTC , worth over $1.3 billion. The purchase is the firm’s third-largest Bitcoin buy to date, according to a disclosure released on Thursday. Metaplanet purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $108,129 per coin. However, the purchase date was not disclosed. Metaplanet aims to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 100,000 BTC by 2026. Metaplanet is just one of many publicly traded firms that have pivoted to Bitcoin, adding the asset to their balance sheet. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, over 140 publicly traded firms hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet, amassing $90 billion worth of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s Strategy accounts for two-thirds of this amount, holding over $64 billion worth of Bitcoin. The latest purchase makes Metaplanet the seventh-largest holder of Bitcoin. Indian Politician Calls For Bitcoin Reserve Pilot A spokesperson for India’s ruling party has urged the government to consider launching a Bitcoin reserve pilot, believing it to be a strategic step towards economic resilience. Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari stated in an article that the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and Bhutan’s state-led mining operations signal a shift towards crypto in global financial markets. The spokesperson said that India could create a sovereign Bitcoin strategy by leveraging its expanding renewable energy infrastructure. “This isn’t a reckless pivot. It’s a calculated step toward embracing digital assets.” However, India’s tax policy indicates uncertainty. Crypto in India is unregulated but heavily taxed, with the government imposing a hefty 30% flat rate tax on virtual digital assets. However, it has been slow to establish a regulatory framework for crypto. Under section 115BBH of India’s Income Tax Act, all profits acquired by selling crypto are taxed at 30%. While traders can deduct purchase costs, there are no provisions for other expenses and losses. A 1% TDS also applies to all crypto transactions. According to Bhandari, India must offer regulatory clarity, beginning with the sovereign Bitcoin reserve. He added that regulations could bring transparency and oversight to the emerging asset class, enabling innovation while protecting users. Bhandari concluded, “India stands at a pivotal juncture,” Bhandari wrote. “A measured Bitcoin strategy —perhaps a reserve pilot — could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity.” Bitcoin Treasury Corporation To Relist On Toronto Exchange Canadian Bitcoin lending company Bitcoin Treasury Corporation (BTCT) is set to resume trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Venture Exchange. The company announced its common shares will trade under the ticker BTCT from Monday. The trading resumed after a brokered offering raising $92 million in gross proceeds. The company issued shares at 10 CA$ ($7.32) each. The financing was supported by a concurrent capital raise. BTCT also used a portion of the proceeds to purchase 292.8 BTC at $31.5 million. This is the company’s first major Bitcoin purchase since launching its Bitcoin accumulation and institutional lending strategy. The firm plans to use its Bitcoin reserves to offer clients liquidity solutions. It also plans to publish its initial Bitcoin share per figure after concluding its acquisition phase. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $107,000 as its rally takes a breather around $107,000. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week with a substantial rally after President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC reclaimed $105,000 and ended the day at $105,442. Analysts believe BTC is on the cusp of a bullish breakout and could potentially set a new all-time high. A potential catalyst is the decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY), with President Trump considering candidates to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair. Powell’s term ends in May 2026. The US Dollar Index has fallen 12% this year, with Morgan Stanley anticipating an additional 9% decline. Leading candidates include Scott Bessent, Kevin Hassett, and Kevin Warsh. President Trump has been highly critical of Powell, repeatedly urging the Fed Chair to cut interest rates. However, Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin agreed with Powell, stating, “There is little upside in heading too quickly in any one direction. Given the strength in today’s economy, we have time to track developments patiently and allow the visibility to improve.” Analysts believe a breakout is coming, with two major indicators supporting their argument. The daily chart shows that BTC has maintained its position above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which provided support since April. Additionally, Bitcoin has formed a bullish flag pattern consisting of a vertical line and a descending channel. Analysts also noted the formation of a bullish engulfing candlestick, reversing the weekend’s bearish price action. The pattern also ensured BTC maintained its position above $105,000, indicating a potential shift in market structure, adding weight to the flagship cryptocurrency’s ongoing recovery. However, despite the bullish setup, market sentiment is divided. BTC has recorded 19 instances of the bullish engulfing pattern meeting the defined confirmation criteria. Of these, 15 led to new local highs in the following days or weeks. More importantly, 19 instances occurred within a broader bull market context. The prevailing bull market structure indicates a statistically favorable environment for continuing the current price action, potentially pushing BTC to new highs. BTC registered a sharp drop on Tuesday, falling over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. It recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884, but was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $104,631. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC fell 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $100,979 before settling at $102,180. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $98,385 on Sunday as market sentiment turned bearish. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as the price surged over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as BTC crossed $106,000 on Tuesday and $107,000 on Wednesday to settle at $107,393. The price lost momentum on Thursday, dropping 0.39% to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,970.

2025-06-27T15:00:51,"Bullish: Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges. Here’s The Latest","Corporate Bitcoin adoption is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, marking a significant shift in the way companies view the world’s leading cryptocurrency. According to a recent report from Cointelegraph, 134 corporations now hold Bitcoin (BTC), nearly doubling the number from 2024. Bitcoin’s surge highlights a growing trend: it’s being viewed as a core treasury asset rather than a speculative investment. Corporate Treasuries Embrace Bitcoin Throughout 2025, corporate accumulation of Bitcoin has intensified. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.net and other trusted sources indicates that over 800,000 BTC, worth tens of billions of dollars, are now held in the treasuries of public and private companies. This figure represents nearly 4% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply and reflects a deepening conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value. The surge has been particularly notable among publicly listed companies. A Q1 2025 report from Bitwise revealed that corporate BTC holdings grew by over 16% in the first three months of the year alone, with more than 95,000 BTC added to balance sheets. The momentum is fueled by concerns about inflation, declining confidence in traditional currencies, and Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a reliable hedge. BULLISH: Corporate Bitcoin adoption is accelerating rapidly with 134 corporations now holding $BTC , nearly doubling from 2024. pic.twitter.com/dEkUDxGVss — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 27, 2025 Catalysts Behind the Surge Several key factors are driving this rapid adoption. Regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, particularly the United States, has removed the legal uncertainty that previously hindered corporate involvement. With the SEC greenlighting Bitcoin spot ETFs and providing clearer guidelines for crypto accounting, companies are now more confident in allocating capital to digital assets. Additionally, macroeconomic pressures have pushed corporations to seek alternatives to traditional cash reserves. With interest rates fluctuating and inflation remaining a persistent concern, Bitcoin offers an attractive, decentralized hedge that’s easily auditable and globally liquid. Industry Leaders Pave the Way MicroStrategy (now operating as Strategy) remains the poster child of corporate Bitcoin adoption. As of mid-2025, the company holds over 470,000 BTC, more than 2% of the total supply. Its consistent accumulation strategy has inspired a growing wave of followers, including firms like Metaplanet in Japan, Trump Media, and GameStop, all of which have recently disclosed Bitcoin purchases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Meanwhile, new players are emerging with Bitcoin-centric business models. ProCap Financial, a newly formed firm backed by veteran investors, recently announced a $1 billion merger aimed at building one of the largest Bitcoin treasury companies in the U.S., following the Strategy playbook. Looking Ahead While the trend is bullish, it isn’t without challenges. As Bitcoin becomes more intertwined with corporate finance, questions about volatility management, treasury governance, and custodial security grow more pressing. Additionally, the growing correlation between Bitcoin and equity markets has led some analysts to warn that BTC may behave more like a tech stock during downturns, potentially undermining its hedge narrative. Nevertheless, the data speaks volumes. With more than 134 corporations now holding Bitcoin, and hundreds more considering similar strategies, the asset’s legitimacy in boardrooms and financial planning is no longer in doubt. As Cointelegraph highlights, Bitcoin’s transformation from a fringe innovation to a mainstream corporate asset is well underway, and the implications for global finance are only just beginning.

2025-06-27T15:00:48,"BTC, ETH & SOL: Institutional Inflows Surge—Whales & ETFs Fuel Next Leg","Big players are making moves in the crypto market. Significant funds are pouring into top digital currencies. Whales and investment funds are driving this next wave. Discover which coins are primed for growth. Explore how institutional interest is reshaping the landscape. Read on to uncover the details behind this surge. Bitcoin Analysis: Moderate Volatility with Key Levels in Focus Bitcoin showed a modest weekly gain of 2.25%, while the month recorded a slight decline of 1.82%. Over the past six months, the price advanced by 12.52% despite experiencing fluctuations. The movement within a range of established price points indicated a market with both upward momentum and minor setbacks. Recent price action demonstrated recovery after the monthly dip, allowing the coin to maintain a positive trend in the longer timeframe with steady accumulation and improvements in market sentiment. The current situation places Bitcoin within a defined range between $94,832 and $113,326, with nearby support at $84,880 and resistance at $121,869. Further out, the second support and resistance levels are set at $66,385 and $140,364. The market appears balanced, with bulls aiming to push prices above resistance, while bears are active at lower thresholds. Indicators show the trend is not strongly directional, as the relative strength index hovers around neutral at 55.13. Traders might consider accumulating near support and taking profits near resistance, employing staggered entry points and risk management strategies while awaiting a clear breakout. Ethereum Market Outlook: Past Declines and Key Support/Resistance Levels Ethereum experienced a decline of about 8.09% over the past month and nearly 28% over the last six months. Price action maintained a downward trend with small recoveries that failed to break the overall bearish sentiment. This consistent decline highlights growing investor caution and reduced trading enthusiasm, reflecting pressure in the market. Each drop emphasizes the ongoing struggle to regain upward momentum as participants remain wary of future movements. Current levels place Ethereum’s price between approximately $1,923 and $2,961. Immediate resistance is near $3,395, with another barrier at about $4,433. Key supports are around $1,318 and a deeper level near $280. Indicators show sustained selling pressure, with the Awesome Oscillator at -120 and a Momentum indicator at -65. The Relative Strength Index is near neutral at 48. Traders might consider buying near the $1,318 support while monitoring the $3,395 resistance for signs of reversal. The market appears range-bound, encouraging a cautious approach between these key levels. Solana Price Behavior: Recent Trends and Current Market Levels In the last month, Solana experienced a decline of nearly 20%, while over the past six months, the coin fell more than 27%. It traded within a range of about $136 to $182, highlighting heightened volatility during this period. Recent price corrections indicate a downward trend, with a short-term decline of approximately 3.4% over one week. Technical indicators suggest a weaker market sentiment, reflecting the performance trends observed over these time spans. Current price action focuses on crucial support and resistance levels. Immediate support is near $115.84, with a secondary zone around $69.81. On the upside, the first resistance is approximately $207.90, followed by a second near $253.93. With a negative Awesome Oscillator, Momentum, and an RSI of about 44, bears seem to dominate the market. Although there is no clear, sustained trend, traders may consider buying near support levels and selling closer to resistances, watching for breakouts or reversals that could indicate a shift in momentum. Conclusion BTC , ETH , and SOL are experiencing a significant rise in institutional interest. Large investors and exchange-traded funds are driving this trend. This momentum suggests strong potential for growth in the near term. As institutions increase their stakes, these cryptocurrencies could see further appreciation in value. This heightened activity highlights their growing acceptance and potential for mainstream adoption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-27T15:00:30,"How VTrader is Automating the Alpha Layer of Crypto Markets","In the world of crypto trading, speed, and fees often determine who wins. Therefore, a new player is quietly redefining the equation, aiming to automate trading tools and alpha discovery. That player is VTrader, a next-gen, no-fee trading platform built around on-chain transparency and AI-powered intelligence. At the core is Steve Gregory, a former compliance officer and attorney who has scaled three major exchanges and helped secure full U.S. money transmission licensing (MTLs) in under a year at CEX.IO. Now, he's taking on one of the valuable crypto's profit centers: trading fees. ""Between the spread and the exchange fee, you often lose around 5% just for showing up. This hurts the average return for customers."" Gregory told Crypto Daily. ""We believe a major shift is coming to the industry just as retail stock brokerages moved to zero-fee trading; crypto is heading the same way."" VTrader operates on a fee-less trading model, instead earning yield from user deposits . This model allows the platform to avoid trading commissions while offering a transparent view of customer balances permanently verifiable on-chain. It's a pivot away from the closed, opaque custody models most exchanges still rely on. The vision is clear: build trust by default and let automation do the heavy lifting. AI Meets Alpha VTrader is doing more than cutting fees—embedding artificial intelligence directly into the trading stack. Its recent feature is a price prediction engine that forecasts the near-term movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on real-time data scraped from news, social sentiment, and technical indicators. Users can view how past predictions performed against actual market outcomes, giving the system an uncommon level of transparency for an AI-powered tool. Gregory explains, ""The AI tool is meant to supplement the user's research and give users confidence when they place a trade."" Perhaps most innovative is the platform's focus on what Gregory calls ""narrative-based alpha."" Unlike traditional equities, where fundamentals dominate, crypto often trades on hype, sentiment, and memes. VTrader's upcoming feature will track token popularity, momentum shifts, and sentiment swings across the crypto news cycle and then alert users when it detects actionable signals. It's a modular, plug-and-play approach to trading intelligence where traders don't just react to news; they're notified before the hits. Intent-Based DeFi Trading, Powered by AI The VTrader team is also exploring intent-based trading, where users create strategies based on values or themes like green energy or decentralized infrastructure and let AI execute those strategies with discipline. As trading automation becomes more accessible, some critics argue that AI-enhanced tools like VTrader give users an unfair advantage. Gregory disagrees, sharing that information asymmetry has always existed, but the point is to democratize access to better tools. VTrader is not here to hide alpha ; rather, it is working towards unlocking it. The platform is structured so that users can freely access performance data on the AI models, enabling a rare level of openness in an industry often criticized for its opacity. What Comes Next? While AI and predictive tools are central to VTrader's roadmap, Gregory argues that user experience is still the most significant barrier to mass adoption in crypto. ""UX is the biggest challenge for crypto. New entrants aren't familiar with it and it looks too technical, so they don't trust it. We aim to make everything look simple on the surface while the complexity stays in the backend which is transparent but under the hood. We want users to feel at ease using our platform,"" he says. As traditional exchanges cling to outdated revenue models and siloed infrastructure, platforms like VTrader are betting that the future of trading is transparent, intelligent, and fee-free. By combining on-chain audibility, AI-powered prediction engines, and real-time narrative tools, VTrader isn't just building a trading platform; it's redefining what it means to have an edge in crypto.

2025-06-27T14:54:20,"Top blue-chip altcoins to buy as Nasdaq 100 Index hits ATH","Cryptocurrency prices have pulled back in the past few days, but a few signals point to an eventual comeback. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, pointing to potential gains that could take it to $140,000. ETF inflows have also jumped and are nearing the key milestone of $50 billion. Similarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has surged to a record high of $22,500, while the S&P 500 Index has climbed to $6,170. Both indices are up over 27% from their April lows. Further, there are signs the Federal Reserve may begin cutting interest rates in September, while the US dollar index has plunged. Additionally, the U.S. and China are reportedly close to signing a new trade agreement. Best altcoins to buy today ahead of the bull run The bullish Bitcoin pattern and the surging S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices may trigger the next crypto bull run. Some of the top altcoins to buy are Sei ( SEI ), Aptos ( APT ), and Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ). 1. Sei Sei price chart | Source: crypto.new Sei is one of the best-positioned altcoins ahead of the next bull run. It’s a fast-growing EVM-compatible chain gaining traction in gaming, DeFi, and stablecoins. It’s also under consideration to run Wyoming’s stablecoin initiative. The Sei price has risen from a year-to-date low of $0.1315 to a high of $0.3337 on June 25. It recently broke through resistance at $0.2767, invalidating the previous double-top formation. With the price now above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, further gains are likely. Bulls may target the 50% retracement level at $0.4340.

Like Sei, it’s a layer-1 blockchain slowly gaining traction. According to DeFi Llama’s data , Aptos-based DEXs processed over $4 billion in the past 30 days, with a total value locked (TVL) of $1.3 billion, ranking it 12th in the industry. APT price has formed a double-bottom at $3.88, with the neckline at $6.30. This bullish pattern points to a potential breakout, with an upside target near $10 if the neckline is breached. 3. Aerodrome Finance AERO price chart | Source: crypto.news Aerodrome Finance is a leading DEX on the Base blockchain, processing billions in monthly trading volume. The AERO price has rallied from a low of $0.2963 in April to $0.80 as of June 27. It has formed an ascending triangle pattern and is hovering near the 23.6% retracement level. A mini golden cross, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 100-day MA, has formed, a bullish signal. If momentum holds, the next target is the $2 resistance level.

This surge is reshaping investor interests and market dynamics, compelling traders to look towards these novelty coins for potentially lucrative opportunities. The Rise of $XYZ in the Sports and Crypto Arena One standout in the memecoin category is XYZVerse ($XYZ), which cleverly merges the worlds of sports fanaticism with cryptocurrency. This unique approach has not only garnered it the accolade of Best New Meme Project but also a dedicated following eager to support a project that resonates with their interests. The ethos of XYZVerse, encapsulated by the G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time) vision, elevates it above typical memecoins, offering a structured roadmap aimed at sustainable growth rather than short-term hype. $XYZ is positioned as not just a meme or a token but as a symbol of honor amongst sports and crypto enthusiasts, promising to bring competitive spirit into the crypto market. Market Enthusiasm Around $XYZ's Pre-Launch Phase The ongoing presale of $XYZ offers early investors a chance to buy into the project at ground-floor prices, potentially setting the stage for significant returns as the coin reaches broader exchanges. Starting at $0.0001, the token's price has climbed to $0.003333 and is anticipated to hit $0.02 by the end of the presale, with a final listing target of $0.10.

SHIB, for instance, has extended beyond its meme origin to develop a suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and community-driven initiatives. BONK, launched on the Solana platform, and Floki are equally establishing themselves as more than transient tokens, by fostering ecosystems that offer tangible utilities and engaging experiences to their holders. The quirky FARTCOIN, despite its humorous undertone, is pioneering engagement through a combination of AI and user-generated content, showcasing the dynamic and evolving nature of memecoins.

The number of Bitcoin wallets holding 10 BTC or more just hit a 3.5-month high, according to on-chain data from Santiment. As of June 27, 152,280 wallets now fall into this “whale and shark” category, each holding over $1 million in BTC. It’s the highest count since March 12, and it’s happening despite the sideways action in price. “As markets have been volatile, smart money has accumulated on most retail panic sell cycles,” Santiment noted in its report. Bitcoin whale and shark wallets. Source: Santiment Bitcoin whale and shark purchases It’s worth highlighting that a pattern where large holders accumulate as smaller investors exit, is not new, but it is telling. While retail investors grow weary during consolidation phases, institutions and high-net-worth players often treat them as accumulation windows. Bitcoin is up more than 70% over the past year but has traded relatively flat in the short term: down 1.12% on the day, up just 1.28% over the past week, and slightly negative on the month. That’s precisely the type of lull where professional money quietly builds positions, often anticipating the next major leg up. So should everyday investors follow the whales? Historically, spikes in whale wallet counts have preceded significant moves in Bitcoin’s price. It’s not a guarantee, but it’s often an indicator that confidence remains high among long-term holders, especially in a backdrop of ETF inflows, macroeconomic easing, and growing global adoption. With retail interest cooling, the smart money appears to be positioning ahead of the crowd, again.

2025-06-27T14:30:29,"XRP Lawsuit: After Torres Says No, Lawyer Predicts When It’s Over","Following Judge Analisa Torres’ June 26 denial of Ripple and the SEC’s joint motion for an indicative ruling, crypto attorney Fred Rispoli has delivered a blistering breakdown of the legal and political dynamics behind the decision—and issued a clear prediction on when the XRP lawsuit may finally conclude. Rispoli, founder of Hodl Law and one of the most outspoken legal voices in the XRP community, wasted no time analyzing the ruling , which rejected both parties’ efforts to modify the court’s final judgment and resolve the long-running case at the appellate level. XRP Lawsuit Shaken By Denial “I thought Judge Torres would grant the first motion,” Rispoli wrote in a lengthy post on X, “recognizing that the anti-crypto war of the Gensler Era was political animus and that the agency was moving in a different direction under new leadership.” But Torres, he said, “chose not to,” and “there was zero obstacle to her granting the motion and moving on.” In his view, the refusal was less about legal deficiency and more about institutional frustration or political motivation. “There are only two reasons for this,” Rispoli argued. “One, she was pissed that the parties wasted 4.5 years of her time with bitter litigation… Two, she is hostile to the Trump administration and will do what she can to throw up obstacles.” Rispoli’s analysis extended sharply to the SEC’s failure to support the motion with official testimony that could have helped the court reconsider its prior findings of reckless conduct by Ripple. Citing pages 3 and 4 of Torres’ order, Rispoli pointed out that “the ruling parrot[s] back the SEC’s own words of how egregious, dangerous, and reckless the SEC believed Ripple to be and why a $1 BILLION fine was necessary.” He emphasized that nothing in the SEC’s submission countered those prior statements with institutional acknowledgment of past errors. “I said that the second motion had to have some actual testimony by SEC Commissioners,” he wrote, imagining declarations such as: “I, Commissioner Peirce , voted against this ridiculous lawsuit because it was a waste of our enforcement resources,” or “I, Commissioner Atkins … determined the SEC enforcement division under the prior administration acted arbitrarily, capriciously and often with bad faith.” None of that materialized. “This obviously did not happen,” Rispoli said, and offered two possible explanations. “(1) Ripple and the SEC did not discuss this necessity… (2) Ripple did ask and the SEC said, ‘We are not making ourselves look like idiot assholes. This crappy motion on SEC letterhead is the best I can offer.’” He concluded that the second explanation is most likely, and said the SEC’s institutional behavior remains unchanged. “The SEC is going to do what it has done for decades: protect its own regardless of the administration in charge or detriment to the public.” That belief fuels Rispoli’s broader frustration with US regulatory governance. “If you ever want to know the types of pieces of shit that sit atop the SEC, type into your browser ‘david aguirre sec whistleblower’ and read up… I sue .gov agencies all the time for despicable behavior… This is the reason I am so invested in crypto—to opt out of our crumbling system.” When Will The XRP Lawsuit End? Looking ahead, Rispoli remains convinced that a settlement is coming soon. Responding to a reader who asked when the saga might finally end, Rispoli gave two scenarios for the August status update due to the Second Circuit: either the parties ask to resume the appeal, or they declare it settled. “In that scenario, case doesn’t end until late 2026/early 2027,” he said of a revived appeal. But that’s not the outcome he expects. “I think we see (2) happen and get that announcement end of July/early August of this year.” As for the implications of the court’s existing injunction against Ripple’s institutional XRP sales, Rispoli minimized its real-world effect. “It doesn’t affect $XRP on the secondary markets nor will it impact XRP ETF approvals,” he explained. While Torres technically retains authority to enforce it, Rispoli added, “The injunction only substantively matters if the SEC wants it to matter.” He also noted that Ripple appears to be preparing to move forward under mutually tolerable terms. “If you look at the @s_alderoty post on this ruling from today,” Rispoli observed, “he used the term ‘historic institutional sales’ to describe the Torres-determined-bad-behavior. This signals to me that the parties are going to settle and move on with the understanding that XRP sales to institutions will be done in a way the SEC can live with.” Though Judge Torres’ refusal to accommodate the proposed resolution was a procedural blow, Rispoli believes it will prove to be the final flashpoint in a case that is now headed toward closure. “The parties will drop their appeals, settle at $50M and move on with the injunction in place,” he wrote. If his forecast is right, the XRP community could be less than six weeks away from the end of one of the most consequential enforcement actions in crypto history.

2025-06-27T14:20:09,"Crypto Blockchain Industries Unveils Bold $23.4M Bitcoin Investment Strategy","BitcoinWorld Crypto Blockchain Industries Unveils Bold $23.4M Bitcoin Investment Strategy Are you keeping an eye on the latest moves in the crypto space? A significant development from Europe is catching attention: Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI), a prominent French-listed fintech firm, is gearing up for a substantial capital raise. This move isn’t just about bolstering their balance sheet; it’s a direct signal of their confidence in the future of digital assets, specifically through strategic BTC purchases and investment in mining infrastructure. It’s an exciting time to see traditional financial structures adapting to the decentralized world. Crypto Blockchain Industries’ Strategic Expansion Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI), already a recognized name in the European fintech landscape, is making headlines with its ambitious plans. The company aims to secure up to €20 million, equivalent to approximately $23.4 million, to significantly expand its footprint in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it represents a considerable commitment to digital assets and the underlying technology that powers them. Their strategy highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies to directly engage with cryptocurrencies, viewing them as both an asset class and a foundational technology for future growth. Funding Future Growth: The Shareholder Loan Approach The method CBI has chosen for this capital injection is particularly interesting: a shareholder loan . This approach involves existing shareholders providing funds to the company, typically with an agreement for repayment, often with interest. It’s a common financing mechanism that demonstrates strong internal confidence and commitment from the company’s existing investor base. For CBI, opting for a shareholder loan over other financing methods like issuing new equity or traditional debt could indicate: Strong Shareholder Support: Existing investors believe in the company’s vision and are willing to directly fund its strategic initiatives. Flexibility: Shareholder loans can sometimes offer more flexible terms compared to bank loans or public offerings. Minimized Dilution: Unlike issuing new shares, a loan doesn’t immediately dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. This method underscores a deep alignment between the company’s management and its shareholders regarding its bold crypto-centric direction. Powering Up: Focusing on BTC Purchases and Mining Equipment The primary use of these substantial funds is twofold: direct BTC purchases and investment in mining equipment. This dual strategy is designed to maximize their exposure and participation in the Bitcoin network. Acquiring Bitcoin directly allows CBI to: Hold a Store of Value: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital gold, and holding it can be a hedge against inflation or a long-term value appreciation play. Participate in the Ecosystem: Direct BTC ownership allows for more active participation in the broader crypto economy. Simultaneously, investing in mining equipment positions CBI to earn Bitcoin through the mining process. This not only generates new BTC but also contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. It’s a comprehensive approach that seeks to leverage both the asset’s value and its production mechanism. What This Means for French-listed Crypto Firms CBI’s move could set a precedent for other French-listed crypto firms and even broader European companies. As regulatory clarity slowly emerges in the European Union, particularly with initiatives like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets), more traditional companies might feel confident enough to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets or core operations. This could signal a broader institutional adoption wave, not just from crypto-native companies but from established fintech players. France, with its growing tech scene, is increasingly becoming a hub for blockchain innovation, and CBI’s decision further solidifies this position. Navigating the Crypto Investment Strategy Landscape Every significant financial decision comes with its own set of considerations, and CBI’s bold crypto investment strategy is no exception. While the potential for upside is considerable, particularly with Bitcoin’s historical performance, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies presents inherent risks. Companies embarking on such ventures must carefully consider: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the value of holdings. Regulatory Changes: The evolving regulatory landscape could introduce new compliance requirements or restrictions. Operational Risks: Managing mining operations comes with its own set of technical and energy-related challenges. However, for a company like CBI, which operates in the fintech and blockchain space, these risks are likely weighed against the long-term strategic advantages of being an early mover in what many believe is the future of finance. A Bold Leap into Bitcoin’s Future Crypto Blockchain Industries’ plan to raise $23.4 million for BTC purchases and mining equipment through a shareholder loan is a significant indicator of growing institutional confidence in digital assets. This strategic move by a French-listed firm not only strengthens CBI’s position in the crypto economy but also sends a powerful message to the broader financial market: Bitcoin is here to stay, and smart capital is increasingly recognizing its value and potential. It will be fascinating to watch how this bold investment strategy unfolds and its impact on both CBI and the wider European crypto landscape.

This ranking is based on sovereign-held Bitcoin reserves, where the state actively manages and declares its holdings. What’s even more impressive about this is that Bhutan’s reserves were not seized or purchased but mined, which distinguishes them from other countries’ holdings. How Did Bhutan Build Its Bitcoin Reserve? The country began Bitcoin mining in late 2020, using two small units installed by Druk Holding & Investments (DHI) near Dochula Pass. The initial team learned from online resources and even assembled hardware themselves during a pandemic-induced border closure.

2025-06-27T14:07:45,"How Soon Until We See Widespread Bitcoin Mortgages?","In a notable moment for the convergence of cryptocurrency and traditional finance, Strategy’s Michael Saylor has opened a public dialogue with US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte regarding the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream mortgage lending. This engagement centres on Saylor’s proposal to share a proprietary Bitcoin Credit Model designed to assess loan risk using Bitcoin-specific metrics like volatility and asset coverage. The conversation follows Pulte’s announcement that the FHFA is exploring whether cryptocurrency holdings could play a role in mortgage qualification, potentially signalling a shift in how federal housing agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac evaluate borrower assets. The exchange highlights not only the maturing role of Bitcoin in financial planning but also the potential for federal regulators to influence how digital assets might be incorporated into home lending frameworks. Did Saylor Orange Pill US FHFA Director William Pulte? In a recent development underscoring the growing intersection between digital assets and traditional finance, MicroStrategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor publicly engaged with Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte on the potential for Bitcoin-backed mortgage models. Saylor offered to share Strategy’s proprietary Bitcoin Credit Model , which analyses loan risk and pricing based on key Bitcoin-specific metrics such as price volatility, asset appreciation forecasts, and collateral coverage. This outreach followed Pulte’s statement that the FHFA would study how cryptocurrency holdings might factor into mortgage qualification assessments, an announcement seen by some as a signal that federal housing agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may be reconsidering legacy lending criteria in light of evolving asset portfolios among U.S. households. The FHFA’s willingness to examine crypto asset integration is particularly notable given its role in overseeing government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which currently require that cryptocurrency be converted into US dollars and held at regulated institutions before it can be counted in borrower asset calculations. Until earlier this year, regulations such as the SEC’s now-repealed SAB 121 effectively discouraged mainstream financial institutions from accepting crypto assets as loan collateral. The removal of these accounting restrictions has opened new opportunities for digital assets to be recognised in underwriting frameworks, potentially allowing borrowers to leverage their Bitcoin holdings without liquidating them. Saylor’s intervention adds technical depth to this policy conversation by introducing a credit model tailored specifically to the characteristics of Bitcoin as collateral. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin’s volatility, liquidity, and non-sovereign nature require distinct methods for calculating loan-to-value ratios, duration-based risk spreads, and margin thresholds. His firm’s model aims to quantify these variables to support safer, over-collateralised lending structures that could be integrated into existing mortgage products. Should regulators adopt or adapt such a framework, it could mark a significant step toward the mainstreaming of crypto-backed mortgages through established institutions, rather than niche providers. This exchange also arrives amid growing public interest in alternative financing models, especially among younger Americans who hold a disproportionate share of their net worth in digital assets . A shift in policy from institutions like the FHFA could legitimise the use of Bitcoin as a form of wealth in housing finance, potentially improving access to homeownership for crypto-native households. Whether this signals a broader alignment between crypto innovation and US housing policy remains to be seen, but the dialogue between Saylor and Pulte suggests that such discussions are no longer merely theoretical, they are now taking place at the highest levels of US housing finance governance. What is a Bitcoin-Backed Mortgage and How Does it Work? A Bitcoin mortgage is a type of loan where Bitcoin (BTC) is used as collateral instead of, or in addition to, a traditional cash down payment. In this structure, a borrower pledges a specified amount of Bitcoin to a lender, which holds it in escrow for the duration of the mortgage. The borrower then receives fiat currency (e.g. USD) to purchase property, and makes monthly repayments similar to a conventional mortgage. These arrangements are usually over-collateralised , meaning the value of the pledged Bitcoin exceeds the value of the loan, to protect the lender from price volatility, a dynamic which grew out of DeFi lending. If the value of Bitcoin falls below a certain threshold, the borrower may be required to add more collateral or risk liquidation of their BTC to cover the outstanding balance. Compared to standard mortgages, Bitcoin-backed mortgages offer a different risk-reward profile. Traditional home loans are based on credit history, income documentation, and a fiat down payment, typically between 10% and 20% of the home’s value. Bitcoin mortgages, by contrast, may appeal to borrowers who are asset-rich in crypto but either unwilling or unable to liquidate their holdings. These products can circumvent some of the documentation hurdles in traditional underwriting but introduce new risks around asset volatility. In addition, while specialised lenders offer these products, most traditional banks still do not accept Bitcoin as a valid asset for mortgage qualification due to regulatory and balance sheet constraints, though this may change if agencies like the FHFA broaden asset recognition standards. Bitcoin-native features like multisignature (multisig) wallets and timelocks offer enhanced security and trust minimisation in lending arrangements. Multisig ensures that funds can only be spent when a predefined number of parties approve the transaction, reducing counterparty risk, while timelocks allow transactions to be locked until a specific time or block height, enabling automated loan expiry or repayment conditions without requiring intermediaries. Interest rates for Bitcoin mortgages can be competitive, but they often vary widely depending on the lender, collateral coverage, and market conditions. Rates may be lower than unsecured crypto loans, but not always on par with the most favourable conventional mortgage rates, particularly from government-backed lenders. In some cases, lenders may offer flexible terms to attract borrowers who wish to retain exposure to BTC’s long-term appreciation while accessing liquidity. However, borrowers face additional costs such as custodial and escrow fees, and the risk of margin calls during market downturns, which can erode any rate advantages. Until Bitcoin becomes an approved asset within traditional institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, rates are unlikely to standardise across the broader lending market. Bitcoin’s deflationary economic model, driven by its fixed 21 million coin supply and halving cycles every four years, introduces a unique dynamic into mortgage lending. Theoretically, as new supply is cut in half and issuance slows, the scarcity of Bitcoin could increase its value over time. This has historically incentivised long-term holding (HODLing), making Bitcoin an attractive reserve asset for some. In the context of a mortgage, this means borrowers might be reluctant to pledge Bitcoin as collateral, fearing opportunity cost if the price rises dramatically. At the same time, lenders may be wary of sharp declines that could compromise collateral value. The success of Bitcoin mortgages in the long term will depend on how lenders and regulators manage this volatility, and whether Bitcoin’s deflationary model is seen as a stable enough basis to underpin large, long-duration financial products like home loans. Is Saylor Too Optimistic or Will the Lending Industry Embrace Bitcoin? Michael Saylor’s framing of Bitcoin as a digital asset rather than a form of digital cash has defined his entire investment philosophy, guiding both Strategy’s corporate strategy and his broader public advocacy. By treating Bitcoin not as a medium of exchange but as a pristine, long-duration store of value, Saylor has dismissed spending or transacting with BTC in favour of accumulating and holding it indefinitely. However, this conviction has naturally led him to explore mechanisms by which Bitcoin can generate yield, a pursuit that sits uneasily with the asset’s trust-minimised design and P2P principles. His recent interest in Bitcoin-backed credit models, such as mortgages, reflects a desire to monetise Bitcoin without selling it. Yet this approach enters murky territory, especially considering the high-profile collapses of past retail-focused crypto lending platforms that offered similar promises. The failures of firms like Celsius , Voyager , and BlockFi highlight the inherent risks of attempting to extract yield from volatile digital assets in poorly regulated environments. These companies offered attractive returns to depositors while engaging in opaque, leveraged, and often mismatched lending practices. When prices collapsed, so did their balance sheets, leaving users with frozen accounts and mounting losses. Saylor’s version of yield, rooted in secured, over-collateralised lending against Bitcoin rather than uncollateralised or rehypothecated deposits, may seem more conservative in comparison. But the underlying tension remains in the fact that Bitcoin is not a risk-free yield-generating instrument, and introducing debt-based products around it inevitably reintroduces credit risk, counterparty risk, and systemic fragility into a space that was, in theory, designed to eliminate them. If federal regulators such as the FHFA ultimately approve the use of Bitcoin as qualifying collateral for mortgages, the traditional lending industry could be forced to adapt to a new class of asset and borrower. Banks and government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would need to develop protocols for valuing, securing, and managing digital collateral in compliance with capital requirements and consumer protection rules. This could bring new revenue streams, borrower demographics, and innovation to the mortgage sector, particularly among younger, crypto-native households who are currently underbanked by traditional standards but overexposed to digital assets. It would also likely prompt standardisation efforts, including regulatory guidance on custody, valuation methodologies, and margin maintenance. If the federal government, through agencies like the FHFA, establishes a clear and favourable regulatory framework for Bitcoin-backed mortgages, it is likely that major players in the banking industry would follow suit, albeit cautiously. Traditional financial institutions are generally risk-averse and heavily regulated, but they also have a long history of adapting to government-backed policy shifts, especially when accompanied by guarantees or securitisation mechanisms such as those offered by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. A green light from federal authorities would reduce legal ambiguity and provide the compliance infrastructure necessary for banks to safely evaluate, custody, and lend against Bitcoin collateral. While some conservative institutions may remain hesitant due to volatility concerns or reputational risk, others, especially fintech-forward banks or those already exploring digital asset custody, could view this as a competitive opportunity to tap into a growing demographic of crypto-native borrowers and expand their lending portfolios in a high-margin, underserved market. In an optimistic scenario, if Bitcoin-backed mortgages gain traction and prove resilient, the lending industry could see a wave of hybrid financial products that merge traditional underwriting with decentralised asset classes. Lenders might offer tiered products with dynamic loan-to-value ratios based on Bitcoin volatility metrics, or integrate stablecoins and BTC together for risk balancing. Over time, the legitimacy of Bitcoin as a financial asset class could be solidified, potentially leading to secondary markets for tokenised mortgage debt or new layers of credit infrastructure. But this vision hinges on whether institutional actors can manage the volatility and cultural idiosyncrasies of Bitcoin responsibly, without repeating the speculative overreach that doomed previous lending experiments in the crypto space.

2025-06-27T14:06:45,"BitFuFu: Punished For A Bad Quarter, Poised For A Powerful Re-Rating","Summary The market has unfairly punished BitFuFu for a dismal Q1, but a closer look reveals the operational challenges that caused the slump were temporary. Recent operational data from April and May confirms a powerful turnaround is already underway, showcasing an exponential rebound in hashrate and a sharp recovery in Bitcoin production. BitFuFu trades at a glaring valuation disconnect from its U.S. peers, with the market assigning a value to its hashrate that is a mere fraction of the industry average. This significant market misunderstanding has created a compelling arbitrage opportunity, leaving room for a substantial valuation re-rating as the company heads into its Q2 earnings report. Just over a month ago, I claimed that BitFuFu Inc. ( FUFU ), a Singapore-based crypto miner, was well on track for strong operating income growth in 2026. FUFU stock has lost almost 20% since then after the company reported lackluster earnings for the first quarter, characterized by a 46% YoY decline in revenue, primarily attributable to the bitcoin halving event in April last year. All else equal, bitcoin halving negatively impacts miner revenue, which is something crypto investors are well aware of now. After going through BitFuFu's April and May performance data, I am confident that the company is among the few crypto miners that are operationally ready to thrive amid increasing mining difficulty. As such, I find BitFuFu's market valuation materially disconnected from its economic value at a time when it's valued at a substantial discount to its closest peers, presenting an arbitrage opportunity for investors. BitFuFu's Challenging First Quarter The fourth bitcoin halving in April 2024 has materially impacted the comparable revenue growth of crypto miners of every scale and size. BitFuFu's Q1 revenue declined from $144.4 million a year ago to just $78 million, showcasing this massive impact. Not only has BitFuFu felt the impact, but larger players like MARA Holdings ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) also reported substantial net losses in Q1. MARA's net loss in Q1 totaled $533.4 million, and RIOT reported a net loss of $296.4 million. BitFuFu, on the other hand, reported a net loss of $16.9 million. However, bitcoin halving is not the only factor that has impacted revenue negatively. While peers such as MARA and RIOT mitigated the bitcoin halving impact through substantial operational expansions that led to robust hashrate growth, BitFuFu suffered a temporary decline in the hashrate under management as well (hashrate dropped 28% YoY to 20.6 EH/s from 28.6 EH/s). This paved the way for a truly lackluster Q1 performance. In its Q1 earnings release, BitFuFu reported that this temporary decline in the hashrate came on the back of the expiration of some hashrate purchase orders and miner relocation. While BitFuFu's peers made the most of surging bitcoin prices, the company was not in a position to capitalize on this price increase as self-mined bitcoin production declined staggeringly from 1,103 in Q1 2024 to just 186 in Q1 2025. Exhibit 1: BitFuFu's Q1 Performance Metrics Q1 Earnings Release The below table summarizes how BitFuFu fell behind its closest peers in the first quarter. Company Q1 2025 YoY revenue growth Q1 2025 hashrate growth Q1 2025 YoY BTC production change Comments BitFuFu -46% -28% -83% (self-mining) Revenue was impacted by bitcoin halving and a substantial yet temporary drop in hashrate. Riot Platforms 100% 172% 12.2% Substantial hashrate growth helped Riot overcome the halving impact. Mara Holdings 30% 95% -19% Hashrate growth helped mitigate the halving impact, but revenue growth mostly came from higher BTC prices. Source: Company Filings At first glance, you might feel BitFuFu is losing ground. However, as I reveal in the next segments of this analysis, FUFU stock has been punished for a temporary deterioration in its financial performance. This market misunderstanding is exactly what sets the stage for an arbitrage opportunity. April/May Data Confirms BitFuFu's Rebound As we inch toward the end of the second quarter, we already have access to BitFuFu's April and May performance data that confirms, without a shred of doubt, that the company has well and truly recovered from the challenges faced in Q1. Encouragingly, the rebound is across all key operational metrics, which confirms that BitFuFu is headed in the right direction. The most direct, meaningful evidence of this recovery comes in the form of a significant improvement in the hashrate under management. From just 20.6 EH/s at the end of Q1, hashrate grew 37% MoM to 28.3 EH/s in April, followed by another strong 21% MoM increase to 34.1 EH/s in May. Based on these numbers, within just two months from the end of the disappointing first quarter, BitFuFu's hashrate under management has grown exponentially to surpass Riot Platform's Q1 deployed hashrate of 33.7 EH/s. Along with the hashrate under management, bitcoin production has also rebounded sharply after a sluggish Q1. In Q1, the company produced a total of just 723 BTC (186 BTC from self-mining and 537 BTC from the cloud-mining segment). In April, BitFuFu mined a total of 209 BTC , followed by 400 BTC mined in May , bringing the total BTC production to 609 in the first two months of the quarter. Based on these numbers, BitFuFu seems well on track to produce a meaningfully higher number of BTC in the second quarter, assuming this trend remains strong. The strong performance in May was driven by the contribution from the hashrate purchased in late April, and a similar feat could be expected in June as the company purchased additional hashrate in late May as well. Importantly, the average daily BTC production increased from 7 in April to 12.9 in May, suggesting that the robust increase in hashrate is already contributing positively. BitFuFu's strong growth in April and May corresponded to a robust increase in the power infrastructure as well, which gives me confidence that the observed hashrate growth is well-supported from a power requirement perspective. At the end of Q1, the company had a power capacity of 478 MW, a notable decline from 644 MW of power capacity as of Q1 2024. Since then, however, the trend has turned positive, with power capacity growing 18% MoM in April to 566 MW, followed by another 15% MoM increase in May to 651 MW. This continued increase in power capacity highlights the progress in BitFuFu's strategic plan to reach 1 GW of power capacity by 2026. Exhibit 2: BitFuFu's Power Capacity June Presentation Taking a closer look at BitFuFu's strategic BTC holdings, which form the backbone of its treasury strategy, reveals that the management is following the best course of action to drive shareholder returns higher. After seeing an increase in BTC holdings from 1,835 in March to 1,908 in April, the company sold 178 BTC at an average price of $104,000 in May to capitalize on the recent run-up in bitcoin prices. At the end of May, BitFuFu held 1,709 BTC. BitFuFu's performance in April and May, in my opinion, foreshadows how the company could grow profitably in the post-bitcoin halving environment by focusing on operational efficiency and access to low-cost power. These two variables will play a key role in determining the profitability of every bitcoin miner in the long run, and I am confident that BitFuFu is headed in the right direction on this front. The Valuation Disparity Highlights The Opportunity For A Re-Rating BitFuFu is significantly undervalued from a comparable valuation perspective. I believe this undervaluation primarily stems from the company's unique business model, as it generates the bulk of its revenue from cloud-mining services. This unique business model also involves securing a major portion of its total hashrate from third-party suppliers. In comparison, stock market darlings such as Riot Platforms, Mara Holdings, and CleanSpark have a more straightforward business model where they have positioned themselves as bitcoin miners. This business model differentiation may have contributed to the market seeing BitFuFu as a riskier business compared to its peers. Another factor that may have contributed to the comparable undervaluation is BitFuFu's Singapore origins. All of the competitors I discussed above are headquartered in the U.S., which naturally boosts their investment appeal. BitFuFu's smaller scale from a BTC ownership perspective compared to its peers may have also played a part in this relatively cheap valuation. As of May 31, FUFU held 1,709 BTC compared to 19,225 for Riot, 49,179 for Mara, and 12,502 for CleanSpark according to the most recent data. While this smaller scale may spook some investors, in reality, this should not be a dealbreaker, given that BitFuFu is executing its strategy well. To realistically estimate BitFuFu's intrinsic value, I thought it's best to use a Market Cap/Hashrate comparison of its American peers and then apply a valuation discount to reflect the factors discussed above. Before that, let's see how BitFuFu compares with its peers across a few important metrics. Metric FUFU RIOT MARA CLSK Peer Average Stock price $3.17 $10 $14.98 $10.6 - Market capitalization $535 million $3.58 billion $5.24 billion $2.82 billion - TTM revenue $397 million $459 million $705 million $537 million P/S multiple 1.35x 6.41x 6.57x 4.88x 5.95x Hashrate 34.1 EH/s 35.4 EH/s 58.3 EH/s 45.6 EH/s Market cap/hashrate $15.68 million/EH $101.13 million/EH $89.87 million/EH $61.64 million/EH $84.21 million/EH Note: Stock Price Data as of June 26. Looking at this table, FUFU's disconnect from the peer group is evident. At a P/E multiple of 1.35x, FUFU is significantly undervalued compared to the peer average of almost 6x. The undervaluation is even more evident by the fact that the market is attaching a value of $15.68 million per EH for BitFuFu whereas the peer average is over $80 million. Given the limitations that I discussed earlier, I believe a 30% discount to the peer average is warranted, which gives us a target fair value of $58.95 million/EH. Based on BitFuFu's current hashrate of 34.1 EH/s, the implied market cap comes to $2.01 billion. Based on 163.2 million shares outstanding, the per-share intrinsic value estimate comes to $12.32, which implies an upside potential of almost 300%. Even after applying a valuation discount to account for company-specific limitations facing BitFuFu, the company seems substantially undervalued in the market, which makes FUFU stock an attractive bet for investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin. Takeaway BitFuFu, after a disappointing Q1 performance, is attractively valued in the market compared to other publicly traded bitcoin miners. The short-term challenges that led to this lackluster Q1 performance seem to have passed, and the company has shown resilience in the first two months of the second quarter. The market seems to have misunderstood the growth potential of BitFuFu, leaving room for a valuation re-rating once the Q2 earnings report is out. Key risks to monitor include the company's reliance on third-party hashrate providers, execution risks facing vertical integration efforts involving data centers, and the revenue volatility arising from its reliance on cloud mining.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797765-bitfufu-punished-bad-quarter-poised-powerful-re-rating?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","FUFU",cryptocompare

Institutional demand is still strong. ETFs have seen net inflows for 13 days in a row and $1.71 billion this week which is the most since May. Major corporate holders like Metaplanet and ProCap have accumulated over 7,500 BTC in the same period. This is institutional conviction despite retail is still sleeping. Can Bitcoin Clear $112K and Aim Higher? Technical resistance between $108,000 and $110,000 remains the key barrier. Analysts say a close above $109,000 with increased volume could push BTC to $112,000 and beyond. Beyond that, potential targets include $120,000 and even $165,000, driven by spot ETF demand and macro tailwinds. He's right! Bitcoin won't ever go above $112k again because: The US is getting their spending under control and the federal reserve will permanently stop printing money. https://t.co/jvslq1lrDD — Vijay Kailash, CFA, CFP® (@realvijayk) June 26, 2025 But upside isn’t guaranteed. A failure to clear $108,250 may trigger a short-term pullback. Volume is still low, and on-chain activity has declined—transfer volume is down 32% to $52 billion, while spot trading remains muted around $7.7 billion. If the price breaks below $106,249, the path to $104,000–$105,000 opens. These zones may act as accumulation points for bulls. Bottom line: The next 48 hours are pivotal. A confirmed breakout above $108K could ignite a fresh rally. A rejection may spell consolidation—or correction—before the next leg higher. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Surges Past $1.6M—Layer 2 Just Got a Meme-Sized Boost Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has smashed through the $1 million mark in its public presale, raising $1,673,470 out of a $1,904,052 million target. With just hours left before the price jumps to the next tier, buyers can still lock in $0.01205 per HYPER. As the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper brings fast, low-cost smart contracts to the BTC ecosystem. It merges Bitcoin’s security with SVM’s scalability, enabling high-speed dApps, meme coins, and payments—all with cheap gas fees and seamless BTC bridging. Audited by Consult, Bitcoin Hyper is engineered for speed, trust, and scale. Over 91 million $HYPER are already staked, with estimated 577% APY post-launch rewards. The token also powers gas fees, dApp access, and governance. The presale accepts crypto and cards, and thanks to Web3Payments, no wallet is needed. Meme appeal meets real utility—Bitcoin Hyper might be Layer 2’s breakout star of 2025.

2025-06-27T14:00:01,"Ethereum Price: Will ETH Soar Beyond $2.4K? A Crucial Market Analysis","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: Will ETH Soar Beyond $2.4K? A Crucial Market Analysis Are you watching the charts, wondering what’s next for Ethereum price ? The crypto community is buzzing with anticipation as leading analysts point to a critical juncture for the second-largest cryptocurrency. With ETH holding above a key support level, the stage might be set for a significant move. Let’s dive into the signals and expert opinions shaping Ethereum’s immediate future. Understanding the Current Ethereum Price Dynamics The cryptocurrency market is a landscape of constant flux, but certain indicators offer clearer pathways. For Ethereum price , the $2,400 level has emerged as a focal point. Michaël van de Poppe, founder of MN Trading Capital, as cited by Cointelegraph, suggests that if Ethereum successfully maintains its position above this crucial support, further gains could be on the horizon in the weeks ahead. This sentiment is echoed by other market observers, who see growing signs of a potential shift. Crypto Fella, a prominent market watcher, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to express a similar conviction: “It’s almost time for the long-expected reversal.” This indicates a broader belief among analysts that Ethereum might be poised to break free from recent consolidation or downward pressure, signaling renewed bullish momentum. The ability of ETH to hold this support level is not just a number; it’s a psychological and technical battleground for traders and investors alike. Diving Deep into ETH Analysis: The $2.4K Support When we talk about ETH analysis , support levels are fundamental. A support level is a price point where buying interest is strong enough to prevent the price from falling further. For Ethereum, the $2,400 mark has acted as a significant area of confluence, where previous resistance might have turned into new support. If buyers step in consistently at or above this level, it reinforces the foundation for an upward trajectory. Conversely, a decisive break below $2,400 could signal weakness and potentially lead to further downside, triggering stop-losses and increasing selling pressure. This makes monitoring this level paramount for anyone interested in Ethereum’s short-to-medium term performance. It’s not just about hitting a number; it’s about sustained price action above it, indicating strong conviction from market participants. Decoding Crypto Market Trends: The ETH/BTC Ratio Explained Beyond its USD pairing, understanding Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC) is vital for grasping broader crypto market trends . The ETH/BTC ratio serves as a key barometer for altcoin strength. When this ratio rises, it often signals an ‘altcoin season’ where capital flows from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. Conversely, a declining ratio suggests Bitcoin dominance, with altcoins underperforming. Currently, the ETH/BTC ratio stands at 0.02275, having experienced a 6.84% decline over the past month, according to TradingView. This recent dip indicates that Ethereum has been losing ground against Bitcoin. However, for those anticipating an ‘altcoin rally,’ a reversal in this ratio is a crucial precursor. Analysts are closely watching for signs that Ethereum can regain strength against Bitcoin, which would signify a broader shift in market sentiment towards altcoins. Key Insights from Technical Analysis: Signals to Watch Beyond simple support levels, comprehensive technical analysis involves scrutinizing various indicators to identify potential trend reversals and confirm momentum. Traders often look at: Volume: An increase in trading volume as price holds support or breaks resistance adds conviction to the move. Moving Averages: Crossovers or price interactions with key moving averages (e.g., 50-day, 200-day) can signal trend strength or weakness. Relative Strength Index (RSI): This momentum oscillator can indicate if an asset is overbought or oversold, potentially signaling a reversal point. Chart Patterns: Formations like inverse head and shoulders, double bottoms, or bullish divergences on indicators can suggest an impending uptrend. For Ethereum, the ‘long-expected reversal’ mentioned by Crypto Fella would likely be confirmed by a combination of these factors aligning, indicating a robust shift in market dynamics rather than just a temporary bounce. Actionable insight here is to combine these signals rather than relying on just one. Is an Altcoin Rally on the Horizon for Ethereum? The potential for an altcoin rally is a recurring theme in cryptocurrency markets, often following periods of Bitcoin dominance. Ethereum, being the largest altcoin by market capitalization, typically leads such rallies. Several factors beyond technicals could fuel such a surge: Network Upgrades: Ongoing developments and successful implementation of upgrades (like the Dencun upgrade earlier this year, or future advancements) can enhance Ethereum’s scalability, security, and efficiency, attracting more users and developers. DeFi and NFT Growth: Ethereum remains the backbone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems. Renewed interest or innovation in these sectors directly benefits ETH. Institutional Adoption: Increasing institutional interest, potentially including spot Ethereum ETFs in the future, could bring significant capital inflows. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish turn in the wider crypto market, often initiated by Bitcoin’s performance, typically pulls altcoins higher. While the signs are promising, challenges remain. Regulatory uncertainties, macroeconomic headwinds, or a sudden downturn in Bitcoin’s price could dampen enthusiasm. However, if the $2,400 support holds and the ETH/BTC ratio shows signs of reversal, Ethereum could indeed lead the charge in the next significant altcoin rally. Conclusion: Ethereum at a Crossroads Ethereum finds itself at a pivotal moment. The consensus among analysts points to the $2,400 support level as a crucial determinant for its near-term trajectory. Should this level hold firm, combined with a potential reversal in the ETH/BTC ratio and other positive technical indicators, the stage is set for Ethereum to eye further substantial gains. As always, the crypto market remains dynamic, but the current signals provide a compelling narrative for Ethereum’s potential ascent. Keeping a close eye on these key levels and broader market sentiment will be essential for navigating what could be an exciting period for ETH holders.

Bakkt Moves Toward Direct Bitcoin Investment Publicly traded digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings has filed a $1 billion shelf registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a pivotal step in its strategic pivot toward cryptocurrency treasury allocations. The filing, submitted on June 26, 2025, grants Bakkt the authority to sell a range of securities, including Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt instruments, and warrants in one or more future offerings. This development follows a policy revision earlier this month, enabling Bakkt to invest directly in Bitcoin and other digital assets. While the company has not disclosed any purchases yet, the filing confirms it could use proceeds from this shelf offering to fund crypto acquisitions. In its prospectus, the company stated, “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources.” Strategic Pivot and Business Headwinds A subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt has navigated a challenging year. In March 2025, the company announced it was losing major clients, Bank of America and Webull, triggering a 30% decline in its share price. Further complicating matters, Bakkt disclosed in the filing that its loyalty services segment faces possible divestiture as it sharpens its focus on crypto infrastructure offerings. Bakkt’s revised investment policy is part of a broader repositioning. Co-CEO Akshay Naheta described the plan as a move to “transform Bakkt into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company.” The strategy also includes partnerships, such as a March agreement with Distributed Technologies Research Global Ltd. to enhance crypto payment-processing capabilities. Regulatory Risks and Market Positioning The SEC filing outlines extensive risk factors, with regulatory uncertainty remaining a significant concern. Bakkt warned that evolving legal frameworks, potential classification of digital assets as securities, and disruptions to banking services could materially affect operations. The company also flagged cybersecurity threats and operational complexities in integrating new digital assets. If Bakkt proceeds with a Bitcoin allocation, it would join an expanding list of public firms adding crypto to their balance sheets. At Bitcoin’s current price of $106,800, a full $1 billion investment would secure approximately 9,364 BTC, positioning Bakkt just ahead of Coinbase on the list of top publicly traded Bitcoin holders. Following news of the shelf offering, Bakkt’s Class A shares (NYSE: BKKT) rose 3% to $13.33 on Thursday. However, the stock remains down 46% year-to-date.

2025-06-27T13:50:53,"Belgravia Hartford Propels Strategic Bitcoin Investment with Second $1M Drawdown","BitcoinWorld Belgravia Hartford Propels Strategic Bitcoin Investment with Second $1M Drawdown The world of digital assets continues to attract significant institutional interest, and a recent move by Belgravia Hartford Capital underscores this growing trend. This publicly traded Canadian investment firm has just announced a pivotal step in its strategic foray into the cryptocurrency market: the completion of a second $1 million drawdown specifically earmarked for acquiring Bitcoin. Belgravia Hartford’s Bold Move: A Deeper Dive into Institutional Bitcoin Investment Belgravia Hartford Capital, a name increasingly recognized in the Canadian investment landscape, is making headlines once again with its proactive approach to digital asset integration. Their latest announcement details the completion of a second $1 million drawdown, a clear signal of their ongoing commitment to the Bitcoin market. This isn’t just a one-off purchase; it’s part of a larger, carefully planned strategy to build a substantial Bitcoin portfolio. The funds for this significant Bitcoin investment are sourced from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund, a specialized vehicle designed to navigate the complexities of the crypto space. The firm’s decision to allocate such substantial capital towards Bitcoin highlights a growing confidence among traditional investment entities in the long-term viability and value proposition of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic move by Belgravia Hartford is indicative of a broader shift, where established players are no longer just observing the crypto market but actively participating and shaping its future. Their methodical approach, utilizing regulated channels like Coinsquare’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, further solidifies the legitimacy and maturity of the crypto ecosystem. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Work? Understanding the Mechanics For those new to institutional crypto investments, understanding the mechanics behind Belgravia Hartford’s strategy is key. This latest $1 million drawdown is not a direct purchase from an open exchange but rather a structured financing agreement. Here’s a breakdown of how this particular Bitcoin investment is executed: The Source Fund: The capital originates from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund. This fund likely pools money from various investors, including Belgravia Hartford, and specializes in digital asset strategies. The Drawdown Mechanism: A “drawdown” in this context refers to Belgravia Hartford accessing a pre-arranged line of credit or capital commitment from the Round13 fund. This particular drawdown is the second of its kind, part of a larger $5 million financing agreement. Purpose-Specific Funds: Crucially, these funds are explicitly designated for one purpose: to buy Bitcoin. This specificity ensures transparency and adherence to the investment firm’s stated digital asset strategy. Regulated Trading Desk: The actual acquisition of Bitcoin is conducted through Coinsquare’s regulated over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk. OTC desks are preferred by institutions for large volume trades as they minimize market impact and offer better pricing, often without revealing the trade size publicly. Coinsquare’s status as a regulated entity adds an extra layer of security and compliance, which is paramount for a publicly traded firm like Belgravia Hartford. Financing Terms: The financing agreement comes with a variable interest rate, which is tied to the Bank of Canada’s prime rate. This detail indicates a sophisticated financial arrangement, typical of institutional lending and borrowing, designed to manage costs effectively. This structured approach allows Belgravia Hartford to systematically accumulate Bitcoin while managing their capital exposure and leveraging established financial partnerships. It’s a testament to the increasing sophistication of how traditional finance is integrating with the digital asset space. The Significance of the Round13 Digital Asset Fund Partnership The collaboration with the Round13 Digital Asset Fund is a cornerstone of Belgravia Hartford’s strategy. This partnership is more than just a source of capital; it represents a strategic alignment with a specialized fund that understands the nuances of the cryptocurrency market. Why is this significant? Expertise and Access: Round13 Digital Asset Fund likely possesses deep expertise in crypto markets, including research, risk management, and access to unique investment opportunities that might not be readily available to traditional firms. Streamlined Acquisition: By partnering with a fund focused on digital assets, Belgravia Hartford can streamline its acquisition process, relying on Round13’s infrastructure and market connections. Risk Management: A specialized fund can offer sophisticated risk management strategies tailored for volatile crypto assets, potentially mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with direct market exposure. Scalability: The $5 million financing agreement suggests a long-term plan for substantial Bitcoin accumulation. The fund provides a scalable mechanism for Belgravia Hartford to increase its crypto holdings over time without immediate large capital outlays from its primary balance sheet. This type of partnership underscores a growing trend where traditional financial institutions are leveraging the expertise of crypto-native funds to gain exposure to digital assets, rather than building the entire infrastructure in-house. It reflects a maturing market where collaboration is key to navigating the evolving landscape. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Belgravia Hartford’s continued commitment to Bitcoin through structured drawdowns sends a strong message about the future of institutional crypto adoption. Their actions are not isolated but fit into a broader narrative of increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Here are some key implications: Validation and Legitimacy: When publicly traded firms like Belgravia Hartford allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it lends further credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. It signals to other traditional investors that cryptocurrencies are becoming a serious component of diversified portfolios. Market Maturation: The use of regulated OTC desks and structured financing agreements, as seen with this crypto drawdown , points to the maturation of the market infrastructure. This makes it easier and safer for large institutions to participate. Diversification Strategy: For many institutional investors, Bitcoin and other digital assets represent a new frontier for diversification. They offer a potential hedge against inflation, a non-correlated asset, and exposure to a rapidly evolving technological paradigm. Belgravia Hartford’s move exemplifies this diversification play. Precedent Setting: Each major institutional entry or increased allocation sets a precedent, potentially encouraging other firms that have been on the sidelines to reconsider their stance. The domino effect of institutional crypto adoption could accelerate significantly in the coming years. The growing comfort level of these firms with the inherent volatility of crypto, coupled with their focus on long-term strategic accumulation, indicates a fundamental shift in how digital assets are perceived within the global financial system. This institutional embrace is crucial for the long-term stability and growth of the crypto market. Analyzing the Impact of this Crypto Drawdown on Market Sentiment Every significant institutional move, like Belgravia Hartford’s latest crypto drawdown , can influence market sentiment. While a single $1 million purchase might seem small in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization, its symbolic weight is considerable. What impact might this have? Positive Signal: The consistent buying pressure from institutional entities provides a positive signal to retail and other institutional investors. It suggests that “smart money” continues to see value in Bitcoin, even amidst market fluctuations. Supply Dynamics: While OTC trades don’t directly impact spot exchange prices in the same way retail trades do, they represent Bitcoin being taken off the open market and held by long-term investors. This gradual reduction in liquid supply can contribute to price appreciation over time. Increased Confidence: News of institutional accumulation often boosts overall confidence in the market, potentially attracting more capital inflows. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is an asset for the future, not just a speculative fad. Regulatory Comfort: The emphasis on regulated platforms like Coinsquare also helps to assuage concerns about regulatory uncertainty. Institutions opting for compliant channels sends a message that the industry is professionalizing. This ongoing accumulation by firms like Belgravia Hartford is a quiet but powerful force, slowly but surely absorbing Bitcoin supply and embedding it deeper into the traditional financial fabric. It’s a key indicator of Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a globally recognized and accepted store of value and investment asset. Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights for Investors Belgravia Hartford’s strategy offers valuable lessons for all types of investors interested in the digital asset space. Benefits of Institutional Bitcoin Investment: Diversification: Bitcoin can offer portfolio diversification due to its relatively low correlation with traditional assets. Potential for High Returns: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Early Mover Advantage (for traditional finance): Firms entering now are positioning themselves to capitalize on the long-term growth of the digital economy. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant swings, posing risks for short-term investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can introduce unpredictability. Security Risks: While institutional platforms are robust, the digital nature of assets means security remains a paramount concern. Market Manipulation: Despite growing maturity, the crypto market can still be susceptible to large movements based on news or whale activity. Actionable Insights for Retail Investors: While most retail investors don’t have access to multi-million dollar drawdowns from digital asset funds, Belgravia Hartford’s approach provides valuable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investors often adopt a long-term “hodling” strategy. This suggests that daily price fluctuations are less important than the asset’s long-term value proposition. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): The repeated $1 million drawdowns mimic a form of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy where one invests a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This can mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak. Importance of Regulated Platforms: Belgravia Hartford uses Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk. For retail investors, this translates to choosing reputable, regulated exchanges that prioritize security and compliance. Diversification within Crypto: While Belgravia Hartford is focusing on Bitcoin, a broader crypto portfolio might include other strong projects for retail investors, though Bitcoin remains the institutional favorite. Conclusion: Belgravia Hartford’s Strategic Play Reinforces Bitcoin’s Institutional Trajectory Belgravia Hartford Capital’s latest $1 million crypto drawdown to acquire Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s evolving role in institutional portfolios. This strategic move, facilitated by the Round13 Digital Asset Fund and executed through Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk, highlights a calculated and confident approach to digital asset integration. As traditional investment firms increasingly recognize the long-term value and diversification benefits of cryptocurrencies, actions like these pave the way for broader institutional crypto adoption. It signifies a future where digital assets are not just an alternative investment but a core component of sophisticated financial strategies. The steady accumulation by entities like Belgravia Hartford quietly reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a robust and legitimate asset, signaling a continued bullish outlook for its institutional trajectory.

The relisting is complementary to the company’s overall Bitcoin-driven strategy. The firm confirmed that, as of a September issue date, more than 10 million of its common stock—listed on the ticker “BTCT”—are issued and outstanding, already sold in the recent brokered offering. The $92 million gross proceeds resulted from a raise of 125 million Canadian dollars, in which BTCT sold 426,650 shares at CA$10 ($7.32) each. The shares have a four-month and one-day holding period. BTCT Buys 292.8 BTC to Power Institutional Lending Initiative BTCT has put some of the raise to use buying 292.8 BTC for around $31.5 million. It is BTCT’s first meaningful Bitcoin buy under its new lending and accumulation initiative. For BTCT, the Bitcoin will be used to offer liquidity services to clients, so it is not just an asset, but a lending and capital optimization tool. The firm will release a “Bitcoin per share” figure after acquisition period, so that shareholders will be able to get more clarity on the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Long-Term Holders Push BTC Supply to Record Levels BTCT’s strategy is part of an overall movement in the crypto space, with long-term holders not even considering selling despite recent price spikes. CryptoQuant data indicates there has been a 800,000 BTC 30-day record accumulation in wallets that have not sold since at least six months ago.

This just goes to show that the mounting institutional involvement in crypto is, in part, responsible for the correlation, but that’s a topic for another discussion. Even though Bitcoin is trading almost flat on the weekly chart, the past seven days have been anything but calm. Naturally, most of the volatility had to do with the war between Iran and Israel. Around June 23rd, BTC dropped below $100K for the first time since early May, sending the markets into a state of discomfort and causing over $1 billion worth of liquidated positions. This was caused mostly because of the news that the US had decided to enter the war on the side of Israel and bomb strategic nuclear sites in Iran. The turmoil didn’t stop there, but doomsayers had it all wrong because on the very next day, the situation started de-escalating following what many believed to be a staged retaliation by Iran targeting a US base in Qatar, causing minor damage. Following this situation, US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire and despite the minor tensions, it appears that the conflict is now subdued. Markets reacted positively, with BTC rallying from the sub-$100K region to a high at around $108,000. At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $107,000, but the majority of altcoins, as you can see in the heatmap below, took a much more considerable punch. Many of them are down between 4% and 10%, signaling, once again at Bitcoin’s unshakable dominance in the past few months. In other news, one of the more interesting developments came from Chainlink as Mastercard – one of the world’s leading payment processing companies – announced a partnership with the aims of enabling its 3 billion users to seamlessly buy crypto. This is what adoption looks like. Another are that many are monitoring closely is the legal battle between the US SEC and Ripple. A lot of people were expecting the case to officially end this week, but the presiding judge tossed the parties’ motion for indicative ruling, which means that the whole thing will be dragged out, possibly for another few months. It all depends on Ripple now. All in all, the market fared very well in the face of mounting geopolitical turmoil and economic instability, but it’s very interesting to see how things will develop in the weeks to come.

And many regret not holding a… https://t.co/DHtcauZGFt — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) June 25, 2025 Drawing Parallels from Bitcoin and Ethereum History Xena XRP pointed out that skepticism towards XRP mirrors the same sentiment that once surrounded Bitcoin and Ethereum during their early stages. She reminded readers that when articles predicted Bitcoin reaching $1 million, critics dismissed such projections and insisted on focusing first on hitting $1,000. Today, Bitcoin trades significantly higher, and many who doubted regret not having invested earlier. Xena reflected on her own experience, sharing that she acquired Bitcoin when it was priced between $200 and $600 and Ethereum when it was just $5. At the time, many dismissed the possibility of substantial gains, yet those investments turned out to be highly rewarding. She stated that the same type of dismissive commentary now surrounds XRP, with critics frequently repeating the phrase “let’s cross all-time high first” whenever long-term price projections are discussed. Xena stressed that such thought is common among individuals who believe they have all the necessary information, but in reality, lack the full picture. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Referencing Ripple Connections and Riddles Xena XRP further explained her confidence by pointing to longstanding hints within the XRP ecosystem. She referenced the well-known XRP community figure Bearableguy123, claiming he appears to have an insider-level understanding of Ripple’s plans. She highlighted that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse follows Bearableguy123, and Ripple CTO David Schwartz used to follow him as well before facing criticism for doing so. According to Xena, this consistent engagement over the years suggests that Bearableguy123’s advice to “persevere” should not be ignored. She also brought up the frequently discussed number 589 , a figure often mentioned within the XRP community. Xena questioned why Ripple consistently referenced this number, even though the $589 XRP price prediction by the end of 2018 did not materialize. She suggested that Ripple’s leadership, including Brad Garlinghouse, somewhat knows that the number is significant. Trusting the Founders Over the Critics Xena XRP challenged followers to decide whose opinions carry more weight. She contrasted the views of what she referred to as “X haters” and random skeptics with the statements from Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto and CTO David Schwartz. She referenced Arthur Britto’s well-circulated statement that XRP was designed to reach $10,000, emphasizing that even if such a figure were incorrect by several thousand dollars, the implication is still that XRP could hit a substantially high price point. She concluded her response by encouraging people to choose which side they trust. Whether to align with those who dismiss XRP’s potential or to trust the insights of Ripple’s co-founders and individuals who, according to her, understand the project’s true scope. Xena made it clear that she opted for the latter and expressed no doubt in XRP reaching $10,000 , reinforcing that conviction with both historical examples and perceived insider signals.

2025-06-27T13:47:20,"Stablecoins gain momentum, but retail payment disruption remains distant","Stablecoins — long pitched as a dull, dependable cousin of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin — have taken center stage in recent weeks. The asset class pegged to stable currencies like the US dollar, has captured market and political attention as big companies and regulators increasingly enter the fray. Last week, the US Senate advanced legislation that would create a federal framework for stablecoins, marking a milestone for a sector that has long operated in regulatory gray areas. Meanwhile, shares of Circle Internet Group, the issuer of USDC, have soared more than 600% since the company’s June 5 debut on public markets. That surge in interest is being matched by action. Fintech firm Fiserv unveiled its own stablecoin this month, and major retailers Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring their own tokens. If current trends hold, stablecoins’ total market capitalization — now at $260 billion — could nearly double to $500 billion by the end of 2026, according to Seaport Research Partners. Despite the buzz, Wall Street remains cautious about how soon stablecoins will become mainstream in everyday retail payments. Analysts at Bernstein and Evercore ISI say the most viable near-term use cases lie in areas like international money transfers and corporate payrolls. Promise in cross-border payments and payrolls Despite the buzz, Wall Street remains cautious about how soon stablecoins will become mainstream in everyday retail payments. Analysts at Bernstein and Evercore ISI say the most viable near-term use cases lie in areas like international money transfers and corporate payrolls. Cross-border payments, where speed and low fees matter most, are likely to benefit from stablecoin adoption, the analysts argue. Blockchain-based transactions can outpace traditional financial systems in both efficiency and cost, offering businesses a reason to integrate stablecoins into their operations. There’s also interest in using stablecoins to pay workers directly. This could help companies in emerging markets sidestep unreliable banking infrastructure, while employees receive faster access to inflation-resistant funds. Retail payments not quite ready Still, when it comes to paying for everyday items — from e-commerce checkouts to bar tabs — stablecoins face higher hurdles. As Bernstein’s analysts put it, “stablecoins are a solution looking for a problem in retail consumer payments.” In traditional card-based transactions, merchants, not shoppers, absorb the interchange fees. As a result, there’s little incentive for consumers to switch to new payment methods that offer them no immediate benefit. Attempts by companies to push customers toward alternate forms of payment often lead to lower sales conversions and higher churn, the Bernstein team noted. Without clear incentives or seamless integration, stablecoin adoption at the checkout counter is unlikely to gain traction anytime soon. Not yet a threat to card networks Evercore analysts similarly downplayed the immediate impact on established payment networks like Visa and Mastercard, despite Tuesday’s announcement that Fiserv had partnered with Mastercard to support stablecoin transactions. “We think the adoption of stablecoins for domestic payments will take a while as the value prop isn’t strong enough yet,” the Evercore analysts wrote. “And speaking from experience, consumers require a lot of incentives to switch their habits.” Stablecoin expansion continues, but timeline uncertain To be sure, stablecoin innovation is advancing at a rapid clip, with more announcements expected from both crypto-native companies and Fortune 500 firms. But for now, it remains difficult to determine who the long-term winners and losers will be. Analysts acknowledge the potential in stablecoins, but say it does not mean the roadmap to its mass adoption is clear. Whether stablecoins eventually reshape global commerce — or remain a niche utility — may hinge on how seamlessly businesses and consumers adapt to a digital payments future that’s still being written.
