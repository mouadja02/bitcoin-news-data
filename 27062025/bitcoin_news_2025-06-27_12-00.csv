2025-06-27T09:36:58,"Genius Group to split lawsuit wins between shareholders and Bitcoin Treasury","Genius Group announced a plan to allocate any future legal settlements equally between shareholder dividends and Bitcoin acquisitions. On June 26, Genius Group, a Singapore-based AI-driven education company listed on the NYSE American, announced a new distribution plan that would see proceeds from its ongoing legal cases split equally between shareholder dividends and Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases for its corporate treasury. The company is currently pursuing two major lawsuits seeking over $1 billion in damages. The first, already filed in the Southern District of Florida under the RICO Act, demands over $750 million in damages tied to alleged misconduct by former partners and executives. The second, expected to be filed soon, targets alleged naked short selling and spoofing, with preliminary damages estimated above $260 million — figures expected to rise with updated 2024–2025 trading data. If successful, 50% of any net legal recoveries — after fees and taxes—will be issued to shareholders as a special dividend. The remaining 50% will be used to purchase Bitcoin for the company’s treasury.

The announcement follows Genius Group’s recent expansion of its BTC holdings, with the company boosting its treasury by 52% over the past month after a U.S. court had lifted a previous ban on crypto purchases . Specifically, the company added 34 BTC to its corporate treasury, increasing its total holdings to 100 BTC. The acquisitions were made at an average price of $100,600 per Bitcoin, totaling roughly $10.06 million in investment. With the ban lifted, the CEO reiterated its 1,000 BTC target.

The price has dipped a bit since then — but what’s next for BANANAS31? Check out our Banana For Scale price prediction to find out. Table of Contents What is Banana For Scale? Banana For Scale crypto price prediction: general outlook Banana For Scale price prediction 2025 Banana For Scale price prediction 2030 What is Banana For Scale? Banana For Scale ( BANANAS31 ) is a meme token built on the BNB Smart Chain, inspired by the classic internet joke where a banana is used to show the size of things — you’ve probably seen it on Reddit or old-school meme pages. The token officially launched on November 15, 2024, via the Four.meme platform and quickly caught attention thanks to its quirky origin and community-driven vibe. It really took off when a banana sticker was spotted on SpaceX’s Starship S31 — a real moment of meme meets space. Since launch, BANANAS31 has attracted tens of thousands of holders and carved out a spot for itself in the memecoin universe , blending humor, DAO-powered governance, and internet culture into one bananas-packed project. Is Banana For Scale a good investment? Let’s take a look at the Banana For Scale coin price prediction. Banana For Scale crypto price prediction: general outlook On June 26, 2025, Banana For Scale hit a fresh all-time high at $0.01701 before cooling off a bit to around $0.01598. On June 27, BANANA is now trading at $0.0099791, down around 40% over the last 24 hours but up 75% on the week and 47% over the last month. BANANA 1-day chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news BANANAS31 has found its own lane in the memecoin world thanks to its fun branding and viral energy. It’s still pretty new but already gaining momentum, especially after some recent exchange listings and buzz from retail traders. Like most meme tokens, the price swings are all about hype and community — not real fundamentals. So yeah, it’s hot right now, but it could just as easily cool off if the hype fades.

The site expects BANANA to trade between $0.0117 and $0.04 over the rest of the year — and in the best-case scenario, it could even surpass its recent all-time high. As of June 26, the overall BANANA price prediction still leans bullish. Out of 24 technical indicators tracked by CoinCodex, 19 are flashing bullish signals, while only 5 suggest bearish momentum. Wallet Investor offers a more conservative Banana For Scale price prediction for 2025, estimating an average price of around $0.0092 by year-end. Their forecast ranges from a low of $0.007 to a potential high of $0.0112. Will Banana For Scale go up or down in 2030? Banana For Scale price prediction 2030 According to CoinCodex’s expectations, BANANA could be trading anywhere between $0.0208 and $0.065 by 2030. Wallet Investor’s projections for BANANA are far more cautious. They estimate the meme token might trade between $0.0182 and $0.0228 by late June 2030. Should you invest in Banana For Scale? If you’re into memes, community-driven tokens, and a bit of chaos — BANANAS31 might be right up your alley. It’s got strong meme energy, a growing fanbase, and a few viral moments already under its belt. But like any memecoin, it’s a wild ride: prices can soar on hype and drop just as fast. So, if you decide to get involved, think of it as a high-risk, high-volatility investment — and only put in what you’re fully prepared to lose.

Intrigued? The AI-powered education company is chasing over $1 billion in damages through two lawsuits. If the cases succeed, half the winnings will go to shareholders as a special dividend, and the other half will be used to buy Bitcoin. It’s an unusual but strategic move. Big Win? Here’s What Shareholders and Bitcoin Get In a press release on Thursday, Genius Group’s board approved a plan to split any future legal wins. CEO Roger Hamilton says the company will distribute 50% of net damages to shareholders and use the rest to grow its Bitcoin treasury. According to the company, a successful outcome in both lawsuits could result in a $7 per share dividend and an acquisition of 5,000 BTC at today’s prices. That Bitcoin haul, worth over $535 million at current prices, would mark one of the most aggressive BTC buys by a public company in recent memory. 50% of legal wins go to $GNS shareholders as special dividend, 50% to $BTC Bitcoin Treasury.

In a Saylor double alternate universe where… pic.twitter.com/x3sNg4UaoK — Roger James Hamilton (@rogerhamilton) June 26, 2025 Two Lawsuits, One Aggressive Strategy The first lawsuit has already been filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and targets several individuals, including former SEC Chairman John Clayton. Genius is seeking more than $750 million in damages. The second lawsuit, still being finalized, focuses on naked short selling and spoofing. Based on 2023 data, the company expects at least $262 million in damages but that number is likely to grow with updated trading records from 2024 and 2025. Hamilton emphasized that these lawsuits are meant to recover losses directly caused to shareholders. Lawsuits Could Fund BTC Push Genius Group has already started building a Bitcoin treasury. Earlier this month, it boosted its BTC holdings by over 50% and said it’s aiming to accumulate 1,000 BTC. But if the legal strategy pays off, the company could fast-track that goal. “There’s no guarantee how much we recover,” Hamilton admitted . Still, he floated a best-case scenario where justice wins, and Bitcoin climbs. “Wouldn’t that be the ultimate irony,” he added, “where victims end up making 100x what the crooks stole from them because we fought back.” What Comes Next There’s no timeline yet for how long the lawsuits will take or how much might be recovered. Any payouts will depend on final damages, legal fees, taxes, and regulatory approvals in both the U.S. and Singapore. But the message is clear: Genius Group is betting that legal wins can fund both shareholder rewards and long-term Bitcoin growth!

Hayes tells his 704,300 followers on the social media platform X that US legislation and monetary policy, as well as tensions in the Middle East, are among the reasons he believes will trigger Bitcoin to push higher. On the US monetary policy, Hayes says the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) exemption for banks is now “progressing.” SLR exemption is a monetary policy tool that allows banks to hold more U.S. Treasury securities without raising their supplementary leverage ratio, a move that boosts their liquidity. The BitMEX co-founder further says the GENIUS Act, which provides a framework for regulating stablecoins, will hand the US stablecoin market to the banks. According to Hayes, the legislation, which became law earlier this month, will be positive for lenders. Hayes further says the Middle East region still presents a geopolitical risk, a factor that favors safe-haven assets, despite a recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel that was brokered by President Donald Trump. “BTC all-time highs are coming!” The BitMEX co-founder also says an unwind of the US dollar carry trade globally is about to cause “serious pain.” A carry trade is a bet on the interest rate differences between two countries. In the case of the US dollar, the expectation of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve is causing a weakening of the world’s reserve currency, as this will reduce the returns expected on the dollar-denominated assets. According to Hayes, Bitcoin is the antidote for the ongoing weakening of the US dollar.

According to an official press release , the Nasdaq -listed Mullen Automotive Inc. now accepts purchases made in cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the official TRUMP ( TRUMP ) memecoin . This means that traders can purchase both Mullen and Bollinger commercial electric vehicles by paying in crypto. In addition to the two cryptocurrencies mentioned, the company also plans to accept other types of crypto as it continues to delve into crypto payment acceptance.

2025-06-27T09:10:49,"XRP may fall below $2.00 despite Wormhole integration; check forecast","The cryptocurrency market could end the week bearish despite its positive start. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is down 1% in the last 24 hours and has now dropped below $107k. As usual, Bitcoin’s performance dictates how altcoins react. Most altcoins are currently in the red, including Ethereum’s Ether and Ripple’s XRP. XRP risks dropping below $2 soon. XRP drops below $2.1 despite wormhole integration XRP has lost 4.5% of its value in the last 24 hours and currently trades at $2.0905. The bearish performance comes despite Ripple’s integration with Wormhole. Wormhole announced on Thursday that Ripple has expanded its multichain interoperability by integrating with its infrastructure. The integration will enable cross-chain messaging, asset transfers, and multichain issuances of tokens, which will support additional use cases across DeFi, institutional onchain finance, and real-world assets (RWAs), including tokenized securities and regulated financial instruments. Furthermore, Wormhole will integrate its cross-chain messaging infrastructure with both the XRPL mainnet and the XRPL EVM Sidechain for seamless interoperability. This will empower developers to transfer supported XRPL assets, including XRP, Issued Assets (IOUs), and Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs), across more than 35 supported chains and build scalable, cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps). Developers can also interact with smart contracts across chains using messaging and data triggers. The news failed to catalyze an XRP rally. Instead, XRP now faces a decline to the $1.90 support level. XRP faces a potential drop to $1.90 The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bearish despite a positive week for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. The pair is bearish and efficient, which means sellers are firmly in control and could push XRP’s price lower. After eliminating the liquidity level above $2.2, XRP has resumed its bearish run, dropping to the $2.09 level. If the bearish trend continues, XRP could test the next support level at $1.9052 in the coming hours or over the weekend. In the event of an extended dip, XRP could drop to the next major support level at $1.7293. However, this drop will likely happen if the broader crypto market embarks on a long bearish run. If not, then the $1.90 support level could hold and serve as a springboard for XRP to rally higher. The 4-hour technical indicators are bearish. The MACD lines are at the neutral zone and heading into the negative territory, suggesting that the sellers have temporarily gained control of the XRP market. The RSI of 40 also shows that XRP is currently facing selling pressure from investors. The bulls seem to be exhausted, and this is affecting XRP’s price action and other major cryptocurrencies. However, if the bulls regain control, XRP could target the liquidity level around $2.65.

2025-06-27T09:09:24,"HIVE Digital: Underwhelming Q4, Continue To Avoid","Summary HIVE's Q4 results reinforce my view that Bitcoin mining is structurally unprofitable, with declining revenues despite higher Bitcoin prices and hashrate. The company's relentless capacity expansion is necessary to keep pace with industry difficulty, but it results in a never-ending cycle of capital investment and little financial return. HIVE's HPC/AI business remains insignificant compared to industry leaders, offering no meaningful diversification or growth opportunity. I continue to recommend avoiding HIVE for long-term investors, as the economics of Bitcoin mining remain unattractive, except during rare Bitcoin price surges. It's been a few months since I last wrote about HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) . In my last article, I was cautious on HIVE, as the company's perpetual share dilution and volatile stock price make it unattractive for long-term investors. Since my article, HIVE's shares have done well, returning 10.8% (Figure 1). Figure 1 - HIVE has risen 11% since March (Seeking Alpha) However, with the company releasing its fiscal fourth quarter results, I thought it would be timely to catch up with the company and see if HIVE's financial performance has improved or if there are any interesting corporate developments worth commenting on. Overall, HIVE's fourth quarter financial performance reiterates my thesis about the poor economics of Bitcoin mining. Although Bitcoin prices rose significantly YoY and HIVE's hashrate rose 40% YoY from 4.5 EH/s to 6.3 EH/s, HIVE saw a YoY revenue decline and a big net loss as Bitcoin prices dipped in the quarter. HIVE remains an avoid for me. Brief Company Overview For those not familiar, HIVE's core business remains its Bitcoin mining operations, which currently operate at 6 Exahash/s (""EH/s""), with plans to expand capacity to quadruple capacity to 25.5 EH/s by September 2025 (Figure 2). Figure 2 - HIVE's footprint ( Investor Presentation ) HIVE also has a nascent High-Performance Compute/Artificial Intelligence (""HPC/AI"") business unit that rents out its graphical processing units (""GPUs"") to businesses and researchers seeking access to the latest NVIDIA GPUs for AI workloads. Q4/2025 Was Underwhelming As mentioned above, HIVE's recently reported its fiscal fourth quarter results. Revenue was $31.2 million, a 15.4% YoY decline, despite Bitcoin prices rising significantly YoY (Figure 3). Figure 3 - HIVE Q4 financial summary ( Company Reports ) The main culprit is HIVE's Bitcoin production, which plunged to just 303 coins mined in the three months ended March 31, 2025. Bitcoin Mining Is A Mug's Game As I have written numerous times, Bitcoin mining is a mug's game because miners need to constantly upgrade their kit, increasing difficulty for the industry and reducing production for everyone (Figure 4). Figure 4 - Bitcoin mining difficulty is ever increasing (blockchain.com) So, even though HIVE's hashrate has increased ""from approximately 4.5 EH/s on March 31, 2024 to 6.3 EH/s on March 31, 2025"", the number of coins mined got sliced in half for HIVE, leading to lower YoY revenues. HIVE Continues To Grow Capacity The problem is that HIVE can't stop growing capacity, since everyone else in the industry is constantly buying more servers and data centers to mine Bitcoin (see the rising difficulty above). For HIVE, there is some positive news on the growth front. As per the quarterly press release , ""HIVE commissioned the first 100 MW at Yguazú two weeks ahead of its projected schedule,"" doubling the company's hashrate to 11.5 EH/s, which is sufficient to mine 5.5 Bitcoins per day at current difficulty. This growth is part of the company's plans to quadruple its hashrate to over 25 EH/s by December 2025 (author's note, the figure below from the latest corporate presentation shows plans for 25.5 EH/s by September, so management's latest update implies a slight delay to the growth plans) (Figure 5). Figure 5 - HIVE plans to quadruple hashrate to 25.5 EH/s by year-end ( Investor Presentation ) However, given the arms race to deploy more servers to mine Bitcoin, I fear investors will see much less growth in production than expected. Just counting the large publicly traded Bitcoin miners, we see growth plans to increase hashrate by ~50% by September (Figure 6). Figure 6 - Everyone else is also planning growth in hashrate ( Investor Presentation ) So while HIVE may enjoy a temporary boost to production, as competitor servers are brought online, HIVE's Bitcoin production will once again trend lower, unless it expands capacity again. This is a never-ending cycle of capital investment with little financial return. What Does HIVE Have To Show For Its Capital? Since 2016, HIVE has spent over $700 million in capital expenditures and acquisitions (Figure 7), including nearly $200 million in the last twelve months (Figure 8). Figure 7 - HIVE has spent over $700 million in capex since 2016 (Seeking Alpha) Figure 8 - HIVE invested $200 million in last twelve months ( Company Reports ) However, if we look at the balance sheet, HIVE only has $202 million in net PP&E and 2,201 Bitcoins in its HODL account, worth $181 million, to show for its efforts (Figures 9 and 10). Figure 9 - HIVE PP&E ( Company Reports ) Figure 10 - HIVE HODL account for Bitcoin ( Company Reports ) Simply put, Bitcoin mining does not appear to be a positive NPV activity that creates economic value. HPC Remains A Rounding Error As I have written previously, HIVE's HPC/AI business continues to struggle to gain traction. Although the company claims to have tripled revenues to $10.1 million in F2025 (Figure 11), HIVE's tier-3 data centers simply lack the scale and sophistication to compete with the leading AI companies like CoreWeave Coreweave ( CRWV ). Figure 11 - HIVE quarterly revenues breakdown ( Company Reports ) As a comparison, CoreWeave saw revenues increase 420% YoY to $982 million in the most recent quarter (Figure 12)! Figure 12 - CRWV saw revenues explode to nearly $1 billion in latest quarter ( Investor Presentation ) Frankly (pun intended), it is embarrassing for HIVE to even mention HPC/AI as a separate business unit, given its lack of scale. Risks To Being Cautious In my opinion, the only upside to HIVE is the hope for a surge in Bitcoin prices. If Bitcoin prices were to rise materially in a short period of time, Bitcoin miners may be able to enjoy bonanza profits, like they did in 2021/2022, when the price of cryptocurrencies rose much faster than the difficulty of mining them, leading to positive profitability (Figure 13). Figure 13 - HIVE was only profitable briefly in 2021/2022 (Seeking Alpha) Conclusion HIVE's recently reported Q4/2025 earnings do not change my mind on the poor economics of the Bitcoin mining business. Simply put, Bitcoin mining is a mug's game where every player is on a treadmill to increase capacity, driving up overall industry difficulty and reducing Bitcoin production. Except for brief stretches when Bitcoin prices rise faster than difficulty, Bitcoin mining is a net negative NPV activity. I continue to advise long-term investors to avoid HIVE and its peers.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797688-hive-digital-underwhelming-q4-continue-to-avoid?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED","HIVE|HIVE:CA",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T09:05:09,"Both Good and Bad News for Bitcoin (BTC) from Analysts! ""There is a Risk of a Major Crash, But….""","Bitcoin (BTC) rose to $107,000 from $100,000 at the beginning of the week following news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. While there is uncertainty in the market about which direction BTC will move next, Katalin Tischhauser, Head of Investment Research at Sygnum, made important statements. Speaking to CoinDesk, Katalin Tischhauser argued that Bitcoin is unlikely to crash without unexpected black swan events like the Terra or FTX crash. Arguing that there will be a long-term bull cycle unless such a black swan event occurs, Tischhauser said: “The crypto market is strongly sentiment-driven. Therefore, technical analysis signals such as double tops warrant caution. However, a full-fledged collapse needs a swansong like the Terra collapse or the FTX explosion in 2022. Barring a similar black swan, we could see a prolonged bull cycle based on current political and regulatory support and sticky institutional capital flowing in.” Double Top Risk in Bitcoin! Bitcoin has been stuck between $100,000 and $110,000 in recent weeks, prompting analysts to speculate that Bitcoin’s uptrend is exhausted and that the trend could reverse to a bearish double-top pattern. The double top formation is interpreted as a sign that prices will switch from an uptrend to a downtrend. At this point, analysts like Katalin Tischhauser and Peter Brandt think that Bitcoin could form a double top pattern above $100,000. But Tischhauser also thinks a major crash is unlikely unless there is a black swan event like the one in 2022. Although such a big drop seems unlikely for BTC, if a double top pattern forms, it could mean that BTC could fall 75% from its peak to $27,000. At this point, Peter Brandt pointed out in an analysis he made at the beginning of the month the potential for a double top pattern to form and a 75% correction to occur. According to the pattern, a double top at $ 110,000 was taken as the basis, and a low level of $ 75,000 was taken before the second top. In this context, according to analysts, if BTC breaks below $ 75,000, this means that a double top pattern has formed and could lead to a 75% drop from the peak. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-27T09:03:12,"Why is crypto down today : SOL, XRP and memecoins plummet amidst Bitcoin dominance rise","The crypto market is experiencing a downturn as major tokens like Bitcoin, XRP and Solana plummet, with the SOL ecosystem and PayFi sector both dropping over 4%. Why is crypto down today? According to data from CoinGecko, the overall market cap for crypto has fallen by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. It currently stands at $3.39 trillion. The drop is reflected by many of the major tokens experiencing a decline in the past day of trading. Traders are now left wondering why is crypto down today. So far, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained mostly steady compared to other tokens. At press time, BTC dipped by 0.4%. It is currently trading hands at $107,355. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) has dropped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours to a value of $2,447. However, the biggest drops can be seen in Solana ( SOL ) and XPR ( XRP ). In the past 24 hours, XRP fell by 4.2%. It has experienced the worst fall compared to the other tokens ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. Solana comes in second place after XRP, having fallen by more than 2.5% in the past trading day. Meanwhile, smaller tokens like Ethena ( ENA ) specifically has dropped by 5%, as it trades near the $0.25 threshold. Pressure from Germany’s BaFin ordering a 42-day redemption after stopping sales of Ethena’s stablecoin USDe (USDE) in March, bringing it near the $0.21 support area. You might also like: What to expect in the week ahead for the altcoin market: BTC, BERA, INJ and more Adding to Solana’s price drop, the Solana ecosystem has also experienced a decline. According to data from SoSoValue, the Solana ecosystem sector fell 4.24% in 24 hours. Within the sector, Solana and Jupiter ( JUP ) both fell 4.12% and 4.94% respectively. Meanwhile, the PayFi sector followed suit with a 4.03% decline. On the other hand, the memecoin sector has suffered a 3.91% drop, with major tokens like SPX6900 ( SPX ) experiencing corrections. Out of the top 10 memecoins by market cap, SPX has taken the worst dive by 10.21% in the past day. Meanwhile, top three tokens like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and Pepe ( PEPE ) only saw modest corrections of 2.31%, 3.27% and 3.24% respectively. Why is crypto down today? Today’s crypto market dip seems to be driven by underlying market fears and technical bearish indicators. Although the crypto market cap has dropped, the overall crypto trading volume has remained in the green. This could indicate that traders are selling more tokens amidst the decline instead of holding on for the long haul. The answer to why is crypto down today lies in the current geopolitical state of the world which shows no signs of cooling down anytime soon. Despite recent news of a ceasefire that brought Bitcoin above and beyond the $105,000 mark, investors are taking profits and staying cautious amid upcoming macroeconomic events like the Fed rate decision. In addition, analysts have noted that BTC has entered a critical supply zone at around $108,000 to $110,000, with indicators like RSI and MACD signaling cooling momentum to the current cycle. This could explain why is crypto down today, considering Bitcoin dominance has climbed above 65%.

Instead of rushing up with wild price swings, things seem calm and steady. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan says this shows the market is cooling, not overheating — and that could be a healthy sign. At the same time, crypto traders are watching $108,500 closely, and even big names like Coinbase are now buying BTC every week. Is this the calm before Bitcoin’s next breakout? Analyst: No Signs of Panic or Hype According to CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan , Bitcoin’s trading volume is showing signs of cooling. He shared a bubble chart that helps explain this — big circles mean high trading volume, and the colors show how fast the volume is changing. Right now, the bubbles show the market is calm. There’s no sharp increase in buying or selling, which means people aren’t acting out of fear or greed. Instead, this steady pace may mean Bitcoin is building a stronger base before its next move. Bitcoin: Cooling Without Overheating “Currently, Bitcoin is near its all-time high, but the market shows a cooling trend without signs of overheating.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/5CTYft5SZl — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 27, 2025 Even though Bitcoin is holding near its all-time high, Crypto Dan believes it might still need some outside help to break higher. Things like interest rate cuts or clearer crypto regulations could be the boost it needs. Traders Are Watching $108,500 Level Adding bullishness to the sentiment, Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe says Bitcoin is resting now but could jump higher soon. He says the small pullback is normal and not a reason to worry. Meanwhile, this sideways move can help Bitcoin gather power to break through the big resistance level at $108,500. If that level is broken, many traders expect Bitcoin to shoot up quickly, possibly reaching $110,000 or more, just like it has done in the past when it cleared major hurdles. Coinbase Is Buying Bitcoin Every Week While things may look quiet on the surface, big players are taking action. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently said the company is buying Bitcoin every week. He also told his followers to “go long” on Bitcoin, which means holding it for the long run. We're buying more Bitcoin every week. Long #Bitcoin https://t.co/LleWBXGYTG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 26, 2025 Coinbase now holds nearly $995 million worth of Bitcoin, making it the 10th-largest company with BTC holdings.

2025-06-27T09:00:22,"Kakaopay shares rally ends after stablecoin warning","South Korea remains one of the strong crypto regions, making a return in 2025. Despite this, Kakaopay is facing headwinds on its stablecoin adoption. South Korea is facing a resurgence of interest in crypto, reviving older projects and stablecoin usage. However, regulatory pressures are curbing some of the growth, especially when it comes to stablecoin issuers. Recently, the shares of Kakaopay broke their 2025 rally, coming down from their peak. Kakao Pay Corp. traded at a peak of 93,800 KRW ($69.17), recently dropping to the equivalent of $62.09. The shares lost 15% in a single day after the company received warnings on its own attempts to use stablecoins. The stablecoin narrative boosted the share price by 200% in June, before the recent setback. Kakao Pay Corp. broke its rally, after regulators warned fintech and crypto companies may not have an advantage in issuing stablecoins. | Source: Google Finance Kakaopay was seen as the potential leader, benefitting from the new South Korean legislation on stablecoins. The news of a potential setback arrived after Kakaopay had filed a patent for a Korean won stablecoin, selecting the ticker KPKRW. The new requirement tying stablecoins only to commercial banks, however, means crypto companies will not have an advantage in launching the digital won. The expectation of having a new Kakao-based stablecoin also boosted KAIA, the native token of Kakao’s new chain. KAIA rallied to a three-month high above $0.20, recently taking a step back to $0.17. The South Korean market is more conservative, offering a predominance of fiat trading pairs. The ability to mint stablecoins remains limited, as South Korea’s central bank warned about the rushed unrolling of new assets. In the country, stablecoins can only be issued by licensed commercial banks, limiting the venue for DeFi projects and unregulated crypto-backed stablecoins. Kakopay was considered one of the first potential issuers of a stablecoin. However, for South Korean companies, combining fintech with stablecoin payments is not as straightforward as in other regions. Despite this, South Korean investors were still keen on the stablecoin narrative. In the past month, Circle (CRCL) became the most widely purchased foreign stock in the country, with $443M from Korean retail. Kakao’s ecosystem still uses stablecoins for decentralized activities. Kaia chain carries $106M in bridged stablecoins, mostly USDT for decentralized transactions. Kaia’s stablecoins are used in other regions, with no limitations for on-chain tokens outside South Korea. South Korea remains a crypto powerhouse in 2025 South Korean exchanges logged over $663B in trades for the year to date. The country remains one of the sources for retail adoption, with 22.6% to 30% penetration rate among regular users and retail traders. The Korean Won still carries around 1.8% of BTC trading and over 2.5% of ETH volumes. The country’s exchanges also have a marked effect on altcoins, often following Upbit and Bithumb listings. South Korean traders also draw attention to an entirely different selection of altcoins compared to other markets. The country remains a factor in reviving demand and providing use cases for multiple platforms from previous bull markets. With more conservative listing requirements, South Korean exchanges were not overwhelmed by a wave of memes, still providing liquidity for a shorter list of assets.

2025-06-27T09:00:19,"Deaton Says Ripple IPO Could Trigger $100B Valuation, How High Will The XRP Price Be?","The possibilities of a Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO) have become higher as time goes on and the company moves toward a complete resolution of its SEC lawsuit. With expectations of the IPO rising, possible valuations have started to fly around as the company is one of the largest cryptocurrency companies. Most notably, pro-XRP lawyer and community member John Deaton has proposed that the Ripple IPO could lead to the company being valued at over $100 billion. Deaton Puts Ripple At $100 Billion The comment and valuation from lawyer John Deaton come after Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, successfully completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO). So far, the crypto firm has found a lot of success in the market, surging from an initial $5 billion valuation to over $63 billion in valuation post-IPO. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Deaton responded to a post on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting this feat, pointing out how Ripple could be even more successful in this regard. He explains that despite Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse saying that the company was in no rush to go public, the IPO should be timed correctly to have the right impact. Pointing to the current market environment, he points out that if Circle can grow to a $63 billion valuation, then it means that Ripple can soar even higher. Given XRP’s standing in the market as the 4th-largest cryptocurrency, ahead of Circle’s USDC, which sits at 7th place, Deaton believes that Ripple’s valuation post-IPO can rise to $100 billion. “If Circle can hit a 62B-75B market cap then Ripple, with nearly 40B XRP, currently valued at $2 (ie $80B), could certainly hit a $100B market cap in this environment,” Deaton wrote. As Bitcoinist reported, Ripple had issued a $700 million tender offer with shares priced at $175. This now puts the equity valuation of the company at $25 billion with 141 million outstanding shares as investors look favorably at the crypto firm. How High Could The XRP Price Go? Market experts have speculated that if the Ripple IPO does go through and the valuation soars, the XRP price will soar in tandem. Crypto investor Dennis Liu shared a video that suggested a successful IPO would be positive for the XRP price. He points out that a symbiotic relationship of the XRP coin related to the Ripple stock would be the dream of investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align Other market experts have debated that the XRP price would go double-digits to rise above $10 if this happens.

Altcoin market (TOTAL2) is holding key Fibonacci support and showing early signs of accumulation. A BTC dominance breakdown could trigger a wave of capital rotation into altcoins, fueling an altcoin season. After two years of a powerful uptrend, Bitcoin’s dominance over the crypto market may be about to turn.

2025-06-27T08:57:25,"Private Key and Front End Exploits Lead Crypto Thefts in 2025","The majority of the thefts were driven by private key compromises and front-end exploits, which together accounted for more than 80% of stolen funds across 75 incidents. These highly targeted attacks very often involve social engineering and infrastructure vulnerabilities, and they have become much more more damaging, averaging nearly $30 million per breach. A $1.5 billion hack on Dubai-based exchange Bybit, linked to North Korean state actors, was the largest single incident and contributed to nearly 70% of total losses. Geopolitical tensions have also entered the crypto security space, with groups like the pro-Israel hacker collective Predatory Sparrow targeting Iranian exchanges. In the DeFi sector, Resupply lost $9.6 million in a price manipulation exploit involving synthetic assets. Meanwhile, British hacker Kai West was indicted in the US for selling stolen data through BreachForums, raking in millions in Bitcoin and Monero. Crypto Theft Soars in 2025 Crypto-related cyberattacks surged to unprecedented levels in the first half of 2025, which resulted in a staggering $2.1 billion in losses. This is according to a new report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. The majority of these losses stemmed from private key exploits and front-end compromises, which together made up more than 80% of the value stolen across 75 separate incidents this year. These infrastructure-based attacks, which include compromising a user’s private seed phrase or exploiting vulnerabilities in a crypto platform’s interface, have proven to be particularly damaging as they typically net hackers ten times more value than other forms of cyberattacks. (Source: TRM Labs ) TRM Labs explained that these kinds of attacks leverage core weaknesses in cryptosystems and are frequently exacerbated by social engineering tactics that are designed to manipulate users. In addition to infrastructure breaches, protocol exploits were another key threat vector. These attacks, like flash loan exploits and re-entrancy vulnerabilities, accounted for 12% of total losses during the period and target the underlying smart contracts or logic of a blockchain protocol to steal money or destabilize operations. The scale of theft in H1 2025 already exceeds the previous half-year record that was set in 2022 by approximately 10% and is almost equal to the entire year’s total for 2024. A major driver of this year’s record-breaking losses was a $1.5 billion hack on the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit , which was attributed to North Korean state-backed hackers. That single incident represents around 70% of total funds stolen so far in 2025 and pushed the average hack size to nearly $30 million. This is double that of the previous year. State actors and politically motivated hacking groups seem to be playing a larger role in these attacks. TRM Labs pointed to the pro-Israel hacker collective Gonjeshke Darande , also known as Predatory Sparrow, which has possible links to the Israeli government and was responsible for a $100 million exploit on Iran’s largest exchange, Nobitex, in June. The report frames this escalation as a “pivotal shift” in the landscape of crypto hacking, where geopolitical intent increasingly underpins malicious activity. To address this mounting threat, TRM Labs called for a comprehensive overhaul of crypto security practices. This includes implementing multifactor authentication, using cold storage for funds, conducting regular audits, and enhancing detection of insider threats and social engineering attempts. More broadly, the firm pointed out that there is a need for international cooperation between law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, and blockchain analytics firms. According to TRM Labs, the first half of 2025 should serve as a wake-up call for the industry. Resupply Hit by $9.6M DeFi Exploit Unfortunately, crypto crime is showing no signs of stopping. Resupply, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, recently confirmed a security breach in its wstUSR market that led to $9.6 million in losses. The exploit was the result of a price manipulation attack involving a synthetic stablecoin called cvcrvUSD. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers , the attacker inflated the share price in the ResupplyPair contract to borrow $10 million in reUSD using minimal collateral. The funds, initially sourced through Tornado Cash, were converted to Ethereum and distributed across two addresses. In response, Resupply paused the affected contracts and stated that only the wstUSR market was compromised. The protocol plans to release a full post-mortem after completing its investigation. Cyvers’ CTO Meir Dolev believes that the attack could have been avoided with better input validation, oracle checks, and real-time anomaly monitoring. This incident is part of the list of DeFi exploits in 2025. Hackers have increasingly shifted to social engineering, which was the case in a $2 million Bedrock UniBTC exploit in 2024 linked to a former Fuzzland employee who used insider access and supply chain attacks to carry out the breach. UK Hacker Busted for Selling Stolen Data Meanwhile, British national Kai West was recently indicted by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for allegedly operating under the alias “IntelBroker” and selling stolen data on cybercrime forums, leading to over $25 million in damages. West is accused of conspiring with a cybercriminal group known as CyberN***ers to hack into and steal data from more than 40 companies, including a telecom provider, a municipal healthcare system, and an internet service provider. (Source: US Attorney’s Office ) The charges stem in part from an undercover law enforcement operation where an agent purchased stolen credentials from IntelBroker for $250 in Bitcoin. The data included administrative-level usernames and passwords. West allegedly offered data stolen in these breaches for sale for over $2 million and was active on the notorious BreachForums platform between January of 2023 and February of 2025. He was reportedly responsible for at least 158 threads advertising stolen data, 41 of which involved companies based in the United States. Sixteen of those posts contained explicit price listings, amounting to at least $2.4 million. West also accepted payments in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero. According to authorities, his activity on BreachForums escalated to the point where he was identified as the platform’s owner starting in August 2024. He was arrested in France earlier this year, and US authorities are now seeking his extradition. Law enforcement officials, including former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia, placed a lot of emphasis on the severity of the crimes. Raia described West as a “serial hacker” who profited millions from illicit activities. The case now adds to a growing list of high-profile cybersecurity incidents, including a recent breach affecting Coinbase . That incident involved the unauthorized access of customer data by overseas support agents, which led to a $20 million extortion attempt.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9728/private-key-and-front-end-exploits-lead-crypto-thefts-in-2025,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Security",cryptocompare

This massive H1 quarterly delivery represents 30% of the total current positions.

However, the put-call ratios reveal bullish sentiment across both assets. Bitcoin shows a 0.74 ratio with maximum pain at $102,000, while Ethereum displays a 0.52 ratio with maximum pain at $2,200. Both cryptocurrencies currently trade well above their respective pain points, with BTC at $107,555 and ETH at $2,452. Source: Cryptonews This expiration significantly exceeds the previous 2025 events. Bitcoin contracts jumped from 33,972 last week to 139,390 today, while Ethereum surged from 224,509 to 938,551 contracts. The scale exceeded April’s $8.05 billion, which was previously the year’s largest event. Massive BTC and ETH Expiring Options Drive Market Positioning Strategy The sheer volume of expiring contracts accounts for over 30% of total open interest, a concentration rarely seen in crypto derivatives markets and one that historically precedes significant price movements. Bitcoin’s dominance in the expiration is particularly striking, with 139,000 contracts carrying $15 billion notional value compared to last week’s modest 33,972 contracts. This four-fold increase is due to the monthly nature of June 27 expiries, which aggregate positions built throughout the quarter rather than weekly accumulations. The maximum pain theory suggests both assets face gravitational pull toward their respective strike prices. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin’s $102,000 max pain sits significantly below current $107,555 levels, while Ethereum’s $2,200 target lies below $2,452 trading prices. This divergence typically creates downward pressure as market makers hedge their exposures. Put-call ratios reveal contrasting sentiment structures despite overall bullish positioning. Source: IntoTheBlock Bitcoin’s 0.59 ratio indicates moderate call dominance, while Ethereum’s 0.46 ratio shows stronger bullish conviction. However, implied volatility patterns diverge sharply, with BTC hovering below 35% while ETH maintains elevated levels of 65%. Notably, block trading activity has also intensified dramatically in the 48 hours preceding expiration. Source: CoinGlass Deribit recorded $1.4 billion in large-scale call transactions, with institutional players actively repositioning ahead of the deadline. This volume surge indicates that investors are preparing for potential volatility rather than simply riding out the expiration. The timing coincides with Bitcoin’s fourth attempt to establish $108,000 as support after recovering from levels below $100,000. Technical analyst Rekt Capital recently identified this as a crucial transitional period, noting that weekly closes above $104,400 will determine whether Bitcoin enters its next price discovery uptrend or faces an extended period of consolidation. Institutional Flows Show Mixed Long-Term Outlook Institutional activity surrounding today’s expiration reveals conflicting signals as traditional finance entities embrace crypto treasury strategies while short-term positioning suggests caution ahead of potential volatility. Bitcoin’s institutional narrative strengthens despite near-term uncertainties. Most recently, billionaire Philippe Laffont included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40” list of top investments for the next five years, projecting that the market capitalization could exceed $5 trillion by 2030. He admitted to previously overlooking Bitcoin as a store of value. Billionaire @plaffont has included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40,” his list of top investment opportunities for the next five years. #Bitcoin #Crypto https://t.co/9rwMC189FE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 Similarly, Bakkt, a cryptocurrency exchange, has filed for a $1 billion shelf registration with the SEC , earmarking the proceeds for Bitcoin acquisitions under its updated treasury strategy. However, despite these institutional activities, immediate market dynamics present challenges. Recent CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin miner revenues fell to $34 million daily , the lowest since April 20, driven by reduced transaction fees and price pressure. Despite this stress, miners increased reserves from 61,000 to 65,000 BTC between March and June, indicating long-term confidence. Ethereum faces more complex institutional positioning, with SharpLink Gaming being the recent accumulator of 12,207 ETH , valued at $30.6 million. @SharpLinkGaming becomes world's largest public $ETH holder with $30.6 million purchase, bringing total holdings to 188,478 $ETH worth $457 million. #SharpLink #ETH #Treasury https://t.co/wxbXBFSe5T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The company now holds 188,478 ETH worth approximately $457 million, representing the largest publicly traded Ethereum position. Spot ETF flows provide additional context for retail sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs recently recorded eleven consecutive inflows of $588 million , while Ethereum ETFs recorded weekly inflows of $205 million at the same time. This retail interest contrasts with institutional selling, creating complex cross-currents in Ethereum markets. The technical outlook remains pivotal for both assets.

2025-06-27T08:52:30,"Best crypto presales to buy now as positive signs emerge for crypto ETF approvals","Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $107,000 on Friday, just 4% below its all-time high, as the cryptocurrency continues to consolidate near key technical levels. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) are also approaching significant resistance zones, and a breakout from these levels could trigger renewed buying interest across the broader market. BTC fell to a daily low of $98,200 on Sunday amid heightened geopolitical tensions but managed to avoid a daily close below the psychologically important $100,000 mark. The cryptocurrency rebounded sharply on Monday and extended its gains through midweek, closing above $107,000 on Wednesday and holding steady since. At the time of writing, Bitcoin remains near $107,000. If the rally continues, a test of the May 22 all-time high of $111,980 appears likely. A decisive close above that level could pave the way for further upside, with the next target potentially near $120,000. As Bitcoin edges closer to new all-time highs, retail investors are increasingly turning to speculative tokens like Bitcoin Pepe , which is now in the final phase of its presale. With momentum building across the crypto market, capital is rotating into early-stage projects as traders seek high-risk assets with the potential for outsized returns. Bitcoin Pepe has emerged as a key beneficiary of this shift, drawing attention from investors looking to capitalize on asymmetric upside opportunities. Good signs of DOGE ETF The proposed spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) appears to be making progress, with increasing engagement between issuers and US regulators raising optimism around potential approval. Recent filings show that Bitwise Asset Management has submitted amended applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its proposed spot Dogecoin and Aptos (APT) ETFs. Bitwise, one of the earliest firms to seek approval for a Dogecoin ETF back in January , is now revising its application in response to ongoing discussions with the SEC. The amendments come shortly after the SEC announced a delay in its review of Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF, citing the need for additional time to evaluate whether the product complies with regulatory standards. A notable update in the revised filings is the introduction of “in-kind” creation and redemption mechanisms—absent from the original application. This feature allows ETF shares to be exchanged directly for the underlying asset, enhancing tax efficiency and potentially reducing market impact. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas called the amendment a “huge update,” viewing it as a positive development that reflects broader momentum for spot crypto ETFs. Eric Balchunas @EricBalchunas · Follow Bitwise has filed amended S-1s for their spot Dogecoin ETF and their spot Aptos ETFs.

Bitcoin Pepe’s momentum continues The potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF would mark a significant step forward for the altcoin and meme coin segments, bringing increased visibility and institutional legitimacy to a category often dismissed as purely speculative. Such recognition could help shift broader market perceptions, creating room for technically ambitious projects like Bitcoin Pepe to gain traction. Positioned as an infrastructure-driven meme coin, Bitcoin Pepe seeks to “build Solana on Bitcoin” by combining the base-layer security of Bitcoin with the scalability associated with Solana. This approach distinguishes it from typical meme tokens that rely solely on community hype. To support its Layer 2 ambitions, the project has announced several strategic partnerships, including Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. Together, these initiatives are aimed at reinforcing the project’s technical foundation while introducing real-world utility for the token, key factors that set it apart in a crowded and often speculative market. Bitcoin Pepe ’s ongoing presale has raised over $15.9 million, with the BPEP token currently priced at $0.0437. According to the project team, BPEP is set to be listed on BitMart and MEXC, with an additional listing announcement scheduled for June 30.

Van de Poppe’s Detailed Analysis Van de Poppe opened with a stark observation : Not long ago, Bitcoin dipped below $100,000, sending shockwaves across the broader crypto landscape. Altcoins were hit even harder, with many printing all-time lows or revisiting cycle bottoms. He attributes the crash to escalating geopolitical turmoil, which acted as the primary destabilizer. Drawing a parallel to the COVID-19 crash, when BitMEX liquidations briefly sent Bitcoin to $3.7K, he noted that in both cases, fear-driven news events triggered mass sell-offs.

2025-06-27T08:30:26,"Senate Targets September for Passing Landmark Digital Asset Market Structure Bill","U.S. Senator Tim Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, announced plans to advance legislation on digital asset market structure by the end of September, signaling renewed urgency in shaping the crypto regulatory landscape. Speaking during a “fireside chat” with Senator Cynthia Lummis and White House crypto adviser Bo Hines on Thursday, Scott emphasized that a clear market framework is necessary for the crypto market to function effectively in the United States. “For the market to function completely, we need to move forward with legislation for market structure and stablecoins,” Scott stated, setting a September 30 target for passing the bill. In support, Senator Lummis assured, “You’re the chairman, and we will do as you wish. We will make sure that we’re ready to do that,” reflecting strong committee alignment on advancing the crypto agenda. Lummis Pushes Forward with Crypto Legislation At the Bitcoin Policy Summit a day prior, Lummis noted she would be “extremely disappointed” if key legislation like the GENIUS Act and market structure bills were not enacted before 2026. The GENIUS Act, designed to guide stablecoin innovation in the U.S., has cleared the Senate but awaits action in the House of Representatives. As of June, neither chamber has scheduled a floor vote on comprehensive market structure legislation. The timeline shared by Scott and Lummis may differ from President Donald Trump’s push for swift crypto legislative action. On June 18, Trump called on the House to pass the GENIUS Act and deliver it to his desk “ASAP,” reflecting the administration’s prioritization of stablecoin regulation. CLARITY Act in Senate Focus Lummis expressed her intent to draft market structure legislation before the August recess, aiming for a September markup. She highlighted that the Senate may look at the House’s Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) as a reference point for crafting its version. The CLARITY Act, which passed out of committee in June, aims to clarify which digital assets qualify as securities under SEC oversight or as commodities under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The proposed legislation is intended to establish clear guidelines for digital asset firms , fostering legal clarity that could drive institutional adoption while maintaining consumer protections. If successful, the bill could become a foundational pillar for the United States in regulating and fostering growth within the crypto sector.

2025-06-27T08:29:11,"ETH outperforms BTC amid geopolitical tensions but one top crypto is beating all","Global markets are reeling from geopolitical unrest, with Israeli airstrikes on Iran triggering a 4.7% Bitcoin (BTC) drop to $103,300 and Ethereum (ETH) dipping to $2,694. Yet ETH has surged 40% over three months outpacing BTC as institutional investors pour $1.25 billion into ETH ETFs since mid-May. Meanwhile Singapore’s new crypto regulations are tightening forcing offshore exchanges like Bitget to comply by June 30. Amid this volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the best crypto to buy now, with its presale in Phase 5 drawing intense interest. Investors are flocking to its $0.03 token price, promising a 100% return at launch. Ethereum’s resilient surge Ethereum (ETH) is showing remarkable strength despite market turbulence. Geopolitical tensions, including recent Middle East conflicts, sparked a crypto sell-off, yet ETH’s 40% quarterly gain remains robust. Institutional interest fuels this momentum, with ETH ETFs attracting $1.25 billion since mid-May. ETH’s dominance is climbing to nearly 10%, signaling a shift toward DeFi and AI-focused altcoins. Bitcoin, meanwhile, saw its dominance slip by 2-3 percentage points. Crypto prices today reflect this divergence as ETH trades at $2,404.82, up 6.95% daily. Consequently, ETH’s resilience highlights its appeal in a volatile crypto market. However, another token is stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out, having raised $11,200,000 since its presale began, with over 570 million tokens sold to 12,500 holders. Furthermore, its robust infrastructure aligns with Singapore’s push for transparency, positioning it as a top crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance. Its presale is blazing through Phase 5, currently over 50% filled at $0.03 per token—a 200% increase from Phase 1’s $0.01. With the listing price of 0.06, you will be looking at a 100% ROI at launch, and a post-launch estimation of 2.50 once in 2025, making the hypothetical maximum possible gain by 8,233%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a two-L body that integrates peer-to-conract and the peer-to-peer lending systems into a dynamic, safe lending environment. In addition, it has a non-custodial protocol, which means users are in control of the assets, and it is different to centralized platforms. This utility drives its appeal in the crypto market. Security and scalability at Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust and growth. The team has finalized a CertiK audit, earning an 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. Active monitoring and moderate social media engagement bolster transparency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, fully collateralized to resist depegging risks. Additionally, its Layer 2 strategy aims to slash gas fees and boost scalability. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. In addition, a $100,000 giveaway is underway, splitting prizes among 10 winners who invest $50 in the presale. Why Mutuum Finance shines bright As crypto prices fluctuate, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as the best crypto to buy now. Phase 5’s $0.03 price is a fleeting opportunity, with over 50% of tokens already claimed. Phase 6 will raise the price to $0.035, a 16.7% jump, making now the moment for savvy investors. The project’s audited contracts, innovative lending, and stablecoin plans signal long-term potential. Unlike BTC and ETH, which face geopolitical pressures, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers stability and utility. Investors are joining 12,500 holders to secure tokens before the launch.

2025-06-27T08:27:58,"The FCA must reassess its stance on digital asset ETPs—now | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. It’s often said that good regulation should promote disruption, not inhibit it; however, the FCA’s stance towards digital asset ETPs has remained stubbornly conservative and set in its ways for the last decade. As things stand, the FCA currently prohibits UK retail investors from accessing digital assets through regulated, exchange-traded products, ETPs. The reasons cited are well known and can essentially be summarised as the following: challenges related to assessing their true value, high prevalence of cybercrime, extreme volatility associated with these speculative assets that people are poorly equipped to understand, and lastly, there’s no legitimate investment need for cryptocurrencies. You might also like: The UK has to get its crypto house in order | Opinion While the aforementioned reasons may have held weight ten or even five years ago, as digital assets enter the mainstream and over 500 million people use them around the world for reasons beyond mere speculation, these arguments look increasingly out of date. For one thing, the criticism that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and are hard to effectively value applies to many traditional asset classes (early-stage venture capital, art, and commodities) that face comparable challenges when trying to judge their value. However, these are still accessible to retail investors. Often overlooked but no less important is that, unlike the aforementioned traditional assets, cryptocurrencies, particularly those with established utility or monetary properties, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), have transparent, auditable supply mechanisms and globally liquid markets that support valuation frameworks based on adoption, scarcity, and usage. Critics have, since its inception, pointed out how bitcoin and digital currencies can be used for nefarious means. Indeed, my first encounter with Bitcoin came in 2011 when, at GCHQ, I saw it being applied for criminal transfers. While that may have been true over a decade ago, the authorities have cottoned on to its potential use, and illicit activity in cryptocurrency markets has declined and is often more traceable due to the blockchain’s transparency. Major ETPs operate on regulated exchanges with institutional-grade custodians and compliance measures. Cryptocurrency transfers, by definition, leave a signature that can be monitored, unlike suitcases filled with cash, which can be transported without any electronic trace or potential for monitoring. Alongside their speculative nature, critics cite the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, while this is undeniably true, volatility exists across many retail-accessible asset classes, such as leveraged ETFs or EM equities. Volatility and its accompanying risks don’t on their own merit exclusion from retail investors, especially when access is through diversified and professionally structured ETPs with transparent risk disclosures. A fairer and more addressable criticism is the lack of education and understanding on how to invest in these products by retail customers. Without proper knowledge on how to store assets, check accredited exchanges for purchasing assets, and ensure data is properly managed, consumers are vulnerable to scams and errors that can be costly. Investor education should, for this reason, be a regulatory priority, not a reason for exclusion. Many retail investors routinely allocate to complex products (structured notes, options, etc.) under regulated advice or self-direction. Crypto ETPs offer a familiar, regulated wrapper for exposure, simplifying access and removing custody and technical barriers, thereby improving—not reducing—investor understanding. At Bitwise, we currently work with CFA and directly with the allocator community to improve education for both retail and institutional investors. The final and most used criticism of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general is that it’s a “solution in search of a problem” and that there’s no legitimate investment need. Defining that constitutes a “legitimate need” is highly paternalistic and inconsistent with free-market principles. Retail investors may seek portfolio diversification, long-term growth, or a hedge against monetary debasement—all of which cryptoassets can potentially provide. The demand is clear: UK investors already access crypto through offshore platforms, often at greater risk. It’s clear that the current status quo from the FCA is untenable; 7 million retail investors/users exist in the UK alone, and they can currently only access offshore platforms and unregulated products where corporate governance and compliance levels vary hugely. This technology has proven itself to be more than just a fad; it is now pervasive throughout every sector and industry globally. Digital Assets and blockchain technology sit at the nexus of multiple mega trends such as the digitisation of money, Agentic AI, energy grid optimisation, and tokenization of real-world assets. Retail investors are right to want to support the Web3 economy and future growth of these markets; the FCA should provide them the guidelines and protection they’re crying out for.

The cryptocurrency market was in the midst of a brutal bear market , with Ethereum having crashed from its November 2021 peak of over $4,800. The ride has been anything but smooth since then. Ethereum continued falling before eventually clawing its way back, even touching above $4,000 in 2024. How much ETH would you have now? Those 8.38 ETH tokens you bought for $10,000 three years ago are worth $20,490 today, a profit of $10,490, or a 104.9% return. Not bad, but it depends on what you’re comparing it to.

2025-06-27T08:21:33,"Top DeFi coin of summer 2025? This $0.03 underdog is leading the race","A new chapter is unfolding in the DeFi space as investors shift their focus to platforms offering real utility, sustainable income, and flexible risk exposure. With lending protocols dominating headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping into the spotlight as one of the most talked-about DeFi entrants of 2025. At just $0.03 per token, it is attracting investors eager to get in early before the next price jump. Phase 5 of the presale is already 50% sold out, and with a higher price coming in Phase 6, this will be the final window to secure MUTM at a discounted rate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining crypto lending by introducing a two-pronged model that caters to both conservative capital and high-risk digital assets. With a beta platform launch scheduled for release alongside the token going live and a $100,000 giveaway rewarding early believers, Mutuum is pushing on all fronts to lead DeFi innovation this summer. Because of the utility embedded in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) many meme investors are finally waking up. After losing money to coordinated dumps or low-liquidity coins, they’re asking, “Where’s the actual value?” That’s where Mutuum Finance steps in. It’s not just a token—it’s a fully audited DeFi platform that pays users to lend and hold. Early-phase buyers from $0.01 to $0.03 have seen up to 3x profits, and with beta launching soon and exchange listings expected, the next wave of serious investors is now watching MUTM for at least 100% gain from here. P2C or P2P? Mutuum lets you choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate through two core models—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—providing unmatched lending flexibility. The P2C model will target blue-chip assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Users will deposit these tokens into audited smart contracts, generating mtTokens in return. These yield-bearing mtTokens will accumulate interest and can later be redeemed for the original assets plus earnings, subject to liquidity. Interest rates will be automatically adjusted based on pool utilization, rewarding suppliers when demand rises. As usage increases, lenders will see their returns climb, establishing a self-balancing cycle that ensures capital efficiency and protocol health. Meanwhile, Mutuum’s P2P model will serve more speculative tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Here, lenders and borrowers will set custom terms, including interest rates and loan durations. With no shared pool, lenders can charge higher rates in exchange for taking on more risk. This model expands lending access for non-traditional assets while preserving P2C liquidity by isolating volatility. Both lending formats will be overcollateralized and governed by a Stability Factor metric to protect all positions. If the collateral value dips too low, the system will automatically initiate liquidation, safeguarding lender funds and keeping the ecosystem solvent. Why investors are jumping on MUTM at $0.03 MUTM isn’t just another utility token. It will serve as the backbone of the Mutuum ecosystem, powering staking rewards and protocol revenue redistributions. Users who stake mtTokens in designated contracts will receive MUTM dividends when the platform performs buybacks using revenue from loan interest. This system will directly link token demand to platform usage, locking in real yield for long-term supporters. Layer-2 infrastructure will further enhance Mutuum’s offering by delivering fast, cost-efficient transactions. The integration of a decentralized stablecoin—minted only through overcollateralized borrowing—will inject even more stability and capital efficiency. As borrowers repay or get liquidated, the stablecoin supply will shrink automatically, reducing risk and supporting peg maintenance. Governance will dynamically control borrowing interest rates, ensuring that price fluctuations are managed without relying on external parties. As the roadmap progresses toward the beta launch, over 12,450 holders have already joined the ecosystem. With more than $11.2 million raised, audit scores from CertiK that include a 95.00 Token Scan and 76.50 Skynet Score, and an engaged 10K+ Twitter following, momentum is building fast. The giveaway—offering ten early participants $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each—adds even more urgency to act now. MUTM is not just a presale token; it’s a full-fledged DeFi engine in the making. Those who move early stand to gain not only from the launch itself but from continued income through dividends, platform rewards, and sustained ecosystem growth. The $0.03 price tag won’t last long, and with the next phase around the corner, the summer of 2025 will belong to Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

Accordingly, Bakkt may purchase Bitcoin (BTC) after the $1 billion shelf offer is presented. At this point, Bakkt aims to raise up to $1 billion through various securities issuances that can be used to finance the purchase of Bitcoin. Since Bakkt has filed Form S-3 with the SEC to issue securities in one or more issues, with the number, price and terms determined at the time of the issuance, with the total issuance not to exceed $1 billion. This process, called shelf registration, allows Bakkt to quickly issue bonds and buy Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies with them when the right conditions are met. “…We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources…” Bakkt’s move comes after it updated its investment policy earlier this month to allow it to buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies.

(BTCT), a provider of institutional lending and liquidity services, said it bought 292.80 bitcoin BTC for C$43 million ($31.6 million), launching an accumulation strategy aimed at building a robust digital asset treasury. The Toronto-based company said it viewed bitcoin as both a long-term reserve asset and a crucial part of its revenue model, planning to use the holdings to support its institutional loans business. With the $125 million raised from a recently completed brokered share offering and any income resulting from the BTC purchase, Bitcoin Treasury aims to deliver institutional-grade services tied to the digital asset economy. It said it will focus on disciplined risk management and creating shareholder value as it positions itself as a leader in bitcoin-backed financial solutions. The company's shares are set to begin trading on the TSX Venture Exchange on June 30, following its reverse takeover of 2680083 Alberta Ltd . Shares of the merged entity were first listed at C$10 on Thursday with an immediate halt applied by the exchange. Although neither BTCT nor 268 shares were listed previously, the merger is a corporate shortcut that lets BTCT become a public company without a traditional IPO, using 268 as a private shell vehicle set up specifically for this purpose. The offering involved multiple financial institutions including Canaccord Genuity, Stifel, National Bank Financial Markets, BMO Capital Markets, and CIBC Capital Markets.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/27/bitcoin-treasury-corporation-acquires-292-btc-prepares-for-toronto-trading-debut,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Finance|TSX|Digital Asset Treasury|Share sale|Loans|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T08:06:20,"Crypto News Today : Friday’s Bitcoin, Ethereum Options Expiry Could Trigger a Volatility Storm","The post Crypto News Today : Friday’s Bitcoin, Ethereum Options Expiry Could Trigger a Volatility Storm appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The second quarter of 2025 has been kind to Bitcoin. Since April 1, the market leader has climbed 30.2 % , buoyed by a 14.2 % gain in April, an 11.1 % jump in May, and a further 2.6 % rise so far in June. The rally carried price from $104,544 at the start of the month to about $107,370 today, briefly tagging new cycle highs near $107 K. Period Price Change April 2025 +14.2 % May 2025 +11.1 % June-to-date +2.6 % Q2-to-date +30.2 % Crypto Market Today Spot price drifts into Thursday night. A slow slide toward $102 K would hint that option sellers are steering the market. Liquidity at $105 K. A gap in buy orders below that level raises the odds of a swift downdraft. Post-expiry snap-back. Once $15 B in hedges disappear, a sudden volatility spike up or down is common. Friday’s $15 B Options Expiry According to Deribit’s Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David Pequignot , one of the year’s biggest expiries hits the tape this Friday. Roughly $15.2 B in BTC options 38 % of the entire $40 B open interest, will settle at once. The “max-pain” level, where the highest number of contracts expire worthless, sits at $102,000. Prices often drift toward this magnet because market makers who sell options profit most if Bitcoin lands there at expiry. Sentiment and Volatility Tell a Mixed Story Options data still leans cautiously bullish: Put/Call ratio: 0.73 , meaning there are 73 puts for every 100 calls—more calls signal an upside tilt. Implied volatility: down sharply from 50 % to 38 % , suggesting traders expect smaller price swings in the near term. [post_titles_links postid=”475533″] Yet those expectations can change quickly when billions in contracts roll off. $105 K: The Line in the Sand Technical traders are laser-focused on $105,000 . It has acted as first-line support throughout June: Hold above $105 K: Bulls retain control; a post-expiry relief rally toward $110 K or higher stays on the table. Break below $105 K: Sentiment could flip in a hurry, with price gravitating toward the $102 K max-pain zone and triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders. Bottom Line Bitcoin’s 30 % quarter has impressed even hardened bulls, but the real test comes with Friday’s mega-expiry. Stay alert, whether BTC defends $105K or succumbs to max-pain gravity will likely set the tone for the rest of the summer. [article_inside_subscriber_shortcode title=”Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!” description=”Stay ahead with breaking news, expert analysis, and real-time updates on the latest trends in Bitcoin, altcoins, DeFi, NFTs, and more.” category_name=”News” category_id=”6″] FAQs What is a Bitcoin options expiry and why does it matter for prices? A Bitcoin options expiry is the date when options contracts (the right to buy or sell Bitcoin at a set price) terminate. It matters because large expiries often trigger increased volatility as traders close positions and prices can be “pinned” to the max-pain level, where most contracts expire worthless. How do market makers impact Bitcoin prices around options expiry? Market makers aim to minimize their losses from options contracts they’ve sold. They achieve this by strategically buying or selling Bitcoin to steer its price towards the “max-pain” level at expiry, where their net payout from options is lowest. How might upcoming options expiries shape Bitcoin’s volatility this summer? Upcoming expiries, especially large ones like Friday’s $15.2 billion event, could cause significant short-term price swings. The unwinding of hedges and market makers’ actions around “max-pain” points are likely to dictate periods of heightened volatility throughout the summer.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-news-today-fridays-bitcoin-ethereum-options-expiry-could-trigger-a-volatility-storm/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T08:03:22,"Bitcoin is the sixth-largest asset worldwide","The top digital currency, Bitcoin, surpassed Google in market capitalization and is currently the sixth-largest asset worldwide. Bitcoin is now valued at $2.128 trillion, beating Google at only $2.075 trillion, and ranking just below Gold, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. BTC’s growing adoption has contributed to the rise in its market cap Bitcoin saw its market cap rise following the massive institutional adoption after the launch of spot ETFs . The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s ETF approval triggered significant capital inflows from institutional players worldwide. As of June 9, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest BTC exchange-traded fund on the market, had pulled in over $70 billion in t otal assets, growing more quickly than any other ETF. Fidelity’s FBTC ranked second with $20 billion, and Grayscale’s GBTC came in third with just under $20 billion. President Donald Trump’s support for Bitcoin has propelled the asset’s status and driven adoption. During his campaign days, he hinted at a Bitcoin reserve, which he signed an executive order on when he assumed office. He also signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile. Analysts now believe BTC could easily surpass $200,000 in the next few years. If this growth trend continues, Bitcoin could approach—or even overtake—Microsoft and Nvidia, and become the largest asset of all time, especially if the US maintains a pro-Bitcoin approach. In the Bitcoin Magazine podcast in April, Zach Shapiro, the head of policy for the Bitcoin-focused BPI think tank, argued that a US government purchase of 1 million BTC would significantly affect the asset’s price. He said, “If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoins, that’s just a global seismic shock. I think first, Bitcoin price goes through the roof. I think we’d probably go very quickly to something like a million dollars per Bitcoin.” BPI executive director Matthew Hines also claimed that other countries are watching closely to see how the US approaches Bitcoin before shaping their policies. Hines added that the Trump administration’s desire to make the US the BTC superpower will hinge on how much Bitcoin they’ll hold. The UK’s CMA is investigating Alphabet, focusing on Google’s search and ad services Alphabet is grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny, antitrust probes, and a dip in its digital ad earnings. The company is also dealing with fierce competition from its AI-focused rivals, threatening to upend the dominance of AI-driven ad tools like Performance Max and its generative search summaries. Google is still under antitrust investigations in the UK and the EU. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently reviewing Google’s search and advertising services under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 to determine whether the company should be granted Strategic Market Status (SMS). The CMA’s roadmap includes early priorities such as requiring choice screens for users to access various search providers, ensuring fair ranking principles for businesses, enhancing publishers’ content transparency, and enabling consumer data portability to foster innovation. Meanwhile, the European Union is also looking into AI overviews under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), claiming they favor Google-owned content and divert traffic from third-party websites. According to an Ahrefs study, AI overviews caused nearly a 35% dip in organic website clicks, possibly lowering publishers’ ad revenue. If the EU finds fault with AI overviews and Google, the tech giant could be penalized and obliged to pay fines. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-27T08:00:52,"World Liberty Financial Receives $100 Million from UAE Crypto Investment","A fund based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced a significant investment of $100 million in the Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform World Liberty Financial, and its native token WLFI. The investment was confirmed in a joint statement by Aqua 1 and World Liberty Financial, highlighting the collaboration as a step towards developing a blockchain financial ecosystem and integrating stablecoins. World Liberty Financial Partners With Aqua 1 Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, “We’re excited to work hand-in-hand with the team at Aqua 1.” This investment positions Aqua 1 among the largest stakeholders in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency project. It is further strengthened by the backing of crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is the top investor in the company with a substantial $75 million stake. Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move — Chart Signals Are Clear This marks the second investment from a UAE-based firm in World Liberty Financial within a short span; earlier this year, Abu Dhabi’s MGX used World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance. David Lee, a founding partner at Aqua 1, stated that Aqua 1 and the decentralized platform will collaborate to “identify and nurture promising blockchain projects.” World Liberty Financial also plans to support the Aqua Fund, an investment vehicle focused on enhancing the digital economy in the Middle East. In addition, Aqua 1 will aid World Liberty Financial in expanding its reach into South America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. Both companies are also set to develop “BlockRock,” a platform aimed at tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) to bridge traditional investments like real estate with the Web3 ecosystem. New App Launch Planned In tandem with these initiatives, World Liberty Financial is preparing to release an audit report of its stablecoin, USD1, within days. Folkman, speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, New York, also mentioned that the platform’s WLFI token may soon become tradable. Launched two months prior to the US presidential election, WLFI has already generated substantial revenue for Trump’s family business through the sale of governance tokens. These tokens grant holders the ability to vote on project changes and influence its strategic direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer While WLFI is currently not tradable, Folkman hinted at forthcoming updates that users should watch for in the coming weeks. He also revealed that the company’s stablecoin has received its first attestation report, which will be available on the company’s website. To further facilitate user engagement, Folkman announced the upcoming launch of a new app designed to simplify cryptocurrency use for everyday investors. As of press time, the official TRUMP memecoin trades at $8.96, recording a major 30% drop in the monthly time frame.

2025-06-27T08:00:43,"‘An Opening For India’: BJP’s National Spokesperson Calls For Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Pilot","The national spokesperson for India’s ruling party has suggested that the country should explore a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve pilot and proactively work on a regulatory framework for crypto assets to lead the growing industry and strengthen its economy. Politician Pushes For Bitcoin Reserve Pilot On Thursday, Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), urged the Indian government to explore a Bitcoin strategy to strengthen the country’s economy and project innovation. In an article for India Today, Bhandari praised the US efforts to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, exploring budget-neutral options to expand its holdings without using taxpayers’ money. He highlighted the US states’ race to pass crypto legislation and establish reserves. Notably, three states have already passed bills that allow the creation of a BTC reserve, with some, such as Texas, enabling the use of public funds to purchase and hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Similarly, Arizona recently passed a bill that updated the state’s unclaimed property laws to include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, technically creating Arizona’s first crypto reserve. He also noted Bhutan’s crypto strategy, mining BTC using hydropower since 2021, offering a regional perspective. Notably, the South Asian country amassed a $1 billion Bitcoin reserve by May 2025. BJP’s national spokesperson considers that the US shift and Bhutan’s strategy invite reflection about how BTC, thoughtfully integrated, could enhance India’s economic toolkit. “For India, observing this offers a lens to assess whether Bitcoin could diversify our reserves, complementing traditional holdings in an uncertain global economy,” the article reads. Meanwhile, he suggested that the country, with its renewable energy capacity, could adapt Bhutan’s successful model, which shows that “digital assets can stabilise economies, a point worth considering.” Crypto Regulatory Reform: A Must According to Bhandari, these measures “reflect a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential to bolster fiscal resilience and serve as a hedge in uncertain economic conditions,” adding that these efforts aren’t a “reckless pivot,” but a “calculated step” toward embracing the legitimacy of digital assets. Therefore, India stands at “a pivotal juncture,” having the opportunity to lead global markets with a “measured Bitcoin strategy,” like a reserve pilot, to “strengthen economic resilience and project modernity.” Nonetheless, he explained that regulation in the country remains pivotal as India’s crypto policy needs clarity to unlock the industry’s potential. Notably, authorities tax crypto assets, but the sector remains highly unregulated. BJP’s national spokesperson pointed out that in 2023, India chaired a crypto working group with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to shape global standards. However, he considers it necessary to “race ahead” like the US and other jurisdictions, instead of pausing for consensus. Clear regulation could bring both transparency and the required oversight to this emerging asset class—enabling responsible innovation while protecting a rising investor class. He concluded that regulation is essential for “fostering institutional confidence and building a framework where Bitcoin can play a meaningful role in India’s macroeconomic strategy.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/an-opening-for-india-bjps-national-spokesperson-calls-for-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-pilot/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Bhutan Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Adoption|Bitcoin reserve|Bitcoin Strategy|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto regulation|India crypto regulation|Indian politician|Startegic Bitcoin Reserve",cryptocompare
