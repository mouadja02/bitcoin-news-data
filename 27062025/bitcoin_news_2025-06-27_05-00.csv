This legal update immediately impacted the market, causing the price of XRP to drop to $2.09 before recovering slightly to around $2.10. The token saw a 5% dip following the news. XRP Price Prediction XRP’s overall price trend still leans bearish. The coin continues to make lower highs and lower lows, a pattern that signals weakness in the market. While small price jumps can happen even in a downtrend, a proper trend reversal would require XRP to start forming higher lows and eventually break past previous highs. JUST IN: Judge Torres has denied @Ripple and the @SECGov joint motion for an indicative ruling. pic.twitter.com/iPzD4aMG1H — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 26, 2025 At the moment, XRP is struggling to break through an important resistance zone between $2.19 and $2.20. If the price does manage to move above $2.20 with a strong daily close, the next target area would be around $2.30 to $2.35. A breakout past this point would signal a much stronger bullish trend and could open doors for a rally towards $2.60. Can XRP Price Dip Below $2? On the downside, the key support zone to watch is between $2.05 and $2.10. If XRP falls below this, the next support would be around $1.92 to $1.95. Right now, momentum remains weak, with short-term gains appearing within a generally bearish market structure. For this bullish scenario to stay intact, XRP needs to hold above the $2.08 support area. If the price drops below this, it increases the risk of the market making a fresh low. If that happens, the focus would shift to the bigger support level around $1.79. At the moment, while Bitcoin has already shown signs of forming five waves up, XRP has yet to do the same. Until clearer signs of strength appear, experts are watching for signs of support holding and any move that could lead to a fifth wave upward.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-as-judge-torres-blocks-ripple-sec-motion/,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T02:30:50,"Unveiling Bitcoin RSI: Why PlanB’s Astute Analysis Calms Crypto Market Fears","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Bitcoin RSI: Why PlanB’s Astute Analysis Calms Crypto Market Fears Are you feeling a slight tremor of concern as Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) climbs? For many traditional investors, an RSI hitting 70 often signals an ‘overbought’ asset, typically followed by a price correction. But what if the rules for the volatile and exciting crypto market are different? Renowned analyst PlanB, famous for his Stock-to-Flow model, recently took to X to share a crucial perspective that might just put those worries to rest. Understanding Bitcoin RSI: Is 70 Really Overbought? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between 0 and 100. Traditionally, an RSI reading above 70 suggests an asset is overbought, while a reading below 30 indicates it’s oversold. These are often seen as signals for potential reversals. However, PlanB’s latest insight challenges this conventional wisdom when applied to Bitcoin. He pointed out that while a 70 RSI might raise eyebrows in traditional finance, it’s quite a normal occurrence for Bitcoin. Why? Because Bitcoin typically operates within a much broader RSI range, historically trading between 40 and 90. This makes the current level of 70 only slightly above its historical average of 65. This critical piece of PlanB analysis suggests that applying traditional metrics without considering Bitcoin’s unique market dynamics can lead to misinterpretations. Why Does Bitcoin Behave Differently? Exploring Unique Market Dynamics Bitcoin isn’t your average stock or commodity. Its inherent volatility, driven by factors like halving events, global macroeconomic shifts, rapid technological adoption, and evolving regulatory landscapes, contributes to its distinct RSI behavior. Here are a few reasons why Bitcoin’s RSI might differ: Rapid Price Discovery: Bitcoin is still a relatively young asset class, undergoing rapid price discovery. Periods of intense buying pressure can sustain high RSI levels for longer than traditional assets. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply shock events (halvings) often precede parabolic bull runs, during which the asset can appear ‘overbought’ for extended periods as demand outstrips supply. Global Accessibility: Unlike many traditional markets, Bitcoin trades 24/7 globally, leading to continuous price action that can sustain momentum. Investor Psychology: The unique blend of retail and institutional investor sentiment in crypto can lead to prolonged buying frenzies that defy traditional ‘overbought’ indicators. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors So, what does this mean for you, the everyday Bitcoin investor? It means looking beyond simplistic indicators and understanding the broader context. Here are some actionable insights: Context is King: Don’t just look at the RSI number; understand where Bitcoin is in its market cycle (e.g., pre-halving, post-halving, accumulation phase). Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s historical performance shows that even after periods of high RSI, significant upside has often followed. A long-term holding strategy often outperforms short-term trading based on single indicators. Diversify Your Analysis: While RSI is a valuable tool, combine it with other indicators like moving averages, volume trends, and on-chain metrics to get a more comprehensive picture. Avoid Panic Selling: The fear of an ‘overbought’ asset can lead to premature selling. PlanB’s perspective helps mitigate this fear by contextualizing the current RSI level. Challenging the ‘Overbought Bitcoin’ Narrative The idea of an overbought Bitcoin at an RSI of 70 is largely a narrative carried over from traditional markets. In equity markets, an RSI of 70 often suggests that a stock’s price has risen too quickly and is due for a pullback. However, Bitcoin’s parabolic growth phases have frequently seen its RSI sustain levels well into the 80s and even 90s before any significant correction. This resilience to traditional ‘overbought’ signals is a hallmark of Bitcoin’s unique market behavior and highlights the importance of crypto-specific analysis. PlanB’s consistent focus on Bitcoin’s long-term value and unique market dynamics provides a calming perspective amidst short-term market fluctuations. His emphasis on the historical trading range of 40-90 for Bitcoin’s RSI reminds us that what might seem alarming in one market is perfectly normal in another. This understanding empowers investors to make more informed decisions, reducing the likelihood of reacting to false signals and staying focused on the asset’s potential. The Future of Investor Sentiment in the Crypto Market As the crypto market matures, the sophistication of its analysis must evolve. Relying solely on traditional indicators can be misleading. PlanB’s latest commentary serves as a powerful reminder that Bitcoin operates under its own rules, influenced by unique supply-demand dynamics, technological advancements, and a passionate global community. Understanding these nuances is key to navigating the exciting yet volatile world of digital assets. By embracing a crypto-native analytical approach, investors can better gauge true market health and make decisions aligned with Bitcoin’s unique trajectory.

2025-06-27T02:20:52,"US Stock Markets Soar: What This Positive Open Means for Crypto","BitcoinWorld US Stock Markets Soar: What This Positive Open Means for Crypto The financial world is buzzing today as US stock markets opened with a noticeable upward momentum, a development that often sends ripples across various investment sectors, including the dynamic realm of cryptocurrencies. As the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all registered positive gains, investors are keenly observing what this bullish start signifies for broader investor sentiment and, crucially, its potential implications for digital assets. For many in the crypto community, understanding the interplay between traditional finance and the decentralized world is key to navigating market volatility and identifying emerging opportunities. Let’s delve into the specifics of today’s market open and explore its wider economic ramifications. What’s Driving the US Stock Markets Rally Today? Today’s trading session commenced on a high note, with all major US stock markets indices showing promising gains right from the opening bell. The S&P 500, a benchmark for large-cap U.S. equities, climbed by +0.37%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite, often a barometer for growth stocks and innovation, saw a respectable rise of +0.31%. Not to be outdone, the venerable Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant American companies, posted a gain of +0.28%. These figures, while modest, paint a picture of renewed confidence and positive buying pressure. This upward movement suggests a prevailing optimism among investors, perhaps fueled by recent corporate earnings reports, economic data, or shifting macroeconomic expectations. Such an immediate positive reaction at the market open often sets the tone for the rest of the trading day and can indicate a broader shift in market psychology. Decoding Investor Sentiment: Why Does a Strong Open Matter? A strong market open , particularly across major indices, is more than just numbers; it’s a powerful indicator of prevailing investor sentiment . When markets open higher, it often reflects a collective belief among participants that economic conditions are favorable, corporate profits will continue to grow, or that anticipated challenges are manageable. This positive outlook can create a virtuous cycle, encouraging more investment and further bolstering asset prices. Conversely, a weak opening can signal apprehension or a lack of confidence. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, tracking traditional market sentiment is vital because, despite their distinct characteristics, crypto markets often mirror the risk appetite seen in equities. When traditional investors feel confident enough to buy stocks, they might also be more inclined to allocate capital to higher-risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, perceiving the broader economic outlook as stable enough to support such ventures. This interconnectedness highlights the importance of keeping an eye on the bigger financial picture. The Crypto Correlation Conundrum: How Connected Are We? The relationship between US stock markets and the cryptocurrency space has been a subject of intense debate. Historically, Bitcoin, often seen as “digital gold,” was thought to be an uncorrelated asset, acting as a hedge against traditional market volatility. However, recent years have shown an increasing crypto correlation with major equity indices, particularly the NASDAQ. When tech stocks rally, often so do cryptocurrencies, and vice versa. Today’s positive stock market opening could, therefore, be interpreted as a bullish signal for crypto. Why this correlation? As institutional adoption of crypto grows and more traditional investors enter the space, digital assets are increasingly treated as risk-on assets, much like growth stocks. This means that factors influencing traditional equities—such as interest rates, inflation, and global economic stability—can also impact crypto prices. While the correlation isn’t always perfect, a robust performance in traditional markets often creates a favorable environment for crypto, signaling a broader willingness to take on risk across the investment landscape. It’s a reminder that while crypto offers unique value propositions, it doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Navigating the Economic Outlook: What’s Next for Markets and Crypto? Today’s positive market open certainly paints an encouraging picture for the immediate future, but what does it mean for the broader economic outlook and its long-term implications for both traditional finance and cryptocurrencies? A sustained upward trend in stock markets typically suggests underlying economic strength, perhaps driven by strong employment figures, contained inflation, or a dovish stance from central banks. For crypto, this can translate into continued investor confidence and potentially higher capital inflows. However, investors must remain vigilant. The global economy is a complex web, influenced by geopolitical events, regulatory shifts, and technological advancements. While a positive start is welcome, factors like persistent inflation, potential interest rate hikes, or unexpected global events could quickly shift the narrative. Therefore, while today’s gains are a reason for optimism, a prudent approach involves closely monitoring upcoming economic data, central bank announcements, and significant news events. Understanding these broader macroeconomic forces is crucial for making informed decisions, whether you’re trading stocks or digital assets, as they all contribute to the overarching investor sentiment . Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor: Monitor Macro Trends: Don’t just watch crypto charts. Keep an eye on traditional market performance, inflation data, and interest rate announcements. They significantly influence risk appetite. Diversify Wisely: While correlations exist, maintaining a diversified portfolio across different asset classes (including a mix of traditional and digital assets) can help mitigate risks. Stay Informed: News from major economies, particularly the US, can directly impact global market sentiment. Being aware of these developments helps in anticipating market shifts. Assess Risk Appetite: A rising tide lifts all boats, but be prepared for potential pullbacks. Understand your own risk tolerance before making significant investment decisions. In conclusion, today’s strong market open in US stock markets provides a significant boost to overall investor sentiment , reflecting a generally positive economic outlook . While not a direct predictor, this upward trajectory often fosters a more favorable environment for the cryptocurrency market, highlighting the growing crypto correlation . As traditional and digital financial worlds become increasingly intertwined, understanding these connections is paramount for any investor seeking to navigate the complex yet opportunity-rich landscape. The current positive momentum serves as a reminder that the broader financial ecosystem plays a crucial role in shaping the future of digital assets.

2025-06-27T02:00:34,"Bitcoin Weak Hands Exit While Smart Money Loads Up –  Is A Breakout Near?","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its steady climb toward its all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 recorded in May 2025, the cryptocurrency is witnessing a notable shift in its holder composition. New on-chain data suggests that BTC “weak hands” are selling their holdings to larger investors. Bitcoin Moving Upstream From Weak Hands To Big Money According to a recent Cryptoquant Quicktake post by contributor IT Tech, Bitcoin’s supply is moving upstream from retail investors to larger holders. This movement denotes a fundamental shift in the investor sentiment toward the largest digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern? Analyst Sees Path To $137,000 Retail investors – those holding less than one BTC – have seen a significant reduction in their holdings, with total balances dropping by 54,500 BTC year-over-year (YoY), to 1.69 million BTC. On average, this cohort has experienced outflows of approximately 220 BTC per day. In contrast, large holders – wallets with 1,000 BTC or more – have expanded their total BTC exposure by 507,700 BTC over the same period, bringing their combined holdings to 16.57 million BTC. This group is now seeing average inflows of around 1,460 BTC per day. Institutional interest in Bitcoin also continues to rise at a historic pace. Notably, institutions are currently absorbing about seven times more BTC than retail investors are selling. At the same time, the post-halving issuance of BTC is currently hovering around 450 BTC a day, raising the possibility of a true “supply squeeze” amid strong buying pressure. To recall, BTC underwent its latest halving in April 2024, when the mining reward for each block on the chain was slashed from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. In their commentary, IT Tech noted that meaningful retail interest has yet to kick in during this cycle. Unlike previous market tops – where retail investors aggressively accumulated BTC – current data shows them exiting the market, suggesting that the bull run may still have more room to grow. Another metric that points toward the market top being far from the current price level is the Bitcoin 30-day MA Binary CDD. In a recent analysis, CryptoQuant contributor Avocado_onchain noted that the BTC market is “far from overheating.” BTC Short-Term Holder Floor Approaching $100,000 As BTC remains range-bound between $100,000 and $110,000, the short-term holder (STH) realized price – a key psychological support level – is steadily climbing. It currently sits near $98,000, reflecting rising investor conviction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised For Rally As Geopolitical Tensions Ease And Inflation Expectations Fall Further on-chain data also shows that both retail and institutional holders are reducing exchange deposits, signalling reluctance to sell at current levels.

2025-06-27T02:00:20,"The $323M Crypto Project Building in Silence: Why BlockDAG’s Six-Week Countdown Could Change Crypto!","In crypto, timing is more than buying low and selling high. It is about recognising the moment just before quiet progress turns into public acceleration. With BlockDAG (BDAG) , that shift has not happened yet. And that is what makes the current window so important. The six-week rollout plan outlined in BlockDAG’s roadmap is detailed and structured. Each week brings new functionality, from staking and mining to DeFi tools and exchange listings. It is a sequence built to drive utility before price discovery. But the key detail is this. The countdown has not started. Those entering now are ahead of every major milestone, before token circulation, before staking closes, and before DeFi activation changes the pace. Inside BlockDAG’s Six-Week Rollout Plan BlockDAG’s six-week countdown is not a placeholder. It is a structured execution plan designed to deliver real network value ahead of listings. It begins with the end of the presale, the start of staking, and the conversion of all X1 and TAP points into BDAG coins. Wallet migration also finalises at this point, preparing users for on-chain participation. As the countdown continues, the mainnet goes live. Production infrastructure, including high-performance ASIC miners, becomes active while tokens remain non-tradable. In the third week, decentralisation takes hold with the launch of community-run nodes and mining pools, allowing early participants to secure the network pre-listing. By Week 2, 40% of presale tokens are airdropped. At the same time, the full DeFi stack launches, including the DEX, bridge, oracle services, lending features, and the launchpad. This culminates in listing week, which opens with a lead exchange before expanding across more than nine platforms. Every phase builds function before exposure, setting up a foundation for lasting network value. The Importance of Getting In Before the Clock Starts This early phase is not just about getting a better price. It is about locking in strategic positioning. With the current limited-time offer at $0.0030 and only for a few days until the increase to $0.0080, participants are entering ahead of visibility acceleration. The confirmed $0.05 listing puts the return window at 1500%, a rare setup in any presale cycle. But the real edge lies in what is already happening behind the scenes. Over 2 million users are actively mining BDAG using the X1 app, creating sustained engagement before trading begins. More than 18,000 ASIC miners have been sold. Deliveries for the X30 and X100 models begin July 7, with X10 units shipping by August 15. Demand is rising well ahead of liquidity. BlockDAG has sold 23.2 billion BDAG coins and raised $323 million toward its $600 million goal. That capital is being deployed to build a structure, not just fuel speculation. It’s an ecosystem already under construction, building momentum before it ever hits exchanges. A Network That Exists Before the Token Trades Unlike projects that debut a token before anything works, BlockDAG is taking the opposite route. Its testnet is live and functional. Developers can deploy EVM-compatible smart contracts, build dApps using a no-code interface, and test ecosystem tools without needing coins in circulation. This reverses the typical flow seen in Layer 1 launches. Infrastructure is going live first. Trading comes later. This structure mimics the early success paths of Bitcoin’s initial mining model, Kaspa’s DAG architecture, and Solana’s validator-driven rollout. But BlockDAG brings all of it into one combined framework, streamlining early access through mobile apps, miner rigs, and developer grants. Crypto Market Snapshot BlockDAG has designed its rollout to favour early movers, not momentum chasers. The testnet is active, miner adoption is rising, and no-code dApps are already being built. Decentralised mining pools are ready, and real builder activity is underway. But marketing campaigns, exchange volume, and token liquidity have yet to begin. That is exactly what makes this phase so powerful. In crypto, the advantage comes from owning infrastructure before it becomes the headline. BlockDAG still offers that window. But once the six-week countdown begins, the early edge fades, and the rush to catch up begins.

2025-06-27T01:46:49,"Bakkt files for SEC shelf registration amid the growing interest in crypto","The publicly traded crypto custody and loyalty rewards firm Bakkt plans to raise $1 billion in an equity and debt offering to support a “Bitcoin strategy”. This is according to filings submitte d to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, June 26. The shelf offering could consist of sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities. The shift would be the latest strategic change for Bakkt. However, according to the SEC filing , the firm has not yet made any crypto purchases. Bakkt files for SEC shelf registration amid the growing interest in crypto Bakkt submitted a filing to the SEC through a “shelf” registration process. With this shelf registration, the firm can occasionally sell any mix of the securities mentioned in the prospectus in one or more offerings. The filing stated that Bakkt may sell securities occasionally through one or more offerings, with amounts, prices, and terms decided at the time of each offering. This prospectus outlined the basic terms of these securities and how the firm will offer them. According to the filing, the total price for the securities Bakkt sells will not go over $1 billion. The SEC also required the company to include the price they would pay for those securities and the amount of money they expected to make from the sale. This came after Bakkt said it had “updated” the investment policy to specifically allocate capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets as part of its treasury and corporate strategy on June 10. Founded in 2018, Bakkt is now an emerging crypto treasury firm that allows investors to make a leveraged bet on digital assets such as Bitcoin, ETH, and SOL by financing digital asset purchases in the traditional capital markets. Earlier, the Atlanta-based firm, which started with backing from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) owner Intercontinental Exchange, offered an institutional-grade trading platform for daily physically-settled Bitcoin futures before trying to tokenize rewards points and crypto custody. This product failed to gain traction. The company went public in 2021. Meanwhile, Bakkt’s initial Chief Executive Officer, Kelly Loeffler, resigned in 2019 to briefly serve as a Republican United States senator in Georgia under the first Trump administration . Moreover, President Donald Trump’s social media company, Truth Social, was said to be in “advanced talks” to acquire Bakkt last November. Bakkt officials highlight the firm’s focus on crypto Following the announcement that Bakkt had “updated” the investment policy, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, stated that this plan aims to help Bakkt change into a company that focuses solely on crypto infrastructure and allows them to add Bitcoin and other digital assets to their treasury carefully. According to Naheta’s speculations, their strategy shows their strong belief in the future of digital assets and their goal for Bakkt to grow globally and become a leader in programmable money. Andy Main, Co-CEO and President of Bakkt, also commented on the topic of discussion. According to him, their updated investment policy shows their confidence in digital assets’ long-term potential and dedication to seeking strategic opportunities that increase shareholder value. Main said this is a significant step for the company as it looks to expand into global payments and remittance systems using stablecoins while being part of the ongoing development of the digital asset ecosystem.

2025-06-27T01:45:26,"Brian Armstrong declares weekly Bitcoin buys as Coinbase hits All-Time High","Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, has publicly declared that they buy Bitcoin weekly, reaffirming his bullish stance on the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The announcement on X (formerly Twitter) came as Coinbase shares hit an all-time high of $375.07, surpassing its previous record from November 2021. The comment suggests Armstrong and his company’s strong belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. On multiple occasions, Armstrong has suggested that Bitcoin’s price could someday go into millions of dollars. Armstrong also suggested it won’t be long before nations start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheets , a shift that could redefine global demand and establish the asset as a player in world politics. Some dismissed it as overly speculative, but others pointed out that countries like El Salvador and the Central African Republic have already moved in that direction. Whether symbolic or strategic, Armstrong’s consistent Bitcoin purchases reflect a growing trend among crypto leaders and institutional investors who see BTC as a hedge against inflation, currency volatility, and systemic risk. Market confidence drives Coinbase to a new peak Coinbase Global Inc. shares closed at the highest level ever, capping off a rally fueled by the growing acceptance of the cryptocurrency industry on Wall Street and Washington. The crypto-exchange operator’s stock rose 5.5% on Thursday to $375.07. The previous high was $357.39 in November 2021, just months after the company went public through a direct listing. Coinbase shares have surged more than 1,000% from a record low in late 2022, which came as the collapse of FTX raised questions about the future of digital assets. The stock’s comeback occurred as cryptocurrency prices rebounded and the industry won powerful new allies, including US President Donald Trump. Just last month, Coinbase was added to the prestigious S&P 500 Index . This extraordinary revival comes after a dark period in the crypto industry. FTX and other heavyweights crashed in 2022, leading to the absurdly high skepticism rate about digital assets. Few of the largest exchanges were left unscathed, and Coinbase was one of the few that didn’t get whacked, leaving it as a safe player in a chaotic industry. Now, renewed optimism is back. Institutional capital is moving in, retail traders are coming back, and financial giants like BlackRock and Fidelity are plowing ahead with crypto products. Coinbase recently joined the S&P 500 Index, a sign of increasing legitimacy in traditional finance. Analysts say the wider recovery in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices and greater regulatory clarity are helping lift investors’ confidence in Coinbase. The exchange’s various revenue streams, including trading fees, custody services, and institutional partnerships, have also contributed to its stock performance. US lawmakers boost crypto sentiment with policy shift The return of Coinbase also coincides with growing regulatory clarity and political support of digital assets in the United States. Washington is warming to crypto after years of hostility and uncertainty. Legislation on the horizon on stablecoins and clearer signals from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are also helping the sector lay down the law. Bipartisan backing in Congress has added fresh momentum to bills that could provide transparency and oversight, particularly in critical functions including custody, staking, and decentralized finance. President Donald Trump has publicly supported crypto innovation, unlike previous administrations. Under his rule, there has been a huge policy expansion in the domain of crypto, such as creating a crypto reserve for the country. Coinbase, a longtime advocate for reasonable regulation, has been one of the most vocal in communicating with legislative staff and regulatory agencies. And it is paying off. Investors, analysts, and crypto enthusiasts these days see Coinbase as not just an exchange but also a bridge between the digital economy and the traditional financial system.

After dipping to $0.142 on Sunday, the meme coin has climbed back above $0.16. Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities According to market watchers, this bounce off long-term support could set the stage for a much bigger move, possibly as soon as July. Chart Pattern Points To Support Analysts have noted that Dogecoin’s slide to $0.142 fits neatly into a rising pattern of higher lows. Based on analysis, the dip hit a multi-year trendline that first showed up in October 2023. At that time, prices fell to a similar zone before reversing. Once Dogecoin found footing, it moved into an ascending channel, forming a steady string of higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart. $DOGE $1 https://t.co/KgAc4sZ2LN — WIZZ🥷 ( beware scammers ) (@CryptoWizardd) June 24, 2025 July Could Be The Launchpad Meanwhile, crypto analyst WIZZ have predicted that Dogecoin’s next leg up could begin in July. If the current support holds, they argue, DOGE may pick up speed and push toward the wedge’s tip and hit $1. The analyst’s chart shows a potential rally to $1.40, which would mark a 740% jump from today’s levels and blow past the $1 mark that many have eyed for years. Multiple Forecasts Add Fuel To The Debate This isn’t the first time experts have set sights on $1 for Dogecoin. Galaxy Research put the $1 target on its radar before the end of 2025. Javon Marks, in his own analysis, sees DOGE breaching $1.25 by riding a bullish continuation pattern. Other analysts have called for a 500% surge after a falling-wedge breakout in March. $0.6533 for $DOGE with a high likeliness of a break above, bringing $1.25+ into play!

Long-Term Risks Dogecoin’s recent turn higher adds about 10% to its weekly lows, and it’s up roughly 5% over the last weekly session, trading near $0.166. But critics point out that DOGE lacks the fundamental backing of tokens that power major networks. Its price moves largely on community enthusiasm and hype. If Bitcoin or the broader crypto market cools off, Dogecoin could see sharper drops than more established assets.

2025-06-27T01:20:13,"Urgent: U.S. GDP Contraction in Q1 2025 Misses Forecasts – What It Means for Your Portfolio","BitcoinWorld Urgent: U.S. GDP Contraction in Q1 2025 Misses Forecasts – What It Means for Your Portfolio The financial world is abuzz with the latest revelation: the U.S. economy has hit a snag. In a surprising turn of events, the U.S. GDP contracted by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2025, a stark deviation from the anticipated 0.2% decline. This crucial economic indicator, meticulously tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, serves as a vital barometer for the nation’s financial health. For investors, particularly those navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets, understanding this economic contraction is paramount. It’s not just a number; it’s a signal that could reshape investment strategies and market sentiment as we move deeper into Q1 2025 and beyond. Understanding the Startling U.S. GDP Contraction in Q1 2025 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. It’s the broadest measure of economic activity. The recent data, which revealed a 0.5% decline in the U.S. GDP for Q1 2025 , marks a significant reversal from the robust 2.4% expansion observed in the previous quarter. This final estimate confirms a cooling, if not outright shrinking, of economic activity. To put this into perspective, consider the recent trajectory: Quarter U.S. GDP Growth (Annualized Rate) Market Expectations Q4 2024 +2.4% (Expansion) Met/Exceeded Q1 2025 -0.5% (Contraction) -0.2% (Missed) This negative shift indicates that the American economy produced fewer goods and services than it did in the preceding three months, signaling a slowdown that could have far-reaching implications for businesses, consumers, and global markets. Why Did the Economy Miss Market Expectations So Significantly? The fact that the U.S. GDP contracted more than analysts had predicted is a key point of concern. Market expectations are typically based on a myriad of economic indicators, forecasts, and sentiment analyses. When the actual figures diverge so sharply, it suggests underlying weaknesses that may have been underestimated. Several factors likely contributed to this steeper-than-expected decline: Slowing Consumer Spending: As the backbone of the U.S. economy, a deceleration in consumer purchases of goods and services can significantly drag down GDP. Factors like persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and waning consumer confidence could be at play. Reduced Business Investment: Companies might be scaling back on investments in new equipment, software, and structures due to uncertainty about future demand, higher borrowing costs, or supply chain disruptions. Government Spending Adjustments: Changes in federal, state, and local government expenditures can also impact GDP. A reduction in government projects or aid could contribute to a slowdown. Net Exports Fluctuation: The balance between exports and imports plays a role. If imports significantly outpace exports, it creates a drag on GDP. Global economic slowdowns can impact demand for U.S. goods. Inventory Adjustments: Businesses might be reducing their inventories, which can temporarily reduce GDP even if final sales remain stable. The confluence of these elements created a perfect storm, leading to an economic contraction that caught many off guard, forcing a re-evaluation of the immediate economic outlook . The Ripple Effect: How This Economic Contraction Impacts Various Sectors A significant economic contraction like the one seen in Q1 2025 doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Its effects reverberate across different sectors of the economy, creating both challenges and, potentially, unexpected opportunities. Understanding these impacts is crucial for making informed decisions. Impact on Traditional Markets: Stocks: Typically, a contracting economy signals lower corporate profits, which can lead to stock market declines. Defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) might fare better than cyclical ones (technology, consumer discretionary). Bonds: In times of economic uncertainty, investors often flock to safe-haven assets like government bonds, driving up their prices and pushing down yields. Interest Rates: A weaker economy might prompt the Federal Reserve to consider pausing or even cutting interest rates to stimulate growth, though this depends heavily on inflation figures. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market: The cryptocurrency market, while often seen as distinct, is not entirely immune to macroeconomic shifts. A significant U.S. GDP contraction can influence crypto in several ways: Risk-Off Sentiment: In times of economic uncertainty, investors tend to reduce exposure to higher-risk assets, which often includes cryptocurrencies. This can lead to selling pressure and price declines. Dollar Strength: A weaker U.S. economy might lead to a stronger U.S. dollar if global investors seek safety in the world’s reserve currency, potentially impacting crypto prices denominated in USD. Inflationary Pressures vs. Deflationary Concerns: If the GDP contraction signals potential deflation (falling prices), it could challenge the “inflation hedge” narrative often associated with Bitcoin. However, if central banks respond with more quantitative easing, it could reinforce the demand for scarce digital assets. Innovation and Adoption: Despite short-term price volatility, a challenging economic environment can sometimes accelerate innovation and the search for alternative financial systems, potentially benefiting the long-term adoption of decentralized technologies. Navigating the Uncertain Economic Outlook: Strategies for Investors Given the confirmed economic contraction in Q1 2025 and the uncertain economic outlook , what steps can investors take to protect and potentially grow their portfolios? While no advice guarantees returns, certain strategies can help mitigate risks and position you for future recovery. Actionable Insights: Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and a carefully considered portion in cryptocurrencies). Within crypto, consider a mix of established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside promising altcoins. Reassess Risk Tolerance: A contracting economy often means higher volatility. Re-evaluate your personal risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. This might mean reducing exposure to highly speculative assets. Focus on Quality and Fundamentals: For stocks, look for companies with strong balance sheets, consistent earnings, and resilient business models. In crypto, prioritize projects with clear utility, robust technology, and strong development teams rather than hype-driven ventures. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps average out your purchase price over time, reducing the impact of market volatility, especially during a downturn. Stay Informed and Patient: Economic cycles are natural. While the current contraction is concerning, markets eventually recover. Stay updated on economic data, central bank policies, and global events, but avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term news. Consider Safe Havens: While traditional safe havens like gold and certain bonds might be appealing, some argue that Bitcoin, due to its decentralized and finite nature, could eventually act as a digital safe haven, though its volatility remains a factor. The key is to remain disciplined and avoid panic. Economic shifts, while challenging, often present unique opportunities for those prepared to act strategically. Beyond Q1 2025: What Lies Ahead for the U.S. Economy? The U.S. GDP data for Q1 2025 provides a snapshot, but the future remains fluid. Will this contraction be a one-off blip, or does it signal the onset of a more prolonged downturn or even a recession? The answer hinges on several factors that will unfold in the coming quarters. Key Factors to Watch: Inflation Trends: The Federal Reserve’s response will largely depend on whether inflation continues to be a concern. If inflation cools, the Fed might have more room to ease monetary policy, which could support economic recovery. Labor Market Strength: A resilient job market can cushion the blow of economic slowdowns, maintaining consumer spending power. Any significant weakening here would be a major red flag. Global Economic Health: The performance of major trading partners and global supply chains will also influence the U.S. economy. A synchronized global slowdown could exacerbate domestic issues. Policy Responses: Government fiscal policies (e.g., spending packages, tax changes) and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions will play a critical role in shaping the recovery trajectory. While the immediate economic outlook is clouded by the recent contraction, economies are dynamic. Businesses adapt, consumers adjust, and policymakers intervene. The path forward will likely involve a delicate balancing act between controlling inflation and fostering growth. For crypto enthusiasts, this macro backdrop underscores the importance of understanding broader economic forces, as they often dictate the tides of the digital asset space. A Compelling Summary: Navigating the Economic Shift The 0.5% contraction in U.S. GDP for Q1 2025 is a sobering reminder that economic growth is not guaranteed. This unexpected downturn, missing market expectations , highlights the fragility of the current recovery phase and introduces significant uncertainty into the economic outlook . From traditional stock markets to the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, the ripple effects of this economic contraction will be felt across various investment landscapes. However, challenging times also foster resilience and innovation. For investors, this period calls for prudence, strategic diversification, and a deep understanding of market fundamentals. By staying informed and adopting a long-term perspective, you can navigate these economic shifts and position yourself for future opportunities. The coming quarters will be critical in determining whether this is a temporary setback or a harbinger of deeper economic challenges, making vigilant observation more important than ever.

2025-06-27T01:00:18,"Analyst Drops Bomb On Bitcoin Vs. Global M2 Money Comparisons","A crypto analyst has revealed a significant disconnect between the Bitcoin price peak and the continued expansion of the Global M2 money supply . In his analysis, he shares a surprising comparison that raises fresh questions about the true drivers of the crypto bull market and how liquidity trends impact price cycles. Bitcoin Price Moves Ahead Of Global M2 A recent analysis by Rekt Capital, a crypto expert on X (formerly Twitter), draws attention to a critical timing mismatch between the Bitcoin price movements and global liquidity levels , measured by the Global M2 money supply. According to the data, Bitcoin reached an all-time high in November 2021, marking the peak of the bull market . However, Global M2 continued to rise for another five months, finally topping out in April 2022. This five-month divergence has prompted a reevaluation of Bitcoin’s sensitivity to macro indicators and its ability to act as a leading macroeconomic signal. Rekt Capital’s analysis implies that while liquidity conditions heavily influence Bitcoin , it does not necessarily move in lockstep with them. Instead, it may anticipate shifts in monetary policy and investor sentiment before they fully play out in traditional finance indicators like the money supply. While Bitcoin had already begun its decline following its peak in November 2021, the expansion of the global money supply persisted, indicating that central banks and financial systems were still operating under loose monetary conditions well into 2022. Notably, Rekt Capital’s analysis does not imply a direct cause-and-effect relationship but highlights a clear time lag between Bitcoin’s price behavior and global liquidity trends. This places BTC in a unique position in the financial landscape, as both a liquidity-sensitive asset and a potential early warning signal to broader market changes. BTC And Global M2 Set Stage For September Surge Crypto Con, a crypto analyst on X, has also shared insights into the relationship between Bitcoin’s price and changes in the Global M2 money supply, indicating the potential for a major upside move in the leading cryptocurrency. The chart, published on June 25, presents a side-by-side comparison of Bitcoin’s historical performance with a 10-week forward-shifted Global M2 metric. The chart’s data reveals a recurring pattern where the Global M2 expanded, and Bitcoin followed with a rally approximately ten weeks later. Conversely, contractions in M2 preceded Bitcoin’s price declines by the same time frame. This trend was observed during several key turning points in the market cycle. In April 2023, a significant decline in M2 was followed by a Bitcoin price downturn. A reversal and increase in M2 around March 2024 corresponded with the start of a sustained Bitcoin rally. Similarly, the December 2024 peak in M2 anticipated a Bitcoin correction several weeks later. Based on this trend, current conditions remain favorable. The forward-shifted Global M2 continues to show an upward trajectory , implying that Bitcoin may experience more upside movement through early September 2025.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-vs-global-m2-money/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Con|Global M2 Money Supply|Rekt Capital",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T00:49:01,"Asia Morning Briefing: Asia's Banks Look to Stablecoins to Prevent Deposit Flight","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. While stablecoins (USDT, USDC) dominated U.S. headlines last month amid the GENIUS Act and Circle's (CRCL) blockbuster IPO, Asia's quieter yet strategic adoption is reshaping the region’s cross-border finance. Asian banks increasingly see stablecoins like USDT and USDC as defensive tools against deposit flight and lost transaction revenue. Behind the scenes, stablecoins are already playing an important role in the region's financial plumbing. Fireblocks' Head of Asia, Amy Zhang, said in a recent interview with CoinDesk that major banks across Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong are proactively exploring local-currency stablecoins to mitigate these threats. “If I’m not one of the banks banking Circle or banking Tether, am I going to lose deposits?” Zhang told CoinDesk. “That’s a huge risk for banks.” In Korea, eight major banks, including KB Kookmin and Shinhan, are forming a consortium to launch a Korean won stablecoin by 2026 , a direct response to surging local use of USDT and USDC for cross-border transactions. Japan’s banking giants MUFG, SMBC, and Mizuho are piloting yen-pegged stablecoins to streamline trade finance and reduce dependence on traditional cross-border rails. Hong Kong’s Bank of East Asia also recently piloted its own USD and HKD stablecoin settlement network. Payment service providers (PSPs) are aggressively fueling the adoption of stablecoins, shifting away from costly traditional banking channels. ""A year ago, PSPs were asking if they should do stablecoins,"" Zhang said. ""Now they say, 'I'm moving a billion of client flows; I need a better wallet.'"" Fireblocks, which processed over $3 trillion in digital assets last year, reports that stablecoins now account for about half its transaction volume. Zhang cited growing usage among Asian e-commerce giants. Recent media report s say that China's JD.com plans to cut supplier-payment costs dramatically using stablecoins, which is an example of what Zhang mentioned. PSPs such as Hong Kong's Tazapay use Circle’s USDC to efficiently route cross-border payments into USD and HKD disbursements to help with instant payouts for content creators and gamers in Asia's emerging markets. A dashboard from Visa Analytics shows that weekends have 30% higher stablecoin volumes, underscoring their role in retail and gig use. Tether’s USDT dominates stablecoin flows in emerging Asian markets, driven by its liquidity and ease-of-access Zhang said, and by contrast, USDC gains traction in highly regulated financial hubs like Singapore and Hong Kong. As the region's financial institutions adopt stablecoins defensively and corporate users operationalize them pragmatically, Asia's quiet transformation in cross-border finance infrastructure could become the next headline in stablecoin's evolving history. The question is, what will be the next IPO to capitalize on this? Bakkt is Raising $1 Billion to Buy BTC Bakkt Holdings (NYSE: BKKT) is preparing to join the growing ranks of public companies allocating capital to bitcoin, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday . The SEC filing shows that Bakkt is looking to raise $1 billion through a mix of securities, common stock, preferred stock, debt, warrants, and units to buy BTC. The move comes as corporate BTC treasury strategies gain momentum globally. Companies like Metaplanet in Japan , Bridge Biotherapeutics in Korea , and Semler Scientific in the U.S. have made headlines by adding BTC to their balance sheets. The registration follows a wave of negative news : Bakkt recently lost two of its largest clients, Bank of America and Webull, responsible for a significant chunk of its loyalty and crypto service revenues. In February of last year , the company warned that it might not be able to continue operations. A few months later, Trump Media was reportedly said to be looking into an acquisition , but since then, nothing has materialized. Bakkt is also said to be exploring the potential sale or wind-down of its loyalty division as it refocuses on crypto payments and trading infrastructure. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin held steady above $107K Thursday ahead of a major $40B options expiry on Deribit, with a $102K max pain price and no clear directional bias from traders, while Core Scientific surged 33% on takeover rumors. ETH: Ethereum is trading at $2,420 as it tests major resistance between $2,500–$2,600, with analysts saying a breakout could pave the way to $2,800 or even $4,000 amid falling exchange reserves and record user activity. Gold: Gold slipped to $3,331 on Thursday despite a weaker dollar and falling Treasury yields, as strong U.S. jobless claims and durable goods data offset recessionary GDP revisions and added uncertainty over the Fed's future leadership. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets are poised to rise Friday, tracking Wall Street gains after the White House downplayed concerns over upcoming tariff deals. S&P 500: The S&P 500 rose 0.8% Thursday, nearing a record high after a $9.8 trillion rebound from April lows, capping a 23% rally driven by easing tariff fears and renewed market optimism.

2025-06-27T00:40:07,"HIVE Digital: Unveiling a Robust $181.1M Digital Asset Portfolio","BitcoinWorld HIVE Digital: Unveiling a Robust $181.1M Digital Asset Portfolio In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, a company’s strategic management of its treasury assets is a powerful indicator of its long-term vision and resilience. Canadian cryptocurrency mining powerhouse, HIVE Digital Technologies, recently captivated the market with an announcement that vividly illustrates its robust financial health and astute foresight. As the fiscal year 2025 concluded, HIVE Digital proudly disclosed an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , a substantial portion of which is anchored by a significant 2,201 Bitcoin. This pivotal revelation offers more than just a financial snapshot; it provides profound insights into the operational prowess and sophisticated asset management framework of a true trailblazer in the digital economy. HIVE Digital’s Strategic Accumulation of Digital Asset Holdings What does it truly signify for a pioneering entity like HIVE Digital to command such a formidable sum in digital asset holdings ? This figure is not merely a number; it represents a meticulously curated portfolio of cryptocurrencies, predominantly Bitcoin, which HIVE has diligently mined and, critically, chosen to retain rather than immediately liquidate. This deliberate strategy transcends conventional corporate treasury management, reflecting a profound bullish conviction in the enduring value of these assets and a proactive decision to fortify its financial bedrock. A Modern Treasury Approach: Unlike traditional corporations that might hold cash or government bonds, HIVE Digital’s treasury strategy embraces the native assets of the digital realm. This approach positions them to directly benefit from the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Balance Sheet Fortification: These substantial holdings are a direct infusion of strength into the company’s balance sheet. They serve as a formidable reserve, offering unparalleled flexibility to fund future operational expansions, invest in cutting-edge technologies, or provide a vital buffer during inevitable market downturns. Unwavering Market Confidence: By choosing to ‘HODL’ a significant portion of its self-mined assets, HIVE Digital unequivocally signals its deep-seated confidence in the long-term appreciation trajectory of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the charge. This transparency can foster immense trust among investors, demonstrating that the company’s interests are intrinsically aligned with the success of the broader crypto ecosystem. What Does HIVE Digital’s Bitcoin Portfolio Reveal? The precise mention of 2,201 Bitcoin as a cornerstone of HIVE Digital’s treasury illuminates a critical facet of its financial strategy. Bitcoin, often hailed as ‘digital gold,’ remains the preeminent cryptocurrency, serving as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . For a dedicated mining company, accumulating and safeguarding such a significant Bitcoin portfolio is a nuanced strategic maneuver that extends far beyond routine operational considerations. The HODL Philosophy in Action: HIVE’s decision to hold over two thousand Bitcoin is a clear manifestation of a ‘HODL’ strategy. This implies a calculated long-term bet on Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, indicating that the company is not merely covering immediate operational expenses but actively building wealth through asset accumulation. Proof of Operational Excellence: The ability to retain such a large Bitcoin reserve strongly suggests that HIVE Digital’s mining operations are not just profitable, but exceptionally efficient. They are generating enough revenue to comfortably cover their considerable expenses without being forced to liquidate all their freshly mined Bitcoin. This speaks volumes about their rigorous cost management, energy optimization, and overall operational superiority, especially in light of the escalating mining difficulty and the recent Bitcoin halving events that compress margins for many miners. Strategic Market Exposure: This substantial Bitcoin portfolio also provides HIVE Digital with direct and significant exposure to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. While this introduces a degree of volatility to their balance sheet, it also offers immense upside potential, allowing the company’s valuation to soar during pronounced bull markets, directly benefiting shareholders. The Dynamics of Cryptocurrency Mining in Today’s Market The landscape of cryptocurrency mining is a relentless arena of innovation, constantly reshaped by technological breakthroughs, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the fluctuating economics of energy. Companies like HIVE Digital operate at the vanguard of this demanding industry, where sustained success is inextricably linked to unparalleled efficiency and visionary strategic planning. Sustainability as a Core Pillar: A paramount consideration in modern crypto mining is energy consumption. HIVE Digital has consistently championed its unwavering commitment to harnessing sustainable and green energy sources. This dedication is not merely an environmental statement; it’s a strategic imperative that significantly reduces operational costs, enhances their global reputation, and aligns perfectly with critical ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment criteria. This focus on clean energy also mitigates regulatory risks associated with high energy usage. Relentless Hardware Innovation: To maintain a competitive edge, mining companies must perpetually invest in the most advanced and energy-efficient mining hardware. This necessitates substantial capital expenditure, a challenge that robust digital asset holdings can effectively help finance, ensuring HIVE remains at the technological forefront. Navigating Halving Events: Bitcoin’s programmed halving events, which periodically halve the block reward for miners, represent a significant operational hurdle. These events fundamentally alter the revenue model. However, companies possessing strong balance sheets, exemplified by HIVE Digital’s asset base, and highly efficient operations are uniquely positioned to weather these periods of reduced revenue. They can often consolidate their market share as less efficient or undercapitalized miners are compelled to exit the industry, making the strong stronger. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market: HIVE’s Approach The crypto market is famously characterized by its extreme volatility, with asset prices capable of experiencing dramatic swings within remarkably short periods. For an enterprise whose core product and treasury are intrinsically linked to these digital assets, the masterful management of this inherent volatility is not just important—it is existential. HIVE Digital’s substantial holdings are a clear indicator of a meticulously calculated approach to risk management and astute market timing. Sophisticated Treasury Management: It is highly probable that HIVE employs advanced treasury management strategies. These would dictate precise protocols for when to liquidate a portion of mined coins to cover operational expenditures and, crucially, when to strategically hold them for long-term capital appreciation. This dynamic balance is key to optimizing profitability and stability. Prudent Risk Mitigation: While accumulating significant assets offers immense upside potential, it inherently exposes the company to downside risk during market corrections. HIVE Digital’s reported holdings underscore a profound, long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s foundational value. This suggests they are strategically prepared to endure and even capitalize on market downturns, viewing them as opportunities rather than existential threats. Commitment to Transparency: By transparently disclosing their digital asset holdings , HIVE Digital significantly enhances its credibility and builds robust investor confidence. This level of openness is a distinguishing factor in the often opaque crypto space, setting them apart and fostering a stronger relationship with their shareholder base. Beyond the Numbers: The Future of HIVE Digital The announcement of an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings is far more than a mere financial snapshot; it serves as a powerful testament to the strategic direction and ambitious future trajectory of HIVE Digital . This exceptionally strong financial bedrock strategically positions the company for sustained expansion and continuous innovation within the rapidly burgeoning digital economy. Unlocking Expansion Opportunities: Armed with a formidable war chest of digital assets, HIVE Digital is exceptionally well-equipped to pursue a myriad of expansion opportunities. This could manifest as the acquisition of new, high-capacity mining facilities, significant investments in pioneering blockchain technologies, or strategic diversification into other lucrative blockchain-related ventures, such as high-performance computing or AI infrastructure powered by their extensive GPU fleets. Solidifying Industry Leadership: By consistently demonstrating robust financial stability, unwavering operational efficiency, and a crystal-clear long-term vision, HIVE Digital is actively reinforcing its esteemed position as a leading innovator in the global cryptocurrency mining industry. Their steadfast commitment to environmentally responsible and sustainable practices further solidifies this leadership, resonating with a growing segment of environmentally conscious investors and regulators. Elevating Investor Confidence: For current and prospective investors, these substantial holdings send a resounding message: this is a company that is not only generating significant profits from its core mining operations but is also astutely accumulating wealth in the very assets it produces. This deep alignment of interests with the broader success of the crypto ecosystem makes HIVE Digital an attractive proposition for those seeking exposure to the digital asset space. In summation, HIVE Digital Technologies’ impressive disclosure of $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , featuring a substantial 2,201 Bitcoin portfolio , paints a vivid portrait of a meticulously managed and forward-thinking enterprise. This strategic accumulation profoundly underscores their resolute confidence in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies, their exemplary operational efficiency within the challenging cryptocurrency mining sector, and their demonstrated ability to expertly navigate the inherent volatility of the broader crypto market . As HIVE Digital continues its trajectory of innovation and expansion, its robust digital asset base will undoubtedly serve as a pivotal cornerstone for sustained success, cementing its formidable presence in the rapidly evolving digital economy. This strategic move by HIVE Digital is a powerful declaration, signaling the increasing maturity and sophisticated strategic depth emerging within the digital asset investment landscape.

2025-06-27T00:10:16,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Accumulation Signals Unprecedented Gains","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Accumulation Signals Unprecedented Gains Are you tracking the pulse of the Bitcoin market? If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz around its incredible potential. The cryptocurrency world is often a whirlwind of rapid movements and unexpected turns, but savvy analysts look for underlying patterns to guide their predictions. One such pattern, highlighted by crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., points to a compelling indicator for future growth: the persistent accumulation by Long-Term Holders (LTHs). This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a historical blueprint that has previously paved the way for significant rallies, making it a crucial signal for anyone interested in the future trajectory of the leading digital asset. Understanding Long-Term Holders: The Backbone of Bitcoin’s Strength Who exactly are these Long-Term Holders , and why does their behavior matter so much for Bitcoin ‘s market dynamics? LTHs are individuals or entities who hold their BTC for extended periods, typically over 155 days, signaling a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value rather than short-term speculative gains. They are often seen as the ‘diamond hands’ of the crypto space, less likely to sell during price dips and more inclined to buy during periods of consolidation or even correction. Reduced Selling Pressure: When LTHs accumulate, it means fewer coins are available on exchanges for sale, naturally tightening supply. Strong Conviction: Their holding behavior reflects a deep belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and future appreciation. Market Stability: LTHs act as a stabilizing force, absorbing supply and reducing volatility compared to short-term traders. Their collective actions provide a powerful insight into the underlying sentiment of the market’s most patient participants. When these experienced investors are actively increasing their positions, it often suggests they anticipate significant upward movement, reinforcing the overall bullish outlook for the asset. Historical Precedent: When LTH Accumulation Ignited Bitcoin’s Rallies Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis isn’t based on mere speculation; it’s rooted in observable historical patterns that have consistently preceded major Bitcoin surges. Examining past cycles reveals a clear correlation between sustained LTH accumulation and subsequent price explosions. This isn’t just anecdotal evidence; it’s a recurring theme in Bitcoin’s journey. Consider these compelling examples from Bitcoin’s history: Accumulation Period (Approx. BTC Price) LTH Action Subsequent Price Rally (Approx. Target) Timeframe $28,000 Ramped up long positions Jumped to $60,000 Approx. 2 months later $60,000 Continued strong accumulation Rose to $100,000 Following period These instances are not isolated. They demonstrate a consistent pattern where a period of quiet, yet persistent, accumulation by LTHs sets the stage for explosive upward movements. This behavior is akin to winding a spring; the more it’s compressed, the more force it releases when unleashed. For Bitcoin , LTH accumulation represents that compression. Current Trends: What Does LTH Accumulation Signal for Bitcoin’s Price Prediction? If history is any guide, the current robust accumulation by Long-Term Holders paints an incredibly optimistic picture for Bitcoin ‘s immediate future. Analyst Axel Adler Jr. explicitly states that if the present situation mirrors past cycles, the flagship cryptocurrency is poised for a significant rally, potentially targeting a remarkable $160,000. This projection isn’t merely a hopeful guess; it’s an extrapolation based on established market behavior. The fact that LTHs are consistently building their positions, even amidst market fluctuations, underscores a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. They are not deterred by short-term volatility, instead viewing current prices as opportune entry points for future gains. This sustained accumulation reduces the circulating supply available for sale, creating an environment ripe for upward price pressure when demand eventually surges. The Broader Crypto Market: How Bitcoin’s Trajectory Influences Altcoins Bitcoin ‘s dominance often dictates the overall sentiment and direction of the wider crypto market . As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its movements have a ripple effect across thousands of altcoins. When Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, it often pulls the entire market upward, leading to an ‘altcoin season’ where other cryptocurrencies also see substantial gains. Why is Bitcoin’s performance so pivotal? Gateway Asset: Bitcoin is typically the first cryptocurrency institutional and retail investors buy, acting as the primary entry point into the crypto ecosystem. Liquidity Anchor: Its sheer size provides a foundational layer of liquidity that supports the entire market. Sentiment Driver: Positive news or price action for Bitcoin tends to generate broader enthusiasm and investor confidence across the board. Therefore, if LTH accumulation indeed propels Bitcoin towards the $160,000 mark, it’s highly probable that we will witness a broader bullish trend engulfing the entire crypto market , offering opportunities across various digital assets. This interconnectedness means that understanding Bitcoin’s signals is paramount for navigating the broader crypto landscape. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors While the signals from Long-Term Holders are undeniably bullish, it’s crucial for investors to approach the crypto market with a well-informed strategy. A potential Bitcoin price prediction of $160,000 is exciting, but responsible investing requires diligence and a clear understanding of both opportunities and risks. What Should Investors Consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying fundamentals of any asset you invest in. Analyst predictions are indicators, not guarantees. Long-Term Perspective: Emulate the LTHs. Bitcoin’s volatility can be intense in the short term, but its long-term trend has historically been upward. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, if appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments that could influence the market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, to smooth out market volatility and benefit from long-term accumulation . The consistent accumulation by LTHs is a powerful vote of confidence, but the path to $160,000, while projected, will likely not be a straight line. Market corrections and unexpected events are always possible, making a resilient strategy essential. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Remarkable Journey Continues, Fueled by LTH Conviction The compelling evidence presented by analyst Axel Adler Jr. regarding Long-Term Holders ‘ persistent accumulation provides a potent bullish narrative for Bitcoin . This isn’t just about a hopeful price prediction ; it’s about understanding the deep-seated confidence of the most committed participants in the crypto market . History has repeatedly shown that when LTHs are actively building their positions, significant rallies often follow, transforming what might seem like ordinary market activity into a prelude for extraordinary gains. As Bitcoin continues its remarkable journey, the unwavering conviction of its LTHs serves as a powerful testament to its enduring value proposition. While no investment is without risk, the current patterns suggest a future brimming with potential, positioning Bitcoin for what could be one of its most impressive surges yet. For those looking to understand the core drivers of Bitcoin’s next potential leap, the actions of its long-term holders offer an invaluable compass.

Bloomberg, citing info from Crane Data LLC, reports that the amount of capital invested in the money-market industry has now soared to a record $7.4 trillion, with $320 billion pouring into the funds in 2025 so far. Money-market funds are financial instruments that allow people to invest in lower-risk and short-term debt securities, including US Treasuries. Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes, tells Bloomberg that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing monetary policy choices suggest the money market industry could continue to grow and easily stretch to $7.5 trillion in assets this year. “Five-percent-plus rates were nirvana, four-percent-plus is still very good – and if we dip down into the high threes, that’s quite acceptable as well.” The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced last week that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. Michael Bird, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, tells Bloomberg that it’s “not surprising” that asset levels in the money-market sector have grown. “Even if the Fed picks up its easing campaign this year, rates will still be relatively high…” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-26T23:55:01,"BTC.com Mining Pool Drives 98% of Bitcoin Miner Flows to Binance","The BTC.com mining pool currently dominates miner flows to Binance, as it now accounts for nearly 98% of all BTC transfers from miners to the exchange. This trend provides critical insight into miner behavior, according to the latest report by CryptoQuant. Bitcoin Miners Show Patience Historically, BTC.com increases its outflows to Binance when Bitcoin’s price rises, indicating strategic profit-taking at local tops. On the other hand, when flows drop, it reflects growing miner confidence, as they choose to hold their Bitcoin rather than sell. Interestingly, despite Bitcoin trading above $100K in recent months, BTC.com’s flows to Binance have sharply declined. This suggests that miners are anticipating further price appreciation and are reducing selling pressure, potentially supporting a more sustained rally. “Miners are among the smartest players in the market. Watching their moves helps us understand where we are in the cycle.” Zooming out, a deeper look at network-level data reveals a “seasonal” trend. Hash Rate Seasonality The latest development comes as Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000 this weekend after reports emerged of a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites, dropping to $98,000 in a swift response to geopolitical tensions. However, the dip was short-lived, as the crypto asset rebounded by early Monday. Despite the recent price milestones, Bitcoin’s on-chain transaction fees remain weak, as per the latest observation by Digital Mining Solutions. In 2025, fees have consistently accounted for less than 1% of the total block reward and have failed to offset the halving-induced subsidy cuts. This weak fee environment means miner revenue, or hash price, is tightly correlated to Bitcoin’s price. When BTC falls, hashprice drops nearly in sync, with minimal fee support to cushion the decline. Bitcoin’s network hash rate has been highly volatile this year, and has seen several record highs and sharp drops. It peaked at 950 EH/s in mid-June before plunging to 827 EH/s – a 13% decline. This pattern of surges followed by steep corrections has been consistent, with seasonal factors playing a role. With around half of US mining centered in Texas, heatwaves and energy curtailments in the summer often cause hash rate dips.

2025-06-26T23:30:21,"Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place","The Bitcoin price could be entering the final and most explosive phase of its current market cycle, as an analyst maps out the cryptocurrency’s next movements onto a parabolic step-like structure. Reinforcing this bullish outlook is the Elliott Wave 5 count, which points to an epic price rally that could propel Bitcoin above $300,000, eclipsing its previous all-time high and current market value by a substantial margin. Bitcoin Price Ultimate Parabolic Push Unveiled A newly released Bitcoin price forecast by X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Gert van Lagen boldly suggests that the leading cryptocurrency may be on the verge of its most aggressive bull run this cycle. Lagen’s price chart indicates that BTC is firmly locked into a parabolic step-like growth structure, potentially eyeing an extended Wave 5 breakout that could drive prices well beyond $345,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The trajectory of the analyst’s chart illustrates a clear parabolic growth curve anchored by four distinct formations, labeled Base 1 through Base 4. Each of these bases represents a phase of accumulation and consolidation that preceded a Bitcoin price breakout. This structure also mirrors a textbook parabolic setup, where each new base sets the stage for steeper upward moves. Most notably, after the completion of Base 3, marked by the inflection point on the chart, Bitcoin launched into a sharp rally, confirming the expected parabolic behavior. Lagen’s analysis now indicates that BTC’s current Base 4 has been completed, followed by a corrective A-B-C structure that appears to have reached its bottom, positioning the cryptocurrency for the anticipated final leg of its cycle. Using Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin’s price action is still unfolding within the fifth wave, which is the final advance in the five-wave impulsive cycle. The price chart identifies Wave 1 as beginning shortly after the 2022 lows. This was followed by a powerful breakout in 2023, which defined Wave 3, while Wave 4 concluded more recently with a classic corrective pattern. Notably, the upcoming Wave 5 could see Bitcoin skyrocket anywhere between $300,000 and $425,000, depending on the timing and strength of its bullish momentum. Timeline For Game-Changing Rally A key element in Lagen’s analysis is the dynamic “sell line” drawn near the upper end of the parabolic arc that runs underneath the Bitcoin price movement on the chart. According to the analyst, the longer it takes for Bitcoin to hit this projected vertical trajectory, the higher the price at which the potential market top might occur. This is due to the upward curvature of the parabolic trend line itself, which steepens over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Currently, Lagen forecasts an early breakout by July 7, 2025, if momentum resumes immediately. However, if Bitcoin continues consolidating through the summer, the projected peak could rise further, as the sell line would continue climbing over time.

2025-06-26T23:30:00,"Russia’s Digital Ruble to Roll Out in September 2026, Says Central Bank","The Russian digital ruble, the nation’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) , will finally launch nationwide on September 1, 2026, the Central Bank claims. The Central Bank says that it expects the largest commercial banks in the nation to start providing their clients with a full range of CBDC transaction options as of September next year. Digital Ruble Rollout: Can Moscow Prevent Further Delays? Its previous statements on the matter would appear to suggest the Central Bank will follow up with an order for smaller and regional banks to follow suit in September 2027. A Russian crypto mining firm executive has claimed Bitcoin (BTC) prices could climb to the $130k mark in the second half of summer 2025. #BitcoinMiining #BitcoinPrice https://t.co/nPpvHr4KJ9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The digital RUB had been slated to launch on July 1 this year. But the Central Bank abruptly postponed the launch “indefinitely” in early March . The bank stunned the public when it initially gave no alternative launch timeline. This led to a flurry of speculation that Moscow was preparing to ditch its CBDC. Others suggested Moscow might push back the rollout to at least 2027 . Some forecasted that the Central Bank would pursue crypto-powered alternatives to the digital ruble. They cited a lukewarm reception for digital RUB plans from both the public and the banking sector. However, the Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that some of the biggest banks in the country are looking forward to the launch. The Russian Central Bank in Moscow. (Source: NVO [CC BY 2.5]) A VTB spokesperson said the megabank was already technologically prepared for the rollout. Sovcombank, meanwhile, said that it would be “completely ready” for customers to make digital RUB transactions by the Central Bank’s deadline. Both banks are currently working with Moscow on the ongoing digital ruble pilot. VTB said that “as the first bank to join the pilot project,” it was “technologically ready” for the launch. It added: “We are interested in providing our clients with access to the latest financial instruments as soon as possible. We expect a wide-reaching digital ruble launch for Russian citizens.” President Donald Trump said that it is possible that Russian President Vladimir Putin has territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine https://t.co/zyOyowqMjB pic.twitter.com/q2zRmeE8ST — Reuters (@Reuters) June 25, 2025 Legislation Heads to State Duma The Central Bank says it has sent a draft bill to the State Duma. It is hoping to rapidly enshrine its demands to the banking sector in Russian law. Lawmakers have previously claimed that the Russian CBDC will be interoperable with the digital currencies issued by other BRICS member states. Some have claimed that it will be put to use in the cross-border trade sector, where it will help Russian traders avoid sanctions regimes. But critics claim that the coin may violate citizens’ privacy rights. They also complain that the digital RUB will be hard to use in more remote parts of Russia, where internet connectivity is often unstable.

2025-06-26T23:24:13,"US stock futures open with a new all-time high as Bitcoin stumbles","Stock futures in the United States opened Thursday night flat, but the S&P 500 still managed to press its face against a fresh record, leaving investors glued to the screen as they wait for the official inflation numbers due Friday morning. This comes as the index climbed 0.8% during the day, ending the session at 6,141.02, just inches away from the 6,147.43 intraday record last hit in February. The Dow Jones added 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite moved up nearly 1%, also heading toward a potential all-time high of its own. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added just 33 points in after-hours trading, a 0.1% lift. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures stayed mostly unchanged. This cautious positioning comes ahead of key inflation data that will either keep the rally going or yank it off course. Investors wait for new inflation data According to CNBC, Rick Rieder, who heads global fixed income at BlackRock, said, “There is so much money that wants to come into the market that didn’t for a while. And I just think if you don’t have any negative news, the natural gravitational pull is across all these assets.” On Friday, traders are set to dig into May’s personal consumption expenditures price index. It’s a big deal—this is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a monthly increase of 0.1%, and a year-over-year jump of 2.3%. The core PCE, which takes out food and energy, is also forecasted to rise 0.1% for the month and 2.6% for the year. That’s not all investors are watching. The morning will also bring updates on consumer spending, personal income, and consumer sentiment. The results could decide if the recent rally continues or runs out of steam. Despite the Fed still dancing around its rate strategy and ongoing geopolitical pressure, the stock market has clawed its way back from its lows earlier this year. All three major indexes have posted solid weekly gains: the S&P 500 and Dow are up over 2%, and the Nasdaq has jumped more than 3%. Bitcoin trapped in tight range as whales unload While equities flirt with records, Bitcoin is stuck pacing the same ten-foot circle it’s been walking since May 9. The price has mostly bounced between $102,000 and $112,000, with just one brief spike beyond that ceiling to hit a new high, still barely ahead of its last one. It hasn’t managed a strong rally, despite an insane amount of interest from institutions. Just this Wednesday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their 12th straight day of inflows and are now heading toward their ninth positive week in eleven, pulling in $3.5 billion just this month, according to Coin Metrics. Yet Bitcoin itself has only risen by 2%. Markus Thielen, who leads 10x Research, explained why. “We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets,” he said. Markus called it an “orderly” change of ownership, where old megawhales are taking their time to sell off coins to new buyers like ETFs and corporate treasuries. The wallets that are buying the most this year? Those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. CryptoQuant classifies these holders as dolphins, and Julio Moreno, the firm’s head of research, says that many ETFs probably fall into this group. Whales and miners control the game The biggest players in crypto right now are still whales (wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC) and megawhales (10,000+ BTC). But they’re not buying. They’ve been net sellers since the start of the year. Retail wallets, those holding less than one full bitcoin, are also dumping. It’s the dolphins who are stepping in to soak up that pressure. But that balance is fragile. Julio said that companies like BlackRock and Strategy (the company formerly known as MicroStrategy) have built large positions using hundreds of wallets. BlackRock holds around 550 wallets, each averaging 1,290 BTC. Strategy controls about 490 wallets, with an average of 927 BTC per wallet. But even with these holdings spread out, they’re considered large buyers behind most of the recent ETF flows. Despite all the buying, price movement has stayed muted. That’s because some of the biggest bitcoin reserves on the planet are still in the hands of Chinese miners. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate. Out of the 19.9 million bitcoins mined so far, between 11 and 15 million came from China-based miners. Of that, about 5 million are still under their control, according to Markus. Normally, during a big price rally, these wallets start dumping on exchanges. This time, they haven’t. “It seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many bitcoin as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” Markus said . Strategy, now focused on corporate crypto adoption, has slowed down its BTC buying this year. That’s mostly because its stock premium has narrowed, and competition from other treasury buyers is rising fast. Markus warned that “if megawhale selling accelerates further, a deeper correction is likely.” On the other hand, if those big sellers back off and whale accumulation starts to rise, the next leg up might finally begin.

2025-06-26T23:05:35,"Crypto Founder Hints on Optimal XRP Sell Point","Edoardo Farina, a well-known supporter of XRP and Head of Social Adoption at XRP Healthcare, recently made a strong statement reinforcing his long-term confidence in the digital asset. According to Farina, there is no conceivable global or financial crisis, no matter how severe, that would compel him to sell any portion of his XRP holdings for less than $100 per token. Despite XRP struggling to hold above $2, Farina continues to promote a mindset of long-term accumulation within the XRP community. His comments are intended to strengthen the commitment of other investors who may be discouraged by market volatility. Unshaken by Global Disasters or Market Crashes In a recent statement , Farina outlined a list of hypothetical catastrophes, including global warfare, widespread economic collapse, artificial intelligence revolts, and even highly improbable scenarios such as a zombie outbreak or extraterrestrial invasion. He stressed that even under these extreme conditions, he would not sell his XRP unless the price surpasses the $100 mark. I'M NOT SELLING $XRP !!!!! World War III, alien invasion, atomic bomb, financial collapse, AI takeover, zombie apocalypse, NOTHING will shake me out. The Blackrocks and market manipulators can already give up. They ain't getting 0.1 XRP below $100! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 24, 2025 This declaration follows recent geopolitical tensions that triggered notable market fluctuations. After the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear sites amid the Israel-Iran conflict, markets experienced a temporary downturn. During this period, Bitcoin briefly dropped below $100,000, while XRP fell below $2. The crypto market has since shown signs of recovery. According to Farina, such events only serve to reinforce his strategy. He believes that long-term value will ultimately prevail over short-term disruptions. His refusal to liquidate XRP holdings under pressure reflects his conviction that temporary shocks should not dictate investor behavior. Outlook on XRP Reaching $100 Farina has consistently expressed the belief that XRP is undervalued and possesses the potential to rise to $100 per coin . This target represents a projected increase of over 4,500% from its current value of approximately $2.19. He previously argued in March that, under fair market conditions, XRP should already be trading well above this benchmark. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other market analysts have raised similar projections. The Modern Investor recently described XRP’s current price as evidence that the asset is still in an early phase of market recognition. Likewise, analyst BarriC stated last month that XRP could potentially hit $100 before the close of 2025. Strategic Holding and Long-Term Goals Farina has not disclosed the exact number of XRP tokens he holds. However, he frequently advises fellow investors to aim for a minimum of 10,000 XRP as part of a serious long-term investment strategy. At current prices, this would amount to roughly $21,900. If XRP were to reach $100, such a holding would be valued at $1 million, supporting the rationale behind his firm stance against selling prematurely. Edoardo Farina’s declaration reflects a broader sentiment among XRP supporters who remain optimistic despite market turbulence and skepticism. His position is built on a belief in XRP’s long-term growth potential and his commitment to strategic holding, even in the face of extreme global events. While his outlook may seem aggressive to some, it underscores the deep conviction shared by many within the community.

2025-06-26T23:00:20,"From DAG Speed to DeFi Power: BlockDAG’s $323M Roadmap to Real-World Crypto Finance","Over the past few years, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) chains have gained attention for their speed and scalability. Kaspa stands out with high throughput and rapid transaction finality. But even with these improvements, one thing remains missing: practical adoption. DAG networks have yet to connect their tech with global payments, DeFi, and mainstream usage. BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping into this space. It uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) plus DAG model, supports EVM tools, and is focused on real-world functionality. Rather than just speeding up transactions, BlockDAG is building a usable network for finance, remittance, and on-chain tools, bridging the gap that other DAG chains have left open. Why DAG Speed Alone Hasn’t Been Enough DAG chains like Kaspa have solved issues like slow confirmation and throughput limits. But most of these projects stop at core infrastructure. They rarely expand beyond the protocol layer. As a result, adoption stays small. BlockDAG is taking a different approach. It doesn’t rely only on DAG speed. Instead, it combines multiple missing features: Proof-of-Work for trustless security EVM compatibility for Ethereum-native app building A no-code dApp builder to open access Integrated DeFi tools: DEX, oracles, and cross-chain bridges This structure helps BlockDAG grow into a high-speed network that actually supports financial use, not just technical performance. How BlockDAG Plans to Power Real Financial Use BlockDAG’s roadmap outlines its plan to add finance-focused tools into its base layer. In Q4 2025, just two weeks ahead of listing, major modules will go live: A native DEX for seamless swaps Lending and borrowing tools Real-time oracles and on-chain indexers A bridge to other chains for liquidity These aren’t ideas for later. They’re ready for release before exchange trading starts. That’s key. Many Layer 1s delay real features until after launch. BlockDAG’s financial stack is part of its early release phase. Its long-term aim goes further. BlockDAG wants to be a DAG-based payment backbone for fast transactions, remittance, and DeFi trading. That’s what many scalable chains miss: how to turn speed into usefulness. PoW + DAG: A Practical Blueprint for Payments BlockDAG’s system blends DAG’s fast confirmations with PoW’s security, similar to what powers Bitcoin. The result is a network that can manage thousands of transactions every second while staying decentralized and secure. Most chains use validators to bundle transactions for efficiency. But bundling creates delays, something payments can’t afford. BlockDAG avoids this by confirming in parallel and anchoring it with PoW, removing both latency and trust issues. This setup supports: Decentralized crypto point-of-sale systems Live foreign exchange settlements Cross-border micro-payments Lightning-fast DEX trades These are not future dreams. If BlockDAG sticks to its plan, real users could be making these transactions by mid-2026. The Numbers Behind BlockDAG’s Growing Adoption So far, BlockDAG has secured over $323 million from its crypto presale and sold 23.3 billion BDAG coins. Over 2 million mobile users have joined its X1 mining app . Meanwhile, 18,170 ASIC miners have been purchased. X30 and X100 rigs ship starting July 7, and X10 follows on August 15. This is clear traction. The project is already powering its builder tools, DeFi roadmap, and high-speed chain with strong financial backing. Its pricing also shows market planning. Batch 29 now sells at $0.0276, showing a 2,660% gain from Batch 1. A temporary $0.0030 price still applies, ahead of its fixed listing at $0.05. For current entries, that’s 2,400% in projected returns. More Than Just Speed: A Financial Layer 1 in the Making DAG technology has given chains a performance edge, but few use it for actual financial tools. BlockDAG is doing both, layering DeFi features on top of scalable tech. Its testnet is live, presale is thriving, and its product suite is built to launch just before market entry. That timing is rare among new chains. If its plan plays out, BlockDAG could not only match Kaspa’s throughput but go further, becoming the first DAG-based Layer 1 to drive crypto payments, DEXs, and real-world financial use. Because speed alone doesn’t drive adoption. But the speed that powers real finance just might.

2025-06-26T22:57:49,"Wall Street sees stablecoins as trillion-dollar shortcut to kill banks and dominate payments","Wall Street is quietly betting big on stablecoins, not as a crypto side hustle but as a full-blown replacement for bank wires and card networks. Today, Circle, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month, saw its shares jump almost 8%, recovering from a brief dip. The stock has now surged over 600% since its IPO. That price action is coming at a time when big financial firms are laying new tracks to run global payments through stablecoins instead of traditional banks. The excitement around Circle didn’t happen in a vacuum. Bitcoin and ether have both been climbing this week, pushed higher by hopes of lower interest rates, a calmer stance from President Trump’s White House on tariffs, and a temporary breather in Middle East conflicts. But for investors chasing Circle and the stablecoin market, it’s not just about riding the crypto wave. It’s about ripping out the old money pipes and laying down a whole new system. Fiserv and Mastercard start connecting stablecoins to payments rails According to CNBC, Fiserv, a payments company with deep ties in banking, released a stablecoin earlier this week. Almost immediately after, Mastercard linked that coin into its existing payments network. It’s one of the clearest signs yet that old-school finance is loading up the backend for what they see as a trillion-dollar opportunity. Zach Abrams, the co-founder and CEO of Bridge, told CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos on Thursday’s “Crypto World” that stablecoins could grow into the trillions, calling them “an entirely new money-movement platform, like credit cards were decades ago.” He added, “Credit cards created trillions in value, and I think stablecoins will be the same.” Abrams says this transformation will unfold over years, not months, but it’s already happening behind the curtain. His company, Bridge, which just got bought by Stripe in a $1.1 billion deal, is already powering real transactions. ScaleAI, which recently received a $14 billion investment from Meta, uses Bridge to pay its global network of data labelers. SpaceX is also using Bridge to collect payments from Starlink customers in local currencies and convert them back to U.S. dollars. These are real-use cases, not test pilots. Traditional banks want in before the trillions show up Today, the $400 billion stablecoin market is controlled mostly by Tether and Circle, but that’s not the ceiling. Abrams said most major banks expect the market to reach a few trillion. That’s why he believes traditional players like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Fiserv will need to take a piece of the traffic. “It won’t get to a few trillion without a huge percentage being handled by traditional financial institutions,” Abrams said. What this means is clear: the banks that helped build the old system are now racing to rewire it before it’s fully out of their hands. And the tools they’re using are stablecoins, not wires, not ACH, not SWIFT. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s push into tokenization keeps expanding. Republic, an investment startup based in New York, announced this week that it will let users buy digital tokens representing shares in private companies like SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The price of entry? Just $50. That’s a massive drop from the usual $10,000 minimum required for investing in these kinds of deals. It’s the kind of retail-access play that shows how far tokenization has already gone, and how much more Wall Street thinks it can extract from packaging real-world assets into tradable tokens.

2025-06-26T22:20:00,"XRP Price Prediction – Major “Breakout” Predicted Within 90 Days – $589 XRP Possible?","XRP (XRP) is quietly regaining traction after a weekend dip below $1.90, bouncing back as geopolitical headlines reshaped market sentiment. A brief slip under the $2 psychological level was quickly reversed after President Trump stepped in to broker a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, sparking a wave of renewed buying. Yet despite the rebound, XRP has struggled to break out of a months-long consolidation phase, frustrating investors who expected follow-through after its late-2023 surge near all-time highs. One popular crypto trader seems to think that the wait could be over soon. Egrag Crypto, a pseudonymous account followed by more than 85,000 users on X shared a bullish XRP price prediction that sees an upcoming spike to $27 per token. #XRP – The Breakout Is Coming – Base On Math : Based on historical patterns, breakouts from triangle formations (symmetrical, ascending, or descending) typically happen around 75% to 95% of the total pattern duration. Calculations for a 334-day pattern: 75% of 334… pic.twitter.com/64hhEK0J0A — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 24, 2025 This rally should begin from July to September based on a bull flag pattern Egrar has been tracking for a while. According to his estimate, the full upside potential of these patterns typically unfolds in 75% to 95% of the time that it took them to be fully formed and broken. XRP Price Prediction: On Track to Hit $2.6 If Positive Momentum Gains Traction Heading to the charts, we can see that XRP has broken above a descending price channel and has already retested the upper bound of this pattern from above twice. These retests confirm the setup’s bullish bias and anticipate a significant rally that could push XRP to at least $2.6 in the near term based on the channel’s height. The 9-period and 21-period exponential moving average (EMA) have made a bullish crossover in this 4-hour chart already and they seem to be headed for a ‘golden cross’ with the 200-period EMA as well. The $2.3 level is the key resistance to watch in the short term. A move above this area will confirm a bullish XRP price prediction to the $2.6 target. A move toward $589 seems quite unlikely at the time but Egrar’s prediction does favor a strong bullish movement to uncharted territory. That said, the best crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) can offer the kind of upside potential that well-established tokens can’t. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises $1.6M to Launch its Bitcoin L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is an ambitious crypto project that aims to unlock the untapped potential of Bitcoin’s decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme coin segments. Through a Solana-based layer-2 scaling solution, Bitcoin Hyper aims to attract the attention of both developers and users who will now be able to stake, lend, borrow, and transfer BTC tokens rapidly and cheaply. The protocol’s architecture is quite simple. A Bitcoin wallet address will be used to receive users’ Bitcoin tokens. Once the assets are deposited, the Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge, which will monitor this address 24/7, will mint that same amount of tokens in the Bitcoin Hyper L2. As the protocol becomes rapidly adopted by top wallets and exchanges, the demand for HYPER will rise rapidly. To buy this token at its discounted presale price and reap the highest returns, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-26T22:05:00,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: $7.5 Million Pulled from Liquidity Pool – Is the Trump Team Cashing Out?","After weeks of heightened speculation and headline-fueled rallies, cracks may be forming in the Trump coin hype cycle. The removal of over $7.5 million from the TRUMP liquidity pool, widely interpreted as an intention from insiders to cash out, casts doubt on the long-term Trump coin price outlook . For a meme coin so closely pegged to the social momentum and influence of U.S. President Donald Trump, a move from its core team to pull away from the token could mark a collapse. TRUMP is now 45% below its late-May peak following the presidential dinner for top holders, struggling to regain traction and in need of a fresh social catalyst to reignite retail attention. Whale Ramps Up Sell-Offs Following $7.5 Million Withdrawal According to an X report from smart money tracker Lookonchain, the TRUMP coin team moved $4.4 million in USDC and $3.12 million worth of TRUMP from its liquidity pool on June 25. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) to a new wallet. https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiA https://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 The USDC has since been bridged to Ethereum, while the remaining 347,438 TRUMP tokens were transferred to a newly created Coinbase wallet. With no details on the purpose or intention of the transfer, speculation-fueled FUD around an insider sell-off could be detrimental for a meme coin that is already struggling with low demand. Lookonchain also flagged that a known whale has quietly ramped up profit-taking efforts following the transfer, placing a limit order to sell 275,672 TRUMP worth nearly $2.5 million. This same wallet had sold 100,000 TRUMP just two weeks earlier, and still holds 369,400 TRUMP valued at around $3.31 million. TRUMP Coin whale places second $2.5 Million limit order. Source: X, @lookonchain. The staggered sell-off pattern suggests an intent to exit rather than to de-risk, raising concerns that subsequent dumps could follow suit. TRUMP Coin Price Prediction: Could Sell Pressure Spark a Breakdown? The mass movement of capital from large hands could put pressure on the Trump coin price as it approaches the conclusion of a falling wedge forming since its late May peak. TRUMP / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. This comes as wider market dynamics flip bullish for the first time since, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line in a golden cross—an early sign of a potential trend reversal. The RSI has also bounced from oversold territory at 30, an indication of seller exhaustion. However, FUD may have stopped buyers from filling the gap as it stalls at 33. This bullish momentum coincides with a critical bounce from the wedge’s lower support, aligned with a historic accumulation zone below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $9.30. If bulls can defend it, the zone creates a confluence zone with the patterns’ upper descending trendline and a prime setup for a breakout. A successful breakout sets a technical target around the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $14.50, representing a potential 60% gain from current prices. However, if the accumulation zone fails, the next major support sits at 20% lower at $7.15, mirroring the mid-April market bottom and likely invalidating the bullish setup. Bitcoin Season Just Got a Whole Lot More Bullish Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.6 million in its third presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 474% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

The AI-focused cloud infrastructure firm is reportedly in advanced talks to buy the Bitcoin mining and hosting giant, after a previous $1 billion bid was rejected last year. Core Scientific Jumps 27% as CoreWeave Reignites Acquisition Talks The earlier offer, made at $5.75 per share, was turned down by Core Scientific’s board, which said the proposal undervalued the company. Since then, Core Scientific’s stock has surged. It jumped more than 27% to $15.67 on Thursday after the report surfaced, briefly triggering a trading halt. The company is now valued at around $3.7 billion, more than double CoreWeave’s earlier bid. *COREWEAVE IN TALKS TO BUY CORE SCIENTIFIC: WSJ Blocks are always moving in the #Bitcoin mining industry. $MNRS Learn more about $MNRS : https://t.co/kCpi8yOYF1 pic.twitter.com/sy9DG1f8dR — Grayscale (@Grayscale) June 26, 2025 Talks are ongoing, and the deal could close within weeks if negotiations continue without major setbacks. So far, the exact terms of the new offer have not been disclosed. Core Scientific operates one of the largest digital infrastructure networks for Bitcoin mining and data hosting in North America. In recent months, it has attracted attention beyond crypto, thanks to the global demand for data center capacity driven by artificial intelligence workloads. The two companies already have a deep relationship. In June last year, Core Scientific signed a series of 12-year contracts to host CoreWeave’s AI operations, supplying hundreds of megawatts of capacity. The agreement is expected to bring in billions in revenue over time and represents Core Scientific’s broader shift toward AI infrastructure. CoreWeave, which went public in March and now holds a market cap of roughly $75 billion, has rapidly scaled its AI infrastructure business. The company rents out access to Nvidia GPUs, often through partnerships with big tech firms. Microsoft alone accounted for over 60% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024, with Meta and IBM also among its clients. A successful acquisition would bring Core Scientific’s infrastructure under CoreWeave’s control, forming a major player in both Bitcoin mining and AI compute power. As demand continues to stretch global data center resources, the combination of Core Scientific’s scale and CoreWeave’s AI expertise could prove strategically valuable. Carlos Ramírez, an analyst following the sector, noted the shift. “Core Scientific is no longer just a crypto company,” he said. “Its infrastructure is becoming key to AI growth, and CoreWeave knows it.” While Core Scientific’s shares rallied on the news, CoreWeave’s stock slipped slightly. Market reactions to takeovers often reflect concern over deal execution, especially when integration or financing challenges loom. For now, all eyes remain on the negotiation table as CoreWeave looks to seal what could become one of the largest deals at the intersection of crypto infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Core Scientific Eyes AI Future Amid Revenue Decline, New CoreWeave Offer As CoreWeave returns with a renewed $1 billion-plus offer for Core Scientific, the backdrop tells a story of a mining firm in transition. Back in February, the Bitcoin mining firm secured a $1.2 billion agreement with CoreWeave to boost data center capacity for high-performance computing (HPC), signaling a pivot toward AI infrastructure. The move is expected to drive $360 million in colocation revenue by 2026, offering a buffer as traditional mining revenue comes under pressure. In Q1 2025, Core Scientific posted a net profit of $580 million , up from $210 million a year earlier. But revenue fell short of expectations, dropping to $79.5 million, down from $179.3 million in Q1 2024. @Core_Scientific reported a first-quarter net profit of $580 million for 2025, a sharp increase from $210 million a year earlier. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/a2zHWUsRcs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 The slump reflects weaker mining yields after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving and a strategic shift from self-mining to HPC hosting. Self-mining still brought in $67.2 million, but hosted and colocation mining lagged, contributing just $12.4 million combined. Industry-wide, miners are feeling the squeeze. According to CryptoQuant, daily miner revenues dropped to $34 million on June 22 , the lowest since April, due to falling BTC prices and lower transaction fees. Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year. Daily revenue slipped to $34 million in June, the lowest since April. Falling fees and Bitcoin’s price drop are crushing margins. pic.twitter.com/TXdN06CU1F — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 26, 2025 Analysts say miners are now the “most underpaid” they’ve been all year. Meanwhile, sustainability is improving. A Cambridge University study shows that 52.4% of Bitcoin mining now runs on sustainable energy , up from 37.6% in 2022. But uncertainty looms as President Trump’s proposed tax bill threatens to slash incentives for solar and renewable-powered miners, potentially raising energy costs across the sector.

Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities It started near $754 when Michael Bloomberg left office in December 2013. Now, as the city prepares for its next election, it’s trading above $107,000. These numbers show a rise of about 14,590% in just over a decade. Mayoral Timeline Marks Bitcoin Growth Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014. At first, Bitcoin barely budged. But by December 2021, it hit roughly $47,000. That climb happened while de Blasio’s two terms played out on City Hall’s stage. The crypto market had its ups and downs, yet the overall trend pointed skyward under his watch. Worth noting that in the time it took New York to go from Bloomberg to Mamdani, Bitcoin soared from $754 to $106,000+ today. You may not see nor believe it right away, but this is actually not a coincidence. Separate money from state. — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Surge Through Political Change When Eric Adams stepped in as mayor in January 2022, he made headlines by taking his first paychecks in Bitcoin. The move sent a clear message that New York was open to crypto. The market then endured a tough 2022 bear phase. Still, Bitcoin bounced back strong in 2023 and kept going. This month, it’s up about 3% and sits at $107,567, according to figures by Coingecko. Separate Money From State Park used the mayor count as a storytelling tool. He’s calling for a break between money and government. His view: people should choose how they handle their own cash. Political shifts come and go, but Bitcoin keeps growing on its own terms. That steady rise speaks to the idea of financial freedom outside state control. New Leadership And Future Trends Zohran Mamdani has surged ahead in the Democratic primary after Adams declared an Independent bid. Since Democrats usually win in New York, many see Mamdani as the likely next mayor. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Park even joked that Bitcoin’s journey has moved “from Bloomberg to Mamdani.” That line underlines how the asset climbed, even as the city’s politics reshuffled itself. It’s easy to draw lines between mayoral posters and price charts. But Bitcoin’s real drivers go beyond City Hall. Global demand, big investors, shifts in mining, and moves by the Federal Reserve have all shaped its path. New York’s mayors provide handy markers on the timeline, not the engine of growth. On Crypto & Politics As New York eyes November 2025, Bitcoin stands as proof that financial tools can live beyond politics. The question now isn’t whether the next mayor will back crypto. It’s how far Bitcoin will go when its story isn’t tied to any single office.

On-chain analyst Ember CN shared the development on X, noting that the company bought another 5,989 ETH worth $14.47 million on June 26. With its latest acquisition, Sharpink has 194,000 ETH, worth around $507 million. The company purchased its ETH at an average price of $2,611, slightly below the current price of $2,474. However, the sizable accumulation of ETH by the company is impressive given that it has been less than a month since it transitioned to an Ethereum treasury company after closing a $425 million funding round led by Consensys. However, the Sharplink is far from done with its accumulation, given that a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month shows that it has plans for another $1 billion raise, with all the funds expected to go towards accumulating ETH. Since its first purchase using funds raised from the funding round, Sharplink has been using proceeds from the sales of its shares through its at-market offering to buy more ETH. The company has also been staking all its ETH holdings to earn more Ether. Corporations showing interest in altcoin treasuries Meanwhile, the continued accumulation by Sharplink is likely part of its goal to become the biggest corporate holder of ETH in its reserves. Given its current stash, it appears to have already achieved that, especially since only a few companies have an Ethereum treasury. While it might be the one with the biggest ETH treasury, Sharplink was not the first public company to consider ETH as a treasury asset, with BioNexus Gene actually releasing an Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper back in March. Another public company with a known ETH treasury is Bit Digital. The Bitcoin miner recently transitioned to focusing solely on ETH staking and treasury, stating that it holds over 24,000 ETH and 417.6 BTC as of March 31, 2025. However, it plans to convert its Bitcoin holdings to ETH while also planning to sell its Bitcoin mining infrastructure and divert the proceeds to ETH. Unsurprisingly, the move caused its stock to fall. Nevertheless, it highlights how several companies are now hopping on the altcoin treasury trends instead of choosing BTC. For instance, companies such as Upexi, Sol Strategies, DeFi Development Corp, and MemeStrategy have all opted for a corporate Solana treasury to acquire and stake SOL. Other firms have also picked altcoins, such as HYPE, XRP, and BNB, as treasury assets. A Chinese chip maker, Nano Labs, recently released a plan to buy $1 billion BNB, while companies like ViVoPower and Webus plan to buy XRP and Lion Group Holdings is targeting a HYPE treasury. Despite this diversification among public companies, Bitcoin treasuries remain the biggest trend, with more companies establishing corporate Bitcoin strategies. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s firm, ProCap BTC, recently announced a plan to go public as a Bitcoin treasury company through a special purpose acquisition deal. The company has been busy buying BTC in anticipation of the move. However, concerns about establishing crypto treasuries continue to grow, especially as the adoption keeps increasing. Some experts believe this poses a major risk, especially as many firms now leverage debt to acquire crypto assets. Sharplink stock continues to perform well Meanwhile, the unrealised loss on Sharplink’s ETH treasury has no major impact on its stock performance. According to Yahoo Finance data, Sharelink SBET closed on June 25 with a 6.42% gain and has already seen an extra 4.57% increase in pre-market. It is now trading at $10.28, with a 52.98% gain over the past month. It is also up 33.85% year to date, showing that the optimism around ETH recovery is spreading to SBET. With market observers bullish on Ether rebound, some believe Sharplink is getting in early. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-26T21:01:21,"Core Scientific’s stock jumped 35% after reports that CoreWeave is in talks to buy the company","Core Scientific’s stock price shot up 35% on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave is in talks to buy the crypto miner. The news caused a temporary halt in trading, but the rally picked up again once the pause ended. This was Core Scientific’s second-biggest trading day since its return to the Nasdaq in January 2024, after it came out of bankruptcy. The sharpest jump the company ever saw was last June, when it climbed 40% in a single session after announcing a major AI expansion deal with CoreWeave. The new acquisition talks are tied to that same relationship, which has turned into a billion-dollar partnership over time. The companies signed a series of 12-year contracts last summer worth $10.2 billion, with Core Scientific committed to delivering 590 megawatts of AI-ready infrastructure by early 2026. CoreWeave’s 2024 bid rejected, deal now being revisited The Journal report said the buyout deal could be finalized in the next few weeks, unless something derails it. If agreed, the acquisition would deepen CoreWeave’s involvement with Core Scientific beyond just contracts. It also highlights how the AI boom has changed the game for miners. Core Scientific was once just a bitcoin miner struggling to stay afloat. Now it’s sitting on close to $5 billion in market value, five times higher than when CoreWeave first tried to buy it. In 2024, CoreWeave made a $5.75 per share offer for Core Scientific . At the time, that offer put the company’s value at just over $1 billion. But Core Scientific turned it down, saying the bid undervalued the business and that it preferred to focus on its existing deals. With its stock now trading well above that old offer, the tables have turned. The partnership between the two has grown stronger since that rejected proposal. They’ve been working together for years, but the 12-year contract signed in June 2023 formalized things. Core Scientific agreed to supply hundreds of megawatts of hosting power to support CoreWeave’s compute-heavy AI infrastructure. Bitcoin miners rush into AI as space and power run low Core Scientific’s shift into AI isn’t unique. Many crypto mining companies are now trying to retool their data centers to meet demand from AI firms. But analysts have warned that AI infrastructure often needs full-scale builds, not just old mining rigs converted into something else. It’s not always a simple flip. Still, companies like Core Scientific are trying to cash in while demand is high. With limited data-center space and rising competition for electricity, timing is everything. Being able to deliver infrastructure quickly has become more important than mining blocks. Even so, CoreWeave’s share price fell by about 1% on Thursday. That’s not a massive drop, but it’s a sign the market isn’t reacting the same way on both sides of this possible deal. Core Scientific, meanwhile, has made its turnaround story all about AI. Since leaving bankruptcy in early 2024, it’s shifted large portions of its operations to hosting high-performance workloads instead of mining bitcoin full-time. That move has put it ahead of many competitors who are still trying to adapt. The company is now one of several crypto miners competing for AI clients, looking to make use of every available megawatt of energy and every square foot of hosting space. With the AI race heating up and real estate for GPUs running thin, whoever controls the infrastructure gets the money. And Core Scientific, thanks to its 12-year agreement with CoreWeave , has already locked in its seat at the table.
