2025-06-27T19:55:25,"‘The Signal We’ve Been Waiting For’: Analytics Firm Says Bitcoin Laying the Groundwork for the Next Leg Up","A market intelligence firm says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is flashing signs of an upcoming rally to the upside. In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics firm Bitcoin Vector tells its audience that liquidity cautiously returning to the top crypto asset by market cap is a sign of an upcoming bull market. “The signal we’ve been waiting for: Bitcoin liquidity has shown its first meaningful expansion in June after reaching a three-year low. With BTC consolidating below its ATH, liquidity supports any sustained upside. While not a breakout, it’s a constructive shift. Capital is cautiously returning, laying the groundwork for the next leg.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X According to the crypto intelligence firm, BTC is displaying a pattern that has historically led to gains. “Structure shift + price momentum: a duo we want to see. A potential Bitcoin leg up begins with this setup: Bullish momentum + structure shift confirmation (highlighted in blue). We just triggered the same pattern again. This setup historically leads to strong upside.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Bitcoin Vector goes on to note that the crypto king has been outperforming Ethereum ( ETH ) – the second-largest digital asset by trading volume – over the last year, meaning that ETH is now “undervalued and under-owned” and in “catch-up mode.” “Over the past year, BTC outperformed ETH massively: BTC rose +74% while ETH fell -28% But that strength has come at a cost BTC’s dominance is stretched, while ETH is now under-owned, undervalued, and in catch-up mode. Rotation season is near.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,140 at time of writing, while Ethereum is valued at $2,434, both marginal increases on the day.

2025-06-27T19:53:37,"Euro Stablecoin Market Nears $500M, Outpaces Dollar’s Growth","The euro-denominated stablecoin market is tearing higher in 2025, climbing almost 30% to near a $500 million mark and outperforming the expansion of dollar-backed competition on a percentage basis. This rally is being fueled by a convergence of macroeconomic forces, regulatory certainty, and a rising euro, laying the groundwork for the euro to take on the dollar's dominance in the digital asset ecosystem. Strength of Euro and Contrasting Monetary Policy Drive Demand The euro has appreciated by a whopping 12.88% against the U.S. dollar year to date, reaching its highest since 2021. A lot of this currency appreciation is due to the aggressive tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB) compared to the more relaxed approach of the Federal Reserve in the face of sustained fears of inflation. The result? Investors and institutions alike are being forced to seek alternatives to the U.S. dollar, driving demand for euro-backed digital assets and stablecoins. Market watchers say the move is part of a broader ”Sell America” trend as money flows out of U.S. assets and into Bitcoin, the euro, and gold. Top macro strategist Jens Nordvig cites rising demand for BTC and EUR call options as a sign that investors are protecting themselves against USD volatility and going long on the euro's ongoing strength. This macroclimate has laid rich soil for euro-denominated stablecoins, which are being used more and more as a store of value and transactional currency in DeFi and cross-border payments. EURC Pioneers the Way: Historic Growth and Multi-Chain Growth Circle's EURC stablecoin paces the way, with supply increasing 138% to over $200 million in market value during the first half of 2025. EURC has become the largest euro stablecoin, getting picked up quickly on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. On-chain activity is taking off: active accounts for EURC are up 66% to 22,000, and monthly transfer volume has grown 47% to over $2.5 billion. While still overshadowed by USDC and USDT, EURC's activity is forthcoming—especially since euro stablecoins have now begun to represent an expanding share of the $230 billion global stablecoin market. Other euro-backed tokens, such as Stasis EURS and Tether's EURT, are also picking up once more, but Circle's regulatory alignment and MiCA compliance made EURC the go-to token for institutions and DeFi protocols. EURC is already heavily adopted on lending platforms like Aave, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve, and as collateral for new euro-denominated DeFi products. MiCA Rules The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) rule by the European Union is a key stimulant for euro stablecoin growth. MiCA has stringent standards for issuer licensing, transparency, and reserves, guaranteeing investors that euro-denominated tokens are secure and in line. The European Commission is expected to affirm stablecoins created outside the EU will be treated as equivalent to the licensed ones in the EU, also opening doors to global adoption. While the ECB has warned that stablecoins pose a threat to traditional banks during stress conditions, markets embrace MiCA's ease. Euro stablecoins are therefore becoming more seen as a regulated, safe haven for retail and institutional buyers alike—especially with euro-denominated DeFi rails expanding and an increasing number of protocols backing EURC and its cousins. Can the Euro Be Crypto's Second Reserve? While they are increasing rapidly, euro stablecoins are still below 1% of all stablecoins worldwide, light-years behind USD-backed giants. But with the revival of the euro, MiCA regulatory clarity, and increasing demand for non-dollar-denominated assets, the time is now right for the euro to become crypto's second reserve currency. Market observers expect more innovation in euro-denominated DeFi, payments, and cross-border settlements with EURC and its rivals poised to take a larger slice of the digital money economy. Bottom Line The meteoric surge of the euro stablecoin market to $500 million is more than a news ticker headline—it's a harbinger of new global finance. With MiCA regulations kicking in and the euro growing in strength, euro-backed stablecoins are becoming increasingly popular as a solid contender to the dollar, poised to reshape the future of digital money and DeFi in Europe and beyond.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9738/euro-stablecoin-market-nears-500-m-outpaces-dollar-s-growth,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|USDT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T19:50:25,"Bitcoin long-term holders added 800,000 BTC in a month, the highest ever recorded","Bitcoin long-term holders just locked in the biggest single-month accumulation ever recorded, grabbing 800,000 BTC in the span of 30 days, according to CryptoQuant. That figure is the highest monthly net growth in coins sitting untouched for more than six months, meaning they’ve now officially crossed into Long-Term Holder (LTH) status. And it’s not some bear-market bargain hunting either. These coins were bought when Bitcoin was trading between $95,000 and $107,000, with spot prices still holding above $100,000 today. The term “LTH” can get tricky. It’s not about addresses, it’s about the coin age. The moment a coin stays put for over 180 days, it’s categorized as long-term. So this isn’t just whales parking coins. It’s about how long those coins sit there, untouched. What we’re seeing now is a kind of quiet lock-in, with investors holding harder than they ever have before. This exact kind of accumulation spike has only shown up six times in Bitcoin’s 15-year history. ETFs and dolphins buy as megawhales back off Since May 9, Bitcoin has barely moved, sticking to a $10,000 range, even with a brief jump near $112,000, just above its previous high. That rally didn’t last. And it wasn’t for lack of interest. Over the last month, Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $3.5 billion across 12 straight trading sessions, making it their ninth week of inflows out of the last 11. But while the ETFs were stacking, the price barely moved. Why? Markus Thielen, head of 10x Research, explained it bluntly: “There is this change of ownership happening. We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets.” In other words, the big early holders — the megawhales — are selling. But they’re doing it slowly, waiting for institutions like ETFs and corporate treasuries to absorb the supply. Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s research chief, said the real power buyers this year are wallets holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, a group CryptoQuant calls dolphins. ETFs likely fall into that bracket. These aren’t retail investors or megawhales. They’re institutions spreading coins across many wallets. BlackRock, for example, operates around 550 wallets, averaging 1,290 BTC each. Strategy — the firm formerly known as MicroStrategy — controls 490 wallets, averaging 927 BTC each, based on 10x Research’s breakdown. Despite looking like mid-sized holders, these companies have stacked thousands of Bitcoin through their network of smaller wallets. Julio said, “In reality, these entities are in fact large holders, having purchased thousands of Bitcoin.” Chinese miners sit on five million coins as whales manage exit Meanwhile, the biggest Bitcoin holders ever, the early Chinese mining operations, are still in the picture. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate, creating as much as 15 million BTC. Today, they still sit on at least five million of those coins. In every previous bull run, those dormant wallets would start dumping onto exchanges. Not this time. Thielen pointed out that these older wallets are only letting go of what ETFs and companies like Strategy are ready to take. “This time, so far, it seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many Bitcoins as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” he said. Still, not everyone’s buying like they were in 2024. Strategy has slowed its acquisition pace, thanks to tighter stock premiums and more competition from other companies moving Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. They’re still the biggest public buyer, but they’re not pushing as hard right now. The whale cohorts — wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC — and the megawhales holding more than that, have been net sellers in 2025. Retail wallets, those with less than 1 BTC, are also offloading. But as long as the dolphins keep buying faster than the whales sell, the market holds steady. If that flips, things stall out. “The imbalance creates a slight bearish bias,” Thielen said. “Making a breakout unlikely without a clear shift in our tactical flow indicator. Until that signal improves, consolidation is expected to continue.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-06-27T19:43:09,"Bitcoin Bull Michael Saylor’s Company Strategy Hit with Multiple Lawsuits – Here’s the Critical Date","Bitcoin-focused investment firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is facing at least five separate class-action lawsuits over $6 billion in unrealized Bitcoin losses, alleging the company made misleading statements to investors about the risks and profitability of Bitcoin. The initial lawsuit was filed by Pomerantz LLP on May 16. However, four other law firms — Gross Law Firm, Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check and Levi & Korsinsky — have opted to file separate lawsuits with similar content rather than join the lawsuit. That’s not unusual, legal experts say. “In class-action securities litigation, law firms compete for the lead counsel role because that role can be very lucrative, with fees in the tens of millions of dollars,” said Adam Pritchard, a professor at the University of Michigan Law School. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump Comments on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Each of the lawsuits alleges that the company made “materially false and misleading” statements about the profitability and risks of Bitcoin investments between April 30, 2024 and April 4, 2025. Professor Ann Lipton of the University of Colorado School of Law similarly emphasized the importance of the lead plaintiff position, saying, “The lead plaintiff controls the litigation and determines the class attorneys. In cases that appear to be strong, many firms and plaintiffs file lawsuits to try their luck.” Law firms looking to get ahead in the litigation process are issuing public press releases inviting more investors to join the case. These statements often draw attention to the July 15 deadline, when the court will choose a lead plaintiff and the other cases will be consolidated under that umbrella. The primary goal of law firms, Pritchard says, is to include the most harmed investor among their plaintiffs. The Securities Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995 requires that the lead plaintiff role be given to the investor who suffered the most harm and volunteered to take on that role. Lipton sums it up this way: “An investor who has had more losses will monitor the case and the lawyers more carefully. That’s why institutional investors are generally preferred.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-27T19:40:03,"Staked Ether exceeds 30% of ETH total supply","Ethereum (ETH) is facing a mix of relatively low prices and increased usage. The network is carrying a near-record level of transactions, while over 30% of the supply is locked. Ethereum (ETH) keeps building up a supply crunch, based on whale holdings and increased staking. Currently, around 30% of the supply is staked, with highly active inflows in the past few months. More than 35M ETH is staked on the Beacon chain, an all-time high. The trend for staking may continue, as ETFs are also allowed to include staking for passive income. ETH staking picked up again in Q2, leading to a record value locked of over 35M ETH, or around 30% of the available supply. | Source: Beacon Chain After some outflows from the staking contract during the market panic in March and April, Ethereum staking returned to peak levels, not seen since September 2024. ETH staking became one of the most reliable markers for long-term confidence in the network’s value. Following the Pectra upgrade, staking also accelerated as large-scale whales could deposit more ETH at a time to build their stake. As a result, the total value staked on Ethereum is at an all-time high. The Ethereum network carries over $61B locked in DeFi protocols, including lending, liquid staking, and DEX liquidity pools. ETH remains valuable as collateral, and whales are in no hurry to sell. More ETH is wrapped in multiple protocols and is taken off the open market. Whales have also shown increased activity, adding on average 800K ETH per day for the previous week, while only 16K new ETH are produced each week. Whales are showing unprecedented levels of accumulation, boosting the narrative of a long-awaited price breakout. ETH exchange reserves remain scarce, at around 19M tokens. ETFs are also actively buying, with BlackRock recently absorbing the stake sold by Grayscale. ETH is also becoming attractive to corporate buyers as a collateral asset. The Ethereum network also awaits a new upgrade , which could further scale and speed up transactions. Despite the relatively high price compared to other networks, Ethereum remains a key platform for DeFi. Based on smart contract activity, the network’s main use cases are ETH transfers, while USDT and USDC remain some of the busiest smart contracts. ETH remains undervalued with volatile trading The current status of ETH is raising expectations for a catch-up rally. Trading under $2,500, ETH is seen as undervalued, despite the peak on-chain activity. Transactions have been climbing for Ethereum throughout 2025, reaching a higher baseline, with the occasional day of anomalous record activity. Despite this, the ETH market price remains close to its lows, still crashing after each breakout. In June, ETH failed to reclaim the $3,000 level. The token is down around 5% in June, though Q2 may end with significant net gains. ETH expanded by 31.8% in Q2, mostly driven by the peak gains in May. The multiple bullish factors for ETH are still not enough to spark a more decisive rally. In June, there is still an expectation for a breakout, where ETH can rally as high as $10,000. Even without a rally, Ethereum has shown it is not a dead chain. Recently, the network drew in over $334M in daily net inflows from bridges, as value returned to the biggest liquidity hub.

2025-06-27T19:39:41,"Inflation fears push Bolivian small businesses to embrace crypto","Bolivian small businesses are increasingly starting to accept crypto as payment amid the ongoing financial crisis. Small businesses in Bolivia are increasingly embracing crypto as trust in the official currency deteriorates. According to a report by Reuters, restaurants, beauty salons, and a range of small businesses are beginning to accept crypto payments. Amid this rising crypto adoption, transactions are up 530% in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year. According to Bolivia’s central bank, crypto transactions rose from $46.5 million to $294 million over the course of the year. The surge in crypto usage comes as the country grapples with a major financial crisis. Bolivia’s currency has lost more than half its value on the black market, while the central bank has run out of dollar reserves. Fuel shortages and historic inflation levels are making crypto assets appear stable in comparison. As a result, Bolivians are increasingly turning to Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins like Tether (USDT) to protect their savings and purchasing power. According to Jose Gabriel Espinoza, former head of Bolivia’s central bank, daily USDT volumes in the country may be as high as $600,000. While this is still a small fraction of the $12–$14 million cash-based black market, reliance on crypto is rapidly growing.

2025-06-27T19:20:43,"Core Scientific Could Top $30 on CoreWeave Buyout Deal: Cantor Fitzgerald","In a research note released late Thursday, Cantor Fitzgerald says Core Scientific (CORZ) could fetch over $30 per share in a potential acquisition by cloud compute giant CoreWeave , citing both the long-term cash flows from its AI contracts and the replacement value of its data centers. That would be a near doubling from the current level just above $16. The note came hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave, a cloud AI compute firm, is once again in advanced talks to acquire Core Scientific, following a failed $5.75 per share offer in 2024. CORZ shares jumped 33% to close over $16 Thursday, but Cantor believes that it still undervalues the company by at least 50%. At the heart of the bull case is a 12-year, $3.5 billion infrastructure lease Core Scientific signed with CoreWeave in 2024 to provide 200 megawatts of AI capacity. Cantor values the lease stream at $24/share, using a conservative 15x profit multiple typical for traditional data center REITs. Add another $11.70/share for the replacement value of CORZ’s 570MW of power infrastructure, and the upside case becomes clear. The BTC - AI Pivot But it’s not just Cantor arguing that the compute power used for crunching numbers to mine BTC might be more efficiently used for AI. Rittenhouse Research, a new fintech and AI-focused firm, released a report in May arguing that the most successful crypto companies aren’t doubling down on bitcoin. Instead, they’re pivoting to become AI infrastructure providers. When Galaxy Digital bought the Helios data center in late 2022, it seemed like a rescue of a struggling miner, yet it turned out to be a strategic AI asset as demand for data center space surged with the rise of ChatGPT and LLMs, Rittenhouse pointed out. “The infrastructure used to mine digital gold is better used to process AI algorithms,” Rittenhouse wrote at the time. At the core of the argument is the belief that AI generates stable, long-term cash flows, unlike BTC mining, which is subject to sharp revenue drops every four years due to halvings and is heavily dependent on bitcoin’s volatile price cycles. The future profitability of BTC mining, Rittenhouse noted, is also dependent on mining firms being able to design chips that are significantly more efficient each cycle to account for the halvening, an increasingly difficult task as gains from silicon shrinkage begin to plateau. But Not Every Pivot Away from BTC is Successful While Cantor, and the market broadly, is looking fondly on Core Scientific's possible pivot, not all pivots away from BTC mining have gone this well. As CoinDesk recently reported, Bit Digital is dumping its bitcoin rigs to go all-in on Ethereum staking , and the market pushed down its stock by 15% during the Thursday trading session in New York. Canaan, once hoping to diversify into AI hardware, has now shuttered its chip unit entirely after failing to gain traction. Its stock is down nearly 75% in the last six months, and closed at 63 cents on Thursday. But Core Scientific might have found the middle path, leveraging its mining-built footprint to tap into a $100 billion-plus AI infrastructure boom. If Cantor’s thesis proves right, CoreWeave’s second offer for CORZ could look very different from the one they made last year , and it could mark a new blueprint for the rest of the sector. Neither CoreWeave nor Core Scientific has publicly commented on the matter.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/core-scientific-could-top-30-on-coreweave-buyout-deal-cantor-fitzgerald,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Mining|Corz|Coreweave|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T19:20:27,"Strategy is facing multiple lawsuits over $6B in unrealized Bitcoin losses and alleged investor deception","Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, is facing mounting legal pressure with at least five class-action suits accusing the company of security fraud. The accusations are based on its unrealized losses of $6 billion in its Bitcoin portfolio and accuse the corporation of not sufficiently disclosing risks to investors. According to the plaintiffs, the company issued untrue and misleading statements for 11 months, beginning in April 2024 and lasting until April 2025. The lawsuits allege that Strategy presented the Bitcoin volatility and the effects of the new accounting alteration in a weak manner. Investors contend that the failure to submit these risks led to a significant decline in share price. In the first case to be led by an investor, Abhey Parmar, he claims that the executives of Strategy Inc. had breached fiduciary duties and exaggerated the firm’s financial prospects. One of the main allegations is that CEO Phong Le and CFO Andrew Kang sold 31.5 million worth of the company before publicly announcing the changes in Bitcoin accounting. According to legal experts, this is common in large-scale class actions where law firms will bid to be appointed lead counsel. Stock gains amid legal scrutiny Strategy shares are up 28% year-to-date through all the legal headwinds, signaling continued investor confidence in its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. The firm now has 592,345 BTC worth more than $63 billion. Strategy has an average purchase price of $70,702 per coin, and Bitcoin is trading at $106,824, an unrealized gain of $21.3 billion, roughly a 51% gain. The founder and chairman of Strategy, Michael Saylor, remained the largest individual shareholder. He owns close to 20 million shares as of the last SEC filing, which translates to approximately $7.8 billion using the current stock price of $389.50 per share. Other significant shareholders are Vanguard (8.55%), BlackRock (5.80%), Capital International Investors (5.80%), Susquehanna Securities (4.82%), and Jane Street Group (4.70%). Despite the growing scrutiny, the company has maintained the same long-term approach to Bitcoin, which involves frequent buy-ups no matter the market conditions, and it has new fiscal backing as a result. Strategy shares ( $MSTR ) are trading at $393.24 and have a market cap of $107.51 billion, a premium of 1.67x over its net asset value. Profit warning sparked filing surge The lawsuits continued to gain traction following revelations by Strategy in April that it was expected to report no profit on Q1, attributed to unrealized losses in Bitcoin. The company cautioned in an SEC filing that it “may not be able to regain profitability in future periods.” Strategy recorded a loss of $16.49 per share in Q1. The initial class action was filed on May 16 by Pomerantz LLP, followed by individual actions by Gross Law Firm, Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman, Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, and Levi & Korsinsky. The possibility of seeing numerous claims instead of a unified lawsuit indicates a clash of legal interests and confusion among the major stakeholders who should take the initiative. So far, none of the top institutional holders of Strategy has attested to participating in any of the suits. The result may shape wider market attitudes toward corporate exposure and disclosure on Bitcoin, especially when insider trading allegations become material.

Bitcoin (BTC) is down 0.7% in the last 24 hours, now trading for $106,700, according to CoinDesk market data. The orange coin’s performance was broadly in line with the CoinDesk 20’s — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, memecoins, and exchange coins — which fell 0.7% in the same period of time. Sui (SUI) was the index’s token that experienced the biggest price change either way, and it only rose 3.3%. Crypto stocks saw more significant moves, with Coinbase (COIN) and Circle (CRCL) losing 6% and 16% respectively. The stablecoin issuer’s stock is down 40% since it topped at almost $300 on Monday. Bitcoin miners remained relatively flat on the day, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which rose more than 30% on Thursday off a report that AI Hyperscaler CoreWeave was looking into acquiring the company, although Hut 8 (HUT) fell 6.5%. The mild price action contrasted with the prospect of the White House’s tariff strategy kicking into high gear again. U.S. President Donald Trump announced that his administration would be terminating all trade discussions with Canada in light of the Digital Services Tax the country aims to impose on U.S. tech firms. “We will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven-day period,” Trump posted . The pause on reciprocal tariffs is also slated to end on July 9, but neither traditional markets nor crypto seem particularly concerned, Coinbase analysts noted in a research report. “[Markets] have largely disregarded the potential economic risks stemming from this situation… partly because this hasn’t necessarily been reflected in the economic data,” the analysts wrote. The complacency around tariffs will likely continue, they said, because they are unlikely to be as inflationary as previously expected.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/market-wrap-crypto-markets-shrug-off-new-trump-tariff-threat-as-july-deadline-looms,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Trump|Market Wrap|btc|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T19:10:17,"XRP Exhibits Strong Bullish Sentiment Despite Ripple-SEC Settlement Snag","New data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment shows that while optimism around Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) has recently cooled, retail sentiment for XRP is overwhelmingly positive. BTC and ETH, the crypto market’s top two cryptocurrencies, have both witnessed a noticeable drop in positive sentiment on social media since late May. Santiment noted that their sentiment ratios, which measure positive against negative commentary, have trended downward. This cooling in social buzz comes amid wild price volatility and downward pressure on both crypto’s prices, suggesting a more cautious stance among investors. Bitcoin is trading at $106,897 at the time of publication, down 2% over the past 30 days. The alpha crypto hit $110,266 around two weeks ago on June 10, before entering a downtrend a day after Israel launched airstrikes on Iran that tanked equities and crypto markets. Meanwhile, Ether recently dipped to $2,429. The crypto has been stuck below the psychologically important $3,000 mark for over 20 weeks following gradual erosion in trader confidence. XRP Sentiment Positive As Judge Slaps Down $50M Settlement Request In sharp contrast, XRP’s bullish-to-bearish comment ratio has climbed 2.1:1 — the highest in roughly 17 days. Santiment analysts pointed out that this spike comes after New York judge Analisa Torres denied a joint request from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple for her to grant a proposed settlement agreement that would reduce Ripple’s civil penalty to $50 million and lift the permanent injunction against the blockchain payments firm. Despite the SEC adopting a more crypto-friendly regulatory posture in recent months under its new leadership, Torres found that the law hasn’t changed. Although Torres’s ruling was a massive legal blow that could prolong the nearly five-year-long case, it seems to have unexpectedly sparked positive discussion and belief among XRP holders.

2025-06-27T19:07:01,"BTCI: $100K Sticky Bitcoin Level May Benefit Option Sellers","Summary BTCI offers high yield by selling Bitcoin options, but these distributions are a return of capital rather than true income and may erode principal over time. BTCI outperforms in flat Bitcoin markets due to its premium income, but underperforms during sharp rallies and carries a similar downside risk to holding Bitcoin directly. I suspect Bitcoin's price may remain range-bound near $100K due to the behavioral and emotional weight of this price level, creating resistance above $110K and support below $90K. Although BTCI is not suitable for long-term income or aggressive bull scenarios, it stands to outperform with a high yield if Bitcoin remains range-bound, as I suspect. Those who follow my research may know that I am skeptical of both Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and derivative-based ETFs. Both have become more popular investments among retail investors seeking low market correlation and high appreciation potential (Bitcoin) and high-income returns (option selling funds). Thus, it is little surprise that Neos Funds has seen strong inflows in its Bitcoin option strategy ETF ( BTCI ), which generates distributions by selling options on Bitcoin. Although cryptocurrencies provide potential and, in a few cases, actual economic utility, I doubt Bitcoin's potential to fulfill its primary role as a medium of exchange . For the time being, it is certainly a store of value for many, but one subject to the speculative whims led, in part, by excess liquidity conditions in the market. Derivative-based ETFs often generate dividend premiums by selling options. While strategy is attractive to many due to its double-digit yields, I believe it is frequently misunderstood as ""income,"" when in fact it is a return of capital, akin to an insurance premium for assuming risk. Given the fund's sharp rise in assets under management since its inception, and the popularity of both option selling and Bitcoin funds, I believe BTCI deserves closer inspection. Although I am generally skeptical of Bitcoin and option selling, BTCI may be an instance where this strategy is sensible, given that speculative demand for Bitcoin long options may be excessive. BTCI Outperforms in Flat Markets On the surface, BTCI has many desirable qualities. Its current distribution rate is around 30%, with a reasonable expense ratio (for a complex fund) of 0.98%. BTCI's total return since its inception late last year is 50%, significantly outperforming most equity funds over the same period, driven by both price appreciation and substantial distribution returns. Since its inception, BTCI's correlation with the S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ) is 0.44, a relatively low figure that still indicates some market exposure. Its correlation to the Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), which it owns for appreciation, is 0.98. Since its inception, BTCI has underperformed HODL on a total return basis (which accounts for fully reinvested dividends): Data by YCharts As seen in the total return ratio, BTCI underperforms sharply during large rallies in Bitcoin, such as that seen recently and after the election last November. However, BTCI outperformed slightly during the range-bound conditions in the intermediate periods. Two-thirds of BTCI is allocated to T-Bills, resulting in a BTCI SEC Yield of 2.1%, as distributions of option premiums are not considered actual dividends. The reason is that, unlike actual dividends, these premiums will weigh on BTCI's unit price over time. Approximately 25% of BTCI is allocated to the Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), which may experience minor appreciation potential in the event of a rise in the price of Bitcoin. However, most of its fluctuations come from the small portion of the fund allocated to options on the CBOE Mini Bitcoin Index, MBTX. The index is currently at 255 points, equivalent to a BTC-USD value of approximately $107K. Currently, 9.5% of BTCI is allocated to long calls at 225, providing significant appreciation potential should Bitcoin rise, though this position will be worthless should Bitcoin fall to ~$94K. About 1% of the fund is allocated to call sales at 285 and 270, respectively (about $110K-$120K in BTC terms). It also has a negative put at 225, which is approximately 1% of its holdings. Thus, roughly 2% of the fund is allocated to option sales, generating premium returns of roughly 2% by expiration in mid-July. Based on its allocations, its ratio appears to be four put short positions, two long calls, and two short calls at differing expiries. Because option price data on MBTX is not as readily available as it is on the Bitcoin fund ( GBTC ), I aligned the expiry prices from MBTX with the equivalent prices for GBTC and, using an online tool, created a rough profit payoff chart for this strategy at current GBTC option prices. I assume that implied volatility levels (which drive premiums) are roughly equivalent for GBTC options and MBTX. At the same time, GBTC trades at its NAV , meaning this payoff chart should be almost identical for BTCI based on its current holdings: Option payoff chart for GBTC, July 18th, 2 $75 long calls, 4 $75 short puts,1 $90 short call, and 1 $95 short call (OptionsProfitCalculator.com) Importantly, the total cost of each option position is in the same ratios as BTCI's allocations on its positions, with the same expiry date. Although imperfect, this should be as close as possible to BTCI's actual payoff chart from its current derivative positions. However, it does not include the quarter of the fund allocated to HODL. Accounting for that position would ""tilt"" this chart upward, showing a ~1/4 slope at the left end instead of a plateau. The 2/3rds of the fund in T-bills would very slightly lift the chart by about 30 bps, as that income will come regardless of Bitcoin's price. Fundamentally, this strategy is not significantly different than a simple covered-call approach. However, by selling options at various expiration levels, the payoff is more curved than the usual ""stair step"" seen in simple covered calls. This gives BTCI relatively high appreciation potential, with a roughly 1:1 linear payoff up to a 5% rise in Bitcoin through July 18th. If Bitcoin rises by over 10%, BTCI should increase about 7% to 8%, with more limited gains given a very sharp rise in Bitcoin. Crucially, BTCI should earn about 1% (98 bps) if Bitcoin merely sustains its current price. There is approximately 1/17th of a year between now and July 18th, meaning the annualized return of BTCI would be about 18% annualized, assuming no change in Bitcoin's price or implied volatility levels. BTCI can earn a decent yield in flat markets because Bitcoin is volatile and therefore has high option premiums to account for its added risk. GBTC's implied volatility today is 37% , far higher than seen in equity index funds, but that is one of its lowest implied volatility levels compared to recent months. This means that BTCI's premium compensation may be low compared to the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin. Bitcoin May Face Sustained Plateau Investors who reinvest their distributions back into BTCI can expect total returns that are very similar to those of Bitcoin itself. The primary difference is that BTCI's strategy generates returns in flat markets, albeit not as strong as those in sharp rallies. BTCI's downside risk is roughly the same as that of Bitcoin itself, except for a small premium cushion. That said, if BTCI's distributions are not reinvested, the position's value will inevitably decline compared to the value of Bitcoin. We can see this in the price-return ratio of BTCI to HODL: Data by YCharts Their total returns, accounting for reinvested distributions, are very close; yet, BTCI experiences chronic decay to simply long Bitcoin funds. This decay factor is larger the faster Bitcoin rises, and vice versa. For this reason, it isn't very reasonable to treat BTCI's distributions as income that can be used for personal consumption. Doing so will inevitably lead to the decay of capital over time, assuming Bitcoin does not appreciate forever . Today, Bitcoin is at a key level, aligning with its past peak before the spring correction. Both Bitcoin and gold have been in trading ranges since the May recovery: Data by YCharts Compared to gold, Bitcoin has demonstrated higher market exposure. Although gold faced small losses during the height of the last correction, it generally rose through that period as inflation expectations and concerns mounted. At the same time, Bitcoin's value crashed by around 30%, more than the value of equities. Gold continued to rise as the market recovered. From an inter-asset correlation standpoint, Bitcoin is neither countercyclical nor a hedge against monetary risk. When concerns regarding dovish monetary policies (in a recession) rise, we're generally seeing gold rally and Bitcoin decline. Changes in the liquidity conditions of retail investors likely drive the price change of Bitcoin. When individual investors report having higher cash allocations, and those allocations are declining, we generally see sharp rallies in Bitcoin. When they report having low cash positions, Bitcoin often peaks and declines. See below: Data by YCharts This relationship is not perfect. I have had a bearish sentiment on Bitcoin since late last year due to low investor sideline cash levels; yet, it rose dramatically after Trump's election, primarily due to the view that he would create a Bitcoin reserve. The reality of this plan has disappointed investors , as Trump is not aiming to buy Bitcoin with government funds, but rather is merely creating a named reserve for Bitcoin that the government already owns through civil asset forfeiture. To me, this effort mainly highlights the degree to which Bitcoin is not an asset immune to government oversight and confiscation. Nevertheless, investor cash allocations were higher last month due to a derisking effort following the correction. That may be somewhat supportive of Bitcoin, though it is unclear if cash levels have fallen significantly since, which I assume given the full recovery of most assets. In my view, it is more likely that Bitcoin struggles to break above $110K, given its momentum has slowed. To me, the more likely outcome is continued range-bound behavior around $100K, given that it is an emotionally critical threshold. Bitcoin may also crash again, potentially catalyzed by another market correction due to the upcoming end of delayed tariffs , though recent news suggests the deadline will be delayed yet again . However, considering only Bitcoin's fundamentals, I believe a range-bound outlook is the most reasonable, particularly given that gold is also in a trading range. The Bottom Line If Bitcoin fluctuates around the $90K to $110K range for a prolonged period, BTCI stands to outperform Bitcoin, earning premiums in a flat market. For this reason, I remain neutral on BTCI, but I believe it may have some speculative short-term value in relation to Bitcoin itself. Of course, there's an argument that Bitcoin may see a huge rally if it breaks above $110K. BTCI is likely to underperform in a massive rally and has roughly the same downside risk should the rally reverse. In my opinion, that is unlikely, given the behavioral and emotional importance of $100K, which provides a ""stickiness factor"" that may keep it around this level. A flat Bitcoin price is ideal for BTCI because it will earn high premiums with less volatility if that is sustained.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797848-btci-100k-sticky-bitcoin-level-may-benefit-option-sellers?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","BTCI",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T19:00:16,"Bitcoin Treasury Soars: BD Multimedia’s Bold BTC Strategy Unveiled","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Soars: BD Multimedia’s Bold BTC Strategy Unveiled In the evolving landscape of corporate finance, a significant shift is underway as more companies explore the potential of digital assets. This week, France-based fintech innovator BD Multimedia made headlines, announcing a substantial addition of 10.95 BTC to its balance sheet. This move not only boosted their total Bitcoin treasury to 14.75 BTC but also highlighted their forward-thinking approach to capital management. What does this strategic acquisition mean for the company, and what insights can we glean from their innovative financing method? Why is BD Multimedia Making Waves with Bitcoin? BD Multimedia , a prominent player in the fintech space, has consistently demonstrated an appetite for innovation. Their recent acquisition of 10.95 BTC, announced via X (formerly Twitter), isn’t just another crypto purchase; it’s a deliberate step in a meticulously planned Bitcoin strategy . This isn’t their first foray into holding digital assets, but it certainly marks a significant increase in their overall BTC holdings , more than doubling their previous stash. The company financed this latest purchase through a custom convertible bond facility. This unique financing mechanism allows them to secure Bitcoin exposure while managing capital efficiently, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of both traditional finance and the nascent digital asset market. It signals a long-term commitment, moving beyond speculative trading to integrate Bitcoin as a core component of their financial reserves. Unpacking BD Multimedia’s Astute Bitcoin Strategy The decision by BD Multimedia to use a convertible bond facility for their Bitcoin acquisition speaks volumes about their confidence and their structured approach. Unlike simply buying BTC on the open market with cash, a convertible bond offers flexibility and potentially more favorable terms, aligning with a long-term vision rather than short-term gains. This method suggests that BD Multimedia views Bitcoin not just as a volatile asset, but as a strategic reserve with potential for significant future appreciation. Their Bitcoin strategy is clear: to leverage the unique properties of digital assets to strengthen their balance sheet and potentially hedge against traditional economic pressures. This proactive stance positions them among a growing cohort of public companies that are recognizing Bitcoin’s role in a diversified corporate treasury. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: A Global Phenomenon? BD Multimedia ‘s move is part of a broader, accelerating trend. More and more companies are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, transforming their traditional corporate treasuries into dynamic digital asset portfolios. This shift is driven by various factors, including inflation concerns, the search for uncorrelated assets, and a belief in the long-term value proposition of decentralized digital currencies. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Marathon Digital Holdings have led the charge, accumulating substantial corporate Bitcoin reserves. Their rationale often includes treating Bitcoin as a superior store of value, a hedge against currency debasement, or simply a strategic investment in the future of finance. Company Approx. BTC Holdings (as of recent data) Primary Rationale MicroStrategy ~214,400 BTC Primary treasury reserve asset, growth strategy Tesla ~9,720 BTC Diversification, digital asset investment Marathon Digital Holdings ~17,800 BTC Self-mined holdings, long-term asset BD Multimedia 14.75 BTC Long-term treasury strategy, structured capital This table illustrates that while BD Multimedia ‘s BTC holdings might seem modest compared to giants like MicroStrategy, their proportional commitment and innovative financing method are equally significant, setting a precedent for smaller to mid-cap companies. Navigating the Bitcoin Treasury Landscape: Benefits and Challenges Embracing a Bitcoin treasury strategy comes with both compelling advantages and notable risks. For companies considering this path, understanding these dynamics is crucial. Benefits: Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth, offering a potential boost to a company’s balance sheet. Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply, Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, preserving purchasing power. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can diversify a corporate treasury, reducing reliance on traditional financial instruments. Innovation & Brand Image: Adopting digital assets can signal a company’s forward-thinking nature, potentially attracting tech-savvy talent and investors. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant fluctuations, posing risks to a company’s financial stability if not managed carefully. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which can create unpredictable challenges for companies holding digital assets. Security Risks: Storing and securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust cybersecurity measures to prevent hacks and theft. Accounting Complexities: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and reporting. For companies like BD Multimedia , these challenges are weighed against the potential rewards, often leading to structured approaches like convertible bonds to mitigate some of the immediate risks while still gaining exposure. What’s Next for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? BD Multimedia ‘s latest move serves as a compelling case study for how companies, particularly in the fintech sector, are integrating digital assets into their core financial strategies. Their use of a custom convertible bond facility could become a blueprint for others looking to bolster their BTC holdings without immediately impacting cash reserves. As the digital economy matures, the concept of a Bitcoin treasury will likely become more mainstream. Companies that proactively explore and implement thoughtful Bitcoin strategy , like BD Multimedia, may find themselves at a significant advantage, not just financially but also in terms of market positioning and innovation.

2025-06-27T18:57:31,"Crypto Exchange Bakkt Seeks SEC Approval To Raise $1 Billion For Potential Bitcoin Treasury Play","Bakkt, a struggling crypto trading venue owned by Intercontinental Exchange, has notified the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of its plans to raise up to $1 billion through various types of securities offerings to fund a Bitcoin acquisition strategy. In a prospectus filed with the SEC on Thursday, Bakkt said the shelf offering could include sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, warrants, and debt securities. The S-3 filing noted that Bakkt announced an updated investment policy earlier this month “to enable us to allocate capital into Bitcoin and other digital assets as part of our broader treasury and corporate strategy,” though the company has not yet made its first purchase. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources,” the filing highlighted. The shelf registration allows Bakkt to quickly access capital markets whenever market conditions become favorable. According to the Atlanta-based exchange, the timing and size of any BTC buys will “depend on market conditions, capital market receptivity, business performance, and other strategic considerations.” Firms Follow Strategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Bakkt’s plans come as an increasing number of public companies begin to hold the alpha cryptocurrency as an alternative asset on their balance sheets. There are now roughly 140 public companies worldwide that have implemented some form of Bitcoin treasury, with Cantor-backed Twenty One , Trump Media , and GameStop recently joining the likes of Metaplanet and Semler Scientific in adopting the BTC acquisition model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy. Elon Musk’s Tesla also holds $1.2 billion of Bitcoin as of publication time. Strategy is currently the world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder with its 592,345 BTC stack. That’s the equivalent of nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply. And firms are branching out beyond Bitcoin for their corporate treasuries, too.

In a disclosure filed on Jun. 25, the company stated that it acquired the bitcoins for approximately 19.3 billion yen, or around $133 million, paying an average price of about 15.6 million yen, roughly $107,900, per BTC. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,234 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 12,345 BTC* pic.twitter.com/ppeGIrfVfe — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 26, 2025 With this latest purchase, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached 12,345 BTC, placing it ahead of Tesla, which holds 11,509 BTC. The company is now the fifth-largest public holder of Bitcoin globally. The only firms with larger holdings are Strategy , Marathon Digital, Galaxy Digital, and Riot Platforms, all of which operate with a crypto-native focus. Metaplanet began its Bitcoin accumulation strategy in April 2024. Since the start of 2025, the total value of its BTC holdings has risen by 315%, reflecting both the timing of its purchases and the broader surge in Bitcoin’s price. Investor sentiment has remained strong. Earlier in June, when the company announced plans for its latest acquisition, its stock rose nearly 7% in a single trading day, reaching a high of 1,595 yen, or approximately $11. Why a Bitcoin strategy made sense Metaplanet was founded in 1999 and spent much of its early life in traditional industries, primarily operating in hospitality and corporate services. The company managed hotels and ran an investor relations consultancy, remaining a relatively low-profile business in Japan’s broader economic environment. Over time, financial challenges began to emerge. Japan’s economy was also showing signs of deeper strain, shaped by long-term structural stagnation, rising public debt, and persistently low interest rates that made it difficult for companies to preserve capital value. In early 2024, Metaplanet’s leadership responded by shifting direction. The board adopted a Bitcoin-first treasury strategy, formally recognizing Bitcoin as a primary reserve asset in April 2024. Company executives pointed to a weakening yen and declining real returns on cash as key reasons behind the move. Shortly afterward, Metaplanet published what it called the Bitcoin Manifesto. The document outlined a long-term commitment to prioritizing Bitcoin across its treasury and capital allocation decisions. The strategy began modestly. In April 2024, the company purchased 117.7 BTC at an average cost of around 10.2 million yen per coin, or approximately $6.5 million. The announcement triggered a swift market reaction. Metaplanet’s stock rose from around 20 yen to 35 yen the same day, or roughly $0.13 to $0.22 in dollar terms. As of Jun. 27, MTPLF trades at $1,500 yen, up over 75-times since adopting the BTC-strategy. As the plan gained momentum, the company began repositioning itself more aggressively. It announced plans to open a Bitcoin-themed hotel and acquired the license to operate Bitcoin Magazine in Japan. To fund its Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet chose to raise capital through equity issuance rather than debt, using nearly all proceeds from share sales to purchase additional Bitcoin. As Bitcoin’s price climbed and investor interest strengthened, Metaplanet scaled up its ambitions. It launched the 210 Million Plan in January 2023, targeting 30,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026. In June 2025, the company introduced a more expansive initiative called the 555 Million Plan. Under this program, Metaplanet announced it would issue 555 million new shares over two years to raise approximately 780 billion yen in capital. The stated goal is to accumulate up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, representing close to 1% of Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins. As a result of ongoing equity raises, the number of outstanding shares has expanded significantly, reaching around 760 million by mid-2025. Metaplanet has acknowledged the risks associated with frequent share issuance, particularly the potential for shareholder dilution. To address this, the company introduced a metric it calls Bitcoin yield, which tracks the amount of BTC held per share. The structure aims to ensure that each round of fundraising brings in more Bitcoin than the proportional increase in shares, allowing BTC-per-share to rise over time. The company targets a 35% increase in Bitcoin yield each quarter. If achieved consistently, this would make each fundraising round accretive. However, the model carries sharp risks. A quick decline in Bitcoin’s price or lower-than-expected fundraising results could reduce yield growth, diminishing the benefit to shareholders. First profit since 2017 Metaplanet’s move to a Bitcoin-focused treasury model has fundamentally reshaped its financial profile. After several years of operating losses, the company reported a full-year operating profit in 2024, marking its first return to profitability since 2017. Revenue rose from 261 million yen (approximately $1.8 million) in fiscal 2023 to 1,062 million yen (around $7.3 million) in fiscal 2024. The company recorded an operating profit of 350 million yen (about $2.4 million), reversing a prior-year loss of 468 million yen (roughly $3.2 million). The shift in Metaplanet’s asset base has been even more pronounced. Total assets increased from 1,666 million yen (around $11.5 million) to 30,325 million yen (approximately $209.7 million). Net assets grew from 1,152 million yen (about $8 million) to 18,923 million yen (nearly $130.9 million). Positive momentum has carried into fiscal 2025. In the first quarter alone, Metaplanet reported operating profit of approximately 550 million yen (around $3.8 million). The figure ranks among the highest quarterly results in the company’s history, supported by rising Bitcoin prices, continued coin accumulation, and yield generated from Bitcoin-backed financial activities. Metaplanet’s growing financial position has also elevated its role in public markets. It is now recognized as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in Asia. Within Japan, it remains the only publicly listed firm using Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. Investor interest has followed. Before adopting its Bitcoin strategy, Metaplanet had a few thousand shareholders. Today, it counts more than 60,000 investors, spanning both retail and institutional participants. Among retail investors in Japan, demand has been driven in part by the country’s tax environment. Capital gains on direct crypto holdings can be taxed at rates as high as 55%, making equity-based exposure through listed companies a more attractive alternative. Institutional attention has grown as well. Metaplanet stock has been included in several exchange-traded funds, both domestically and internationally. It is increasingly viewed as a non-traditional growth vehicle that offers indirect access to Bitcoin through regulated equity markets. Asia’s corporate playbook evolving To better understand how Metaplanet’s rise is being viewed within the industry, Crypto.news spoke with Charlie Hu, co-founder of Bitlayer, who shared his perspective on the firm’s trajectory and evolving strategy. When asked how Metaplanet’s approach compares to that of MicroStrategy, Hu described the difference as both structural and regional. “MicroStrategy’s approach is focused on large convertible debt raises and a long-term hodl thesis. Metaplanet’s approach seems to be more regionally specific, making Bitcoin an important part of its corporate identity while riding and leading the wave of institutional adoption in Asia. It’s also starting from a smaller base, meaning new purchases represent outsized percentage growth relative to its market cap.” Hu sees Metaplanet’s 210,000 BTC target as a potential signal to the broader corporate landscape in Asia. “Any large institutional purchase could significantly impact supply dynamics. Most importantly it will signal Asian corporations that Bitcoin exposure is no longer fringe. Of course, potential discussions around regulation could also arise.” On whether Metaplanet’s profit model is sustainable — given its heavy reliance on Bitcoin price appreciation—Hu emphasized the importance of investor communication and risk handling. “We’ve been in the market long enough to know that there is always volatility risk in Bitcoin. If these risks are leveraged correctly and communicated to Metaplanet’s investors, then the company is set to win in the long term.” So far, Metaplanet’s strategy has benefited from a favorable macro and market cycle. Future performance may depend on how it adapts when conditions are less supportive.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/after-a-7500-run-on-bitcoin-metaplanet-is-set-to-win/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Feature|Exclusive|Bitcoin|Tesla",cryptocompare

Kashkari’s insights offer a glimpse into the potential trajectory of U.S. monetary policy, which, in turn, can influence everything from borrowing costs for everyday consumers to the speculative appetite for digital currencies. Let’s delve deeper into what these anticipated rate adjustments could signify for the economy and the ever-evolving crypto market. What Are the Prospects for Fed Rate Cuts in 2025? According to Walter Bloomberg on X, U.S. Federal Reserve’s Neel Kashkari recently stated his expectation of two Fed rate cuts in 2025, with the first potentially occurring as early as September. This projection comes at a pivotal time when global economies are navigating persistent inflation, geopolitical tensions, and varying growth trajectories. For context, the Federal Reserve has maintained relatively high interest rates in an effort to combat inflation, which surged significantly in the post-pandemic era. These higher rates make borrowing more expensive, which in theory, slows down economic activity and cools price increases. Kashkari’s outlook suggests that by 2025, the Fed may feel confident enough in its progress against inflation to begin easing its restrictive stance. The timing, particularly the September possibility, indicates a data-dependent approach, where the Fed will closely monitor inflation trends, employment figures, and overall economic health before making any definitive moves. Who is Neel Kashkari and Why Does His Monetary Policy Stance Matter? Neel Kashkari serves as the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis and is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body responsible for setting U.S. monetary policy. His views carry significant weight because they offer insights into the internal deliberations and varying perspectives within the Fed. Kashkari has often been characterized as one of the more ‘hawkish’ members of the FOMC, meaning he typically prioritizes controlling inflation, even if it means higher interest rates for longer periods. Given this background, his projection of two rate cuts in 2025 is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a growing consensus, or at least a significant consideration, within the Fed that the economy might be on a path where easing rates becomes feasible without reigniting inflationary pressures. Understanding the individual stances of FOMC members like Kashkari helps market participants gauge the likely direction of future monetary policy decisions. Understanding the Broader Economic Outlook and its Implications The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy , primarily through interest rate adjustments, plays a crucial role in shaping the overall economic outlook . When the Fed cuts interest rates, it typically aims to stimulate economic growth. Here’s how: Cheaper Borrowing: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers. This encourages companies to invest in expansion, hire more staff, and consumers to take out loans for big purchases like homes and cars. Increased Spending: With lower borrowing costs, disposable income might increase, leading to higher consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Asset Valuation: Lower rates can make bonds less attractive, pushing investors towards riskier assets like stocks, and potentially, cryptocurrencies, in search of higher returns. However, the Fed must always balance stimulating growth with managing inflation. Cutting rates too soon or too aggressively could lead to a resurgence of inflation, undoing previous efforts. The dual mandate of the Fed is to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and rate decisions are always a careful calibration between these two objectives. Kashkari’s forecast implies a belief that by 2025, the balance will tip towards needing less restrictive policy to maintain economic momentum without compromising price stability. The Ripple Effect: Analyzing the Crypto Market Impact For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions are not just distant economic news; they are critical market movers. The anticipated crypto market impact of potential Fed rate cuts in 2025 is generally seen as positive, largely due to the inverse relationship between interest rates and risk appetite. Here’s why: Increased Liquidity: Lower interest rates mean that money is cheaper to borrow and less attractive to keep in traditional savings accounts or low-yield bonds. This encourages investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Risk-On Sentiment: A more accommodative monetary policy fosters a ‘risk-on’ environment. When traditional investments offer lower returns, investors are more willing to allocate capital to volatile, high-growth assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Dollar Weakness: Rate cuts can sometimes lead to a weaker U.S. dollar. As cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are often priced against the dollar, a weaker dollar can make them appear relatively more valuable, potentially driving up their price. Historically, periods of low interest rates have often coincided with bull runs in the crypto market, as ample liquidity flows into the ecosystem. Conversely, periods of rising rates (like the recent past) have often seen capital flow out of riskier assets. While crypto markets are influenced by many factors, including technological advancements, regulatory news, and adoption rates, the macro-economic backdrop set by central banks remains a dominant force. Let’s consider a simplified comparison: Interest Rate Environment Traditional Assets (e.g., Bonds, Savings) Crypto Assets High Rates (Current) More attractive yields, safer returns Less attractive, potential capital flight, ‘crypto winter’ Low Rates (Anticipated 2025) Less attractive yields, search for higher returns More attractive, ‘risk-on’ sentiment, potential for growth What Challenges Could Derail This Economic Outlook? While Kashkari’s forecast offers a hopeful sign, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential challenges that could alter this economic outlook . Inflation, while cooling, could prove stickier than anticipated due to unforeseen supply chain disruptions, geopolitical events, or a resurgence in demand. A persistently strong labor market, while positive for employment, could also put upward pressure on wages and, consequently, prices, making the Fed hesitant to cut rates. Furthermore, the global economic landscape is constantly shifting. Major economies experiencing slowdowns or financial instability could impact the U.S. economy, potentially necessitating a different monetary policy response. The Fed’s decisions are always data-dependent, meaning any significant shift in economic indicators could lead to a revision of their plans. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for Fed rate cuts and their associated crypto market impact , what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor official Federal Reserve communications, economic data releases (inflation, employment), and statements from key FOMC members. These are crucial for understanding potential shifts in policy. Understand the Macro Landscape: Recognize that cryptocurrency prices are not solely driven by their underlying technology but are also heavily influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions. Diversify and Manage Risk: While lower rates can be bullish for crypto, volatility remains inherent. Diversifying your portfolio and implementing robust risk management strategies are always advisable. Look Beyond the Headlines: A single statement from one Fed official is an indicator, not a guarantee. The collective consensus of the FOMC and actual economic data will ultimately drive policy. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Finance Neel Kashkari’s projection of two Fed rate cuts in 2025 signals a potential pivot in U.S. monetary policy , moving towards a less restrictive stance. This shift, driven by an improving economic outlook and a continued battle against inflation, holds significant implications for all financial markets, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. While the prospect of lower interest rates could usher in a more favorable environment for digital assets, the path forward remains dependent on evolving economic data and the Federal Reserve’s cautious, data-driven approach. For investors, staying vigilant, understanding the interplay between macroeconomics and crypto, and adapting strategies accordingly will be key to navigating the opportunities and challenges ahead.

2025-06-27T18:46:33,"Dogecoin consolidates at key support zone as volume remains subdued","Dogecoin is trading within a tight volume-defined range between support at $0.15 and resistance at $0.23. With volume still below average, a confirmed breakout requires stronger buyer engagement. Following a corrective move from recent highs, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has stabilized within a key trading range. Price action is now compressing between the value area low, which aligns with high timeframe support at $0.15—and overhead resistance at the point of control. This structure suggests DOGE may be forming a bottoming base that could fuel the next leg higher. Key technical points Strong Support at $0.15: Value area low aligns with HTF support and a key swing low. Resistance at POC: The point of control is capping price for now, requiring a reclaim to shift structure. Volume Remains Below Average: No breakout likely until volume influx supports price expansion. DOGEUSDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView DOGE is currently navigating a volume-defined trading range, oscillating between the value area low and value area high, with price now sitting near the lower boundary of this range. The $0.15 support level has held firm, acting as both a structural pivot and psychological zone, reinforced by the proximity of a key swing low. While price has rejected from the point of control, a region with the most traded volume, there is no significant follow-through to the downside. This supports the idea that DOGE is in accumulation rather than breakdown. The lack of volume, however, is notable. Any confirmed reversal or breakout will require a visible volume influx, something that has been absent over the past several weeks. Without this, price action is likely to continue consolidating within the current range. You might also like: Is the crypto bull run here? Bitcoin wavers as traders take profits A proper bottoming structure is still in development. If DOGE can continue holding above $0.15 while compressing beneath resistance, a reclaim of the POC would be a key early signal of strength. If price can establish multiple closes above the POC, the door opens to an impulsive move back toward the $0.23 resistance zone, and potentially the swing high, provided volume and momentum align. Until that occurs, the most likely scenario is continued sideways movement with a slight bullish bias, especially given the support confluence at $0.15. What to expect in the coming price action Dogecoin is consolidating near key support with decreasing volatility. As long as $0.15 holds, a reclaim of the point of control could initiate a rotation toward $0.23. Traders should watch closely for volume spikes and structural reclaim signals before anticipating directional breakout momentum.

In a new announcement, Hochul says nearly three million New Yorkers will receive $2.2 billion in tax breaks through the state’s School Tax Relief (STAR) program. “Summer is here – and it’s also the start of STAR tax relief season for millions of New Yorkers. From tax credits to child care assistance and much more, we’re continuing to put more money back in New Yorkers’ pockets.” Under the STAR program, eligible homeowners and seniors receive property tax relief by having their school tax burden reduced. Some have already received their benefit in the form of a tax exemption this year, but others are due to receive the benefit as a tax credit sent via check. Checks will be mailed out beginning next week. Most eligible homeowners, those with incomes below $500,000, will receive a check between $350 and $600, while eligible seniors, those with incomes below $107,300, will receive a check between $700 and $1,500. In New York City alone, 483,000 residents will receive checks totaling $158.6 million. Meanwhile, 582,000 Long Island residents will receive a combined $698.4 million. Residents can track the delivery of the sent check or enroll in direct deposit using ny.gov/STAR.

2025-06-27T18:41:16,"International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Urges Global Action on Crypto Risks","An international financial watchdog group based in France is urging stronger global actions against the risks associated with crypto assets. In a newly published study , the International Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – established in 1989 to promote policies that protect the global financial system – says that stronger actions are needed by crypto service providers to ensure safety. According to FATF, while virtual asset service providers (VASPs) overall have made headway in terms of developing anti-money laundering protocols, progress still needs to be made on this front, highlighting the challenges associated with overseas providers. “Progress has been made in jurisdictions requiring licensing and registration of VASPs. Nevertheless, further progress is required in licensing and registration in practice and jurisdictions continue to face difficulties in identifying natural or legal persons that conduct VASP activities. Jurisdictions have reported challenges with mitigating the risk of offshore VASPs, with more than a third of jurisdictions with a licensing or registration framework applying a more extensive approach and requiring offshore VASPs (that are not created or located in their jurisdictions) to also be licensed/registered.” According to FATF, many jurisdictions are in the process of creating “travel rules,” or rules set in place to ensure the transparency of cross-border crypto transfers. “Jurisdictions have made progress on implementing the Travel Rule. For the 2025 survey, 73% of respondents (85 of 117 jurisdictions, excluding those that prohibit or plan to prohibit VASPs explicitly) have passed legislation implementing the Travel Rule… Jurisdictions that have not yet introduced legislation or regulation to implement the Travel Rule should urgently do so [while] jurisdictions that have introduced the Travel Rule should rapidly operationalize it, including through effective supervision and enforcement in case of non-compliance.” FATF concludes by noting that since digital assets are international by nature, a regulatory failure in one jurisdiction, such as North Korea, can have severe global consequences. “The DPRK this year carried out the largest single VA theft in history, stealing $1.46 billion from the VASP ByBit. Only 3.8% of the stolen funds have been recovered, highlighting the need to address asset recovery challenges and improve international cooperation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-27T18:31:15,"Bitcoin ETFs: Calamos Launches Revolutionary Protection Funds","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs: Calamos Launches Revolutionary Protection Funds Are you an investor intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin but wary of its notorious volatility? The wait for a more structured approach to digital asset investing might finally be over. Calamos Investments, a prominent U.S. asset management firm, is set to revolutionize how investors gain exposure to cryptocurrencies with the launch of three innovative Bitcoin ETFs . These new funds promise a unique blend of upside potential and crucial downside protection, marking a significant step forward in the institutional adoption of digital assets. Understanding the New Era of Bitcoin ETFs On July 8, Calamos will introduce three distinct Bitcoin-structured ETFs: CBOY, CBXY, and CBTY. These aren’t your typical spot Bitcoin ETFs. Instead, they fall under the category of ‘defined outcome’ ETFs, designed to offer investors a predictable range of returns over a specific period. This structure is particularly appealing for those seeking to participate in Bitcoin’s growth while mitigating some of its inherent risks. CBOY, CBXY, and CBTY: Each ticker represents a unique level of downside protection, allowing investors to choose the risk profile that best suits their financial goals. One-Year Protection Period: The downside protection is offered over a defined one-year period, providing clarity and a structured investment horizon. Annual Reset Feature: At the end of each year, the ETFs will reset, establishing new upside caps and downside protection levels based on market conditions, offering continuous adaptability. The Innovative Approach of Calamos Investments This strategic move by Calamos Investments highlights a growing trend among traditional financial institutions to cater to the increasing demand for regulated and sophisticated crypto investment vehicles. Unlike direct Bitcoin ownership, these ETFs provide a wrapper that simplifies access for traditional brokerage accounts and offers a layer of professional management. The management of these groundbreaking funds will be overseen by Co-CIO Eli Pars and the dedicated Alternatives Team at Calamos. Their expertise in managing complex financial products is expected to provide robust oversight and strategic adjustments, ensuring the ETFs align with their stated objectives of offering defined outcomes. Why Crypto Protection is a Game Changer For many potential investors, the wild price swings of Bitcoin have been a significant deterrent. The concept of crypto protection embedded within these ETFs directly addresses this concern. By offering varying levels of downside protection, Calamos aims to attract a broader audience, including risk-averse investors, institutional clients, and financial advisors looking for more stable ways to allocate capital to the digital asset space. This innovative structure provides a sense of security, allowing investors to participate in Bitcoin’s potential appreciation without the constant fear of sudden, significant losses. It’s a bridge between the high-growth potential of cryptocurrencies and the risk management principles common in traditional finance. Navigating the Upside Caps in Defined Outcome ETFs While the downside protection is a major draw, it’s crucial for investors to understand the trade-off: the ETFs come with defined upside caps. This means that while you’re protected from significant losses beyond a certain point, your potential gains are also limited. These caps are set at the beginning of each one-year period and reset annually. This characteristic is fundamental to all defined outcome ETFs . They are designed to offer a known range of potential returns, making them suitable for investors who prioritize predictable outcomes over unlimited upside potential. It’s about managing expectations and providing a more controlled investment experience in a notoriously volatile market. The Future of Digital Asset Investing The launch of these Calamos ETFs signifies a maturing landscape for digital asset investing . It reflects a growing sophistication in product development, moving beyond simple spot exposure to more nuanced, risk-managed strategies. As more traditional firms enter the space with diverse offerings, it paves the way for greater institutional adoption and wider accessibility for retail investors. This evolution is critical for integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream investment portfolios, offering investors more choices and tailored solutions to meet their unique risk tolerances and financial objectives. It underscores the long-term viability and increasing legitimacy of digital assets as a recognized asset class. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Bitcoin Exposure Calamos Investments’ forthcoming launch of CBOY, CBXY, and CBTY on July 8 marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency investment landscape. By offering defined downside protection coupled with upside caps, these innovative Bitcoin ETFs provide a compelling option for investors seeking a more controlled and predictable way to gain exposure to the world’s leading digital asset. This move not only expands the accessibility of Bitcoin but also sets a new standard for risk-managed investment products in the evolving digital asset ecosystem. It’s an exciting development that promises to reshape how many approach their crypto portfolios.

The flagship coin has struggled to rally beyond $108k in the weekly timeframe, thus signaling possible midterm weakness. Although institutional investors, led by Strategy and Metaplanet , have continued to relentlessly accumulate more BTCs, market data shows the appetite for long exposure has faded over time. According to market data from Glassnode, Bitcoin’s spot volume has hovered at around $7.7 billion in the recent past, far below the prior peaks. Why Traders Are Cautious About Bitcoin Price Consolidation Bitcoin price has failed to record similar bullish gains as Gold (XAUUSD) in the past few months despite the U.S. dollar losing around 10 percent in value since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. The short-term market uncertainty caused by the sharp differences between the Federal Reserve and the government of the day on Interest rates has reduced the overall BTC speculation. According to Aksel Kibar , a popular classical chart trader, the BTC price has gradually formed a potential head and shoulders (H&S) pattern in the weekly timeframe. Although the buyers have been attempting to push higher in the recent past, Kibar highlighted that BTC price must consistently close above $109k in the weekly timeframe to confirm bullish momentum. With the poor performance of the trade negotiations between the United States and other nations led by Canada, Japan, and the European Union, the BTC price faces a midterm bearish outlook. As Coinpedia reported, BTC price is likely to retest $92k before reaching $120k in the near term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-analysis-low-speculative-urgency-signals-more-pain-in-the-midterm/,"ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The IRS is now getting better access to crypto transaction data as it prepares for new reporting rules. Notably, the IRS sends different types of letters about crypto taxes. Some are just reminders, while others warn of possible missing income. The most serious ones claim underreporting and may lead to audits or a tax bill, often needing a response within 30 days. Accounting firms have also noticed the trend, as more clients enquire about unexpected letters. Many everyday investors still lack a comprehensive understanding of their tax responsibilities regarding cryptocurrency, resulting in confusion and concern. Although some political leaders have discussed removing taxes on cryptocurrency , no new legislation has been passed. For now, the IRS is getting stricter, and many regular investors are being affected. New Crypto Tax Rules Are Coming Starting in 2026, crypto brokers will be required to report both the total amount and the original cost of digital asset sales to the IRS. This will be done through a new form called 1099-DA. The goal is to minimize errors and enhance accuracy in tax reporting. This will give the IRS a clearer view of investors’ crypto profits and losses. Notably, this upcoming rule will not affect decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. In March, President Donald Trump repealed a controversial IRS rule that would have forced DeFi platforms to disclose transaction details. However, centralized platforms still have to report user activity. This new rule is expected to bring big changes to how crypto is taxed in the U.S. Profits Rise, But Tax Mistakes Trigger IRS Warnings Earlier this year, CoinLedger shared that the average crypto investor made over $5,000 in profits in 2024. According to reports, most gains were attributed to Bitcoin (BTC) and other newer altcoins, while coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) experienced losses. Kemmerer stated that many people receiving IRS letters are not avoiding taxes; most make small mistakes or forget to report older activity. A common issue is wallet-to-wallet transfers, which are not taxed but can cause confusion if not tracked properly. As crypto taxes become more strict, it is more important than ever to report accurately and stay compliant.

2025-06-27T18:20:15,"Bitcoin’s Crucial June: Unveiling Its Weakest Monthly Performance in a Year","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Crucial June: Unveiling Its Weakest Monthly Performance in a Year The world of cryptocurrency is rarely dull, but sometimes, even the most seasoned investors are left scratching their heads. Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, recently delivered a performance that has many wondering: what’s really going on? According to CoinDesk, citing compelling data from the reputable on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, Bitcoin (BTC) is poised to record a mere 2% gain in June. This figure marks its weakest monthly performance since July of the previous year, a stark contrast to the exhilarating rallies many have come to expect. While institutional adoption and robust U.S. spot ETF inflows paint a picture of growing mainstream acceptance, the underlying Bitcoin price action tells a more nuanced story. Let’s dive deeper into what Glassnode’s insights reveal about the current state of the market and what it means for you. What Does Glassnode Analysis Reveal About Bitcoin’s Recent Performance? For those closely watching the digital asset space, Glassnode is a name synonymous with in-depth market intelligence. Their Glassnode analysis provides a granular view of blockchain activity, offering insights that traditional market metrics often miss. Their latest findings paint a clear picture of a market grappling with indecision. A 2% monthly gain for Bitcoin might sound positive on paper, especially when compared to traditional assets, but for a cryptocurrency known for its volatility and parabolic surges, it signifies a significant slowdown. Historically, post-halving periods have often been characterized by periods of accumulation and subsequent explosive growth. However, this June’s Bitcoin performance suggests a different dynamic. Despite the significant influx of capital into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs – a development that many believed would consistently propel prices upward – the market seems to be hitting a ceiling. Glassnode’s data points to a curious dichotomy: while institutional interest remains strong, there’s clear selling activity occurring from both large holders (whales) and smaller, retail participants. This profit-taking behavior, while natural after a significant rally, indicates a lack of conviction for immediate upward momentum. Consider this perspective: Subdued Gains: A 2% gain is far below the double-digit, sometimes triple-digit, monthly returns seen in previous bull cycles. Historical Context: Marking the weakest performance in nearly a year highlights a significant shift from the more volatile, yet often upward-trending, price action Bitcoin has displayed. Conflicting Signals: The paradox of strong institutional inflows clashing with widespread profit-taking from existing holders creates a complex market environment. Why Are Whales and Smaller Holders Selling? Dissecting On-Chain Data It’s a question many investors are asking: if Bitcoin ETFs are attracting billions, why isn’t the price soaring? The answer lies in the fascinating world of on-chain data. Glassnode’s strength lies in tracking the actual movements of coins on the blockchain, providing unparalleled transparency into market participant behavior. Their latest report indicates that both ‘whales’ (addresses holding significant amounts of BTC) and smaller, ‘shrimp’ holders are contributing to the selling pressure. This isn’t necessarily a sign of panic, but rather a reflection of strategic profit-taking. Many long-term holders acquired their Bitcoin at much lower prices and are now realizing gains. For whales, this could be a rebalancing of portfolios, or a belief that the asset needs a period of cooling off before its next leg up. For smaller holders, it might be a response to macroeconomic uncertainties or simply cashing out profits after enduring previous bear markets. Here’s what the on-chain data implies: Realized Gains: A significant portion of the coins moving are doing so at a profit, indicating that holders are locking in returns. Supply Dynamics: While new demand from ETFs is absorbing some of this supply, it’s not enough to overcome the selling pressure from existing holders who are taking chips off the table. Market Indecision: Glassnode explicitly concluded that the market has entered another period of indecision. This means there’s no clear consensus on the next major price move, leading to choppy, sideways trading. This dynamic creates a tug-of-war: new money coming in versus existing money exiting. For the crypto market trends , this period of rebalancing is crucial. Is This Just a Temporary Pause? Understanding BTC Consolidation When an asset like Bitcoin experiences a period of sideways movement after a significant rally, analysts often refer to it as a BTC consolidation phase. This isn’t necessarily a bearish signal; in fact, it can be a healthy and necessary part of a market cycle. Consolidation allows the market to digest previous gains, shed weaker hands, and build a stronger foundation for future price movements. Think of it like a coiled spring. After a rapid expansion, the spring needs to compress before it can release energy again. During consolidation: Price Discovery Slows: Volatility often decreases, and the price tends to trade within a defined range. Accumulation or Distribution: This period can be one of accumulation (smart money buying up cheaper coins from those selling) or distribution (smart money offloading to new, less informed buyers). Glassnode’s data on whale selling suggests a mix of both, leaning towards distribution by some larger entities. Market Re-evaluation: Investors use this time to reassess fundamentals, macro factors, and future catalysts. Historically, Bitcoin has seen numerous consolidation phases, some lasting for weeks or even months, before breaking out to new highs. The key is to identify whether the current phase is merely a pause before continuation or a precursor to a deeper correction. The lack of strong immediate upward momentum despite positive news (like ETF inflows) suggests that the market needs more time to absorb new demand and overcome selling pressure. Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what does this period of indecision and consolidation mean for you, the investor? Understanding the current crypto market trends is vital for making informed decisions. While the short-term outlook may seem less exciting, it presents opportunities for those with a long-term vision. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Patience is Key: In a consolidation phase, impulsive decisions often lead to losses. Adopt a patient approach and avoid being swayed by daily price fluctuations. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, a consolidation period can be an excellent time to accumulate more BTC through DCA. This involves investing a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which helps average out your purchase price over time. Focus on Fundamentals: Revisit why you invested in Bitcoin in the first place. Its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing adoption remain strong long-term fundamentals. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Keep an eye on reports from firms like Glassnode. Understanding supply dynamics, exchange flows, and holder behavior can provide early warnings or confirmations of shifts in market sentiment. Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you’re not overexposed to any single asset. Volatility, even during consolidation, can still be significant. Educate Yourself: Use this slower period to deepen your understanding of blockchain technology, new protocols, and emerging trends within the broader crypto ecosystem. This is a time for strategic positioning, not panic. The market is maturing, and its reactions to news and data are becoming more complex. What was once a purely speculative asset is now attracting serious institutional capital, which brings with it a different set of market dynamics. The Road Ahead: What to Watch For While June’s performance has been subdued, it doesn’t necessarily signal the end of Bitcoin’s bull run. Rather, it highlights a period of necessary recalibration. Moving forward, investors should closely monitor several key indicators: ETF Inflow Consistency: Will institutional demand continue to absorb selling pressure? Sustained strong inflows could eventually tip the scales. Macroeconomic Factors: Global interest rates, inflation data, and geopolitical events continue to influence risk assets like Bitcoin. Whale Behavior: Glassnode’s future reports on whale accumulation or continued distribution will be crucial for gauging sentiment among the largest holders. Breakout/Breakdown from Consolidation: Eventually, Bitcoin will break out of its current range. Monitoring key support and resistance levels will be vital for identifying the next major move. The current phase is a test of patience and conviction for many. It’s a reminder that markets rarely move in a straight line, and periods of rest are essential for sustainable growth. In conclusion, Glassnode’s latest report serves as a crucial reality check for Bitcoin enthusiasts. While the 2% gain in June might be its weakest in a year, it underscores a healthy, albeit frustrating, consolidation phase. The market is absorbing new institutional demand while simultaneously dealing with profit-taking from existing holders. This period of indecision is a natural part of the market cycle, allowing for re-evaluation and the building of a stronger foundation. For investors, it’s a time to exercise patience, apply sound risk management, and focus on the long-term potential of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset space. The future of Bitcoin remains bright, but its path forward will likely be characterized by periods of calm reflection before the next surge.

2025-06-27T18:12:01,"Five Law Firms Files Lawsuit against Strategy Over Bitcoin","Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has become the subject of discussion among several firms, with a number of them bringing lawsuits against the Bitcoin (BTC) behemoth. It was recently reported that five law firms filed identical class action lawsuits against Strategy. Strategy Accused of Misleading Bitcoin Statements The prosecutors have charged the business intelligence software firm with securities fraud related to the Bitcoin treasury it has built over the past five years. They have accused the firm of making misleading investment statements, including some about Bitcoin and Strategy’s business, operations, and prospects. According to Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC, a nationally recognized law firm, “the anticipated profitability of the Company’s bitcoin-focused investment strategy and treasury operations was overstated.” Also, Strategy has been indicted for understating the various risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility. Nor did it reveal the magnitude of losses Strategy could attract on the value of its digital assets following its adoption of ASU 2023-08. These firms are seeking to recover damages from Strategy. To this end, more entities are encouraged to join the class action. Strategy Acquires More Bitcoin This comes only a few days after Strategy added more BTC to its growing collection. Michael Saylor, the firm’s CEO, stated that the firm purchased an additional 245 Bitcoin units at a cost of around $26 million. Each digital coin was bought at an average price of $105,856. So far, the company has acquired a total of 592,345 BTC in Bitcoin holdings. Collectively, these were acquired for about $41.87 billion but are now worth nearly $60 billion, based on the present market value of Bitcoin. Metaplanet Copies Strategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Another firm with a strong Bitcoin accumulation strategy is Metaplanet, also known as Asian MicroStrategy. This Japanese financial giant also purchased 1,111 Bitcoins for approximately $118.2 million around the same time as Strategy’s recent acquisition. Each unit of Bitcoin was acquired at an average price of $106,408. Metaplanet’s total holdings have now reached 11,111 BTC, purchased for about $1.07 billion. The Bitcoin price is currently at $107,302.30, which places the value of Metaplanet’s holding at nearly $1.12 billion. The company has achieved a strong return, reporting a 306.7% yield this year, which is significantly above most market averages.

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will likely trade sideways a little longer before reclaiming $108,500 as support and then have a massive breakout to a new ATH. “Slight consolidation before the next breakout, that’s what Bitcoin is telling us. It couldn’t break through this resistance in one-go and is therefore consolidating. That’s fine, I assume we’ll see a big breakout to an ATH when we clear $108,500.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Bitcoin is trading for $106,706 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may be on the verge of an explosive move to the upside as it holds the level around $2,400 as support. “We’re likely going to be testing the other side of the range in the upcoming weeks… I’m expecting strong continuation from ETH to be happening in the coming days/weeks as we’re holding onto the range low.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Looking at his chart, he suggests that ETH may soon hit the $2,800 level again in early July.

Altcoins, meanwhile, struggled to catch a bid. According to a Binance Research report on June 27, Bitcoin ( BTC ) weathered a volatile weekend spurred by Middle East tensions, briefly dipping below $98,000 before surging past $107,000 and outperforming traditional markets. While the S&P 500 and gold saw muted reactions, BTC’s swift recovery reinforced its status as the go-to asset during uncertainty. Ethereum ( ETH ), meanwhile, lagged with a steeper 17% drop and weaker rebound, underscoring its relative fragility in crisis moments. You might also like: Aptos hits milestone as RWA on-chain breaks $540m Bitcoin’s resilience meets altcoin indifference While Bitcoin’s rebound past $107,000 showcased its strength, the numbers reveal a stark contrast with traditional assets. Per the report, the S&P 500 gained 2.56%, a solid performance, but one that paled next to BTC’s 5% weekly surge after its weekend dip. Gold, typically a safe haven, barely moved, while oil gave up early-week gains as supply fears eased. Notably, the U.S. dollar slumped to a three-year low after President Trump’s renewed attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, reigniting concerns over central bank independence. Bitcoin’s ability to outpace other assets reinforces its dual role as both a risk asset and a hedge against political chaos. BTC once again behaved more like a strategic asset than a speculative bet. Altcoins, however, missed the memo. The divergence suggests a market that still plays by Bitcoin’s rules. Historically, BTC rallies eventually spill over into altcoins—but the 2025 cycle has defied expectations. Ethereum’s 17% weekend plunge and tepid recovery to $2,480, still below its opening price, highlighted its lagging resilience. Solana ( SOL ) and Avalanche ( AVAX ) barely budged, mirroring ETH struggles, while speculative favorites in the AI and meme coin categories lacked momentum. The indifference reveals a deeper structural shift: altcoin cycles no longer operate on autopilot. Without a unifying catalyst or narrative, the market has become fragmented, its attention diluted across thousands of competing tokens. The hidden drag on Bitcoin’s momentum Despite reclaiming $107,000, BTC is on track for its weakest monthly gain (just 2%) since July 2025, per crypto.news data. Beneath the surface, Bitcoin faces its own headwinds—a tug-of-war between institutional inflows and whale selling. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have absorbed $3.9 billion in fresh capital this month, yet on-chain metrics show large holders (10,000+ BTC) are net sellers, according to Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score. Mid-sized wallets (10–10,000 BTC) are accumulating, but opportunistically, suggesting traders are playing ranges rather than betting on a breakout. Bitcoin’s dominance is undeniable, but its solo act raises questions. For altcoins to awaken, the original cryptocurrency may need more than just stability, it might need a true catalyst that reignites risk appetite across crypto’s saturated landscape.

2025-06-27T18:00:15,"Vinanz Unleashes Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation with $631K Boost","BitcoinWorld Vinanz Unleashes Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation with $631K Boost In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, companies are continually seeking innovative ways to strengthen their financial positions and capitalize on emerging opportunities. Today, the spotlight falls on Vinanz Ltd., a UK-listed mining firm that has just made another significant move, signaling a robust commitment to its Bitcoin strategy. This latest acquisition isn’t just a headline; it’s a powerful statement about the growing confidence in Bitcoin as a treasury asset, even for companies deeply entrenched in the crypto mining sector. For those keenly following the cryptocurrency market, this development from Vinanz offers compelling insights into the strategic foresight driving some of the industry’s key players. Why Vinanz is Doubling Down on Bitcoin ? Vinanz Ltd. recently announced the purchase of an additional 5.85 BTC, valued at approximately $631,000. This brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 65.03 BTC. But why would a company primarily focused on crypto mining operations choose to accumulate Bitcoin rather than immediately liquidating its mined assets? The answer lies in a multi-faceted strategy aimed at long-term value creation and financial resilience. Strategic Treasury Management: By holding Bitcoin, Vinanz is essentially treating BTC as a primary treasury asset, akin to how traditional companies might hold gold or other stable assets. This strategy aims to hedge against inflation and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation over time. Synergy with Mining Operations: For a crypto mining firm, accumulating Bitcoin is a natural extension of its core business. They are already generating BTC through their operations; holding a portion of it aligns their balance sheet directly with the asset they produce, creating a direct upside from Bitcoin’s price movements. Market Confidence: Vinanz’s continued BTC acquisition signals strong internal confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. This can inspire investor confidence, suggesting that the company believes in the long-term viability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This approach isn’t unique to Vinanz, but their consistent accumulation highlights a growing trend among savvy companies looking to diversify and strengthen their financial foundations in the digital age. The Growing Trend of Crypto Mining Firms Building Digital Assets Treasuries Vinanz’s strategy is part of a broader movement where companies, particularly those involved in crypto mining , are increasingly opting to build substantial digital asset treasuries. This paradigm shift challenges the traditional view of corporate finance and embraces the potential of cryptocurrencies as legitimate, long-term investments. Here’s a look at why this trend is gaining momentum: Benefits of a Corporate Digital Asset Treasury: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing monetary expansion and inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often viewed as a scarce asset with a fixed supply, making it an attractive hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth potential. Holding BTC allows companies to participate directly in this growth. Balance Sheet Strength: A substantial holding of a high-value digital asset can enhance a company’s balance sheet, potentially improving its creditworthiness and attractiveness to investors. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing digital assets positions a company as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to a new generation of investors and talent. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously pioneered this corporate Bitcoin treasury model, inspiring others to follow suit. While Vinanz ‘s holdings are currently smaller, their consistent additions demonstrate a clear strategic direction that aligns with this burgeoning trend. Understanding Vinanz ‘s Strategic BTC Acquisition Vinanz Ltd.’s latest BTC acquisition , bringing their total to 65.03 BTC, underscores a deliberate and sustained effort to build a robust Bitcoin treasury. Operating mining facilities across the U.S. and Canada, Vinanz is strategically positioned in regions known for their stable energy grids and favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrency operations. This geographic diversification not only optimizes their mining efficiency but also provides a stable base from which to execute their treasury strategy. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin rather than selling it immediately to cover operational costs or generate fiat revenue speaks volumes. It suggests that Vinanz’s leadership team believes the intrinsic value and future appreciation of Bitcoin outweigh the immediate benefits of liquidation. This long-term vision is critical in the volatile crypto market, where short-term fluctuations can often obscure the broader trajectory. Consider the potential impact of such a strategy: Strategy Type Description Potential Benefits Potential Risks Bitcoin Treasury (Vinanz Model) Holding mined BTC on the balance sheet for long-term appreciation and inflation hedge. Significant upside potential from BTC price increases; strong signal of confidence in crypto. Exposure to BTC price volatility; potential liquidity challenges if immediate fiat is needed. Immediate Liquidation Selling mined BTC immediately to convert to fiat currency for operational expenses or profit. Predictable fiat revenue; reduces exposure to crypto market volatility. Missed opportunities for BTC appreciation; constant pressure to optimize fiat conversion rates. Vinanz’s choice to lean heavily into the Bitcoin Treasury model highlights a sophisticated understanding of both their operational capabilities and the macroeconomic landscape, positioning them for potential significant gains should Bitcoin continue its upward trajectory. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury? While the allure of holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset is strong, it’s crucial to acknowledge both the significant benefits and the inherent challenges. For companies like Vinanz, navigating this landscape requires careful consideration and robust risk management. Key Benefits: Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional asset portfolio can provide diversification, as its price movements often correlate differently with traditional financial markets. Attracting New Investors: A forward-thinking stance on digital assets can attract a new segment of investors who are enthusiastic about the crypto space. Cost-Efficiency (Long-term): If Bitcoin appreciates significantly, the value of the treasury could far exceed the cost of acquisition, creating substantial shareholder value. Key Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. Significant price swings can impact a company’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be complex and varies by jurisdiction, often requiring specialized expertise. Vinanz, by choosing this path, is clearly demonstrating a belief that the potential rewards outweigh these challenges, and they likely have robust strategies in place to mitigate these risks. Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Digital Assets Landscape For investors looking at companies like Vinanz, understanding their digital assets strategy is paramount. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin is not just about a single purchase; it’s indicative of a broader corporate philosophy. Here are some actionable insights: Evaluate Management’s Vision: Does the company’s leadership clearly articulate its rationale for holding crypto? Is it a speculative bet or a well-thought-out treasury strategy? Vinanz’s consistent purchases suggest the latter. Assess Risk Management: How does the company mitigate the risks associated with crypto volatility and security? Look for evidence of robust security protocols and clear risk assessment frameworks. Consider Operational Synergy: For mining companies, how well does their crypto treasury strategy integrate with their core mining operations? A strong synergy, like that seen with Vinanz, can create a powerful compounding effect. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Understand if the company is building a long-term position or making short-term trades. Companies with a long-term conviction in Bitcoin, like Vinanz, often present a more stable investment thesis in the crypto space. The move by Vinanz is a microcosm of the larger trend of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency space. As more companies explore and implement strategies involving digital assets, the market matures, and new investment opportunities emerge. Keeping an eye on these pioneering firms provides valuable indicators for the broader market trajectory. In conclusion, Vinanz Ltd.’s continued strategic accumulation of Bitcoin is a significant development, underscoring a strong belief in the long-term value of digital assets. By building a substantial Bitcoin treasury alongside its robust crypto mining operations in the U.S. and Canada, Vinanz is positioning itself not just as a miner, but as a sophisticated player in the broader digital economy. This proactive approach highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies to leverage Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, aiming for financial resilience and growth in an increasingly digital world. For investors, it serves as a compelling example of how traditional business models are adapting and thriving within the innovative landscape of cryptocurrency.

2025-06-27T18:00:15,"Bitcoin Big Investors Step Back: Whale Inflows To Exchanges See Steep Decline","Since reclaiming the $107,000 price mark on Wednesday, Bitcoin has managed to hold strongly above this key level, reflecting its robust resilience despite a recent pullback. Following the renewed upward trend, bullish sentiment is growing stronger among key BTC investors on crypto exchanges. Large Bitcoin Transfers To Exchanges Nosedive Given the recent upsurge in Bitcoin’s price , major investors on crypto exchanges are starting to turn optimistic about the asset’s future performance. Darkfost, a verified author and on-chain analyst who shared the development on X, highlighted that Bitcoin whale inflows to exchanges are experiencing a sharp decline when compared to the past month. This trend signals a potential shift in market dynamics toward a more confident state among whale holders. A sharp drop in whale inflows to exchanges reflects a retreat from immediate selling pressure , perhaps a revived preference for long-term holdings. It is mostly regarded as a bullish signal because reduced whale inflows often precede periods of price spikes, as it limits massive sell-offs. As Bitcoin broke above the $100,000 mark and pushed toward a new all-time high, Darkfost stated that large investors took advantage of the rally and secured notable gains. The same action from these holders was seen back in 2024. “Actually, the current pattern closely resembles what we saw in 2024 when BTC was reaching a new ATH,” the on-chain expert added. During this ongoing period of upward price performance, there was a brief second, lesser wave of inflows before inflows began to decline once again. This second wave of inflows was a result of the $2 billion in capital inflows recorded on June 16. However, Darkfost revealed that the inflows were entirely due to an internal transaction on Binance that moved over 20,000 BTC, while underscoring the importance of monitoring the metric on a monthly level for a much clearer signal. If whale inflows continue to reduce on exchanges and history repeats itself, the expert is confident that the development might set the stage for Bitcoin to rally to a new all-time high in the near term. BTC Next Big Move Approaching Crypto analysts, such as Titan of Crypto, have hinted at a move to a new all-time high . In his recent analysis, the technical expert and trader highlighted that BTC could be gearing up for its next major move beyond its current peak. Titan of Crypto’s forecast is supported by a key Inverse Head and Shoulders formation on the 1-month chart, which has remained valid since it emerged.

2025-06-27T17:59:07,"List of the Most Discussed Words in the Cryptocurrency Community in the Last 24 Hours Published – Two Altcoins Are Trending","Cryptocurrency analysis firm Santiment has revealed the words that have attracted the most attention in the cryptocurrency community in the last 24 hours. Here are the words popular in the cryptocurrency community according to Santiment analysts: The word 'BTC' came to the fore in light of Bitcoin's central role in cryptocurrency investment, its impact on market behavior, and its comparison to other tokens. Discussions about Bitcoin's use as a store of value and alternative currency are back on the agenda. In addition, large institutional purchases and bull market signals for Bitcoin are among the factors that triggered this rise. The word ‘July’ has become a trending topic in the crypto and financial world due to the many major events expected to take place during July. In particular, Bitcoin price predictions focusing on the end of July 2025, Coinbase launching perpetual futures on July 21, various token launches, legislative hearings being postponed until July, and regulatory initiatives such as the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act being considered in the US Senate make this month a critical juncture for the markets. Related News: BREAKING: Donald Trump Comments on Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies The word ‘Yapyo’ came to the fore thanks to the pre-sale preparations and community interactions of YAPYO, a project connected to the on-chain ecosystem on the Arbitrum blockchain. US-based digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings is in the news with its $1 billion shelf offering application. This application to the SEC has led to speculation that the company may purchase Bitcoin and expand its digital asset strategy. The policy updates that allow the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)-backed company to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet have also attracted attention. The word ‘Bhutan’ has been trending since the Asian country of Bhutan was found to have secretly mined 12,000 Bitcoins since 2020. This reserve is reportedly worth around $1.3 billion, equivalent to 40% of Bhutan’s GDP, making it the third-largest state-backed Bitcoin holder after the US and China. Bhutan’s mining operations are also supported by renewable hydroelectric power, making the country a standout in the field of sustainable mining. The word XRP is on the agenda again due to Ripple's securities lawsuit. In the ongoing litigation process with the SEC, the court rejected requests for early closure of the case. This creates uncertainty over XRP's price, institutional sales and regulatory status. On the other hand, hopeful expectations for XRP have also begun to increase with cross-chain solutions and partnerships for use in payment infrastructures. *This is not investment advice.

Per CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization stood at $3.29 trillion, underpinned by a global trading volume of $97.8 billion, albeit this being 4.4% down in the past 24 hours. While Bitcoin held above $107k and XRP hovered around $2.10, outperforming assets on the day among altcoins included Euler (EUL) and Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Meanwhile, profit taking pushed Sahara AI and Across Protocol, among others, into negative territory. Bitcoin (BTC) holds above $107k Bitcoin maintained its bullish stance, trading above $107k, with its market cap at $2.1 trillion and daily volume at $45.5 billion. The spot Bitcoin ETF market witnessed net inflows of $225.9 million, with BlackRock’s iShares ETF (IBIT) recording $162.48 million. Institutional interest remained elevated as Strategy, Metaplanet, and others all bought the dip earlier in the week.

The altcoin was holding the key level despite a legal setback after Judge Torres denied a joint SEC/Ripple motion to end an XRP institutional sales injunction. The motion for an indicative ruling also sought the court’s decision on Ripple and the SEC settlement over the $125 million penalty imposed on the company. XRP nonetheless remains bullish amid ETFs anticipation, stablecoin growth , and regulatory developments. Euler (EUL) price soars, just shy of all-time high Euler Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, saw its token EUL surge by 27% to highs of $11.13. The gains meant the EUL price was just shy of the all-time high of $12.97 reached in September 2022. Gains aligned with buying pressure as daily volume spiked over 200%. Also notable is the growth of the recently launched DEX protocol EulerSwap, which hit over $230 million in volume just weeks after its debut. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) surges 12%, above key resistance level Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) climbed 12% to $0.0104, driven by ecosystem developments. Mainly, the PENGU price has risen in the past three days after Cboe submitted its 19b-4 filing for the listing of Canary Capital’s PENGU ETF. The ETF, one of many on small-cap altcoins, will hold 80-95% in PENGU tokens and 5-15% in Pudgy Penguin NFTs. Top crypto losers today While several altcoins showed upward momentum, a number tanked hard to rank as the top crypto losers in the past 24 hours. Across Protocol (ACX) and Sahara AI (SAHARA) were among the biggest losers in the top 500 coins by market cap. In the top 100 coins by market cap, CoinMarketCap data shows today’s worst performers include SPX6900 (SPX), Celestia (TIA), and Injective (INJ).

2025-06-27T17:40:01,"XRP ETF Hopes Remain Optimistic Despite Crucial Ripple SEC Motion Dismissal","BitcoinWorld XRP ETF Hopes Remain Optimistic Despite Crucial Ripple SEC Motion Dismissal The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to legal battles and regulatory hurdles, especially when it comes to groundbreaking assets like XRP. Recent developments in the ongoing saga between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have once again stirred discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike. A recent decision by Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to reject a joint motion from Ripple and the SEC has naturally raised eyebrows. However, for those eyeing the potential approval of a Spot XRP ETF , a prominent pro-Ripple attorney offers a surprisingly optimistic perspective. Understanding the Latest Ripple SEC Court Dismissal To fully grasp the implications of the latest court ruling, it’s essential to understand what a ‘joint motion’ entails in a legal context, particularly concerning the Ripple SEC lawsuit. In this instance, both parties, Ripple and the SEC, had jointly approached the court regarding certain procedural aspects or perhaps a minor dispute within the broader litigation. Judge Analisa Torres, who has presided over significant parts of this high-profile case, ultimately dismissed this joint request. While any rejection from the court might initially seem like a setback for Ripple, attorney Fred Rispoli, a vocal supporter of Ripple’s position, quickly offered a nuanced interpretation. According to Rispoli, this specific dismissal, while a procedural point, does not directly threaten the prospects of an XRP ETF . His reasoning centers on a crucial distinction that has been central to the entire lawsuit: the status of XRP on the secondary market. Key takeaways from this dismissal, according to Rispoli’s analysis, include: Procedural, Not Substantive: The dismissal likely pertains to a procedural agreement or a minor point of contention between the parties, rather than a fundamental ruling on XRP’s security status. Focus on Primary vs. Secondary: The core of the SEC’s argument against Ripple has always revolved around Ripple’s institutional sales of XRP, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities offerings. This latest dismissal does not re-litigate or alter the court’s previous findings regarding XRP’s status on secondary exchanges. No Direct Impact on ETF Criteria: ETF approvals are heavily dependent on the underlying asset’s market characteristics, particularly its trading on secondary markets, not the primary issuance. Why is the XRP Secondary Market Status So Crucial for an ETF? The distinction between primary and secondary markets is paramount when discussing the potential for a Spot XRP ETF . Think of it this way: when a company initially sells its stock directly to investors, that’s the primary market. When those investors then trade the stock among themselves on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, that’s the secondary market. The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple primarily targeted Ripple’s direct, programmatic sales of XRP to institutional investors, classifying them as unregistered securities offerings. However, Judge Torres’s landmark ruling in July 2023 determined that XRP, when sold on secondary exchanges to retail investors, does not constitute an investment contract. This distinction is the bedrock of Fred Rispoli’s optimism. Here’s why the XRP Secondary Market status is so vital for ETF approval: Regulatory Clarity: The court’s ruling provided a degree of clarity that XRP, as traded on public exchanges, is not an unregistered security. This reduces a significant regulatory hurdle for issuers looking to launch a spot ETF. Comparison: Bitcoin Spot ETFs Factor Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval XRP Spot ETF Potential Primary Regulatory Hurdle Market manipulation concerns, lack of surveillance-sharing agreements. XRP’s classification as a security (now largely resolved for secondary sales). SEC’s Stance Historically resistant, citing investor protection. More complex due to ongoing lawsuit, but secondary market clarity is a positive. Market Structure Robust, liquid spot market. Robust, liquid spot market, now with legal clarity on status. Investor Protection: ETFs are designed to offer regulated access to assets. If the underlying asset’s secondary market trading is deemed legitimate and non-security, it aligns with the SEC’s mandate to protect investors within regulated financial products. Precedent from Bitcoin ETFs: The recent approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs by the SEC sets a significant precedent. While each asset is evaluated individually, the framework and the SEC’s comfort with regulated spot crypto products have increased. The core requirements, such as surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets, will likely apply to a potential Spot XRP ETF as well. Fred Rispoli emphasizes that the injunction against XRP selling, which the SEC might seek, only truly matters if the SEC decides to enforce it broadly to impact secondary markets. He suggests the SEC could opt not to enforce such restrictions on the secondary market, focusing instead on Ripple’s direct sales if any. This flexibility on the SEC’s part could be pivotal. The Role of Fred Rispoli and His Insights Attorney Fred Rispoli has become a notable voice in the cryptocurrency legal landscape, particularly concerning the Ripple-SEC case. His consistent analysis and interpretations have provided valuable insights for the XRP community. Rispoli’s perspective is rooted in a deep understanding of securities law and the specific nuances of the Ripple litigation. His ability to dissect complex legal jargon and translate it into understandable implications for the market has made him a trusted source for many. Rispoli’s argument that the secondary market status is the “key factor” influencing XRP ETF approval aligns with the broader legal and regulatory trends seen in the crypto space. Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the mechanisms of trading and the integrity of the exchanges where these assets are bought and sold, rather than solely focusing on their initial distribution methods. This shift in focus is a significant win for XRP, as its secondary market trading has been largely deemed legitimate by the court. Beyond the Courtroom: The Influence of Regulatory Reform and Paul Atkins While court rulings provide clarity, the broader regulatory environment plays an equally significant role in the approval of new financial products like a Spot XRP ETF . Fred Rispoli wisely points to the importance of potential shifts in crypto regulation, specifically mentioning whether a ‘new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins’ is geared up for reform. While Gary Gensler currently chairs the SEC, the mention of Paul Atkins, a former SEC Commissioner known for his pro-market and less interventionist stance, highlights the ongoing debate within regulatory circles about the future of crypto oversight. The crypto industry has long advocated for clear, comprehensive regulatory frameworks that foster innovation rather than stifle it. The current patchwork of regulations and the SEC’s enforcement-first approach have created uncertainty. Should there be a genuine move towards regulatory reform, potentially influenced by figures like Paul Atkins who advocate for clearer rules and less ambiguity, it could significantly expedite the approval process for various crypto-related financial products, including an XRP ETF . What kind of reforms are needed? Here are some key areas: Clear Classification of Digital Assets: A framework that clearly defines which digital assets are securities, commodities, or something else entirely. Innovation-Friendly Regulations: Rules that allow new technologies and business models to flourish without being unfairly constrained by outdated frameworks. Harmonization: Better coordination between different regulatory bodies (SEC, CFTC, etc.) to avoid overlapping or conflicting rules. Pathways for Compliance: Clear guidelines for crypto projects to comply with existing laws, rather than relying on enforcement actions. The debate around regulatory reform is critical because it addresses the systemic issues that create uncertainty for issuers and investors. A more predictable and supportive regulatory landscape would undoubtedly pave the way for more crypto ETFs to gain approval. The Path Forward for a Spot XRP ETF: What to Watch Despite the procedural dismissal, the overall sentiment regarding a Spot XRP ETF remains cautiously optimistic, largely thanks to the legal clarity gained on the XRP Secondary Market . Investors and market participants should keep an eye on several key indicators: SEC’s Stance on Other Crypto ETFs: While Bitcoin ETFs are approved, the SEC’s decisions on Ethereum ETFs and other altcoin ETFs will provide further clues about their evolving comfort level with various digital assets. Court Filings and Appeals: The broader Ripple-SEC lawsuit is not entirely over. Any further appeals or significant rulings could impact the perception of XRP’s regulatory status, though Rispoli’s analysis suggests the secondary market ruling is quite robust. Applications from Asset Managers: The submission of official applications for a Spot XRP ETF by major asset management firms (similar to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF application) would signal serious intent and could kickstart the formal review process. Legislative Developments: Any new crypto legislation emerging from Congress could override or clarify existing regulatory ambiguities, potentially streamlining the ETF approval process. The journey to a Spot XRP ETF is complex, weaving through legal battles, regulatory policy, and market dynamics. However, the insights from experts like Fred Rispoli provide a valuable roadmap, highlighting that the core legal status of XRP’s secondary market trading is the most potent factor in its favor, outweighing procedural skirmishes. Conclusion: Unwavering Optimism for XRP’s ETF Future The latest court dismissal in the protracted Ripple SEC legal battle, while a headline, appears to be a mere blip on the radar for the potential approval of a Spot XRP ETF . As articulated by attorney Fred Rispoli , the fundamental legal clarity achieved regarding the XRP Secondary Market status remains the paramount factor. This distinction, separating Ripple’s past institutional sales from the everyday trading of XRP on exchanges, provides a robust foundation for future ETF applications. The path forward for XRP into mainstream financial products seems increasingly plausible, bolstered by legal precedents and the ongoing push for clearer crypto regulations. While challenges persist, the core legal victory for XRP’s secondary market status offers compelling reasons for continued optimism among its proponents.

2025-06-27T17:38:04,"‘BTC All-Time Highs Are Coming’: Arthur Hayes Reveals 3 Key Catalysts For Next Parabolic Bitcoin Bull Run","The market may have cooled for now, but the bull rally is far from over. Bitcoin billionaire and BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has highlighted multiple catalysts that could supercharge the next BTC bull run to fresh all-time highs. 3 Signs That Suggest BTC Has Room For Further Upside Arthur Hayes took to X on Thursday to outline catalysts that he expects to drive Bitcoin prices higher in the coming months. For starters, the Bitcoin OG pointed to the United States’ monetary policy. Hayes noted that the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) exemption for banks is currently “progressing.” The so-called SLR exemption is a monetary policy tool that lets banks hold more U.S. Treasury securities without raising their supplementary leverage ratio, a move that raises their liquidity. On top of that, Hayes pointed to the US legislation, including the passage of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 (GENIUS) Act, a bill designed to set up guardrails around the approval and supervision of U.S. stablecoin issuers. According to the former BitMEX CEO, the GENIUS Act “hands US stablecoin market to banks.” Finally, Hayes claimed that the geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are a boon for safe haven assets like Bitcoin, amid a fragile President Donald Trump-brokered ceasefire pact between Israel and Iran. “BTC all-time highs are coming.” Earlier this month, Hayes predicted that Bitcoin would more than double within the next six months, rocketing to the $250,000 mark. The rocket surge will be buoyed by the U.S. Federal Reserve accelerating money printing to manage a ballooning national debt load. Billionaire investor Tim Draper made a similar call earlier this month, highlighting regulatory tailwinds for the flagship crypto under the Trump-Vance regime. But for Draper, Bitcoin’s journey to $250,000 this year will be bolstered by a bevy of companies making BTC their treasury reserve asset.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/btc-all-time-highs-are-coming-arthur-hayes-reveals-3-key-catalysts-for-next-parabolic-bitcoin-bull-run/,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Arthur Hayes|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare
