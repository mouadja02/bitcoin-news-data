2025-06-27T12:52:00,"This Clip Shows How Important XRP is for the Financial Sector","XRP enthusiast Lord XRP has emphasized the growing importance of XRP within the global financial ecosystem. In a recent post, Lord XRP described a video clip as a perfect demonstration of how crucial XRP has become to the financial sector. He further stated that XRP is already indispensable and acknowledged the significant progress made in recent years. His post concluded with the assertion that Ripple will be the solution moving forward. THIS IS A PERFECT CLIP TO SHOW HOW IMPORTANT #XRP IS FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. ITS ALREDY INDISPENSABLE. WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE RECENT YEARS #RIPPLE WILL BE THE ANSWER! pic.twitter.com/rT4oBzQXzj — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) June 25, 2025 Insights from Global Financial Leaders The video attached to the post features key remarks from influential figures in the financial world, including Christine Lagarde, who previously served as France’s Minister for Economic Affairs, Finance, and Employment. Lagarde confirmed that central banks globally have collectively decided to implement digital currencies, indicating that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are moving from concept to reality. Her statement underscores a major shift towards the adoption of digital financial infrastructure. A second speaker in the video explained that although digital currencies may still seem unconventional to some, they are rapidly moving into the mainstream. He noted that major banks are fully aware of this transformation and are actively investing in the necessary technology. According to him, these institutions are prepared to offer digital currency-related services as soon as it becomes financially viable for them. This perspective reflects the ongoing evolution of traditional banking systems to accommodate digital assets and blockchain technology. Ripple’s Approach to Solving Financial Problems Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also featured in the video, providing a clear summary of Ripple’s role in the financial landscape. Garlinghouse explained that Ripple offers a suite of technologies designed to help banks and regulated financial institutions settle cross-border transactions more efficiently. He highlighted that Ripple’s solutions dramatically accelerate transaction settlements between financial institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Garlinghouse addressed comparisons between Ripple and Bitcoin , stating that being compared to Bitcoin could be considered a compliment if Ripple is indeed solving real problems at scale. He emphasized the importance of distinguishing between genuine utility and mere hype within the cryptocurrency space. In another part of the video, a speaker asked Garlinghouse whether being compared to Bitcoin should be seen as a compliment. Garlinghouse responded by reiterating that solving meaningful problems in the financial sector is the key metric for success, rather than simply chasing speculative attention. Community Reactions Reflect Broader Sentiments A user commenting on Lord XRP’s post expressed both optimism and frustration. The user acknowledged that Ripple and XRP have made substantial progress in establishing new partnerships across the financial industry. However, they questioned why this growth has not yet translated into significant price movement for XRP. The commenter also wondered why legal proceedings, particularly decisions from the presiding judge, continue to delay progress in terms of market performance. Lord XRP’s post, along with the perspectives shared in the video, highlights the continued integration of blockchain solutions, such as XRP, into mainstream finance. The statements made by leaders such as Christine Lagarde and Brad Garlinghouse underline how the financial sector is steadily embracing digital assets, reinforcing the narrative that XRP plays an increasingly vital role in the transformation of global finance.

2025-06-27T12:47:46,"Best Wallet Token Heats Up as Kraken Launches Peer-to-Peer Payment App","In a bold foray into the TradFi space, crypto trading platform Kraken has launched a peer-to-peer payments app, reviving interest in wallet-related tokens like Best Wallet Token. An all-in-one global money app, Kraken’s latest innovation puts it in direct competition with the likes of Block’s CashApp, Paypal, and Venmo. Krak , launched yesterday, is available in 160+ countries and supports 300+ currencies. That includes crypto, fiat, and stablecoins. The app is free to download and lets you hold, send, receive, and easily convert funds, with transfers taking place within seconds. “We’re able to move money across borders right off the bat, because that’s what we do from a trading perspective in our venues,” says Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi in an interview with Reuters. “We’ve actually already spent over 10 years building out that system for money transmitter licenses… in all the jurisdictions. You have to do that as an exchange anyways, and so what we realized is that our customers just wanted to do more with their money.” Crypto transactions via the Krak app will run on blockchain rails , while fiat transfers will be processed in-house by Kraken, bypassing traditional banking networks entirely. Funds are safeguarded by top-tier security standards and backed by verifiable Proof-of-Reserves. Krak is running a referral program – if you use the app and invite a friend who creates their own account, you’ll both receive $10. Meanwhile, if you hold $USDG, you’ll earn 4.1% rewards that you can withdraw at any time. Most transfers through Krak are free, but for those that are not, the relevant fees will be displayed upfront for full transparency and no surprises. Future Krak offerings will include physical and digital payment cards and upfront payment solutions such as lending services. Crypto Players Grasp the Bigger Picture Platforms like Kraken, Binance, and Coinbase are steadily broadening their horizons beyond their crypto-trading roots. Last month, for instance, Kraken announced plans to introduce tokenized versions of US stocks – dubbed xStocks – for trading in select non-US markets. Similarly, Coinbase is seeking SEC approval to turn shares of public companies into blockchain-based tokens. Savings tools, debit cards, stock trading, and lending solutions are among the more traditional services crypto platforms are now bringing to the table. It’s a shift that reflects the growing demand for all-in-one financial tools that merge crypto with traditional finance. It’s a trend also seen in the best crypto wallet platforms. Wallets are increasingly integrating staking, fiat payments, on-ramping, and yield-earning options to give users more utility and control over their digital assets. All Eyes On The Best Wallet Token One of the top No KYC crypto wallets – Best Wallet – is a prime example. Free to download, fully non-custodial, and with no KYC requirements, the app gives you easy access to and complete control over your digital assets. Aside from buying, selling, and holding crypto, it allows for staking, DeFi, fiat on-ramping, cross-chain swaps, portfolio management, and Web3 access. Best Wallet is also the only crypto wallet that gives you access to the top crypto on presale . And that includes its very own native crypto, the Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . And at the moment, all eyes are on this exciting new crypto. That’s because $BEST drives Best Wallet’s mission to dominate 40% of the $11B crypto wallet market by the end of next year. $BEST holders also get lower transaction fees, and higher staking rewards through a built-in staking aggregator. You’ll also have a say in the project’s direction through community governance rights. The Best Wallet Token’s tokenomics make sense for a project in accelerated development. Of the 10B total token supply, 2.5B is allocated to development, and 3.5B to marketing. Those are both vital to the Best Wallet app reaching its target of 40% market domination. If the presale numbers are anything to go by, investor interest appears strong, with $13.58M already raised. As crypto platforms, from exchanges or wallets, expand their services, $BEST is in a good position to explode when it lists on DEXs and CEXs. Take a look at our Best Wallet Token price prediction for more insights. So if you’re on the lookout for the top presale of the year, $BEST is well worth checking out. Currently, 1 $BEST costs $0.025245, and you can stake it for 102% APY. Being a presale, though, staking rewards are dynamic, and the price will increase in stages. Find out more in our comprehensive guide to buying $BEST today. The Best Wallet Token whitepaper is another useful resource. As for project updates, you can stay up to speed through the $BEST X channel . Strap In as Crypto Gathers Momentum There’s no doubt about it, the crypto market is evolving at a relentless pace. And as digital assets become more mainstream, we expect the plethora of related services from platforms (hello, Kraken), wallets (here’s looking at you, Best Wallet ), and other crypto players to gather momentum. That makes the Best Wallet Token a contender for the top presale tokens of the year. But if you’re thinking of investing in $BEST, please be sure to first do your own research. The crypto market is unpredictable, and you don’t want to be caught off guard.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/kraken-launches-peer-to-peer-payment-app/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 51.75% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

With RSI at 46.21 and price trading below the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400.

The country’s National Assembly Finance and Planning Committee has proposed the formation of a multi-agency regulatory framework to oversee crypto operations, marking a pivotal moment for the region’s virtual asset industry. Kenya’s New Crypto Regulatory Framework Driven by the explosive growth of the crypto sector, Kenyan lawmakers are moving quickly to establish oversight mechanisms. The proposed framework brings together five key government agencies to regulate Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs): Central Bank of Kenya Capital Markets Authority Competition Authority of Kenya Communications Authority of Kenya Office of the Data Protection Commissioner These bodies will collectively regulate various aspects of the crypto ecosystem, including market conduct, data protection, and digital infrastructure. Why Kenya Introduced This Crypto Proposal The proposal stems from a recommendation by Credence Sfrica, a social enterprise organization, which called for a cross-sectoral regulatory team to supervise the rapidly expanding crypto market. The initiative is now open for public feedback, as the Finance Committee aims to build a collaborative and transparent crypto policy. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) Bill Gains Momentum Introduced on April 4, 2025, the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill has received strong support from key players in the crypto industry. The Virtual Asset Chamber (VAC) praised the bill but recommended removing a controversial clause that allowed regulators to conduct off-site surveillance of VASPs without clear boundaries. The committee agreed with the VAC and has amended the bill accordingly. [post_titles_links postid=”475547″] Kenya Aims to Become Africa’s Crypto Hub Kenya is positioning itself as a crypto leader in Africa, moving past its earlier caution. The new VASP Bill is designed to strengthen financial transparency, accountability, and combat illicit financial flows. Lawmakers believe it will help protect consumers and legitimize the crypto space in the country. Key Requirement for VASPs If the bill is passed, all entities engaging in crypto operations in Kenya will be required to obtain a local license approved by the five regulatory agencies. These licensed VASPs must also implement internal policies to identify and manage conflicts of interest and report such matters to authorities. “This Bill puts a strong emphasis on conflict prevention and proper management among virtual asset providers,” said MP Kimani Kuria . “It requires entities to establish effective internal controls to ensure transparency and accountability.” Final Thoughts As Kenya prepares to pass its first comprehensive crypto regulation , it sends a clear signal of intent: the nation is serious about embracing digital finance while safeguarding its citizens. If implemented successfully, this could place Kenya at the forefront of Africa’s blockchain revolution.

However, this seemingly negative development has turned the community bullish on XRP, according to data from Santiment. With crypto moving sideways, retail optimism toward Bitcoin & Ethereum has died down a bit. Meanwhile, XRP sentiment is currently at a 17-day high, in terms of positive vs. negative commentary.

Consequently, XRP has surpassed the two biggest digital assets by market cap, bitcoin and ether, both of which are performing a lot better in terms of price actions in the past week or so. BTC managed to reclaim the $100,000 line after its brief hiatus below it and now sits at around $107,000 as the geopolitical environment in the Middle East improved. ETH also recovered from its substantial slump and is back to $2,400. In contrast, XRP’s price has been trading downward for weeks and is currently below $2.1 after another 3-4% daily drop.

This upward movement reflects a notable price action in ETH crypto driven by a confluence of factors that signal strong bullish sentiment, but also caution against potential short-term volatility has appeared as it began consolidating in $2400- $2500 range. Even popular analyst Degen Hardy noted with caution that he will stay long on ETH as long as it remains above the $2,400 mark.

Per the analyst, this reflects widespread optimism, but it also raises severe concerns of the market turning into “overheating,” where further increases could precede with a short-term correction. Inflows Signal Potential Selling Pressure Analyst further adds that on-chain data presents a cautionary note, despite the recent strong price action, which was primarily driven by geopolitical ease with war-involved countries agreeing to a ceasefire. As the data reveals, Binance witnessed an inflow of 177,000 ETH over three consecutive days. This movement of ETH crypto onto exchanges has higher odds that some large holders may be preparing to take profits or reallocate their assets. [post_titles_links postid=”475660″] Ethereum Awaiting Correction In Short-Term Outlook Ethereum’s spike clearly highlights the aggressive speculative activity, but the simultaneous and substantial inflow of ETH crypto onto Binance points to a looming possibility of selling pressure, too.

This increases the likelihood of a dip coming, as the market might aim to normalize the current overheated funding dynamics. $ETH UPDATE Still in my LONG position as long as we hold above this zone ($2.4K) Will cut it if we break down, bulls are struggling to get to the untapped weekly above.

2025-06-27T12:00:29,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Achieve Remarkable 13-Day Inflow Streak, Signaling Robust Confidence","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Achieve Remarkable 13-Day Inflow Streak, Signaling Robust Confidence Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed a compelling trend that’s capturing the attention of investors worldwide: the consistent and substantial inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs . This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a powerful signal of growing confidence and institutional interest in Bitcoin, marking a significant shift in the digital asset landscape. What’s Driving the Surge in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with positive news as US Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue their impressive run. On June 26, these investment vehicles collectively logged a staggering $226.37 million in net inflows, extending a remarkable 13-day streak of positive capital injection. This sustained interest highlights a deepening conviction among investors regarding Bitcoin’s long-term value and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Leading the charge in these substantial inflows is BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone attracted $163.46 million. Following closely were Fidelity’s FBTC with $32.85 million and Bitwise’s BITB contributing $25.16 million. Even smaller players like Franklin’s EZBC and ARK Invest’s ARKB saw modest yet meaningful inflows of $3.11 million and $1.79 million, respectively. This widespread participation across various ETF providers underscores a broad-based demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. These consistent Bitcoin Inflows are not merely statistical anomalies; they reflect a strategic pivot by both retail and institutional investors. For institutions, spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a regulated, familiar, and accessible pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating obscure exchanges. For retail investors, they provide an easy entry point into the Bitcoin market through traditional brokerage accounts, democratizing access to this innovative asset. Understanding the Impact of Consistent Bitcoin Inflows on Crypto Market Trends The continuous flow of capital into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is having a palpable effect on broader Crypto Market Trends . Each day of positive inflows adds to Bitcoin’s liquidity and strengthens its market capitalization, often leading to upward price pressure. This sustained buying activity indicates that a significant amount of new capital is entering the Bitcoin ecosystem, rather than simply being reallocated within it. This trend is particularly significant because it suggests a maturation of the market. Unlike previous bull runs often fueled by speculative retail enthusiasm, the current environment is characterized by a more measured and institutional-led accumulation. This foundation of strong, consistent demand from regulated investment vehicles can lead to greater price stability and less volatility in the long run, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors. Moreover, these inflows act as a powerful validator for Bitcoin. The fact that sophisticated financial institutions are not only offering these products but also seeing substantial demand for them sends a clear message to the traditional financial world: Bitcoin is here to stay, and it’s becoming an indispensable part of diversified investment portfolios. This legitimization is crucial for fostering further growth and mainstream adoption. How is Institutional Adoption Shaping Bitcoin’s Future? The role of Institutional Adoption cannot be overstated when analyzing the current trajectory of Bitcoin. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a watershed moment, opening the floodgates for traditional financial players to engage with the digital asset space. This isn’t just about large sums of money; it’s about the stamp of approval from entities that manage trillions of dollars in assets. Consider the implications: Increased Legitimacy: When firms like BlackRock and Fidelity offer Bitcoin products, it lends immense credibility to the asset, dispelling previous notions of it being a niche or risky investment. Broader Access: Millions of investors who previously couldn’t or wouldn’t interact directly with cryptocurrencies can now gain exposure through their existing brokerage accounts, lowering the barrier to entry significantly. Market Maturation: Institutional involvement brings with it a demand for robust infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and professional-grade services, pushing the entire crypto ecosystem towards greater maturity and compliance. Long-Term Holding: Institutional investors typically have longer investment horizons compared to retail traders. Their accumulation often signifies a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, contributing to a more stable market base. This growing embrace by institutions is transforming Bitcoin from a fringe asset into a recognized component of global finance. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience, its innovative technology, and its potential as a store of value in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. What Do These Inflows Mean for BTC Price Action? The direct correlation between consistent Bitcoin Inflows and BTC Price Action is a topic of keen interest for investors. While market dynamics are complex and influenced by numerous factors, a sustained influx of capital into spot ETFs typically exerts upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. This is due to the simple economic principle of supply and demand: increased demand for a relatively fixed supply of Bitcoin tends to drive its value higher. Each dollar flowing into a spot ETF theoretically requires the fund manager to purchase an equivalent amount of Bitcoin on the open market (or through OTC desks). This continuous buying pressure, day after day, absorbs available supply and can contribute to a positive price trajectory. Furthermore, the psychological impact of seeing consistent inflows can foster a bullish sentiment among market participants, encouraging further investment. However, it’s crucial to remember that the market is never a straight line. While inflows are a strong bullish indicator, BTC Price Action can still be influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, global events, and profit-taking by existing holders. Yet, the current trend suggests a strong underlying demand that provides a robust floor for Bitcoin’s price, potentially mitigating sharp downturns and supporting upward momentum. Actionable Insights: Navigating Current Crypto Market Trends For investors looking to understand the significance of these developments, here are some actionable insights derived from the current Crypto Market Trends : Monitor ETF Data: Keep a close eye on daily ETF inflow/outflow data. Consistent positive flows are a strong indicator of sustained demand and market health. Resources like those from Trader T on X, or official ETF provider reports, can be invaluable. Long-Term Perspective: The institutional interest reinforces Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a digital store of value and an inflation hedge. Consider a long-term investment strategy rather than short-term trading. Diversification: While Bitcoin is leading, the overall positive sentiment driven by institutional adoption can spill over into other major cryptocurrencies. However, always conduct thorough research before diversifying your portfolio. Stay Informed on Regulation: Regulatory clarity continues to be a major catalyst for institutional adoption. Keep abreast of global regulatory developments as they can significantly impact market sentiment and investment flows. Risk Management: Despite the positive outlook, the crypto market remains volatile. Invest only what you can afford to lose and consider dollar-cost averaging to mitigate price fluctuations. The current landscape suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its speculative phase and cementing its place within mainstream finance. These sustained inflows are not just numbers; they represent a fundamental shift in how the world views and invests in digital assets. A Future Forged by Confidence: Concluding Thoughts The remarkable 13-day streak of positive inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a headline; it’s a testament to the growing confidence in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its increasingly vital role in the global financial ecosystem. This sustained momentum, largely driven by significant institutional participation, underscores a profound shift in Crypto Market Trends , pointing towards greater maturity, stability, and widespread acceptance. As we witness this incredible surge, it becomes clear that Bitcoin is solidifying its position as a legitimate and attractive investment asset. The consistent Bitcoin Inflows are a powerful indicator of demand, paving the way for continued Institutional Adoption and potentially robust BTC Price Action . While the journey of any asset class involves fluctuations, the current trajectory suggests a future where Bitcoin is an undeniable force in the financial world, embraced by a broader spectrum of investors than ever before. This is an exciting time for digital assets, signaling a future forged by collective confidence and innovative financial products.

2025-06-27T11:50:23,"Urgent: Mexican Bank Sanctions Spark Alarm Over US Payment System Access","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Mexican Bank Sanctions Spark Alarm Over US Payment System Access The financial world is abuzz with a startling revelation: a U.S. subsidiary of a Mexican bank sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury allegedly maintains direct access to the very heart of the US payment system . This isn’t just about a bank; it’s about the integrity of global finance and the mechanisms designed to prevent illicit money flows. How could an entity linked to alleged cartel funds still hold such a privileged position within America’s financial infrastructure? Let’s dive deep into this unfolding story that raises critical questions about security and oversight. Unveiling the Controversy: Mexican Bank Sanctions and US Access The recent revelation by Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto in America, has sent ripples through the financial community. According to her post on X, the U.S. subsidiary of Intercam Banco, a Mexican financial institution, appears to possess a Federal Reserve master account. This is significant because Intercam Banco itself has been sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury due to alleged connections with cartel-related funds. The core of the controversy lies in the apparent contradiction: an entity whose parent company faces serious allegations of facilitating illicit money, potentially retaining direct, unfettered access to the vital US payment system . While Intercam Banco has publicly denied these allegations, the question remains: what does this mean for the security of the U.S. financial landscape? Understanding the Federal Reserve Master Account: A Gateway to the US Payment System What exactly is a Federal Reserve master account , and why is its alleged possession by a sanctioned entity so alarming? Simply put, a Federal Reserve master account provides direct access to the U.S. central bank’s payment services. This includes the ability to send and receive payments through Fedwire, participate in automated clearinghouse (ACH) transactions, and directly settle balances. For a bank, it’s the ultimate gateway to the U.S. financial system, bypassing intermediary banks and reducing costs and delays. For a U.S. subsidiary of a foreign bank, such direct access is a powerful privilege. The fact that an entity connected to Mexican bank sanctions could potentially leverage this direct access raises significant concerns about the robustness of the US payment system ‘s defenses against illicit finance. The Shadow of Cartel Funds: Allegations and Implications The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s sanctions against Intercam Banco are rooted in allegations of its involvement with cartel funds . These are not minor infractions; such allegations point to serious criminal activity, including money laundering, drug trafficking, and other transnational crimes that destabilize economies and threaten national security. When funds linked to organized crime infiltrate legitimate financial channels, it undermines the integrity of the global financial system. The alleged continued access to the US payment system , even by a subsidiary, suggests a potential loophole that could be exploited by criminal organizations, allowing them to move illicit money with greater ease and anonymity, directly impacting the fight against financial crime. Navigating Financial Compliance: Challenges and Oversight Gaps This situation brings to light critical challenges in international financial compliance and regulatory oversight. Several questions immediately arise: Are Business Ties Clear? It remains unclear whether the U.S. subsidiary has any ongoing business ties or operational dependencies with its sanctioned parent company. This distinction is crucial for assessing risk. Regulatory Lag: How quickly can regulators identify and act upon such connections, especially when dealing with complex international corporate structures? Information Sharing: Is there sufficient real-time information sharing between different regulatory bodies (e.g., U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve) to ensure a unified and swift response to sanction designations? Proactive Measures: What mechanisms are in place to prevent sanctioned entities, or their closely related subsidiaries, from gaining or retaining such critical access points to a nation’s financial infrastructure? The complexities of global banking and the intricate web of subsidiaries often create blind spots that illicit actors can exploit, making robust and adaptive financial compliance frameworks more essential than ever. What This Means for Financial Security and What Comes Next The alleged direct access of a sanctioned Mexican bank’s subsidiary to the US payment system underscores the constant battle against financial crime and the imperative for vigilant oversight. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even with robust sanction regimes, sophisticated actors will always seek vulnerabilities. It highlights the need for continuous review and strengthening of policies governing access to critical financial infrastructure like the Federal Reserve master account . Moving forward, increased scrutiny of foreign bank subsidiaries operating within the U.S., alongside enhanced inter-agency coordination, will be paramount to ensure that the U.S. financial system remains secure against the flow of cartel funds and other illicit monies. This is not merely a technical issue; it is a matter of national and international financial security.

Bitcoin is quickly becoming more than a reserve asset for Canadian companies. This week, two firms took concrete steps to build with it, marking a clear shift in how BTC fits into corporate finance. Here are more details. Belgravia Hartford Adds Another $1M to Its Bitcoin Bet Toronto-based investment firm Belgravia Hartford is building its Bitcoin treasury with fresh capital – this week pulling another $1 million from its credit line with Round13 Digital Asset Fund. That brings its total draw so far to $1.5 million, all going straight into Bitcoin. The company is buying BTC through the regulated OTC desk at Coinsquare, one of Canada’s leading crypto exchanges. This is part of a broader strategy. Belgravia recently purchased 1.5 BTC for around $161,000 on June 20. That brings its total Bitcoin holdings to 6.4 BTC, valued at roughly $685,000 at current prices. CEO Mehdi Azodi is clear about the company’s direction. “As a micro-cap, we have determined regularly adding BTC to the balance sheet is our best use and store of funds and that such activity is currently imperative for accretive growth in shareholder value,” he said. Let’s simplify this. Belgravia sees Bitcoin as the smartest way to use its funds right now. The company also launched a Bitcoin-focused private placement to raise more capital and keep building its BTC reserves. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation Makes a First Move On the same day, another player stepped into the spotlight. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation, a Canada-based firm focused on institutional Bitcoin services, revealed its first major BTC buy: 292.80 BTC, worth about $31.5 million. The purchase was funded by a $125 million share offering, and it’s just the beginning of the company’s accumulation strategy. But holding Bitcoin isn’t the end goal here! They plan to use it for lending to institutions, offering liquidity while managing risk. The company is clear on its long-term view. Bitcoin is now a key part of how they plan to grow and operate. A Bigger Shift in Canada’s Bitcoin Strategy Both moves point to a growing trend: Canadian companies are getting serious about Bitcoin. Belgravia is slowly building its treasury. Bitcoin Treasury Corporation is jumping in with size and utility. Together, they reflect a bigger shift happening in Canada – where BTC is being treated less like a hedge, and more like an important financial tool.

2025-06-27T11:45:34,"XRP’s Price Dips As Judge Shoots Down Joint Bid From Ripple and the SEC To Reduce the Company’s Previously Ordered Fine","A US judge doesn’t think Ripple should get to walk back the civil penalty from its XRP lawsuit just because the new leadership regime at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now sides with the payments firm. Ripple and the SEC first filed a joint request in May for an “indicative ruling” to see whether District Judge Analisa Torres would be open to vacating the firm’s previously assigned $125 million civil penalty and reducing it to $50 million. Indicative rulings can be filed when a previous judgment is pending with an appeals court, but parties want to see if a district judge would be open to a motion for relief. District judges can deny the motions or express their openness to granting them should the appeals court give them permission. Judge Torres shot down Ripple and the SEC’s joint request in May, ruling that both parties failed “to address the heavy burden they must overcome to vacate the injunction and substantially reduce the civil penalty.” Ripple and the SEC refiled a second joint request earlier this month, outlining what they believed were the “exceptional circumstances” that merited a civil penalty reduction. “The balance of the interests here favors entry of the relief sought by the parties. The requested relief reflects a reasonable compromise by all parties to bring this litigation to an end, to avoid litigation risk on appeal, and to avoid the further expenditure of party and judicial resources.” Torres, however, shot down their second request in a similar fashion to the first, noting that the Supreme Court has said that court judgments aren’t just the property of the litigants; instead, they belong to the whole legal community and shouldn’t be vacated unless public interest demands it. The SEC first sued the San Francisco-based payments firm in late 2020 for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. In 2023, Torres ruled that Ripple’s automated, open-market sales of XRP did not constitute security offerings, contrary to what the SEC alleged. The judge did, however, side with the SEC’s claim that Ripple’s sales of XRP directly to institutional buyers were securities offerings. Last August, the judge slapped Ripple with a $125 million civil penalty, which the firm appealed. The SEC also appealed that number, arguing at the time that it was too low. The regulatory agency changed its tune toward the lawsuit after President Donald Trump took office in January and installed pro-crypto officials at the head of the commission. XRP is trading at $2.12 at time of writing. The fourth-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 3% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-27T11:43:52,"Coinbase to buy bitcoin on weekly basis","Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has publicly stated that he and his company are purchasing Bitcoin on a weekly basis, emphasizing their strong belief in the cryptocurrency's long-term value. This announcement aligns with Coinbase's recent stock performance, which saw shares closing at a record high of $375.07, surpassing its previous peak from November 2021 . Armstrong has previously suggested that Bitcoin's price could eventually reach into the millions, reflecting his bullish outlook on the asset. He also anticipates that nations will soon begin to include Bitcoin in their financial reserves, a move that could significantly influence global demand and the role of cryptocurrencies in international economics . Coinbase's stock surge is part of a broader trend of increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial markets. The company's inclusion in the S&P 500 Index in May 2025 marked a significant milestone, signaling growing institutional interest in digital assets. Analysts attribute Coinbase's strong performance to several factors, including the recovery of cryptocurrency prices, enhanced regulatory clarity, and the company's diversified revenue streams from trading fees, custody services, and institutional partnerships. Armstrong's consistent investment in Bitcoin and his vision for its future underscore a broader trend among crypto leaders and institutional investors who view the cryptocurrency as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/coinbase-ceo-bets-big-on-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T11:43:42,"Live Coin Watch Data Shows Bitcoin Solaris Presale Momentum: 150% Returns Expected After LBank Listing – Bitcoin 2.0 Has Arrived","The post Live Coin Watch Data Shows Bitcoin Solaris Presale Momentum: 150% Returns Expected After LBank Listing – Bitcoin 2.0 Has Arrived appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a market full of noise, one project is rising not just in charts but in chatter. Bitcoin Solaris is now gaining serious traction across crypto trackers like Live Coin Watch. But it is not just another presale. BTC-S is gearing up for something much bigger. The upcoming LBank listing has placed it firmly in the sights of investors looking for Bitcoin-level wealth opportunities without the $100,000+ entry ticket. Why the LBank Listing Changes Everything Exchanges matter. And LBank is no small fish. With millions in daily volume and a reputation for onboarding promising projects, getting listed there is more than a visibility boost. It’s an official stamp of credibility. It means institutional eyes are watching, and retail momentum will only accelerate. The upcoming LBank listing for Bitcoin Solaris comes at a perfect moment. The presale is nearing its final stages, the hype is real, and the infrastructure is built. When BTC-S hits the exchange, it won’t crawl, it will sprint. This is where many expect the 150 percent projected ROI to begin its climb. Projects with real-world utility and this level of technology rarely come this early. But BTC-S is pulling it off. Meet Bitcoin Solaris: More Than Just Hype Bitcoin Solaris is not a copy of Bitcoin. It’s an evolution. It was designed from the ground up with a simple goal: bring financial opportunity to more people using scalable technology that still honors decentralization. Unlike most Layer 1 projects, BTC-S splits its infrastructure into two layers. The Base Layer uses Proof of Work to ensure security and fairness, while the Solaris Layer runs on Delegated Proof of Stake to deliver blazing speeds and ultra-low fees. Together, they allow Bitcoin Solaris to process up to 100,000 transactions per second. That is 10 times more than most legacy chains, and it comes with two-second finality. Smart contracts are built using Rust, and the project initially leverages Solana’s dev tools and ecosystem. This makes it easy to launch DeFi apps, NFTs, IoT platforms, healthcare records, and even decentralized education solutions on BTC-S. And because of the upcoming release of the mobile-friendly Solaris Nova app, mining BTC-S is now accessible even without expensive rigs. You can check projected earnings using the mining calculator directly on the official site at Bitcoin Solaris Mining Calculator. Technical Highlights Driving the Buzz What’s under the hood is what makes Bitcoin Solaris really stand out. This is not another meme coin launch. It is a high-performance blockchain built for practical use and serious value creation. Hybrid Consensus: Combines SHA-256 Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake for both power and efficiency. Validator Rotation: DPoS validators rotate every 24 hours with slashing for misbehavior, ensuring network integrity. Smart Contracts: Rust-based contracts leveraging Solana compatibility for speed and low cost. Security: Resistance to 51 percent attacks, Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and optional Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy. TPS Performance: Up to 3,000 TPS on the base layer and up to 100,000 TPS on the Solaris Layer. This Isn’t Just a Token—It’s a Wealth Engine Built on BTC-S Influencers Are Talking Several top names in crypto content have picked up on BTC-S’s momentum. Their reviews add another layer of visibility and validation. Crypto Vlog dives deep into why the technical design positions BTC-S for long-term growth. Crypto Show outlines why retail investors are showing up in droves. Token Galaxy highlights how BTC-S balances scalability and decentralization. The sentiment is clear. BTC-S is not just trending. It’s becoming a movement. BTC-S Tokenomics: Scarcity, Utility, and Fair Distribution Bitcoin Solaris keeps its token economy simple but powerful. There are only 21 million BTC-S tokens. That’s it. The allocation ensures long-term value, adoption, and decentralization. 66.66 percent for mining rewards over 90 years 20 percent reserved for presale participants 5 percent allocated to liquidity pools 2 percent to ecosystem development 2 percent to community incentives 2 percent for marketing 2 percent for staking rewards 0.33 percent to the team and advisors This balanced structure creates a healthy, sustainable economy. Full details are live on the Bitcoin Solaris tokenomics page . BTC-S vs. Bitcoin: A Mining Comparison Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Algorithm SHA-256 SHA-256 Power Usage Extremely High 99.95 percent lower Mining Hardware Specialized ASICs Accessible mobile mining Block Time 10 minutes 5 minutes base, 15 sec Solaris TPS 7 Up to 100,000 The Presale: Your Final Window Only around 5 weeks remain until the official launch. And the window to get in at $9 is closing. The next phase moves to $10, with a launch price already locked at $20. This is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the market. So far, over 12,800 participants have joined, raising more than 5.6 million dollars. With every new registration, the momentum grows. And yes, Live Coin Watch has started reflecting it too. If there was ever a moment to grab a double-digit ROI potential before the rest of the market catches on, this is it. Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris is the closest thing we’ve seen to a second shot at early Bitcoin wealth. But this time, it comes with scalability, smart contracts, green mining, and actual tech upgrades that suit the modern digital world. With a major exchange listing on the horizon, BTC-S is not just preparing for launch. It’s preparing for liftoff.

2025-06-27T11:43:00,"Bakkt's Jump Into Bitcoin As A Treasury Strategy Distracts From Liquidity Angst","Summary Bakkt is pushing into the Bitcoin as a treasury for publicly listed companies trend. Liquidity continues to drop on a sequential basis with negative free cash flow during the first quarter coming in at $101 million. A $23.5 million private placement of convertible debentures post-period has extended BKKT's liquidity profile, but the company remains a sell. Bakkt ( BKKT ) is pivoting into buying and holding Bitcoin ( BTC ) on its balance sheet as part of an updated investment policy that could also see the embattled crypto firm allocate capital in other digital assets. Investing in BTC as part of a corporate treasury strategy has been all the rage in 2025, popularized by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). The ongoing BTC rally has sparked a rush of companies emulating MSTR. BKKT's push into BTC as corporate treasury distracts from its underlying operations and ramping negative free cash flow profile that has dramatically slimmed its liquidity and threatens to push the company into further angst. I last covered BKKT in February with a sell rating, the stock has dipped nearly 10% since then and is set to go lower. BKKT held total cash, short-term investments, and restricted cash of $44.5 million as of the end of its fiscal 2025 first quarter. Removing the restricted cash component of this would place BKKT's short-term liquidity at a more than 3-year low, as negative free cash flow continues to compound angst. Data by YCharts Hence, the move to BTC as a treasury seems out of place with the company's ability to maintain normal operations from its existing liquidity balance. BKKT recorded first-quarter revenue of $1.07 billion , up 25.2% over its year-ago comp on the back of larger crypto services revenues even as revenues from loyalty services dipped. BKKT's crypto services segment is an intensely low-margin business with gross profit of just $11.12 million realized on its portion of revenue. Net income for the first quarter was positive at $7.7 million, up from a loss of $8.17 million in the year-ago period. Bulls would be right to flag that earnings per share (""EPS"") at $1.13 was a material improvement from negative EPS of $1.86 a year ago, with the commons now trading hands for a 2.86x multiple to annualized first quarter EPS. This would be a steal if BKKT could sustain EPS at its current level. Bakkt Holdings Fiscal 2025 First Quarter Form 10-Q Cash Flow, Liquidity, And Risk While BKKT generated positive EPS for the first quarter, the company's free cash flow during the first quarter was negative at $101 million, a deterioration from positive free cash flow of $36.6 million a year ago. The material change in cash flow came from a negative $76.5 million movement in customer funds available and a $32 million loss from changes in the fair value of warrant liability. The overall pace of free cash flow is materially unsustainable and BKKT needs to raise more cash. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was negative at $162 million, in excess of BKKT's total short-term liquidity balance. This has materially expanded doubts about the ability of BKKT to continue as a going concern. Data by YCharts Hence, the shift to BTC as a treasury could be partially viewed through the lens of BKKT pushing to catch some of the euphoric animal spirits that have propelled some crypto-related tickers to new highs this year and sparked a rush of IPOs. Newly listed Circle ( CRCL ) was up 10x from its IPO price at its peak with crypto exchange Gemini and Peter Thiel-backed Bullish filing to go public on the back of the raging enthusiasm for crypto firms. BKKT has since been able to raise $23.75 million through a private placement of convertible debentures. The debentures will mature after just one year and accrue interest at an annual rate of 0%. The deal will mean the non-restricted portion of BKKT's cash will more than double, providing some level of depth for continued operations even as cash burn remains negative. Data by YCharts BKKT's average diluted shares outstanding are up 151% over the last 3 years on the back of equity dilution needed to expand its runway. This currently stands at less than 12 months against the pace of BKKT's trailing 12-month negative free cash flow and the post-debenture raise in liquidity. The risks for the bears, who form the 21% short interest in BKKT, are that the surge in crypto enthusiasm spills over to a buyout offer. Prior speculation that Trump Media & Technology Group ( DJT ) caused the stock price to spike and there is a non-insignificant possibility of further speculation arising. However, I'm still rating BKKT as a sell on the back of its low liquidity balance, substantial equity dilution, and negative free cash flow. Liquidity has been dipping for 3 years straight and there has not been any fundamental evolution in the company's business model that would allow them to address this shortfall. Hence, BKKT remains a sell, the company's BTC as a treasury pivot is just not material as there isn't sufficient liquidity for BKKT to acquire BTC in large enough numbers and hold it as an investment while its cash position is in such a critical position.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797716-bakkts-jump-bitcoin-treasury-strategy-distracts-liquidity-angst?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX","BKKT",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T11:35:14,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Bitcoin Investing Rises Among Retail and Institutions","Crypto adoption has been steadily brewing beneath the surface, but in recent weeks, momentum has surged from both ends of the spectrum. Institutional accumulation has long been active, with major players snapping up digital assets on any perceived dip. But what is now turning heads is the return of retail capital. Wallet activity and order book data show that individuals are re-entering the market alongside the institutions. This convergence is important. Historically, major rallies have often emerged when both institutional capital and grassroots enthusiasm move in the same direction. Bitcoin’s Scarcity Deepens as Global Institutions Continue Stacking The data is unambiguous: Bitcoin supply on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level ever recorded . This metric alone speaks volumes. It means fewer coins are available for trading and more are being tucked away into long-term storage. Investors, from individuals to multinationals, are not only holding; they are accumulating. Japan’s Metaplanet also made headlines by acquiring over 1,200 more BTC , raising its total holdings past Tesla’s. With more than 12,000 Bitcoin in reserve, it now ranks among the top corporate holders globally, just behind major mining firms. Meanwhile, the United States, once cautious, has turned its seized Bitcoin stash into a sovereign hedge fund of sorts. Over 200,000 coins now sit on the federal books, with further plans in motion to grow this reserve without touching taxpayer funds. BREAKING: 🇮🇳 BJP’s national spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari ( @pradip103 ) highlights importance of #Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. pic.twitter.com/H5YcUJONQf — Crypto India (@CryptooIndia) June 26, 2025 What’s happening here isn’t a string of isolated purchases. Bhutan has quietly built a billion-dollar Bitcoin treasury through surplus hydropower. Pakistan has formalized its own crypto holdings. China, once infamous for its bans, now shows signs of opening up to digital assets in the financial sector. Even India, which has been long ambiguous in its crypto policy, is seeing top party officials call for a national reserve. None of these moves are short-term plays. They reflect a strategic shift in how nations and institutions are preparing for the future of finance. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and independence from central banks, is no longer treated as an experiment. It is being absorbed into portfolios, treasury sheets, and even sovereign policy as a safeguard against inflation, currency volatility, and economic shocks. This level of bullish sentiment and buying across the globe directly suggests a growing interest in potential adoption, making it one of the best periods to accumulate top projects that could turn out to be top gainers in the coming weeks or months. Best Crypto to Buy Now As Crypto Buying Intensifies Globally Best Wallet Token At a time when crypto ownership is becoming more widespread and investor profiles are diversifying, the tools that manage and protect digital assets are no longer just accessories. They are infrastructure. The Best Wallet Token fits squarely into this narrative, offering actual utility for a new generation of crypto users who demand both ease of use and layered protection. The token is built into a larger platform that aims to bridge the gap between wallet simplicity and advanced ecosystem access. Holders of the token get more than fee reductions or cosmetic perks. They gain access to curated airdrops, cross-chain swaps, staking modules, and early access to partner launches. In an environment where new users are entering the space and institutional flows are mounting, the need for an intelligent, incentivized wallet layer becomes critical. The Best Wallet platform does not try to reinvent what a wallet is, but rather redefines what a wallet can offer. Thanks to all this, the presale has already raised upwards of $13 million. 🔥 Over $13M Raised and Counting! 🔥Best Wallet is becoming the go-to for traders who want speed, simplicity, and early access to what matters:✅ Buy new tokens early, directly in-app✅ Buy and bridge across chains in one place✅ Full portfolio control, no clutterDownload… pic.twitter.com/0SDNVPov6v — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) June 4, 2025 In markets where both volatility and opportunity surge side by side, that extra layer of utility matters more than ever. Whether or not Bitcoin dominance continues to rise, the infrastructure supporting user entry points will remain in high demand. The Best Wallet Token, then, is not just tied to speculative value but to the expansion of user access itself. With the world preparing for broader adoption, smart access layers like this may be one of the few categories that can grow regardless of which tokens dominate the headlines. SUBBD As more capital enters the market and new cohorts of investors begin exploring how crypto can fit into real-world models, the role of creator-driven platforms is getting redefined. SUBBD is not merely trying to replicate what other social dApps or decentralized media hubs have done. It functions as a full-stack platform that gives content creators and curators actual ownership, while also engineering a model that incentivizes quality through tokenized patronage. The architecture of SUBBD allows for tiered monetization, reputation-building, and interactive sponsorships, but all of it happens without the platform taking control of either the audience or the revenue. This is what makes it distinct. As more capital flows into Bitcoin and institutional players begin looking for assets with measurable social stickiness, platforms like SUBBD emerge as a new kind of asset class. They are not tied to volatility or hash rates, but to user engagement and cultural currency. And because SUBBD’s model is designed around direct creator-to-audience monetization with transparent reward loops, its growth potential aligns with both the macro rise in content spending and the micro-behavior of users seeking alternative platforms. As this market matures, creator-led economies will likely command greater relevance, and projects that have already structured themselves to function natively within these systems will have a head start. In that sense, SUBBD is not chasing trends; it is laying the groundwork for a creative economy that can flourish regardless of which coins are rallying. Snorter Snorter enters a category that often gets dismissed too quickly. It is built on a meme aesthetic, operates on Solana, and interacts with real-time trading. But under the surface, the architecture of Snorter is anything but trivial. It functions as a meme-trading robot designed for users who want speed, reflexive order execution, and access to social signals without having to rely on large terminals or manual inputs. Snorter’s appeal lies in the fact that it mirrors what the most successful meme coin traders already do: identify early momentum, lean into social virality, and move funds quickly. However, it removes the friction and guesswork by using algorithmic routing and real-time triggers. As meme culture deepens its role in defining the speculative edges of crypto markets, tools like Snorter begin to carry real value. More than just a bot, it is a behavioral model distilled into executable code. And in a cycle where both retail and institutional players are showing interest, Snorter offers a method of interacting with momentum markets that neither relies on sustained hype nor depends on sophisticated onboarding. For traders who want to stay agile without spending hours glued to charts, it becomes a functional companion. The project has already been endorsed by top crypto YouTube channels like 99Bitcoins , adding to its existing popularity further. With Solana's low latency and Snorter’s smart integration of sentiment and volume signals, it quietly sets a new benchmark for how meme tokens can be tracked, traded, and navigated. If this market stays hot, Snorter becomes a serious edge, not a novelty. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper exists to answer a question that has lingered for over a decade: can Bitcoin become more than just a store of value without compromising its core principles? The project’s answer is not theoretical. It is operational. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine, Bitcoin Hyper introduces a true Layer 2 experience for BTC that does not rely on custodians, shortcuts, or abstractions. Instead, it allows Bitcoin to be bridged into a high-speed environment where fees are negligible, finality is near-instant, and smart contract functionality is unlocked. This transforms Bitcoin from a passive asset into an active network, capable of hosting DeFi, supporting micro-payments, enabling staking, and running dApps. In a climate where both institutional and retail investors are accumulating Bitcoin with the expectation of long-term relevance, Bitcoin Hyper proposes a model where that relevance includes functionality. It does not replace BTC. It extends it. Investors who already believe in Bitcoin’s scarcity model now have a way to explore its utility without converting to another chain. This becomes even more significant when viewed through the lens of the broader crypto momentum currently underway. With countries building strategic reserves and institutions treating Bitcoin as financial infrastructure, any solution that can unlock new layers of use while preserving Bitcoin’s foundation becomes inherently valuable. Bitcoin Hyper’s architecture ensures that the original chain remains untouched, but its potential is no longer gated. It is not just a faster version of Bitcoin, but also one that finally begins to move. Conclusion Both institutional giants and everyday investors are now actively accumulating Bitcoin and other digital assets. This convergence signals not just optimism, but confidence in a longer-term shift toward crypto integration at every level, from national reserves to individual portfolios. In such a climate, identifying projects with actual utility becomes essential. The tokens mentioned above are not speculative flashes. They represent infrastructure, innovation, and cultural alignment with where this market is heading. With accumulation already underway, this moment offers a strategic entry point before broader adoption drives valuations sharply upward.

2025-06-27T11:30:45,"Top Analyst Predicts New Bitcoin Peak Timeline And ‘Double Cycle Blowoff’","Veteran crypto analyst Bob Loukas has delivered a Bitcoin update suggesting that the asset could be entering the “perfect storm” phase of its four-year cycle. But in a twist that defies traditional cycle models, Loukas now sees the possibility of a delayed blowoff top extending into early 2026 and introduces the prospect of a rare double-cycle structure. In his latest installment of the Four-Year Journey published on June 26, Loukas reaffirms that the current Bitcoin cycle — which began with the November 2022 low — remains structurally intact and is nearing its climactic phase. “This is certainly the most bullish phase of the four-year cycle,” Loukas states. “We’re now sort of on the cusp of what traditionally has been the beginning or the blowoff phase of a cycle.” Bitcoin Blowoff Delayed? What separates this cycle, according to Loukas, is the unique combination of maturing fundamentals and a confluence of macro, institutional, and regulatory forces. These include continued ETF inflows, corporate treasury adoption, and a radical policy shift under the Trump administration, including what he anticipates may be a pro-crypto Fed chair appointment. Together, these forces are creating what he calls a “perfect storm” for price expansion. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Loukas is cautious about providing hard price targets but acknowledges a doubling effect that could send Bitcoin from its current range near $110,000 to as high as $150,000–$170,000 in the short term. Historically, such phases have seen Bitcoin double in a matter of months once new highs are breached. “A breakout to the upside can see Bitcoin essentially almost double in a very short period of time,” he says, pointing to prior legs of the cycle where Bitcoin surged from $25K to $75K or $50K to $100K within five-month windows. Yet what makes this latest report particularly notable is Loukas’ introduction of a more complex structure he calls a “double cycle blowoff.” He describes this as a fusion of two adjacent four-year cycle peaks — a concept that could delay the market top to as late as February or March 2026, well beyond the traditional 35-month cycle peak window. “If we’ve still got sort of a six to seven month expansion to a peak… that would lead us into maybe even a February or March peak,” Loukas explains. This scenario, while still within the broader cyclical rhythm, would imply a 39–41 month uptrend rather than the typical 33–35 months. “I do think it’s time… 15–16 years into Bitcoin’s adoption,” he notes, referencing the arc from early tech believers to deep institutional penetration. Related Reading: $179,000 Or $79,000? Bitcoin Faces Critical Cycle Pivot, Says Analyst The implications are significant. A delayed peak could mean a much shorter corrective phase — or even the emergence of a second explosive rally as the next cycle begins, creating what Loukas describes as the illusion of one extended supercycle. “There’s a significant upside potential still to come in this cycle,” he says, warning that many may be caught off guard. “You don’t want to be surprised.” BTC Price Targets Loukas also addresses the broader sentiment picture, noting that the typical mania — the kind that marked tops in 2017 and late 2021 — has not yet materialized. “We haven’t seen that sort of blowoff, absolute extreme sentiment that you typically would see near the top,” he says. He sees this as further evidence that the final phase is still ahead. Regarding the price target for a supercycle, Loukas ponders: “I can see numbers in the quarter of a million level. I can also see some really crazy numbers when you see prior manias and bubbles in different asset classes, Seeing a 5x, 6x, 7x move from here over a 2-year period in a major mania is not really a stretch. Even from a market cap perspective, it’s not a stretch, seeing where gold is already heading through the $20 trillion level and well beyond.” While he emphasizes that these ideas are probabilistic and not predictions, Loukas does warn of the long-term consequences if his double-cycle thesis plays out. A massive influx of institutional capital, sovereign interest, and retail mania could ultimately trigger Bitcoin’s first true secular bear market, one not measured in months but in years. “If you consider a mania leadup where so many treasury companies and traditional flows come together and peak… the unwinding process just takes a lot longer.” For now, Loukas’ model portfolio remains partially in cash after trimming some positions near recent highs, reflecting a conservative approach tailored to capital preservation. Still, he acknowledges that younger or more risk-tolerant investors may view this moment as a final accumulation window before the next phase begins. “This video is very, very bullish, right?” he quips. At press time, BTC traded at $107,317.

2025-06-27T11:29:46,"Bitcoin Miner Revenue Drops to 2-Month Low, but Selling Pressure Remains Absent: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin BTC miner revenues have slid to their lowest levels in two months, but there’s still no sign of forced selling, even as profitability falls. Daily mining revenue dropped to $34 million on June 22, the weakest since April and among the lowest levels over the past year, CryptoQuant said in a weekly report shared with CoinDesk. The drop comes as transaction fees decline and bitcoin hovers near local lows, reducing overall incentives for miners to stay online. Hashrate has dipped 3.5% since June 16, marking the most significant pullback in network computing power since July 2024. While modest, it reflects mounting pressure on miners already grappling with tighter margins following the halving. Yet the expected wave of miner capitulation hasn’t materialized. Outflows from miner wallets have remained muted, sliding from 23,000 BTC per day in February to around 6,000 BTC currently — with no exchange transfer spikes recorded. Even wallets tied to Satoshi-era miners, often a bellwether for long-term sentiment, have barely budged: just 150 BTC sold so far in 2025, compared to nearly 10,000 BTC offloaded in 2024. Satoshi-era miners refer to network participants who mined their coins during the very early days of the Bitcoin network, typically between 2009 and 2011, when Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, was still active on online forums. Meanwhile, data shows miner reserves are growing. Addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC — typically operated by mid-sized mining entities — have added 4,000 BTC since March, pushing balances to their highest levels since November 2024. The takeaway is miners are playing the long game, either anticipating a rebound or preferring to burn through cash rather than sell at current prices. “This further suggests there’s no selling pressure coming from miners at these price levels,” CryptoQuant concluded.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/bitcoin-miner-revenue-drops-to-2-month-low-but-selling-pressure-remains-absent-cryptoquant,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Mining|CryptoQuant|News",cryptocompare

The company says it could recover more than $1 billion in damages from the combined cases. In a press release on Thursday, the Singapore-based company announced that its board of directors has approved a distribution plan for any net damages it recovers. According to the statement, 50% of any funds won in court would be paid out to shareholders as a special dividend, while the remaining 50% would be used to purchase Bitcoin. CEO Roger Hamilton said the decision was made to ensure that any court victories benefit shareholders directly. “The Company has two legal cases, one filed and one pending, in which we are seeking combined damages of over $1 billion,” he said. Genius Group Targets $1B in Damages—50% to Shareholders, 50% to Bitcoin The company’s first lawsuit, already filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, seeks over $750 million in damages under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. The suit names four individuals, including former SEC Chairman John Clayton, and alleges misconduct that caused financial harm to Genius Group. A second lawsuit is still pending and centers on allegations of naked short selling and market manipulation. The firm says preliminary analysis of its 2023 trading data shows damages between $251 million and $262 million. Its legal team, led by attorney Wes Christian, is currently updating the claim with more recent trading records, and expects the damage estimate to increase significantly before filing. “As both lawsuits are being pursued by the Company to recover damages caused by third parties directly to our shareholders, the Board believes that 100% of any proceeds from the successful outcome of these cases should be directly distributed or reinvested for the benefit of shareholders.” Roger said. 50% of legal wins go to $GNS shareholders as special dividend, 50% to $BTC Bitcoin Treasury.

In a Saylor double alternate universe where… pic.twitter.com/x3sNg4UaoK — Roger James Hamilton (@rogerhamilton) June 26, 2025 Genius Group said the upcoming short selling lawsuit is currently in its final review and will include revised damage estimates based on continued tracking of share trading activity. There’s no timeline yet for when either case may conclude, and the company cautioned that there’s no certainty around the final outcome or the amount of damages it may recover. Still, Genius Group has laid out a clear post-trial roadmap. Once any net damages are collected, after deducting legal fees, recovery costs, and taxes, the funds will be split. Shareholders would receive a dividend, while the company would use the other half to add to its Bitcoin holdings. If successful, the strategy could set the stage for one of the largest corporate Bitcoin purchases linked directly to litigation proceeds. The company did not disclose how much Bitcoin it currently holds but has previously described itself as a “Bitcoin-first” organization . Genius Group is listed on the NYSE American under the ticker GNS. Any payouts or purchases will follow regulations from the SEC, the NYSE, and Singaporean authorities. Court Drama Eases as Genius Group Resumes Bitcoin Buying Spree Post Legal Freeze Following a turbulent legal standoff that saw Genius Group barred from raising funds and forced to offload part of its Bitcoin treasury, the education and AI-focused firm is now back on the offensive. On April 3, a New York court temporarily prohibited Genius Group from selling shares or using investor funds to purchase Bitcoin, citing ongoing lawsuits linked to its scrapped deal with Fatbrain AI (LZGI).

This practice, he argues, is draining liquidity from the traditional financial system and shifting value into Bitcoin, effectively exiting fiat while still operating within it. Companies Leading the BTC Treasury Shift Public companies now hold 833,214 BTC, worth over $89.21 billion Private firms hold 421,641 BTC, valued at $45.14 billion Top Public Holders: MicroStrategy: 592,345 BTC ($63.42B) Marathon Digital, Twenty One Capital, Riot Platforms, CleanSpark, Metaplanet Top Private Holders: Block: 140,000 BTC ($14.99B) Tether: 100,521 BTC Xapo Bank: 38,931 BTC BitMEX, Mt. Gox follow What Are These Firms Doing? Livingston explains these companies aren’t just storing wealth, they’re systematically converting fiat into Bitcoin: “They raise money in fiat, buy BTC, and repeat it’s like draining the fiat system,” he said on X . This strategy removes liquidity from traditional monetary channels and shifts it into a decentralized asset. What This Means for Fiat Currency Livingston warns that if this trend accelerates: Fiat currencies like the U.S. Dollar could lose dominance Bitcoin could become a pricing benchmark for assets globally Firms may soon be valued by BTC per share, not earnings [post_titles_links postid=”475615″] Surging Stock Prices: A Sign of New Value Metrics?

This trove amounts to nearly 40% of the Himalayan kingdom’s gross domestic product (GDP), making it one of the most crypto -exposed nations on earth. Bhutan’s crypto holdings. Source: Arkham Intel Bhutan’s Bitcoin holdings, long kept under wraps, are managed by the state-owned Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), the government’s commercial arm. “For Bhutan, it was quite obvious in a lot of ways,” said Ujjwal Deep Dahal, CEO of DHI, in a rare public comment. Dahal noted that the nation’s abundant hydropower resources provided a clear path to low-cost, sustainable Bitcoin mining , a strategic advantage that few other countries can replicate. Bhutan starts mining Bitcoin in 2020 Bhutan began mining Bitcoin as early as 2020, leveraging its green energy surplus to enter the crypto space with minimal environmental footprint. While several nations have dabbled in BTC holdings or regulation, Bhutan’s deep, long-term integration into the asset class sets it apart, not only in scale but in intent. Bhutan’s holdings now surpass those of Ukraine and El Salvador, trailing only the United States and China in terms of on-chain government Bitcoin reserves. In addition to its Bitcoin position, Bhutan also holds over $1 million in Ethereum , making ETH the second-largest digital asset in its portfolio. While modest by comparison, this secondary exposure reflects an intentional diversification strategy in the broader crypto market. The implications of Bhutan’s strategy could be far-reaching.

And in this shift, Bitcoin stands out as a likely beneficiary, Lienkha says. BTC currently trades within a broad sideways range between $90,000 and $110,000. Additionally, it is near its all-time high. Per Lienkha, the coin could move towards $130,000. “If the positive momentum in equities continues and global risk appetite strengthens further,” he notes, “Bitcoin could break out of its current range and potentially initiate a new leg higher, potentially targeting the $130,000 level in the medium term.” The $93k–$100k range remains a key structural support zone for $BTC , with dense accumulation from Q1.

That said, it “doesn’t necessarily prove hypersensitivity to geopolitics,” he says. Per historical data, BTC usually weathers spikes during geopolitical events, recouping losses within weeks. Also, the latest recovery appears intertwined with several macro factors. These include a weaker US dollar, reduced oil prices, renewed US Federal Reserve rate cut bets, and sustained ETF inflows. Furthermore, Donald Trump said he planned to remove Fed Chair Jerome Powell. “This, more than any other macroeconomic factor, has the ability to cause more short-term financial havoc,” Toledano says. Overall, headlines often provoke short‑term moves, but “long‑term direction is driven by fundamentals and Bitcoin is only going one way as far as the arc of history is concerned,” he concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $107,367. Actually, earlier in the day, the coin briefly fell to 98,974 before recovering to the current level. The intraday high is $107,985. Currently, the price is still trying to hold above the $108,100 level. Next targets would be $110,490 and $112,080. Bitcoin Price Chart.

House Republicans are reportedly prepping to deliver the Senate’s landmark GENIUS Act to President Trump’s desk as early as the week of July 7. At the same time, they’re eyeing a vote on the long-awaited crypto market structure bill, CLARITY Act. It is anticipated that the House might package both bills together in a single procedural vote. This can be a legislative two-for-one special voting, which is now turbocharged by Trump’s all-caps tweet, “LIGHTNING FAST.” Crypto bills near Trump’s desk The GENIUS Act is not a small bill, as it might sound.

It passed the Senate with a strong bipartisan 68-30 vote and sent a clear signal that crypto’s moving to Washington. Trump’s digital asset empire and 2024 campaign have been powered by some big crypto players, meme coins, and David Sacks. In an X post, the Crypto Czar stated that “July will be a big month, with a bill signing for GENIUS, and CLARITY going to the Senate!” Sacks even thanked Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott and Digital Assets Subcommittee Chair Senator Cynthia Lummis for laying down a clear timeline and plan for crypto market structure legislation. This includes introducing the bill before August recess, marking it up in the first week of September, and getting it done by the end of the month. He added that President Trump supports CLARITY on market structure as well as GENIUS on stablecoins. July will be a big month, with a bill signing for GENIUS, and CLARITY going to the Senate! — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) June 26, 2025 The strategy here seems clear: ride the bipartisan momentum of stablecoin regulation to pull the broader market structure bill across the finish line. It’s a political high-wire act because while GENIUS has Senate traction, the CLARITY Act faces a rockier path, with agriculture and banking committees still weighing in. However, if anyone can turn regulatory chaos into a political showstopper, it’s Trump. House rushes crypto bills According to reports , Capitol Hill aides say conversations are still underway on how to move both bills forward. Committee chairs like French Hill and Tim Scott are threading the needle to make sure the crypto industry, which poured $250 million into this election cycle, gets the clarity it’s been asking for. Meanwhile, the White House Council on Digital Assets, helmed by Bo Hines, is talking openly about making the US “welcoming” again for innovators. That’s a serious pivot from the “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ” just a year ago. If the House moves fast in July, Trump could be signing the first federal crypto law in US history before summer ends and setting the stage for a regulatory framework that turns the US into the next crypto capital. The digital assets market is still stuck in turbulence, while Bitcoin is sailing the high waves alone. As all the major altcoins printed red indexes, BTC price is slowly moving towards its recent all-time high. Despite fresh pullbacks, Bitcoin is trading over $107k. The cumulative crypto market cap hovers around $3.28 trillion, with a trading volume of $100 billion. The stablecoin market saw some bullish updates lately and its total market cap moved to breach the $260 billion mark. Tether’s USDT is still the king of the category as it holds $157.5 billion of the market cap with a trading volume of over $38 billion. USDC stands second in the tally with a cap of $61.6 billion.

2025-06-27T11:10:16,"South Korea’s Pivotal Move: Lawmaker Seeks Crypto ETFs Under Capital Markets Act","BitcoinWorld South Korea’s Pivotal Move: Lawmaker Seeks Crypto ETFs Under Capital Markets Act A significant development is unfolding in the world of finance and digital assets, especially for those keenly following the evolution of cryptocurrency regulation. South Korea, a nation known for its technological prowess and dynamic financial markets, is on the cusp of a potentially groundbreaking legislative change. This move could redefine how investors interact with digital assets, paving the way for mainstream adoption through regulated financial products. Are you ready for a new era of South Korea crypto investment? Understanding the Proposed Amendment to the Capital Markets Act At the heart of this exciting development is a legislative initiative spearheaded by Min Byeong-dug, a prominent lawmaker from South Korea’s ruling Democratic Party. He has introduced a bill aimed at amending the nation’s pivotal Capital Markets Act. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental re-evaluation of what can be considered an ‘underlying asset’ within financial products. The current framework of the Capital Markets Act, like many traditional financial regulations globally, was not originally designed with cryptocurrencies in mind. Its definitions of assets and trust properties primarily encompass conventional financial instruments, commodities, and real estate. The proposed amendment seeks to expand these definitions explicitly to include digital assets such as Bitcoin. Why is this amendment so crucial? Legal Foundation: It would establish a clear legal basis for using cryptocurrencies in various financial instruments, most notably Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). Without this, institutions face significant legal ambiguity and regulatory hurdles when attempting to incorporate digital assets. Trustee Management: The amendment would empower trustees – the entities responsible for holding and managing assets on behalf of investors – to legally hold and manage cryptocurrencies. This is a critical step for creating secure and compliant investment vehicles. Market Expansion: By providing regulatory clarity, the bill aims to unlock new investment opportunities, allowing a broader range of investors to gain exposure to the crypto market through regulated channels. This legislative push signifies a growing recognition within South Korea’s political landscape of the permanence and potential of digital assets. It moves beyond treating cryptocurrencies merely as speculative assets and instead positions them as legitimate components of the broader financial ecosystem. The Dawn of Crypto ETFs in South Korea: What Does it Mean? The primary implication of this bill, if passed, is the potential creation of crypto ETFs in South Korea. An ETF is an investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. It holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and typically tracks an underlying index. For cryptocurrencies, an ETF would track the price of one or more digital assets, offering investors exposure without requiring them to directly buy, store, or manage the actual cryptocurrencies. How do Crypto ETFs benefit investors and the market? The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs and other digital asset ETFs offers several compelling advantages: Accessibility: ETFs are widely understood and accessible through traditional brokerage accounts. This means retail investors, who might find direct crypto purchases daunting, can easily invest in digital assets through familiar platforms. Security: Investing through an ETF means the underlying assets are held by professional custodians, mitigating risks associated with self-custody (like losing private keys or security breaches on exchanges). Liquidity: ETFs are highly liquid, allowing investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices, similar to stocks. Diversification: A crypto ETF could hold a basket of different digital assets, offering instant diversification and reducing risk compared to investing in a single cryptocurrency. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs operate under the scrutiny of financial regulators, providing an added layer of investor protection and legitimacy to the crypto market. This move is not isolated; it reflects a global trend. Countries like Canada and several European nations have already launched crypto ETFs, while the United States recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs, marking a monumental shift in institutional acceptance. South Korea’s potential entry into this space would further legitimize digital assets on the global financial stage. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities for Digital Asset ETFs While the prospect of digital asset ETFs is exciting, the path forward is not without its challenges. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and regulators worldwide grapple with how to best protect investors while fostering innovation. Potential Challenges to Consider: Market Volatility: The inherent price fluctuations of cryptocurrencies pose a challenge for traditional investment products. Regulators will need to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to manage these risks. Regulatory Nuances: Even with the amendment, the specific rules for crypto ETFs – such as custody requirements, valuation methodologies, and investor suitability – will need to be meticulously crafted and enforced by financial authorities. Investor Education: Despite the simplified access, investors will still need to understand the unique risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, even within an ETF wrapper. Global Coordination: As crypto markets are global, South Korea’s regulatory approach will ideally need to consider international standards and practices to prevent regulatory arbitrage. However, the opportunities presented by this legislation far outweigh the challenges. It could position South Korea as a leader in digital asset innovation in Asia, attracting foreign investment and fostering a robust domestic crypto ecosystem. It also aligns with the global trend of integrating digital assets into traditional finance, making South Korea’s financial markets more modern and competitive. South Korea’s Broader Crypto Landscape: Beyond ETFs This bill is part of a larger narrative unfolding in South Korea crypto regulation. The country has been actively working on a comprehensive framework for digital assets, recognizing their growing importance. For instance, the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been tightening regulations on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to combat money laundering and ensure investor protection. The proposed amendment to the Capital Markets Act complements these efforts by focusing on investment products. Key Aspects of South Korea’s Evolving Crypto Stance: Aspect Description Specific Financial Transactions Act Requires crypto exchanges to register with the financial intelligence unit (FIU) and implement strict AML/CFT measures. Investor Protection Ongoing efforts to enhance safeguards for crypto investors, including measures against unfair trading practices. CBDC Research The Bank of Korea is actively researching and piloting a central bank digital currency (CBDC), indicating a broader embrace of digital currency concepts. Blockchain Innovation Strong government support for blockchain technology development across various sectors, including finance, logistics, and public services. The introduction of this bill is a clear signal that South Korea is moving towards a more inclusive and regulated digital asset market. It’s about bringing crypto out of the shadows and into the regulated light of traditional finance, offering a safer and more familiar pathway for a wider range of investors. What’s Next for South Korea Crypto Investors? The bill introduced by Min Byeong-dug is currently in its legislative process. It will need to undergo review and approval by various committees and ultimately be passed by the National Assembly to become law. While the support from the ruling party bodes well, the exact timeline and any potential modifications to the bill remain to be seen. For investors, this development signifies a potential opening of new, regulated avenues to access the crypto market. It suggests a future where investing in Bitcoin or other digital assets could be as straightforward as buying shares in a traditional company. This shift could significantly increase institutional participation and bring more stability and maturity to the South Korea crypto market. The proposed amendment to the Capital Markets Act is more than just a legislative change; it’s a statement of intent. South Korea is signaling its readiness to embrace digital assets within its established financial framework, setting the stage for a new era of investment opportunities. The potential for crypto ETFs , including Bitcoin ETFs and broader digital asset ETFs , promises greater accessibility, security, and legitimacy for the burgeoning crypto space. As the world watches, South Korea’s move could inspire other nations to follow suit, further solidifying cryptocurrencies as a legitimate and integral part of the global financial landscape. This is a pivotal moment that could reshape investment strategies and accelerate mainstream adoption.

2025-06-27T11:08:15,"CryptoQuant analyst identifies sign of the next altcoin wave","CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. said that crypto assets are starting to consolidate, which could indicate that the next altcoin boom may be coming sooner than we think. According to a recent post on X, Adler Jr. found that the average monthly exchange inflow for altcoins has dropped 36% from the annual average capital flow of $2.5 billion. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, on June 27, the average monthly altcoin exchange inflow stands at $1.6 billion. It fell by $900 million from the annual average monthly exchange flow of $2.5 billion. “This moderate flow suggests asset consolidation and growing accumulation potential ahead of the next altseason wave,” said Adler Jr in his post . As of June 27, the average monthly altcoin exchange flow stands at $1.6B, below the annual average of $2.5B. This moderate flow suggests asset consolidation and growing accumulation potential ahead of the next altseason wave. On the chart, green circles highlight periods when… pic.twitter.com/VmNjgJLXbG — Axel 💎🙌 Adler Jr (@AxelAdlerJr) June 27, 2025 The last time such an event occurred in the market was during the altcoin boom in August to September 2024. Even before then, the market experienced a similar cycle indicated by the drop in altcoin exchange flow below the baseline in the second half of 2023. “In each instance, low exchange flows preceded significant altcoin price rallies,” said Adler Jr. You might also like: Why is crypto down today : SOL, XRP and memecoins plummet amidst Bitcoin dominance rise CryptoQuant: How exchange flow could indicate the next altcoin wave When there is less capital flowing into crypto exchanges , it signals less selling pressure. This means that more investors are accumulating assets instead of offloading them on exchanges. They could be in the process of anticipating the next price rebound. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, each time the exchange flow falls below the $1.6 billion mark, it becomes a precedent to significant altcoin rallies. This means that if the exchange inflow slips lower than $1.6 billion, it could result in the next “altcoin season.” As inflows dry up, capital often shifts from short-term speculation toward longer-term holdings, or even toward Bitcoin ( BTC ). But once crypto asset accumulation builds, capital will be able to rotate back into altcoins with greater force, triggering the second phase of the cycle. The data from CryptoQuant suggests that traders are currently entering the transition phase right before the next altcoin cycle. A prolonged dip in exchange inflows supports accumulation, a classic setup for future rally potential. If this holds, the timing could align with broader market recovery and rotation into higher-risk assets.

2025-06-27T11:05:40,"‘Trump’s administration has rapidly reshaped US crypto policy’ – Bybit x Block Scholes Report","A new report shared with Finbold on June 27 by Bybit and Block Scholes highlights how recent U.S. regulatory shifts under President Trump’s administration are accelerating crypto adoption . The administration has appointed pro-crypto regulators across key agencies, ended major lawsuits that had created regulatory uncertainty, clarified staking rules, and provided support for exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) approvals. According to the report, these developments could have far-reaching effects on institutional adoption and global regulatory momentum. The GENIUS Act While Bitcoin ETF approvals have dominated headlines, industry analysts suggest the GENIUS Act may prove to be the most consequential development in US crypto policy to date. The legislation establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the issuance of stablecoins , addressing what experts describe as a core infrastructure gap in the digital asset ecosystem. Stablecoins serve as the critical bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based systems, and the GENIUS Act provides the regulatory clarity needed to unlock institutional participation and broader public trust. Ratio of stablecoin market cap to M2. Source: Block Scholes The timing appears critical, as stablecoin market capitalization is growing significantly faster than the traditional M2 money supply, with the US Secretary of the Treasury estimating it will exceed $2 trillion. The BITCOIN Act Senator Cynthia Lummis’s proposed BITCOIN Act would direct the US Treasury to accumulate 1 million bitcoins over five years, creating a strategic reserve that could “reduce our national debt by half” if held for 20 years, according to Lummis. BTC mined vs BTC bought by government. Source: Block Scholes The government would purchase 200,000 bitcoins annually (roughly 550 per day), amounting to approximately $57 million daily at current prices. This stockpile would surpass the holdings of all publicly traded companies. The bill is already influencing state-level policy. New Hampshire passed HB 302 in May 2025, allowing up to 5% of its public funds to be invested in Bitcoin. Arizona followed with Bill 2749, creating a reserve from abandoned digital assets. Catching up with the US This U.S. momentum has inspired similar moves worldwide. For example, South Korea elected crypto-friendly President Lee Jae-myung, who introduced the Basic Digital Asset Act, enabling non-bank institutions to issue won-backed stablecoins. Additionally, Pakistan unveiled a national Bitcoin strategic reserve and the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority in May 2025, citing inspiration from US policy. The initiative includes a major mining commitment of up to 2,000 MW of energy. Meanwhile, the EU’s MiCA framework, upcoming UK reforms, and developments in the Middle East are creating more unified markets for digital assets. Some UK politicians have proposed Bitcoin reserves and crypto tax reforms, echoing similar initiatives in the US. Featured image via Shutterstock.

The filing, submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, outlines Bakkt’s plan to issue a mix of Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants to strengthen its treasury strategy. New Crypto Treasury Strategy According to the Form S-3 filing, Bakkt updated its investment policy earlier this month to allow capital allocation into Bitcoin and other digital assets, although the company has not yet executed its first purchase. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources,” the filing stated, indicating flexibility in its approach. This “shelf registration” provides Bakkt with the ability to access capital markets swiftly when conditions align, a critical option as the company faces ongoing financial challenges, including a history of operating losses and concerns over its ability to continue as a going concern. Market Timing Key as Bakkt Navigates Challenges Founded in 2018, Bakkt has struggled to maintain momentum , admitting in its filing that it has a “limited operating history and a history of operating losses.” The company noted that its decisions on crypto purchases would depend on market dynamics, capital availability, and strategic goals. Bakkt’s share price gained 3% on Thursday, closing at $13.33, though it remains down 46% since the beginning of the year. In March, Bakkt shares fell 30% following news that major clients, Bank of America and Webull, chose not to renew their agreements with the company, adding further pressure on its stock performance. Despite these hurdles, Bakkt sees promise in the broader crypto environment, recently commenting on X that the wave of crypto IPOs, including those from Circle , eToro, and Gemini, signals renewed momentum for digital assets. “These developments bring validation, visibility, and maturity to the market,” the company noted, underlining its belief in crypto’s growing legitimacy.

At this point, BTC’s last ATH was at $111,900, with new ATHs expected to follow. While Bitcoin has broken many new records in recent months, many altcoins, including the largest altcoin Ethereum (ETH), are still trading below their previous ATHs. As investors await the start of the delayed altcoin season, analyst Axel Adler shared the bullish signal he sees for altcoins. Accordingly, the analyst, who examined the average monthly change flow data of altcoins, argued that this data led to sharp increases in altcoin prices. At this point, Axel Adler said that the average monthly trading volume of altcoins is currently at $1.6 billion, which is lower than the annual average of $2.5 billion. The analyst noted that average flow at these levels points to consolidation and increased accumulation potential for altcoins ahead of the next altseason. Referring to previous data in his analysis, the analyst stated that the average monthly trading volume of altcoins had previously fallen below the monthly base line of $1.6 billion, and then experienced major increases. According to the shared chart, the altcoin’s average monthly trading volume fell below the $1.6 billion monthly baseline in early 2023, the second half of 2023, and August-September 2024. “Historically, in any case, low trading volumes have usually preceded significant price increases in altcoins,” the analyst said.

This is reinforcing bullish sentiment as the market anticipates new all-time highs. The momentum is also affecting other major assets, with the Ethereum price showing signs of steady growth. Remittix , a newer player in the market, is also gaining attention as capital flows shift toward promising altcoins. Remittix Is Building the Payment Layer Crypto Promised Remittix is gaining attention for its focus on utility in the crypto-to-fiat space. It allows users to convert major crypto assets like BTC and ETH into fiat and send them directly to global bank accounts. The process is streamlined, with flat fees and no added foreign exchange charges. Its main appeal lies in how easily it fits into everyday financial activity. Crypto holders can manage payments without needing their recipients to know the transaction started in digital assets. That design will likely gain interest from businesses, especially with the Remittix Pay API offering custom payment routing and fiat settlement options. Remittix’s value grows stronger in markets where remittance services are still expensive and slow. As blockchain adoption rises and platforms seek scalable solutions, Remittix could become a standard tool in regions underserved by traditional finance. Support for over 30 fiat currencies and more than 50 crypto pairs gives it flexibility few rivals offer. If integrations continue across payment platforms and merchant tools, its network effect could widen. Market analysts looking for sustainable infrastructure in crypto will likely track Remittix closely as the year unfolds. BlackRock Marks 16 Days of BTC Buys, Signals Long-Term Conviction BlackRock has extended its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation streak to 16 consecutive days, recently adding another $430 million worth of BTC to its holdings. Notably, there have been zero outflows from BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF throughout this period. This sustained inflow signals a long-term positioning strategy rather than short-term speculation. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s illiquid supply has climbed above 14 million BTC, according to the latest on-chain data. This metric tracks coins held in wallets with minimal historical selling activity, indicating that a growing portion of BTC is being locked away by holders unwilling to part with their assets. The result is a supply squeeze that may compound price volatility during bullish inflows. Source: CoinMarketCap Ethereum Price Approaches Key Resistance With Bullish Momentum Returning Ethereum is on the surge again after its June 23 slump. According to the charts, Ethereum remains one of the few major Layer 1 assets consistently showing structural strength despite volatility. Market sentiment has also improved with recent stabilization that has given ETH room to breathe. A key focus for crypto traders is Ethereum’s ability to reclaim and hold the $2,800 level as support. So far, price action has aligned with historical patterns of recovery and current volume trends reinforce a narrative of growing accumulation. If bulls can maintain momentum through the current ETH resistance, technical models point to a potential run toward higher mid-range targets. Source: CoinMarketCap Conclusion As institutional money floods into BTC and ETH, retail investors looking for meaningful upside may find their best bet in infrastructure tokens like RTX .

Trading volumes dropped sharply to $97.51 billion, down nearly 13%, indicating weaker momentum. Bitcoin continues to dominate the space with a 65% share, while Ethereum today trails behind at 9%. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index today stands neutral at 49, reflecting market indecision. A total of 89,122 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, with total liquidations amounting to $202.17 million. It is worth noting that the largest was of ETHUSDT at $2.82 million on Binance. Bitcoin Price Today: Bitcoin Price today is trading at $106,981.09, down 0.97% in the past 24 hours, with its market cap sitting at $2.12 trillion. Daily volume plunged by 19.27% to $41.39 billion, as prices swung between a low of $106,519.66 and a high of $108,190.55. Successively, options data suggests the maximum pain price is at $102,000 with a put-to-call ratio of 0.75, indicating sustained bullish sentiment among traders. BTC saw minor losses as investors turned cautious ahead of upcoming U.S. inflation data and unclear Fed rate path. Despite the recent gains fueled by geopolitical easing, particularly as the U.S. influenced the Israel-Iran ceasefire, today’s mild correction reflects profit-taking.

Ethereum Price Today: Ethereum price has declined by 1.91% in 24 hours to trade at $2,444.10, pushing its market cap down to $295.03 billion.

Check out our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! XRP Price Today: XRP was among the harder hit today, falling 4.73% to $2.08, dragging its market cap to $123.22 billion. However, trading volume surged 23.78% to $3.26 billion, indicating rising speculative interest. Prices fluctuated between $2.08 and $2.20. XRP futures recorded $542M in volume during their first month, with 45% of activity coming from outside North America. Open interest as of June 25 stands at $90M, underscoring growing global demand despite the ongoing legal uncertainty with the SEC. Potential Altcoin Buys: Pi Coin is gaining traction ahead of its much-anticipated Pi2Day event tomorrow, where major project announcements are expected. Solana, a blue-chip favorite, remains on watchlists as it continues to show strong ecosystem growth. Aptos posted a 5% intraday gain, fueled by news of a potential ETF listing, adding bullish momentum.

In a key development, Judge Torres denied Ripple and the SEC’s request for a private settlement, citing the importance of maintaining the public July 2023 ruling. Both parties must now submit a status update by August, likely deciding between an appeal or closure. White House Crypto Czar announced that crypto market structure legislation is expected to be finalized by the end of September, potentially bringing much-needed clarity to the regulatory landscape. The Pi2Day event tomorrow could usher in a new chapter for the Pi ecosystem, with community buzz hinting at a mainnet or listing announcement. FAQs Why is the crypto market down today? The dip is largely due to risk-off sentiment ahead of key U.S. inflation data and Fed rate uncertainty, alongside declining trading volumes and over $200M in liquidations. How are altcoins performing today? The majority of altcoins today are facing the heat of the broader market’s downturn. However, we do have exceptions like SEI, FARTCOIN, and APT. Is it the right time to buy crypto? While the market is down, it is the right time to buy potential altcoins in a dip. When will the crypto market recover? The crypto market will recover, as the investor sentiment turns optimistic, which could happen as early as by the end of this week.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-price-today-btc-eth-xrp-pi-price-fall-amid-202m-liquidation/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T10:50:07,"Decoding Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin’s Reign Grips the Crypto Market Now","BitcoinWorld Decoding Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin’s Reign Grips the Crypto Market Now Are you feeling the chill in the air for your altcoin portfolio? The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods where Bitcoin leads the charge and times when altcoins steal the spotlight. Currently, all signs point to a definitive Bitcoin Season , and understanding why is crucial for every investor. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal About Crypto Market Trends? The Altcoin Season Index, a pivotal metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), currently stands at a modest 18 as of June 27, 00:30 UTC. This figure, consistent with recent reports, paints a clear picture: the market is firmly entrenched in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this index signify, and why is it such an important indicator for crypto market trends ? The index is designed to provide a snapshot of market dominance. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Here’s a quick breakdown of its mechanics: Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in Altcoin Season, a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This is typically when smaller cap coins see massive gains, often dwarfing Bitcoin’s returns. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is upon us when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that Bitcoin is either holding its value stronger, or appreciating at a faster rate than the majority of the altcoin market. The index scores range from 1 to 100. A score of 18 means that a very small percentage of altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin recently, underscoring Bitcoin’s current dominance. This isn’t just a number; it’s a critical signal for how capital is flowing within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: A Historical Perspective The ebb and flow between Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season is a fundamental cycle within the cryptocurrency market. These cycles are driven by a complex interplay of factors, including market sentiment, technological advancements, macroeconomic conditions, and investor behavior. Historically, Bitcoin often leads bull runs, acting as the primary entry point for new capital into the crypto space. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or reaches new highs, some of that capital tends to ‘rotate’ into altcoins, especially those with strong fundamentals, promising technology, or emerging narratives. This rotation fuels the Altcoin Season, where a wider array of digital assets experience significant price appreciation. Key Characteristics of Each Season: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Dominant Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Various Altcoins Capital Flow New money often flows into BTC first; existing capital consolidates in BTC. Capital rotates from BTC into altcoins; speculative money seeks higher returns. Risk Profile Relatively lower volatility compared to altcoins; perceived as a ‘safe haven’ within crypto. Higher volatility; potential for massive gains but also significant losses. Investor Behavior Focus on foundational strength, institutional adoption, macro trends. Focus on narratives, technological breakthroughs, smaller market cap projects. Index Range (CMC) Typically below 25 Typically above 75 Currently, with the Altcoin Index at 18, we are clearly in a phase where Bitcoin is the preferred asset. This could be due to several factors: institutional interest consolidating around Bitcoin ETFs, global economic uncertainties pushing investors towards perceived safer assets, or simply a period of consolidation after previous altcoin rallies. Navigating Your Portfolio: Strategies for Current Cryptocurrency Performance Given the current market climate, where cryptocurrency performance is largely dictated by Bitcoin, how should investors adjust their strategies? This period presents both challenges and unique opportunities. Challenges: Underperforming Altcoins: Many altcoins may struggle to gain traction or even decline against Bitcoin, leading to frustration for those heavily invested in them. Lower Liquidity: Smaller altcoins might experience lower trading volumes, making it harder to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. FOMO on Bitcoin: As Bitcoin rises, there’s a risk of chasing its gains late in the cycle, potentially leading to losses if a correction occurs. Actionable Insights for Investors: Prioritize Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe the Bitcoin Season will persist, increasing your allocation to BTC might be a prudent move. This could involve converting some altcoins into Bitcoin, or directing new capital towards it. Research Strong Fundamentals: Even in a Bitcoin Season, certain altcoins with genuinely strong technology, active development, and clear use cases may still perform well or offer excellent long-term accumulation opportunities. Look for projects that solve real-world problems or are building critical infrastructure. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider DCA into your preferred assets. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price, which helps mitigate risk over time. Set Realistic Expectations: Understand that not all altcoins will moon during a Bitcoin Season. Adjust your profit targets and be prepared for slower growth or even temporary declines in your altcoin holdings. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep a close eye on the Bitcoin Dominance chart. A significant drop in Bitcoin Dominance often precedes an Altcoin Season, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Example: During past Bitcoin-led rallies, assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) might still see some gains due to their strong ecosystems and widespread adoption, but many smaller, less established altcoins might languish. This is a time for patience and strategic accumulation for future Altcoin Seasons. What Factors Influence Bitcoin and Altcoin Season Shifts? Understanding the drivers behind these market shifts is key to anticipating future movements. While the Altcoin Season Index gives us a current reading, several macro and micro factors influence whether Bitcoin or altcoins will lead the charge. Key Influencing Factors: Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin halvings (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have been precursors to significant bull runs, often starting with Bitcoin leading, followed by altcoin surges. Macroeconomic Environment: Global inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and traditional market performance (e.g., stock market) can all influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. During times of uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived store of value. Institutional Adoption: The entry of large financial institutions (e.g., through Bitcoin ETFs) brings significant capital and legitimacy to Bitcoin, often strengthening its dominance. Technological Breakthroughs/Narratives: New innovations within the altcoin space (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, AI integration) can spark new altcoin rallies, creating specific ‘mini-seasons’ for certain sectors. Regulatory Landscape: Clearer or more favorable regulations can boost confidence in the entire crypto market, but sometimes specific regulations might favor established assets like Bitcoin over newer, less regulated altcoins. The current Altcoin Season Index at 18 suggests that the confluence of these factors is currently favoring Bitcoin. It’s a period where investors are either consolidating gains, seeking stability, or waiting for clearer signals before diversifying heavily into the broader altcoin market. The Future of Cryptocurrency Performance: What’s Next? While the present firmly indicates a Bitcoin Season , the cryptocurrency market is characterized by its cyclical nature. No season lasts forever. The current Altcoin Index reading of 18 is a snapshot, not a permanent state. Looking ahead, several catalysts could potentially shift the market back into an Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Once Bitcoin reaches a new peak or consolidates after a significant rally, investors might start looking for higher returns in altcoins. Major Altcoin Upgrades: Significant technological advancements or network upgrades (like Ethereum’s future developments) can attract new capital and attention to specific altcoins. Emergence of New Narratives: Fresh trends or compelling use cases for altcoins can ignite speculative interest and drive prices upwards. Increased Retail Participation: A resurgence of retail investor interest often broadens the market’s focus beyond Bitcoin to include more speculative altcoin plays. For now, prudence dictates a focus on robust risk management and strategic positioning. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer, understanding the Altcoin Season Index and its implications for cryptocurrency performance is vital for navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of digital assets. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 18 serves as a clear beacon, signaling that we are in a dominant Bitcoin Season. This period calls for a strategic approach, emphasizing Bitcoin’s strength while selectively identifying promising altcoins for long-term growth. By understanding the dynamics of these market cycles, investors can better position themselves to thrive, regardless of whether Bitcoin or altcoins are leading the charge.

Bulls have reclaimed critical ground above the $106,000 mark, but strong resistance zones just below $109,000 are beginning to pressure the current rally. As momentum slows and price action compresses, traders are eyeing a breakout or pullback in the coming 24 hours. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) Bitcoin has rebounded sharply off the $99,500 zone, breaking above the local trendline resistance and reclaiming support above the $104,000–$105,000 range. The daily structure remains bullish, with BTC back inside its ascending channel and currently testing the median line near $107,000. The price is inching closer to the pivot resistance at $109,870, followed by the R4 zone at $114,956 — both of which align with prior rejection points. BTCUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) However, the daily supply zone between $108,000 and $110,000 continues to cap further upside.
