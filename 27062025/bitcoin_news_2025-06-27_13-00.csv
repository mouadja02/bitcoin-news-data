The report analyzes a new wave of regulatory momentum under the Trump administration, highlighting how new laws could institutionalize digital assets and cement the leadership role of the U.S. in the crypto industry. The report outlines key regulatory developments under the Trump administration that have boosted investors’ confidence in crypto. The industry stands at the intersection of the dollar’s legacy hegemony, favorable policy shifts in the U.S., and the global trend of increasing regulatory clarity. Institutional and official acceptance of crypto—from stablecoins to BTC, is being coded into laws. Key Insights: Reinventing the USD – the GENIUS Act: To rejuvenate the greenback’s dominance in the international financial system, U.S. lawmakers have long been pushing for digital asset legislation that can balance consumer protection and innovation. This underscores the GENIUS Act’s significance as the U.S. asserts its might in a volatile world: the future of money will still be denominated in the U.S. dollar. A million BTC in reserves: U.S. legislators are seeking creative ways to defuse America’s time-ticking debt bomb. Some of them are turning to BTC. The newly proposed BITCOIN Act, if passed, will open up demands for 200,000 BTC annually to form part of the U.S. Treasury’s strategic BTC reserves. This will not only cause BTC prices to shoot up, but also signal deeper implications for public recognition and adoption of digital assets. The global race to regulate crypto: From South Korea and Pakistan , to the U.K. and Europe at large, no regulator wants to be left behind in the crypto revolution. The report uncovers insights from across the globe and what these changes could mean for the digital asset class.

2025-06-27T10:50:07,"Decoding Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin’s Reign Grips the Crypto Market Now","BitcoinWorld Decoding Altcoin Season: Why Bitcoin’s Reign Grips the Crypto Market Now Are you feeling the chill in the air for your altcoin portfolio? The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods where Bitcoin leads the charge and times when altcoins steal the spotlight. Currently, all signs point to a definitive Bitcoin Season , and understanding why is crucial for every investor. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal About Crypto Market Trends? The Altcoin Season Index, a pivotal metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), currently stands at a modest 18 as of June 27, 00:30 UTC. This figure, consistent with recent reports, paints a clear picture: the market is firmly entrenched in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this index signify, and why is it such an important indicator for crypto market trends ? The index is designed to provide a snapshot of market dominance. It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CMC (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Here’s a quick breakdown of its mechanics: Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in Altcoin Season, a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This is typically when smaller cap coins see massive gains, often dwarfing Bitcoin’s returns. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is upon us when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that Bitcoin is either holding its value stronger, or appreciating at a faster rate than the majority of the altcoin market. The index scores range from 1 to 100. A score of 18 means that a very small percentage of altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin recently, underscoring Bitcoin’s current dominance. This isn’t just a number; it’s a critical signal for how capital is flowing within the crypto ecosystem. Understanding Bitcoin Season vs. Altcoin Season: A Historical Perspective The ebb and flow between Bitcoin Season and Altcoin Season is a fundamental cycle within the cryptocurrency market. These cycles are driven by a complex interplay of factors, including market sentiment, technological advancements, macroeconomic conditions, and investor behavior. Historically, Bitcoin often leads bull runs, acting as the primary entry point for new capital into the crypto space. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or reaches new highs, some of that capital tends to ‘rotate’ into altcoins, especially those with strong fundamentals, promising technology, or emerging narratives. This rotation fuels the Altcoin Season, where a wider array of digital assets experience significant price appreciation. Key Characteristics of Each Season: Feature Bitcoin Season Altcoin Season Dominant Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Various Altcoins Capital Flow New money often flows into BTC first; existing capital consolidates in BTC. Capital rotates from BTC into altcoins; speculative money seeks higher returns. Risk Profile Relatively lower volatility compared to altcoins; perceived as a ‘safe haven’ within crypto. Higher volatility; potential for massive gains but also significant losses. Investor Behavior Focus on foundational strength, institutional adoption, macro trends. Focus on narratives, technological breakthroughs, smaller market cap projects. Index Range (CMC) Typically below 25 Typically above 75 Currently, with the Altcoin Index at 18, we are clearly in a phase where Bitcoin is the preferred asset. This could be due to several factors: institutional interest consolidating around Bitcoin ETFs, global economic uncertainties pushing investors towards perceived safer assets, or simply a period of consolidation after previous altcoin rallies. Navigating Your Portfolio: Strategies for Current Cryptocurrency Performance Given the current market climate, where cryptocurrency performance is largely dictated by Bitcoin, how should investors adjust their strategies? This period presents both challenges and unique opportunities. Challenges: Underperforming Altcoins: Many altcoins may struggle to gain traction or even decline against Bitcoin, leading to frustration for those heavily invested in them. Lower Liquidity: Smaller altcoins might experience lower trading volumes, making it harder to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. FOMO on Bitcoin: As Bitcoin rises, there’s a risk of chasing its gains late in the cycle, potentially leading to losses if a correction occurs. Actionable Insights for Investors: Prioritize Bitcoin Exposure: If you believe the Bitcoin Season will persist, increasing your allocation to BTC might be a prudent move. This could involve converting some altcoins into Bitcoin, or directing new capital towards it. Research Strong Fundamentals: Even in a Bitcoin Season, certain altcoins with genuinely strong technology, active development, and clear use cases may still perform well or offer excellent long-term accumulation opportunities. Look for projects that solve real-world problems or are building critical infrastructure. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, consider DCA into your preferred assets. This strategy involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price, which helps mitigate risk over time. Set Realistic Expectations: Understand that not all altcoins will moon during a Bitcoin Season. Adjust your profit targets and be prepared for slower growth or even temporary declines in your altcoin holdings. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: Keep a close eye on the Bitcoin Dominance chart. A significant drop in Bitcoin Dominance often precedes an Altcoin Season, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics. Example: During past Bitcoin-led rallies, assets like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) might still see some gains due to their strong ecosystems and widespread adoption, but many smaller, less established altcoins might languish. This is a time for patience and strategic accumulation for future Altcoin Seasons. What Factors Influence Bitcoin and Altcoin Season Shifts? Understanding the drivers behind these market shifts is key to anticipating future movements. While the Altcoin Season Index gives us a current reading, several macro and micro factors influence whether Bitcoin or altcoins will lead the charge. Key Influencing Factors: Bitcoin Halving Cycles: Historically, Bitcoin halvings (which reduce the supply of new BTC) have been precursors to significant bull runs, often starting with Bitcoin leading, followed by altcoin surges. Macroeconomic Environment: Global inflation, interest rates, geopolitical events, and traditional market performance (e.g., stock market) can all influence investor sentiment towards risk assets like cryptocurrencies. During times of uncertainty, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived store of value. Institutional Adoption: The entry of large financial institutions (e.g., through Bitcoin ETFs) brings significant capital and legitimacy to Bitcoin, often strengthening its dominance. Technological Breakthroughs/Narratives: New innovations within the altcoin space (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2 solutions, AI integration) can spark new altcoin rallies, creating specific ‘mini-seasons’ for certain sectors. Regulatory Landscape: Clearer or more favorable regulations can boost confidence in the entire crypto market, but sometimes specific regulations might favor established assets like Bitcoin over newer, less regulated altcoins. The current Altcoin Season Index at 18 suggests that the confluence of these factors is currently favoring Bitcoin. It’s a period where investors are either consolidating gains, seeking stability, or waiting for clearer signals before diversifying heavily into the broader altcoin market. The Future of Cryptocurrency Performance: What’s Next? While the present firmly indicates a Bitcoin Season , the cryptocurrency market is characterized by its cyclical nature. No season lasts forever. The current Altcoin Index reading of 18 is a snapshot, not a permanent state. Looking ahead, several catalysts could potentially shift the market back into an Altcoin Season: Bitcoin Price Consolidation: Once Bitcoin reaches a new peak or consolidates after a significant rally, investors might start looking for higher returns in altcoins. Major Altcoin Upgrades: Significant technological advancements or network upgrades (like Ethereum’s future developments) can attract new capital and attention to specific altcoins. Emergence of New Narratives: Fresh trends or compelling use cases for altcoins can ignite speculative interest and drive prices upwards. Increased Retail Participation: A resurgence of retail investor interest often broadens the market’s focus beyond Bitcoin to include more speculative altcoin plays. For now, prudence dictates a focus on robust risk management and strategic positioning. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer, understanding the Altcoin Season Index and its implications for cryptocurrency performance is vital for navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of digital assets. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 18 serves as a clear beacon, signaling that we are in a dominant Bitcoin Season. This period calls for a strategic approach, emphasizing Bitcoin’s strength while selectively identifying promising altcoins for long-term growth. By understanding the dynamics of these market cycles, investors can better position themselves to thrive, regardless of whether Bitcoin or altcoins are leading the charge.

2025-06-27T10:40:56,"Coinbase’s Strategic Bitcoin Buys: Armstrong Confirms Weekly Acquisitions, Boosting Confidence","BitcoinWorld Coinbase’s Strategic Bitcoin Buys: Armstrong Confirms Weekly Acquisitions, Boosting Confidence In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, a single statement from a key industry leader can send ripples across the market. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with excitement following a significant revelation from none other than Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong . His confirmation that Coinbase is consistently increasing its Bitcoin holdings each week isn’t just news; it’s a powerful signal, especially coming after Coinbase’s stock soared to an all-time high. This move underscores a deeper strategic play, prompting questions about corporate crypto treasuries and the future of digital asset adoption. Coinbase Bitcoin : The Strategic Accumulation Unveiled The conversation that sparked this revelation began on X (formerly Twitter), where BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey openly lauded Brian Armstrong’s leadership, particularly after Coinbase’s stock reached an impressive $368.94. Bailey then challenged Coinbase to take a more definitive step: establish a dedicated Bitcoin treasury. Armstrong’s response was swift and impactful, stating, “We are buying more Bitcoin every week.” This isn’t merely a casual remark; it signifies a deliberate, ongoing strategy by one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges to accumulate the flagship digital asset. This consistent accumulation of Coinbase Bitcoin holdings suggests a long-term conviction in the asset’s value and its role in the company’s financial future. It’s a move that speaks volumes about their belief in Bitcoin’s enduring power. Brian Armstrong : A Visionary Leader’s Confirmation Brian Armstrong has long been recognized as a pivotal figure in the cryptocurrency space, steering Coinbase from a nascent startup to a publicly traded titan. His recent affirmation regarding Bitcoin purchases isn’t just a fleeting comment; it reinforces his long-standing belief in the asset’s potential. Armstrong’s leadership has consistently focused on mainstream adoption and regulatory compliance, positioning Coinbase as a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy. His decision to publicly confirm weekly Bitcoin buys, especially in response to a call for a dedicated treasury, highlights a proactive approach to managing the company’s balance sheet and signaling confidence to both investors and the broader market. This transparency from Brian Armstrong provides valuable insight into the strategic thinking at the top tier of the crypto industry. The Case for a Corporate Bitcoin Treasury : Why Now? The concept of a corporate Bitcoin treasury has gained significant traction, particularly among forward-thinking companies. But what exactly does it entail, and why are more corporations considering it? Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and quantitative easing, companies are looking for assets that can preserve or even grow their purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its capped supply, is often seen as a digital alternative to gold, offering a hedge against inflation. Balance Sheet Diversification: Relying solely on traditional fiat currencies can expose companies to currency devaluation risks. Adding Bitcoin provides diversification, potentially reducing overall financial risk. Signaling Confidence: Holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet sends a strong message to the market about a company’s belief in the future of digital assets. For a crypto-native company like Coinbase, this signal is amplified, reinforcing its commitment to the ecosystem it serves. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth. Companies that accumulate Bitcoin at strategic times aim to benefit from its potential appreciation. Coinbase’s active weekly purchases suggest they are not just passively holding but actively building a strategic reserve, moving towards what could effectively function as a dynamic Bitcoin treasury . What Does This Mean for the Coinbase CEO and the Exchange? The implications of this revelation for the Coinbase CEO and the exchange are multifaceted. Firstly, it strengthens Coinbase’s position as a leading institutional player in the crypto space. By actively accumulating Bitcoin, Coinbase is not just facilitating trades but also acting as a significant holder, aligning its financial interests even more closely with the broader crypto market’s success. This move could: Boost Investor Confidence: Seeing a major exchange like Coinbase, led by its visionary Coinbase CEO , put its own capital into Bitcoin can reassure investors about the asset’s long-term viability and the company’s financial health. Influence Market Dynamics: Consistent buying from a large entity like Coinbase can contribute to demand, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s price trajectory, albeit subtly over time. Set an Industry Precedent: As a publicly traded company, Coinbase’s actions are scrutinized. Its active Bitcoin accumulation could encourage other companies, both within and outside the crypto sector, to consider similar strategies. Enhance Brand Reputation: For a company whose business is deeply intertwined with Bitcoin, holding the asset reinforces its authenticity and commitment to the decentralized future. This strategic decision by the Coinbase CEO further solidifies the exchange’s standing as a cornerstone of the digital economy. Broader Implications for Crypto Investment Coinbase’s decision to increase its Bitcoin holdings has significant ramifications for the wider landscape of crypto investment . It signals a maturation of the market and a growing acceptance of digital assets as legitimate components of corporate finance. For individual and institutional investors alike, this move offers several insights: Institutional Validation: When a major, regulated, publicly traded company like Coinbase actively buys Bitcoin, it adds another layer of institutional validation, potentially drawing more traditional investors into the crypto space. Long-Term Outlook: It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is not just a speculative asset but a long-term store of value and a strategic asset for corporations. This can encourage a more patient and strategic approach to crypto investment . Diversification Trends: Companies like MicroStrategy pioneered the corporate Bitcoin treasury. Coinbase’s actions suggest this trend is gaining momentum, potentially leading to more companies exploring crypto as part of their treasury management. Market Stability: While crypto remains volatile, increased institutional holding can, over time, contribute to greater market stability by reducing the impact of short-term speculative movements. This development is a strong indicator of evolving corporate strategies in crypto investment . Navigating the Future: Challenges and Opportunities While the strategic accumulation of Bitcoin presents numerous opportunities, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent challenges. Volatility remains a key concern, as Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting a company’s balance sheet. Regulatory uncertainty, though diminishing, still poses a potential risk. Furthermore, securing large digital asset holdings requires robust cybersecurity infrastructure. However, the opportunities far outweigh these challenges for a company like Coinbase, which is already deeply embedded in the crypto ecosystem. Their expertise in security, compliance, and market dynamics positions them uniquely to manage these risks. This move could also pave the way for new financial products and services tailored to corporate crypto holdings, further diversifying Coinbase’s revenue streams. Conclusion Brian Armstrong’s confirmation that Coinbase is consistently buying more Bitcoin each week is more than just a passing comment; it’s a strategic declaration. It underscores Coinbase’s deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value, its role as a potential corporate treasury asset, and the ongoing maturation of the broader crypto market. As one of the most influential players in the digital asset space, Coinbase’s actions serve as a powerful signal, potentially encouraging further institutional adoption and shaping the future of crypto investment . This move reinforces the idea that digital assets are not just for individuals but are increasingly becoming a cornerstone of corporate financial strategy.

2025-06-27T10:09:36,"Legal expert breaks silence after major XRP crash","XRP slid 4% over the last 24 hours following a ruling from the U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, who denied a joint motion from Ripple Labs and the SEC that sought to wrap up key elements of their long-running legal standoff. The decision , filed on June 26, effectively keeps the door open for further appeals and delays a final resolution. Within hours of the ruling, XRP fell from $2.16 to $2.09, erasing more than $5 billion in market capitalization in under 24 hours. At $123.62 billion, it now holds the dubious distinction of posting the biggest single-day drop among the top 40 digital assets and becoming the most trending crypto asset between Thursday and Friday, according to CoinMarketCap . XRP market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap But while short-term sentiment has clearly taken a hit, not all observers believe the verdict spells trouble for XRP’s longer-term ambitions, particularly regarding a U.S.-listed spot XRP ETF. Lawyer weight in on XRP ETF Fred Rispoli, a legal commentator and vocal supporter of Ripple, argues that the ruling, though headline-grabbing, is unlikely to affect XRP’s standing on secondary markets, which is what ultimately matters for ETF eligibility. SEC v. Ripple Update: This is a long post on my thoughts here but the TLDR is: ""Welcome to the new SEC, for now more or less the same as the last one."" And: Ripple and SEC will settle the appeal for the reduced, agreed upon amount and leave the Torres judgment in place, while the… https://t.co/9y9o4M4uBW — Fred Rispoli (@freddyriz) June 26, 2025 “Regarding that injunction, it doesn’t affect $XRP on the secondary markets nor will it impact XRP ETF approvals,” Rispoli explained. “And remember, the injunction is just a piece of paper issued by a court… it only substantively matters if the SEC wants it to matter.” In legal terms, Judge Torres’ injunction could theoretically give the court grounds to revisit the case if Ripple is found violating institutional sale restrictions. However, Rispoli emphasized that the SEC would need to actively push for enforcement, an outcome he describes as “extremely low probability.” He also hinted at a broader shift in regulatory posture, suggesting that both Ripple and the SEC may be quietly negotiating a reduced penalty and new guidelines for Ripple’s institutional sales. Such a move would preserve the substance of the Torres ruling while avoiding further escalation. The bigger unknown now lies with the SEC’s leadership. With the commission under political pressure to soften its stance on digital assets, and following the installation of a new Chair under President Trump, there’s growing speculation that an XRP ETF could still move forward, particularly given the rising tide of crypto ETF approvals across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even altcoin ETFs in the pipeline.

CEO Brian Armstrong has revealed that the crypto exchange is now purchasing Bitcoin every single week, strengthening its position in the ongoing race among institutions to stock up on BTC . The exchange currently holds $995 million worth of Bitcoin, making it the 10th-largest corporate holder. Armstrong has also encouraged investors to “go long” on Bitcoin, signaling strong confidence in its future as prices inch closer to a new all-time high. We're buying more Bitcoin every week. Long #Bitcoin https://t.co/LleWBXGYTG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 26, 2025 From Maximalism to Multi-Token Strategy Coinbase launched in 2012 with a Bitcoin-only focus. Back then, Armstrong dismissed altcoins like XRP and Stellar (XL M) as distractions. In a now-deleted tweet from 2014, he claimed Bitcoin was “way far ahead” of the rest, reflecting a clear Bitcoin-maxi mindset at the time. That changed in 2016 when Coinbase added support for Ethereum. Then, in 2018, it expanded even further by enabling ERC-20 tokens. During the bull run, the platform added nearly 100 new tokens in just one year. This shift drew criticism from Bitcoin purists who accused Coinbase of chasing trends instead of staying true to BTC. Michael Saylor Cheers Coinbase’s Bitcoin Surge! MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor , whose company leads all others in Bitcoin holdings, praised Coinbase’s weekly purchases with a rocket emoji, showing his support for Armstrong’s move. We're buying more Bitcoin every week. Long #Bitcoin https://t.co/LleWBXGYTG — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 26, 2025 Bitcoin Magazine CEO David Bailey also backed the decision, calling Armstrong the “G.O.A.T.” for doubling down on Bitcoin in such a bold and consistent way.

While Armstrong’s commitment to buy weekly is significant, consistency will be key if Coinbase hopes to narrow the gap. In terms of value, Coinbase’s holdings stand at $995 million, while MicroStrategy’s are worth about $33 billion. It’s a big difference but if Coinbase keeps buying aggressively, that could start to shift over time Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Grows Coinbase’s weekly BTC purchases reflect a growing trend: institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a way to preserve long-term value. With Bitcoin currently trading at $107,363, Coinbase’s position in the market is strong and getting stronger. While altcoins still grab headlines, this move shows that for major players like Coinbase, Bitcoin remains the foundation.

2025-06-27T10:08:16,"The Smarter Web Company secures $56M, aims for top 30 Bitcoin holders","The Smarter Web Company has raised approximately $56 million, days after spending over $20 million on a Bitcoin investment. According to a Thursday announcement , the UK-based web design and marketing firm secured the funding through an accelerated bookbuild, a fast-track fundraising process typically involving institutional investors. The offering included £36.27 million ($49.8 million) raised via the bookbuild and an additional £4.97 million ($6.82 million) raised through subscription. Shares were priced at £2.90 ($3.98) each. The newly issued stock is expected to begin trading on July 1. The Smarter Web Company said the capital was raised to support its broader business objectives. While the official filing did not explicitly state whether any of the proceeds would be allocated toward additional Bitcoin purchases, the move follows a pattern of BTC accumulation that has intensified over the past month. Following the 10-year plan The Smarter Web Company, which trades on the OTCQB market in the United States under the ticker TSWCF, has been executing a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy since April as part of its “10 Year Plan.” Under this strategy, the company plans to systematically accumulate Bitcoin as a treasury asset over the next decade. While the firm has accepted Bitcoin payments from clients since 2023, it began accumulating the asset in late spring this year. Two days before the fundraising was announced, the company invested over $20 million to acquire 196.8 BTC at an average price of $103,290, which brought its total holdings to 543.52 BTC, valued at approximately $58.19 million as of the latest update. The average acquisition price across its Bitcoin treasury stands at $104,450. Prior to that, the company had executed a total of four Bitcoin purchases since late May, gradually increasing its holdings from 83.24 BTC to 346.63 BTC through acquisitions totalling approximately £17.9 million. On June 26, CEO Andrew Webley met with Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, for what he described as a “good meeting” on Bitcoin strategy. A day later, Webley confirmed in an X post that The Smarter Web Company is now the 39th largest corporate BTC holder and intends to climb into the top 30. For many publicly listed companies, reports of Bitcoin acquisitions often spark bullish momentum. But that wasn’t the case for The Smarter Web Company. Its shares fell 15% on Thursday, closing at $3.56 after touching an intraday low of $3.19, according to Google Finance. Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a treasury asset Bitcoin has been showing strong resilience against macro jitters, and part of that can be attributed to its growing role as a treasury asset. Over the past year, several publicly listed companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, citing its scarcity, liquidity, and potential as a hedge against currency debasement and a means to improve shareholder value. The trend is particularly prominent in the US, where firms like Strategy and BlackRock have led the way. Strategy alone now holds over 576,000 BTC, and more than 60 other public companies have followed suit, using Bitcoin as a core strategic reserve. Similarly, in the UK, despite the lack of regulatory clarity around digital assets, a number of listed firms are beginning to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. Alongside The Smarter Web Company, firms like Vinanz and Abraxas Capital have made sizeable Bitcoin allocations in recent months.

2025-06-27T10:00:40,"Kraken Launches Krak: A New Peer-To-Peer Crypto Payments App—Details","On Thursday, crypto exchange Kraken launched a peer-to-peer payments app, enabling users to send and receive funds in both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies across more than a hundred countries. This move aims to broaden Kraken’s services beyond its core digital asset trading operations, positioning the firm to compete directly with players like PayPal, Venmo, and Block’s CashApp. Kraken Plans Physical And Virtual Cards The newly introduced app, named Krak, offers users a dedicated spend account and the ability to instantly send and request payments in 300 different assets, which includes various cryptocurrencies and local currencies. Unlike traditional cash transfers, which often rely on external banking systems, Kraken will utilize its own internal infrastructure for these transactions, aiming to enhance efficiency and speed. In an interview with Reuters, Arjun Sethi, co-CEO of Kraken, emphasized the company’s ability to facilitate cross-border transactions. “We’re able to move money across borders right off the bat, because that’s what we do from a trading perspective,” he noted. Sethi highlighted that Kraken has spent over a decade building a “robust system” to comply with money transmitter licenses across various jurisdictions. He pointed out that customers are eager for new options for managing their money, prompting Kraken to expand its offerings . Looking ahead, Kraken has ambitious plans for Krak, with future developments including the introduction of physical and virtual cards, as well as advanced services like pay-in-advance loans. MiCA License Secured This expansion follows another significant announcement from the exchange, which recently secured a license under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) from the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI). Sethi remarked on the importance of this licensing achievement, stating, “Securing a license from the Central Bank of Ireland isn’t just about compliance; it’s a powerful signal of Kraken’s commitment to expanding the crypto ecosystem through responsible innovation.” The executive noted that being the first global crypto platform to receive authorization from the CBI underscores Kraken’s dedication to building for the long term. “Trust is the most valuable currency in crypto, and it’s something you earn,” he added. Kraken’s regulatory progress is noteworthy, as the exchange already holds Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) registrations in key European countries, including Ireland, Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, and Spain. With a strong foundation in euro-denominated trading , Kraken introduced the first BTC/EUR trading pair in 2013 and has since become one of the most-soughted platform for euro trading. With the MiCA license now secured, alongside existing MiFID and EMI licenses, the exchange is reportedly preparing to extend its regulated offerings to millions of clients throughout the EU.

2025-06-27T10:00:18,"XRP Price Declines Back To $2 As Legal Dispute With SEC Continues","The XRP price experienced a significant decline on Thursday following new developments in the ongoing legal dispute between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Judge Analisa Torres’ decision to deny the joint motion from Ripple and the SEC for an indicative ruling halted the XRP price recovery as it aimed to breach the nearest resistance level at $2.23. Key Issues Unresolved For Ripple Despite the SEC dropping its appeal, which indicated that the primary legal conflict between the two parties may be reaching a conclusion, Judge Torres’ ruling highlighted that several procedural matters still require resolution, including necessary court approvals. In her judgment, she made it clear that private agreements cannot supersede public court decisions, stating, “The parties do not have the authority to agree not to be bound by a court’s final judgment… They have not come close to doing so here.” Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move — Chart Signals Are Clear In response to the ruling, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to convey that the situation is now back in Ripple’s hands. The executive pointed out that the court has given them two options: either to dismiss their appeal regarding the historic institutional sales or to continue with the appeal. Regardless of the path chosen, Alderoty emphasized that XRP’s legal status as a non-security remains intact, reassuring stakeholders that it is business as usual. Expert Reactions To Torres’ Decision Legal expert Fred Rispoli also weighed in on the implications of the injunction, stating that it would not impact XRP in secondary markets or affect potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) filings awaiting approval by the SEC. He noted that the injunction is merely a court document and emphasized the low likelihood of Judge Torres calling Ripple and the SEC back into court unless the SEC believes Ripple is violating the terms of the injunction. Rispoli further questioned whether the SEC has the authority to grant Ripple the necessary exemptions to alleviate any restrictions imposed by the injunction, suggesting that such actions fall within the SEC’s executive powers. Ripple has asserted that it has adjusted its operations to align with the court’s findings, particularly regarding its past sales to institutional investors. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer Alderoty’s use of the term “historic institutional sales” in his recent statement indicates a shift in how both parties might approach future transactions, signaling a potential settlement that would allow XRP sales to institutions in a manner acceptable to the SEC. XRP Price Could Reach $5 Despite this temporary setback, market analysts remain optimistic about XRP’s future. Crypto analyst CryptoBullet recently noted that XRP’s two-week price chart resembles patterns seen in 2017, including a significant accumulation phase and a potential breakout. With this historical context in mind, the expert predicts a final surge in the XRP price, forecasting new all-time high targets between $4.50 and $5.40 for the cryptocurrency. As of press time, the XRP price has retreated to the $2.08 mark, which is a key support level for bulls anticipating further recovery of the token. In the last 24 hours, XRP has dropped 4.4%, and 10% in the last month. According to CoinGecko data, the XRP price remains 38% below its record high of $3.40.

2025-06-27T10:00:09,"Crypto fundraising revives and breaks above $4B in June","Crypto fundraising is on track to end the first half of 2025 on a high note, after a series of high-value private placements. Crypto VC funding usually tracks bullish periods, and has recovered after a couple of slower months. Crypto fundraising is back to levels not seen since 2022, ending the first half of 2025 with expansion, despite some slower months. Deals saw a trend shift, moving to large-scale private rounds and late-stage financing, with more cautious seed rounds. The model of funding a project only to sell tokens to exchanges is being phased out, instead focusing more on late-stage deals. VC funds remained vigilant for opportunities, but this time, the main driver was the rise of platforms with a widely adopted products. In the coming months, some of the high-profile crypto platforms plan to announce new large funding rounds. Some of the major deals include Polymarket , Pump.fun, and Kalshi . The latest deals may yet be included in the statistics for Q2 deals. Recently, World Liberty Fi also closed a $100M inflow from the Aqua 1 fund. June fundraising breaks above $4B Crypto fundraising tracks the general mood on the crypto market. After a relatively slow start to 2025, some months posted peak results. In March, total VC deals expanded to $5B. Even in slower months, VC fundraising was consistently above $1B, though some months included a concentration of large deals. Coinbase Ventures was the leader with nine deals, followed by Pantera Capital leading six funding rounds. Most of the deals were also made in undisclosed international locations, for a total of 70 rounds. The USA only saw 15 deals for the past month. However, those deals were the biggest, raising over $1.79B. Singapore-based projects raised a further $1.09B. Crypto VC deals moved to international locations, but the USA is still the leader in terms of USD value. | Source: Cryptorank A total of 103 rounds in June raised over $4.49B, with the potential for more deals to be added to the bottom line. The absolute record for VC deals is over $6.88B in November 2021, during the first Web3 boom. This time around, VC deals are not led by narrative, but by established use cases and signs of growth from transactions, fees, and liquidity. Projects like EigenCloud were among the significant deals for the past month, raising $70M in a late-stage round. For smaller projects, token sales, airdrops and special events have returned as a viable source of funding. In the past four months, token sales raised consistently over $4B on a monthly basis, tapping crypto natives and whales. In June, a total of 174 sales raised $4.79B, surpassing even the level of large VC rounds. The main source of interest in token sales were again the special campaigns of Binance Wallet and PancakeSwap. For the month of June, most TGE and token sales used those two platforms, achieving the highest returns. Binance Wallet projects posted gains of 483% on average, while PancakeSwap achieved 228.5%. The success of token sales relied on concentrating most of the opportunities on a single platform, having a guaranteed pool of buyers. Most projects have abandoned ICO attempts outside the top platforms, which give them the biggest exposure to liquidity.

2025-06-27T10:00:00,"Sei Crypto Traders Attention: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Offers 150% Returns with Mobile Mining Before LBank Exchange Launch","Sei traders have spent 2024 chasing fast-turning markets — but many are now shifting capital into something built for returns, not just hype. Bitcoin Solaris has emerged as one of the most aggressively priced and structurally sound entries of the year. It’s now in Phase 9 of its presale, priced at $9 per token — with a confirmed listing on LBank coming soon and a projected launch valuation of $20. With over $5 million already raised and more than 11,500 wallets participating, BTC-S is now delivering token flow — not just promising it. Nova Mining System Converts Phones Into Earners Forget staking lockups or GPU farms. The Nova App gives users the ability to mine BTC-S using spare CPU and storage on ordinary smartphones. During beta testing, mobile users earned live rewards by participating in validation — no setup required. This works because Bitcoin Solaris runs a hybrid architecture. At the base, it uses Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Capacity to keep mining decentralized and efficient. On the upper Solaris Layer, it deploys Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-History, and Proof-of-Time to push transactions at tested speeds over 10,000 TPS. The result: mining access built for participation, not exclusivity — and real yield distribution even before the token lists. Token Rewards Are Already Flowing Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t delay rewards. The Casino module is live, giving every verified wallet one free spin daily, with instant payouts in BTC-S. Token rewards are issued directly on Solana during presale and will be migrated 1:1 to the Bitcoin Solaris chain upon mainnet launch. Buyers who enter with $250 or more unlock additional spins, with top-tier purchases eligible for prizes of up to 0.5 BTC. These mechanics are designed to deliver rewards now: Crypto Vlog recently highlighted Bitcoin Solaris as a working economy in a presale shell — built to deliver returns before listing, not after. The Presale Is Fixed, Transparent, and Ending Fast There are 21 million BTC-S tokens total. Of those, just 4.2 million are allocated for presale — across all phases. No additional emissions, unlock schedules, or delayed allocations are waiting to dilute holders after listing. Everyone buys at public pricing — and right now that’s $9. With LBank listing confirmed, price movement is coming. At a $20 projected listing value, current presale entries offer more than 150% return potential before secondary demand even activates. And because rewards are tied to usage, not speculation, the token’s value driver is active user behavior. Fully Audited, Team Verified, Exchange Ready The token contract passed a full audit by Cyberscope . The Nova App engine was audited separately by Freshcoins . The dev team is KYC verified , and the roadmap is already rolling forward. Testnet, dev toolkit, and wallet upgrades are scheduled. A Mining Power Marketplace is in active development. These aren’t theoretical milestones — they’re tracked deliverables, and the buildout is already in motion. BTC-S is transitioning from presale to public exchange launch. Traders moving out of stagnant altcoins like SEI are stepping into a project that already has functioning products, clear token distribution, and a live reward system. This is a defined entry point with demand already forming and utilities in use.

2025-06-27T09:58:29,"UK’s Smarter Web Company Raises £41.2M After Acquiring 196 Bitcoin – More BTC Purchases Coming?","The Smarter Web Company, a UK-based web design and marketing firm, has raised £41.2 million ($56.59 million) just days after making headlines with a $20 million purchase of nearly 197 Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: The Smarter Web Company raised £41.2 million days after buying nearly 197 Bitcoin. Its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions have boosted holdings to over 543 BTC in just a month. Despite strong crypto moves, the firm’s shares fell 15% but remain up 274% year-to-date. The firm announced on Thursday that it secured funding from institutional investors through an accelerated bookbuild, a method that enables companies to raise capital quickly without extensive marketing. Of the total funds, £36.27 million ($49.8 million) came from the bookbuild, while an additional £4.97 million ($6.82 million) was raised through subscription. The shares were offered at £2.90 ($3.98) each, with the new stock expected to take effect on July 1. Smarter Web’s Fundraising Fuels Bold Bitcoin Buying Spree The fundraising follows The Smarter Web Company’s aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. Earlier this week, the firm revealed it bought 196.8 BTC at an average price of $103,290, boosting its total Bitcoin holdings to 543.52 BTC—worth approximately $58.19 million. Since launching its Bitcoin treasury strategy in April, the firm has purchased BTC five times in June alone, growing its stash by 460 BTC in less than a month. Despite the crypto push, The Smarter Web Company’s shares have struggled. Trading on the US OTCQB market under the ticker TSWCF, the company’s stock fell 15% on Thursday to close at $3.56 after reaching an intraday low of $3.19, according to Google Finance. The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC $TSWCF ) RNS Announcement: Bitcoin Purchase. Purchase of additional Bitcoin as part of ""The 10 Year Plan"" which includes an ongoing treasury policy of acquiring Bitcoin.

Even with recent volatility, the stock remains up 274% so far in 2025. Meanwhile, other UK firms are also ramping up their Bitcoin bets amid Britain’s unclear regulatory stance on digital assets. On Tuesday, Vinanz, a London-listed Bitcoin treasury company, announced it had acquired 37.72 BTC , bringing its total holdings to nearly 59 BTC. In April, investment firm Abraxas Capital made waves with a Bitcoin purchase exceeding $250 million. VanEck Flags Risks in Corporate Bitcoin Strategies Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, has voiced fresh concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms, warning that aggressive BTC accumulation could ultimately hurt shareholders. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). To protect investors, he suggested suspending ATM programs if shares trade below 0.95 times NAV for more than 10 consecutive days. He drew parallels with past missteps in the crypto mining sector, where rampant dilution and inflated executive compensation wiped out shareholder value. Sigel pointed to Semler Scientific, a medical technology company that pivoted to Bitcoin in 2024, as a cautionary tale. Despite amassing 3,808 BTC, Semler’s stock has plunged over 45%, dragging its market NAV down to 0.82 times NAV.

2025-06-27T09:38:50,"Bitcoin Pepe price outlook as Genius Group looks at Bitcoin buys from lawsuit winnings","Artificial intelligence-powered edtech company Genius Group has announced plans to distribute potential proceeds from two multibillion-dollar lawsuits to its shareholders and allocate part of the funds to expand its Bitcoin holdings. As more companies plan to boost their Bitcoin holdings, Bitcoin Pepe , an early-stage project, is building momentum. Lawsuit winnings The board of directors of Genius Group has approved a plan to use any potential winnings from two legal cases—one filed and one pending—to either directly benefit shareholders or reinvest in the company. The combined value of damages sought exceeds $1 billion. One of the lawsuits, filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), targets LZGI International with a claim of over $750 million. A second lawsuit, which Genius Group CEO Roger Hamilton says is forthcoming, is expected to seek at least $262 million based on 2023 data, with the final amount likely to increase as damages from 2024 and 2025 are included. Hamilton emphasized that the goal of both lawsuits is to recover losses incurred by shareholders. He added that the board believes 100% of any proceeds should be distributed to or reinvested for the benefit of shareholders. On Friday, Bitcoin was trading at $106,868.66, down 0.47% in the last 24 hours as traders continued to book profits after a strong spell. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by marketcap is down 5% from its all time high in May. Bitcoin treasury expansion Under the proposed plan, 50% of any winnings will be paid out as a special dividend to shareholders, while the remaining 50% will be used to expand the company’s Bitcoin treasury. If both lawsuits are successful, Genius Group expects to issue a $7 per share dividend and acquire 5,000 BTC based on the current market price of approximately $107,000 per Bitcoin. The company noted, however, that there is no guarantee of a favorable outcome or resulting payouts. On June 17, Genius Group increased its Bitcoin holdings by over 50% through a series of acquisitions, aiming to eventually hold 1,000 BTC in its corporate treasury. The company had previously been under a temporary restriction that barred it from selling shares, raising funds, or using investor money to purchase Bitcoin. That restriction was lifted after one month. Bitcoin Pepe gains traction with infrastructure-driven approach Genius Group’s plans to buy more Bitcoin to make a treasury of the crypto asset are the latest move among many companies’ actions regarding Bitcoin. Recently, Panther Metals unveiled plans to acquire £4 million (approximately $5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s Strategy and MetaPlanet also increased their Bitcoin holdings recently. Bitcoin Pepe is positioning itself within this evolving landscape. Unlike meme tokens that depend primarily on hype, the project aims to integrate viral appeal with infrastructure development. Functioning as a Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Pepe leverages Bitcoin’s base-layer security while aiming to deliver the scalability seen in platforms like Solana. This combination sets it apart from many other meme-based cryptocurrencies. The project’s infrastructure-first strategy appears to be resonating with investors, as evidenced by a presale that has already raised over $15.9 million. Confirmed exchange listings on MEXC and BitMart have contributed to the project’s momentum. A listing announcement is scheduled for June 30, further boosting interest as the presale continues.

On June 26, Genius Group, a Singapore-based AI-driven education company listed on the NYSE American, announced a new distribution plan that would see proceeds from its ongoing legal cases split equally between shareholder dividends and Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases for its corporate treasury. The company is currently pursuing two major lawsuits seeking over $1 billion in damages. The first, already filed in the Southern District of Florida under the RICO Act, demands over $750 million in damages tied to alleged misconduct by former partners and executives. The second, expected to be filed soon, targets alleged naked short selling and spoofing, with preliminary damages estimated above $260 million — figures expected to rise with updated 2024–2025 trading data. If successful, 50% of any net legal recoveries — after fees and taxes—will be issued to shareholders as a special dividend. The remaining 50% will be used to purchase Bitcoin for the company’s treasury.

Specifically, the company added 34 BTC to its corporate treasury, increasing its total holdings to 100 BTC. The acquisitions were made at an average price of $100,600 per Bitcoin, totaling roughly $10.06 million in investment. With the ban lifted, the CEO reiterated its 1,000 BTC target.

Banana For Scale crypto price prediction: general outlook Banana For Scale price prediction 2025 Banana For Scale price prediction 2030 What is Banana For Scale? Banana For Scale ( BANANAS31 ) is a meme token built on the BNB Smart Chain, inspired by the classic internet joke where a banana is used to show the size of things — you’ve probably seen it on Reddit or old-school meme pages. The token officially launched on November 15, 2024, via the Four.meme platform and quickly caught attention thanks to its quirky origin and community-driven vibe. It really took off when a banana sticker was spotted on SpaceX’s Starship S31 — a real moment of meme meets space. Since launch, BANANAS31 has attracted tens of thousands of holders and carved out a spot for itself in the memecoin universe , blending humor, DAO-powered governance, and internet culture into one bananas-packed project. Is Banana For Scale a good investment? Let’s take a look at the Banana For Scale coin price prediction.

BANANA 1-day chart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news BANANAS31 has found its own lane in the memecoin world thanks to its fun branding and viral energy. It’s still pretty new but already gaining momentum, especially after some recent exchange listings and buzz from retail traders.

If you’re into memes, community-driven tokens, and a bit of chaos — BANANAS31 might be right up your alley. It’s got strong meme energy, a growing fanbase, and a few viral moments already under its belt. But like any memecoin, it’s a wild ride: prices can soar on hype and drop just as fast. So, if you decide to get involved, think of it as a high-risk, high-volatility investment — and only put in what you’re fully prepared to lose.

Intrigued? The AI-powered education company is chasing over $1 billion in damages through two lawsuits. If the cases succeed, half the winnings will go to shareholders as a special dividend, and the other half will be used to buy Bitcoin. It’s an unusual but strategic move. Big Win? Here’s What Shareholders and Bitcoin Get In a press release on Thursday, Genius Group’s board approved a plan to split any future legal wins. CEO Roger Hamilton says the company will distribute 50% of net damages to shareholders and use the rest to grow its Bitcoin treasury. According to the company, a successful outcome in both lawsuits could result in a $7 per share dividend and an acquisition of 5,000 BTC at today’s prices.

Genius is seeking more than $750 million in damages. The second lawsuit, still being finalized, focuses on naked short selling and spoofing. Based on 2023 data, the company expects at least $262 million in damages but that number is likely to grow with updated trading records from 2024 and 2025. Hamilton emphasized that these lawsuits are meant to recover losses directly caused to shareholders. Lawsuits Could Fund BTC Push Genius Group has already started building a Bitcoin treasury. Earlier this month, it boosted its BTC holdings by over 50% and said it’s aiming to accumulate 1,000 BTC. But if the legal strategy pays off, the company could fast-track that goal. “There’s no guarantee how much we recover,” Hamilton admitted . Still, he floated a best-case scenario where justice wins, and Bitcoin climbs. “Wouldn’t that be the ultimate irony,” he added, “where victims end up making 100x what the crooks stole from them because we fought back.” What Comes Next There’s no timeline yet for how long the lawsuits will take or how much might be recovered. Any payouts will depend on final damages, legal fees, taxes, and regulatory approvals in both the U.S. and Singapore.

Hayes tells his 704,300 followers on the social media platform X that US legislation and monetary policy, as well as tensions in the Middle East, are among the reasons he believes will trigger Bitcoin to push higher. On the US monetary policy, Hayes says the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) exemption for banks is now “progressing.” SLR exemption is a monetary policy tool that allows banks to hold more U.S. Treasury securities without raising their supplementary leverage ratio, a move that boosts their liquidity. The BitMEX co-founder further says the GENIUS Act, which provides a framework for regulating stablecoins, will hand the US stablecoin market to the banks. According to Hayes, the legislation, which became law earlier this month, will be positive for lenders. Hayes further says the Middle East region still presents a geopolitical risk, a factor that favors safe-haven assets, despite a recent ceasefire between Iran and Israel that was brokered by President Donald Trump. “BTC all-time highs are coming!” The BitMEX co-founder also says an unwind of the US dollar carry trade globally is about to cause “serious pain.” A carry trade is a bet on the interest rate differences between two countries. In the case of the US dollar, the expectation of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve is causing a weakening of the world’s reserve currency, as this will reduce the returns expected on the dollar-denominated assets. According to Hayes, Bitcoin is the antidote for the ongoing weakening of the US dollar.

2025-06-27T09:10:49,"XRP may fall below $2.00 despite Wormhole integration; check forecast","The cryptocurrency market could end the week bearish despite its positive start. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is down 1% in the last 24 hours and has now dropped below $107k. As usual, Bitcoin’s performance dictates how altcoins react. Most altcoins are currently in the red, including Ethereum’s Ether and Ripple’s XRP. XRP risks dropping below $2 soon. XRP drops below $2.1 despite wormhole integration XRP has lost 4.5% of its value in the last 24 hours and currently trades at $2.0905. The bearish performance comes despite Ripple’s integration with Wormhole. Wormhole announced on Thursday that Ripple has expanded its multichain interoperability by integrating with its infrastructure. The integration will enable cross-chain messaging, asset transfers, and multichain issuances of tokens, which will support additional use cases across DeFi, institutional onchain finance, and real-world assets (RWAs), including tokenized securities and regulated financial instruments. Furthermore, Wormhole will integrate its cross-chain messaging infrastructure with both the XRPL mainnet and the XRPL EVM Sidechain for seamless interoperability. This will empower developers to transfer supported XRPL assets, including XRP, Issued Assets (IOUs), and Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs), across more than 35 supported chains and build scalable, cross-chain decentralized applications (dApps). Developers can also interact with smart contracts across chains using messaging and data triggers. The news failed to catalyze an XRP rally. Instead, XRP now faces a decline to the $1.90 support level. XRP faces a potential drop to $1.90 The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bearish despite a positive week for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. The pair is bearish and efficient, which means sellers are firmly in control and could push XRP’s price lower. After eliminating the liquidity level above $2.2, XRP has resumed its bearish run, dropping to the $2.09 level. If the bearish trend continues, XRP could test the next support level at $1.9052 in the coming hours or over the weekend. In the event of an extended dip, XRP could drop to the next major support level at $1.7293. However, this drop will likely happen if the broader crypto market embarks on a long bearish run. If not, then the $1.90 support level could hold and serve as a springboard for XRP to rally higher. The 4-hour technical indicators are bearish. The MACD lines are at the neutral zone and heading into the negative territory, suggesting that the sellers have temporarily gained control of the XRP market. The RSI of 40 also shows that XRP is currently facing selling pressure from investors. The bulls seem to be exhausted, and this is affecting XRP’s price action and other major cryptocurrencies. However, if the bulls regain control, XRP could target the liquidity level around $2.65. The market conditions currently do not support an XRP rally to mitigate the 4H Inducement Liquidity (ILQ) at $2.99.

2025-06-27T09:09:24,"HIVE Digital: Underwhelming Q4, Continue To Avoid","Summary HIVE's Q4 results reinforce my view that Bitcoin mining is structurally unprofitable, with declining revenues despite higher Bitcoin prices and hashrate. The company's relentless capacity expansion is necessary to keep pace with industry difficulty, but it results in a never-ending cycle of capital investment and little financial return. HIVE's HPC/AI business remains insignificant compared to industry leaders, offering no meaningful diversification or growth opportunity. I continue to recommend avoiding HIVE for long-term investors, as the economics of Bitcoin mining remain unattractive, except during rare Bitcoin price surges. It's been a few months since I last wrote about HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) . In my last article, I was cautious on HIVE, as the company's perpetual share dilution and volatile stock price make it unattractive for long-term investors. Since my article, HIVE's shares have done well, returning 10.8% (Figure 1). Figure 1 - HIVE has risen 11% since March (Seeking Alpha) However, with the company releasing its fiscal fourth quarter results, I thought it would be timely to catch up with the company and see if HIVE's financial performance has improved or if there are any interesting corporate developments worth commenting on. Overall, HIVE's fourth quarter financial performance reiterates my thesis about the poor economics of Bitcoin mining. Although Bitcoin prices rose significantly YoY and HIVE's hashrate rose 40% YoY from 4.5 EH/s to 6.3 EH/s, HIVE saw a YoY revenue decline and a big net loss as Bitcoin prices dipped in the quarter. HIVE remains an avoid for me. Brief Company Overview For those not familiar, HIVE's core business remains its Bitcoin mining operations, which currently operate at 6 Exahash/s (""EH/s""), with plans to expand capacity to quadruple capacity to 25.5 EH/s by September 2025 (Figure 2). Figure 2 - HIVE's footprint ( Investor Presentation ) HIVE also has a nascent High-Performance Compute/Artificial Intelligence (""HPC/AI"") business unit that rents out its graphical processing units (""GPUs"") to businesses and researchers seeking access to the latest NVIDIA GPUs for AI workloads. Q4/2025 Was Underwhelming As mentioned above, HIVE's recently reported its fiscal fourth quarter results. Revenue was $31.2 million, a 15.4% YoY decline, despite Bitcoin prices rising significantly YoY (Figure 3). Figure 3 - HIVE Q4 financial summary ( Company Reports ) The main culprit is HIVE's Bitcoin production, which plunged to just 303 coins mined in the three months ended March 31, 2025. Bitcoin Mining Is A Mug's Game As I have written numerous times, Bitcoin mining is a mug's game because miners need to constantly upgrade their kit, increasing difficulty for the industry and reducing production for everyone (Figure 4). Figure 4 - Bitcoin mining difficulty is ever increasing (blockchain.com) So, even though HIVE's hashrate has increased ""from approximately 4.5 EH/s on March 31, 2024 to 6.3 EH/s on March 31, 2025"", the number of coins mined got sliced in half for HIVE, leading to lower YoY revenues. HIVE Continues To Grow Capacity The problem is that HIVE can't stop growing capacity, since everyone else in the industry is constantly buying more servers and data centers to mine Bitcoin (see the rising difficulty above). For HIVE, there is some positive news on the growth front. As per the quarterly press release , ""HIVE commissioned the first 100 MW at Yguazú two weeks ahead of its projected schedule,"" doubling the company's hashrate to 11.5 EH/s, which is sufficient to mine 5.5 Bitcoins per day at current difficulty. This growth is part of the company's plans to quadruple its hashrate to over 25 EH/s by December 2025 (author's note, the figure below from the latest corporate presentation shows plans for 25.5 EH/s by September, so management's latest update implies a slight delay to the growth plans) (Figure 5). Figure 5 - HIVE plans to quadruple hashrate to 25.5 EH/s by year-end ( Investor Presentation ) However, given the arms race to deploy more servers to mine Bitcoin, I fear investors will see much less growth in production than expected. Just counting the large publicly traded Bitcoin miners, we see growth plans to increase hashrate by ~50% by September (Figure 6). Figure 6 - Everyone else is also planning growth in hashrate ( Investor Presentation ) So while HIVE may enjoy a temporary boost to production, as competitor servers are brought online, HIVE's Bitcoin production will once again trend lower, unless it expands capacity again. This is a never-ending cycle of capital investment with little financial return. What Does HIVE Have To Show For Its Capital? Since 2016, HIVE has spent over $700 million in capital expenditures and acquisitions (Figure 7), including nearly $200 million in the last twelve months (Figure 8). Figure 7 - HIVE has spent over $700 million in capex since 2016 (Seeking Alpha) Figure 8 - HIVE invested $200 million in last twelve months ( Company Reports ) However, if we look at the balance sheet, HIVE only has $202 million in net PP&E and 2,201 Bitcoins in its HODL account, worth $181 million, to show for its efforts (Figures 9 and 10). Figure 9 - HIVE PP&E ( Company Reports ) Figure 10 - HIVE HODL account for Bitcoin ( Company Reports ) Simply put, Bitcoin mining does not appear to be a positive NPV activity that creates economic value. HPC Remains A Rounding Error As I have written previously, HIVE's HPC/AI business continues to struggle to gain traction. Although the company claims to have tripled revenues to $10.1 million in F2025 (Figure 11), HIVE's tier-3 data centers simply lack the scale and sophistication to compete with the leading AI companies like CoreWeave Coreweave ( CRWV ). Figure 11 - HIVE quarterly revenues breakdown ( Company Reports ) As a comparison, CoreWeave saw revenues increase 420% YoY to $982 million in the most recent quarter (Figure 12)! Figure 12 - CRWV saw revenues explode to nearly $1 billion in latest quarter ( Investor Presentation ) Frankly (pun intended), it is embarrassing for HIVE to even mention HPC/AI as a separate business unit, given its lack of scale. Risks To Being Cautious In my opinion, the only upside to HIVE is the hope for a surge in Bitcoin prices. If Bitcoin prices were to rise materially in a short period of time, Bitcoin miners may be able to enjoy bonanza profits, like they did in 2021/2022, when the price of cryptocurrencies rose much faster than the difficulty of mining them, leading to positive profitability (Figure 13). Figure 13 - HIVE was only profitable briefly in 2021/2022 (Seeking Alpha) Conclusion HIVE's recently reported Q4/2025 earnings do not change my mind on the poor economics of the Bitcoin mining business. Simply put, Bitcoin mining is a mug's game where every player is on a treadmill to increase capacity, driving up overall industry difficulty and reducing Bitcoin production. Except for brief stretches when Bitcoin prices rise faster than difficulty, Bitcoin mining is a net negative NPV activity. I continue to advise long-term investors to avoid HIVE and its peers.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797688-hive-digital-underwhelming-q4-continue-to-avoid?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED","HIVE|HIVE:CA",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T09:05:09,"Both Good and Bad News for Bitcoin (BTC) from Analysts! ""There is a Risk of a Major Crash, But….""","Bitcoin (BTC) rose to $107,000 from $100,000 at the beginning of the week following news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. While there is uncertainty in the market about which direction BTC will move next, Katalin Tischhauser, Head of Investment Research at Sygnum, made important statements. Speaking to CoinDesk, Katalin Tischhauser argued that Bitcoin is unlikely to crash without unexpected black swan events like the Terra or FTX crash. Arguing that there will be a long-term bull cycle unless such a black swan event occurs, Tischhauser said: “The crypto market is strongly sentiment-driven. Therefore, technical analysis signals such as double tops warrant caution. However, a full-fledged collapse needs a swansong like the Terra collapse or the FTX explosion in 2022. Barring a similar black swan, we could see a prolonged bull cycle based on current political and regulatory support and sticky institutional capital flowing in.” Double Top Risk in Bitcoin! Bitcoin has been stuck between $100,000 and $110,000 in recent weeks, prompting analysts to speculate that Bitcoin’s uptrend is exhausted and that the trend could reverse to a bearish double-top pattern. The double top formation is interpreted as a sign that prices will switch from an uptrend to a downtrend. At this point, analysts like Katalin Tischhauser and Peter Brandt think that Bitcoin could form a double top pattern above $100,000. But Tischhauser also thinks a major crash is unlikely unless there is a black swan event like the one in 2022. Although such a big drop seems unlikely for BTC, if a double top pattern forms, it could mean that BTC could fall 75% from its peak to $27,000. At this point, Peter Brandt pointed out in an analysis he made at the beginning of the month the potential for a double top pattern to form and a 75% correction to occur. According to the pattern, a double top at $ 110,000 was taken as the basis, and a low level of $ 75,000 was taken before the second top. In this context, according to analysts, if BTC breaks below $ 75,000, this means that a double top pattern has formed and could lead to a 75% drop from the peak. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-27T09:03:12,"Why is crypto down today : SOL, XRP and memecoins plummet amidst Bitcoin dominance rise","The crypto market is experiencing a downturn as major tokens like Bitcoin, XRP and Solana plummet, with the SOL ecosystem and PayFi sector both dropping over 4%. Why is crypto down today? According to data from CoinGecko, the overall market cap for crypto has fallen by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. It currently stands at $3.39 trillion. The drop is reflected by many of the major tokens experiencing a decline in the past day of trading. Traders are now left wondering why is crypto down today. So far, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has remained mostly steady compared to other tokens. At press time, BTC dipped by 0.4%. It is currently trading hands at $107,355. Similarly, Ethereum ( ETH ) has dropped by 1.5% in the past 24 hours to a value of $2,447. However, the biggest drops can be seen in Solana ( SOL ) and XPR ( XRP ). In the past 24 hours, XRP fell by 4.2%. It has experienced the worst fall compared to the other tokens ranked among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. Solana comes in second place after XRP, having fallen by more than 2.5% in the past trading day. Meanwhile, smaller tokens like Ethena ( ENA ) specifically has dropped by 5%, as it trades near the $0.25 threshold. Pressure from Germany’s BaFin ordering a 42-day redemption after stopping sales of Ethena’s stablecoin USDe (USDE) in March, bringing it near the $0.21 support area. You might also like: What to expect in the week ahead for the altcoin market: BTC, BERA, INJ and more Adding to Solana’s price drop, the Solana ecosystem has also experienced a decline. According to data from SoSoValue, the Solana ecosystem sector fell 4.24% in 24 hours. Within the sector, Solana and Jupiter ( JUP ) both fell 4.12% and 4.94% respectively. Meanwhile, the PayFi sector followed suit with a 4.03% decline. On the other hand, the memecoin sector has suffered a 3.91% drop, with major tokens like SPX6900 ( SPX ) experiencing corrections. Out of the top 10 memecoins by market cap, SPX has taken the worst dive by 10.21% in the past day. Meanwhile, top three tokens like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), and Pepe ( PEPE ) only saw modest corrections of 2.31%, 3.27% and 3.24% respectively. Why is crypto down today? Today’s crypto market dip seems to be driven by underlying market fears and technical bearish indicators. Although the crypto market cap has dropped, the overall crypto trading volume has remained in the green. This could indicate that traders are selling more tokens amidst the decline instead of holding on for the long haul. The answer to why is crypto down today lies in the current geopolitical state of the world which shows no signs of cooling down anytime soon. Despite recent news of a ceasefire that brought Bitcoin above and beyond the $105,000 mark, investors are taking profits and staying cautious amid upcoming macroeconomic events like the Fed rate decision. In addition, analysts have noted that BTC has entered a critical supply zone at around $108,000 to $110,000, with indicators like RSI and MACD signaling cooling momentum to the current cycle. This could explain why is crypto down today, considering Bitcoin dominance has climbed above 65%.

Instead of rushing up with wild price swings, things seem calm and steady. Crypto analyst Crypto Dan says this shows the market is cooling, not overheating — and that could be a healthy sign. At the same time, crypto traders are watching $108,500 closely, and even big names like Coinbase are now buying BTC every week. Is this the calm before Bitcoin’s next breakout? Analyst: No Signs of Panic or Hype According to CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan , Bitcoin’s trading volume is showing signs of cooling. He shared a bubble chart that helps explain this — big circles mean high trading volume, and the colors show how fast the volume is changing. Right now, the bubbles show the market is calm. There’s no sharp increase in buying or selling, which means people aren’t acting out of fear or greed. Instead, this steady pace may mean Bitcoin is building a stronger base before its next move.

Things like interest rate cuts or clearer crypto regulations could be the boost it needs. Traders Are Watching $108,500 Level Adding bullishness to the sentiment, Crypto expert Michael van de Poppe says Bitcoin is resting now but could jump higher soon. He says the small pullback is normal and not a reason to worry. Meanwhile, this sideways move can help Bitcoin gather power to break through the big resistance level at $108,500. If that level is broken, many traders expect Bitcoin to shoot up quickly, possibly reaching $110,000 or more, just like it has done in the past when it cleared major hurdles. Coinbase Is Buying Bitcoin Every Week While things may look quiet on the surface, big players are taking action. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong recently said the company is buying Bitcoin every week.

Despite this, Kakaopay is facing headwinds on its stablecoin adoption. South Korea is facing a resurgence of interest in crypto, reviving older projects and stablecoin usage. However, regulatory pressures are curbing some of the growth, especially when it comes to stablecoin issuers. Recently, the shares of Kakaopay broke their 2025 rally, coming down from their peak. Kakao Pay Corp. traded at a peak of 93,800 KRW ($69.17), recently dropping to the equivalent of $62.09. The shares lost 15% in a single day after the company received warnings on its own attempts to use stablecoins. The stablecoin narrative boosted the share price by 200% in June, before the recent setback. Kakao Pay Corp. broke its rally, after regulators warned fintech and crypto companies may not have an advantage in issuing stablecoins. | Source: Google Finance Kakaopay was seen as the potential leader, benefitting from the new South Korean legislation on stablecoins. The news of a potential setback arrived after Kakaopay had filed a patent for a Korean won stablecoin, selecting the ticker KPKRW. The new requirement tying stablecoins only to commercial banks, however, means crypto companies will not have an advantage in launching the digital won. The expectation of having a new Kakao-based stablecoin also boosted KAIA, the native token of Kakao’s new chain. KAIA rallied to a three-month high above $0.20, recently taking a step back to $0.17. The South Korean market is more conservative, offering a predominance of fiat trading pairs. The ability to mint stablecoins remains limited, as South Korea’s central bank warned about the rushed unrolling of new assets. In the country, stablecoins can only be issued by licensed commercial banks, limiting the venue for DeFi projects and unregulated crypto-backed stablecoins. Kakopay was considered one of the first potential issuers of a stablecoin. However, for South Korean companies, combining fintech with stablecoin payments is not as straightforward as in other regions. Despite this, South Korean investors were still keen on the stablecoin narrative. In the past month, Circle (CRCL) became the most widely purchased foreign stock in the country, with $443M from Korean retail. Kakao’s ecosystem still uses stablecoins for decentralized activities. Kaia chain carries $106M in bridged stablecoins, mostly USDT for decentralized transactions. Kaia’s stablecoins are used in other regions, with no limitations for on-chain tokens outside South Korea. South Korea remains a crypto powerhouse in 2025 South Korean exchanges logged over $663B in trades for the year to date. The country remains one of the sources for retail adoption, with 22.6% to 30% penetration rate among regular users and retail traders. The Korean Won still carries around 1.8% of BTC trading and over 2.5% of ETH volumes. The country’s exchanges also have a marked effect on altcoins, often following Upbit and Bithumb listings. South Korean traders also draw attention to an entirely different selection of altcoins compared to other markets. The country remains a factor in reviving demand and providing use cases for multiple platforms from previous bull markets. With more conservative listing requirements, South Korean exchanges were not overwhelmed by a wave of memes, still providing liquidity for a shorter list of assets.

2025-06-27T09:00:19,"Deaton Says Ripple IPO Could Trigger $100B Valuation, How High Will The XRP Price Be?","The possibilities of a Ripple Initial Public Offering (IPO) have become higher as time goes on and the company moves toward a complete resolution of its SEC lawsuit. With expectations of the IPO rising, possible valuations have started to fly around as the company is one of the largest cryptocurrency companies. Most notably, pro-XRP lawyer and community member John Deaton has proposed that the Ripple IPO could lead to the company being valued at over $100 billion. Deaton Puts Ripple At $100 Billion The comment and valuation from lawyer John Deaton come after Circle, the company behind the USDC stablecoin, successfully completed its Initial Public Offering (IPO). So far, the crypto firm has found a lot of success in the market, surging from an initial $5 billion valuation to over $63 billion in valuation post-IPO. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Deaton responded to a post on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting this feat, pointing out how Ripple could be even more successful in this regard. He explains that despite Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse saying that the company was in no rush to go public, the IPO should be timed correctly to have the right impact. Pointing to the current market environment, he points out that if Circle can grow to a $63 billion valuation, then it means that Ripple can soar even higher. Given XRP’s standing in the market as the 4th-largest cryptocurrency, ahead of Circle’s USDC, which sits at 7th place, Deaton believes that Ripple’s valuation post-IPO can rise to $100 billion. “If Circle can hit a 62B-75B market cap then Ripple, with nearly 40B XRP, currently valued at $2 (ie $80B), could certainly hit a $100B market cap in this environment,” Deaton wrote. As Bitcoinist reported, Ripple had issued a $700 million tender offer with shares priced at $175. This now puts the equity valuation of the company at $25 billion with 141 million outstanding shares as investors look favorably at the crypto firm. How High Could The XRP Price Go? Market experts have speculated that if the Ripple IPO does go through and the valuation soars, the XRP price will soar in tandem. Crypto investor Dennis Liu shared a video that suggested a successful IPO would be positive for the XRP price. He points out that a symbiotic relationship of the XRP coin related to the Ripple stock would be the dream of investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Rally To $110,000 ATH As These Macroeconomic Factors Align Other market experts have debated that the XRP price would go double-digits to rise above $10 if this happens.

2025-06-27T08:57:25,"Private Key and Front End Exploits Lead Crypto Thefts in 2025","The majority of the thefts were driven by private key compromises and front-end exploits, which together accounted for more than 80% of stolen funds across 75 incidents. These highly targeted attacks very often involve social engineering and infrastructure vulnerabilities, and they have become much more more damaging, averaging nearly $30 million per breach. A $1.5 billion hack on Dubai-based exchange Bybit, linked to North Korean state actors, was the largest single incident and contributed to nearly 70% of total losses. Geopolitical tensions have also entered the crypto security space, with groups like the pro-Israel hacker collective Predatory Sparrow targeting Iranian exchanges. In the DeFi sector, Resupply lost $9.6 million in a price manipulation exploit involving synthetic assets. Meanwhile, British hacker Kai West was indicted in the US for selling stolen data through BreachForums, raking in millions in Bitcoin and Monero. Crypto Theft Soars in 2025 Crypto-related cyberattacks surged to unprecedented levels in the first half of 2025, which resulted in a staggering $2.1 billion in losses. This is according to a new report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. The majority of these losses stemmed from private key exploits and front-end compromises, which together made up more than 80% of the value stolen across 75 separate incidents this year. These infrastructure-based attacks, which include compromising a user’s private seed phrase or exploiting vulnerabilities in a crypto platform’s interface, have proven to be particularly damaging as they typically net hackers ten times more value than other forms of cyberattacks. (Source: TRM Labs ) TRM Labs explained that these kinds of attacks leverage core weaknesses in cryptosystems and are frequently exacerbated by social engineering tactics that are designed to manipulate users. In addition to infrastructure breaches, protocol exploits were another key threat vector. These attacks, like flash loan exploits and re-entrancy vulnerabilities, accounted for 12% of total losses during the period and target the underlying smart contracts or logic of a blockchain protocol to steal money or destabilize operations. The scale of theft in H1 2025 already exceeds the previous half-year record that was set in 2022 by approximately 10% and is almost equal to the entire year’s total for 2024. A major driver of this year’s record-breaking losses was a $1.5 billion hack on the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit , which was attributed to North Korean state-backed hackers. That single incident represents around 70% of total funds stolen so far in 2025 and pushed the average hack size to nearly $30 million. This is double that of the previous year. State actors and politically motivated hacking groups seem to be playing a larger role in these attacks. TRM Labs pointed to the pro-Israel hacker collective Gonjeshke Darande , also known as Predatory Sparrow, which has possible links to the Israeli government and was responsible for a $100 million exploit on Iran’s largest exchange, Nobitex, in June. The report frames this escalation as a “pivotal shift” in the landscape of crypto hacking, where geopolitical intent increasingly underpins malicious activity. To address this mounting threat, TRM Labs called for a comprehensive overhaul of crypto security practices. This includes implementing multifactor authentication, using cold storage for funds, conducting regular audits, and enhancing detection of insider threats and social engineering attempts. More broadly, the firm pointed out that there is a need for international cooperation between law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, and blockchain analytics firms. According to TRM Labs, the first half of 2025 should serve as a wake-up call for the industry. Resupply Hit by $9.6M DeFi Exploit Unfortunately, crypto crime is showing no signs of stopping. Resupply, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, recently confirmed a security breach in its wstUSR market that led to $9.6 million in losses. The exploit was the result of a price manipulation attack involving a synthetic stablecoin called cvcrvUSD. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers , the attacker inflated the share price in the ResupplyPair contract to borrow $10 million in reUSD using minimal collateral. The funds, initially sourced through Tornado Cash, were converted to Ethereum and distributed across two addresses. In response, Resupply paused the affected contracts and stated that only the wstUSR market was compromised. The protocol plans to release a full post-mortem after completing its investigation. Cyvers’ CTO Meir Dolev believes that the attack could have been avoided with better input validation, oracle checks, and real-time anomaly monitoring. This incident is part of the list of DeFi exploits in 2025. Hackers have increasingly shifted to social engineering, which was the case in a $2 million Bedrock UniBTC exploit in 2024 linked to a former Fuzzland employee who used insider access and supply chain attacks to carry out the breach. UK Hacker Busted for Selling Stolen Data Meanwhile, British national Kai West was recently indicted by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for allegedly operating under the alias “IntelBroker” and selling stolen data on cybercrime forums, leading to over $25 million in damages. West is accused of conspiring with a cybercriminal group known as CyberN***ers to hack into and steal data from more than 40 companies, including a telecom provider, a municipal healthcare system, and an internet service provider. (Source: US Attorney’s Office ) The charges stem in part from an undercover law enforcement operation where an agent purchased stolen credentials from IntelBroker for $250 in Bitcoin. The data included administrative-level usernames and passwords. West allegedly offered data stolen in these breaches for sale for over $2 million and was active on the notorious BreachForums platform between January of 2023 and February of 2025. He was reportedly responsible for at least 158 threads advertising stolen data, 41 of which involved companies based in the United States. Sixteen of those posts contained explicit price listings, amounting to at least $2.4 million. West also accepted payments in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero. According to authorities, his activity on BreachForums escalated to the point where he was identified as the platform’s owner starting in August 2024. He was arrested in France earlier this year, and US authorities are now seeking his extradition. Law enforcement officials, including former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia, placed a lot of emphasis on the severity of the crimes. Raia described West as a “serial hacker” who profited millions from illicit activities. The case now adds to a growing list of high-profile cybersecurity incidents, including a recent breach affecting Coinbase . That incident involved the unauthorized access of customer data by overseas support agents, which led to a $20 million extortion attempt.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9728/private-key-and-front-end-exploits-lead-crypto-thefts-in-2025,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T08:54:32,"Massive $17 Billion BTC and ETH Options Expire Today in 2025 Largest Event – Rally or Crash?","The cryptocurrency market is facing its largest options expiration event of 2025 today, as over $17.27 billion in BTC and ETH contracts expire on Deribit. This massive H1 quarterly delivery represents 30% of the total current positions. H1 Expiry Incoming Over $17B in BTC & ETH options are set to expire tomorrow on Deribit, the largest of the year so far. $BTC : $15B notional | Put/Call: 0.74 | Max Pain: $102K $ETH : $2.3B notional | Put/Call: 0.52 |Max Pain: $2,200 Will Q3 start with a breakout or reset?… pic.twitter.com/ye92lhXP4Z — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 26, 2025 Bitcoin leads with $15 billion in expiring options across 139,000 contracts, while Ethereum accounts for $2.3 billion through 939,000 contracts. However, the put-call ratios reveal bullish sentiment across both assets. Bitcoin shows a 0.74 ratio with maximum pain at $102,000, while Ethereum displays a 0.52 ratio with maximum pain at $2,200. Both cryptocurrencies currently trade well above their respective pain points, with BTC at $107,555 and ETH at $2,452. Source: Cryptonews This expiration significantly exceeds the previous 2025 events. Bitcoin contracts jumped from 33,972 last week to 139,390 today, while Ethereum surged from 224,509 to 938,551 contracts. The scale exceeded April’s $8.05 billion, which was previously the year’s largest event. Massive BTC and ETH Expiring Options Drive Market Positioning Strategy The sheer volume of expiring contracts accounts for over 30% of total open interest, a concentration rarely seen in crypto derivatives markets and one that historically precedes significant price movements. Bitcoin’s dominance in the expiration is particularly striking, with 139,000 contracts carrying $15 billion notional value compared to last week’s modest 33,972 contracts. This four-fold increase is due to the monthly nature of June 27 expiries, which aggregate positions built throughout the quarter rather than weekly accumulations. The maximum pain theory suggests both assets face gravitational pull toward their respective strike prices. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin’s $102,000 max pain sits significantly below current $107,555 levels, while Ethereum’s $2,200 target lies below $2,452 trading prices. This divergence typically creates downward pressure as market makers hedge their exposures. Put-call ratios reveal contrasting sentiment structures despite overall bullish positioning. Source: IntoTheBlock Bitcoin’s 0.59 ratio indicates moderate call dominance, while Ethereum’s 0.46 ratio shows stronger bullish conviction. However, implied volatility patterns diverge sharply, with BTC hovering below 35% while ETH maintains elevated levels of 65%. Notably, block trading activity has also intensified dramatically in the 48 hours preceding expiration. Source: CoinGlass Deribit recorded $1.4 billion in large-scale call transactions, with institutional players actively repositioning ahead of the deadline. This volume surge indicates that investors are preparing for potential volatility rather than simply riding out the expiration. The timing coincides with Bitcoin’s fourth attempt to establish $108,000 as support after recovering from levels below $100,000. Technical analyst Rekt Capital recently identified this as a crucial transitional period, noting that weekly closes above $104,400 will determine whether Bitcoin enters its next price discovery uptrend or faces an extended period of consolidation. Institutional Flows Show Mixed Long-Term Outlook Institutional activity surrounding today’s expiration reveals conflicting signals as traditional finance entities embrace crypto treasury strategies while short-term positioning suggests caution ahead of potential volatility. Bitcoin’s institutional narrative strengthens despite near-term uncertainties. Most recently, billionaire Philippe Laffont included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40” list of top investments for the next five years, projecting that the market capitalization could exceed $5 trillion by 2030. He admitted to previously overlooking Bitcoin as a store of value. Billionaire @plaffont has included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40,” his list of top investment opportunities for the next five years. #Bitcoin #Crypto https://t.co/9rwMC189FE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 Similarly, Bakkt, a cryptocurrency exchange, has filed for a $1 billion shelf registration with the SEC , earmarking the proceeds for Bitcoin acquisitions under its updated treasury strategy. However, despite these institutional activities, immediate market dynamics present challenges. Recent CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin miner revenues fell to $34 million daily , the lowest since April 20, driven by reduced transaction fees and price pressure. Despite this stress, miners increased reserves from 61,000 to 65,000 BTC between March and June, indicating long-term confidence. Ethereum faces more complex institutional positioning, with SharpLink Gaming being the recent accumulator of 12,207 ETH , valued at $30.6 million. @SharpLinkGaming becomes world's largest public $ETH holder with $30.6 million purchase, bringing total holdings to 188,478 $ETH worth $457 million. #SharpLink #ETH #Treasury https://t.co/wxbXBFSe5T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The company now holds 188,478 ETH worth approximately $457 million, representing the largest publicly traded Ethereum position. Spot ETF flows provide additional context for retail sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs recently recorded eleven consecutive inflows of $588 million , while Ethereum ETFs recorded weekly inflows of $205 million at the same time. This retail interest contrasts with institutional selling, creating complex cross-currents in Ethereum markets. The technical outlook remains pivotal for both assets. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe identifies $2,400 as Ethereum’s crucial range low, suggesting upside potential if support holds. So far, so good for $ETH . Holding above this crucial range low and we're likely going to be testing the other side of the range in the upcoming weeks. pic.twitter.com/wgkDmyiPlN — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 26, 2025 Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its weekly support at $104,400 will determine whether the asset transitions into its next major uptrend or faces extended consolidation through the historically weak Q3 period.
