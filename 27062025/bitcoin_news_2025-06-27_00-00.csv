2025-06-26T21:30:14,"A Tale Of 3 Mayors And Bitcoin’s Climb From $754 To $107,000","According to Bitwise’s Jeff Park, Bitcoin has gone from a risky experiment to a six-figure asset over three New York mayoral terms. Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities It started near $754 when Michael Bloomberg left office in December 2013. Now, as the city prepares for its next election, it’s trading above $107,000. These numbers show a rise of about 14,590% in just over a decade. Mayoral Timeline Marks Bitcoin Growth Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014. At first, Bitcoin barely budged. But by December 2021, it hit roughly $47,000. That climb happened while de Blasio’s two terms played out on City Hall’s stage. The crypto market had its ups and downs, yet the overall trend pointed skyward under his watch. Worth noting that in the time it took New York to go from Bloomberg to Mamdani, Bitcoin soared from $754 to $106,000+ today. You may not see nor believe it right away, but this is actually not a coincidence. Separate money from state. — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Surge Through Political Change When Eric Adams stepped in as mayor in January 2022, he made headlines by taking his first paychecks in Bitcoin. The move sent a clear message that New York was open to crypto. The market then endured a tough 2022 bear phase. Still, Bitcoin bounced back strong in 2023 and kept going. This month, it’s up about 3% and sits at $107,567, according to figures by Coingecko. Separate Money From State Park used the mayor count as a storytelling tool. He’s calling for a break between money and government. His view: people should choose how they handle their own cash. Political shifts come and go, but Bitcoin keeps growing on its own terms. That steady rise speaks to the idea of financial freedom outside state control. New Leadership And Future Trends Zohran Mamdani has surged ahead in the Democratic primary after Adams declared an Independent bid. Since Democrats usually win in New York, many see Mamdani as the likely next mayor. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Park even joked that Bitcoin’s journey has moved “from Bloomberg to Mamdani.” That line underlines how the asset climbed, even as the city’s politics reshuffled itself. It’s easy to draw lines between mayoral posters and price charts. But Bitcoin’s real drivers go beyond City Hall. Global demand, big investors, shifts in mining, and moves by the Federal Reserve have all shaped its path. New York’s mayors provide handy markers on the timeline, not the engine of growth. On Crypto & Politics As New York eyes November 2025, Bitcoin stands as proof that financial tools can live beyond politics. The question now isn’t whether the next mayor will back crypto. It’s how far Bitcoin will go when its story isn’t tied to any single office.

2025-06-26T21:20:24,"Sharplink sees unrealized losses of $36 million on its ETH holdings","Gaming company Sharplink is at a $36 million loss despite increasing its ETH stash. This follows the recent decline in ETH value, with the token falling more than 6% in the last 30 days amidst market uncertainties. On-chain analyst Ember CN shared the development on X, noting that the company bought another 5,989 ETH worth $14.47 million on June 26. With its latest acquisition, Sharpink has 194,000 ETH, worth around $507 million. The company purchased its ETH at an average price of $2,611, slightly below the current price of $2,474. However, the sizable accumulation of ETH by the company is impressive given that it has been less than a month since it transitioned to an Ethereum treasury company after closing a $425 million funding round led by Consensys. However, the Sharplink is far from done with its accumulation, given that a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month shows that it has plans for another $1 billion raise, with all the funds expected to go towards accumulating ETH. Since its first purchase using funds raised from the funding round, Sharplink has been using proceeds from the sales of its shares through its at-market offering to buy more ETH. The company has also been staking all its ETH holdings to earn more Ether. Corporations showing interest in altcoin treasuries Meanwhile, the continued accumulation by Sharplink is likely part of its goal to become the biggest corporate holder of ETH in its reserves. Given its current stash, it appears to have already achieved that, especially since only a few companies have an Ethereum treasury. While it might be the one with the biggest ETH treasury, Sharplink was not the first public company to consider ETH as a treasury asset, with BioNexus Gene actually releasing an Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper back in March. Another public company with a known ETH treasury is Bit Digital. The Bitcoin miner recently transitioned to focusing solely on ETH staking and treasury, stating that it holds over 24,000 ETH and 417.6 BTC as of March 31, 2025. However, it plans to convert its Bitcoin holdings to ETH while also planning to sell its Bitcoin mining infrastructure and divert the proceeds to ETH. Unsurprisingly, the move caused its stock to fall. Nevertheless, it highlights how several companies are now hopping on the altcoin treasury trends instead of choosing BTC. For instance, companies such as Upexi, Sol Strategies, DeFi Development Corp, and MemeStrategy have all opted for a corporate Solana treasury to acquire and stake SOL. Other firms have also picked altcoins, such as HYPE, XRP, and BNB, as treasury assets. A Chinese chip maker, Nano Labs, recently released a plan to buy $1 billion BNB, while companies like ViVoPower and Webus plan to buy XRP and Lion Group Holdings is targeting a HYPE treasury. Despite this diversification among public companies, Bitcoin treasuries remain the biggest trend, with more companies establishing corporate Bitcoin strategies. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s firm, ProCap BTC, recently announced a plan to go public as a Bitcoin treasury company through a special purpose acquisition deal. The company has been busy buying BTC in anticipation of the move. However, concerns about establishing crypto treasuries continue to grow, especially as the adoption keeps increasing. Some experts believe this poses a major risk, especially as many firms now leverage debt to acquire crypto assets. Sharplink stock continues to perform well Meanwhile, the unrealised loss on Sharplink’s ETH treasury has no major impact on its stock performance. According to Yahoo Finance data, Sharelink SBET closed on June 25 with a 6.42% gain and has already seen an extra 4.57% increase in pre-market. It is now trading at $10.28, with a 52.98% gain over the past month. It is also up 33.85% year to date, showing that the optimism around ETH recovery is spreading to SBET. With market observers bullish on Ether rebound, some believe Sharplink is getting in early.

2025-06-26T21:01:21,"Core Scientific’s stock jumped 35% after reports that CoreWeave is in talks to buy the company","Core Scientific’s stock price shot up 35% on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave is in talks to buy the crypto miner. The news caused a temporary halt in trading, but the rally picked up again once the pause ended. This was Core Scientific’s second-biggest trading day since its return to the Nasdaq in January 2024, after it came out of bankruptcy. The sharpest jump the company ever saw was last June, when it climbed 40% in a single session after announcing a major AI expansion deal with CoreWeave. The new acquisition talks are tied to that same relationship, which has turned into a billion-dollar partnership over time. The companies signed a series of 12-year contracts last summer worth $10.2 billion, with Core Scientific committed to delivering 590 megawatts of AI-ready infrastructure by early 2026. CoreWeave’s 2024 bid rejected, deal now being revisited The Journal report said the buyout deal could be finalized in the next few weeks, unless something derails it. If agreed, the acquisition would deepen CoreWeave’s involvement with Core Scientific beyond just contracts. It also highlights how the AI boom has changed the game for miners. Core Scientific was once just a bitcoin miner struggling to stay afloat. Now it’s sitting on close to $5 billion in market value, five times higher than when CoreWeave first tried to buy it. In 2024, CoreWeave made a $5.75 per share offer for Core Scientific . At the time, that offer put the company’s value at just over $1 billion. But Core Scientific turned it down, saying the bid undervalued the business and that it preferred to focus on its existing deals. With its stock now trading well above that old offer, the tables have turned. The partnership between the two has grown stronger since that rejected proposal. They’ve been working together for years, but the 12-year contract signed in June 2023 formalized things. Core Scientific agreed to supply hundreds of megawatts of hosting power to support CoreWeave’s compute-heavy AI infrastructure. Bitcoin miners rush into AI as space and power run low Core Scientific’s shift into AI isn’t unique. Many crypto mining companies are now trying to retool their data centers to meet demand from AI firms. But analysts have warned that AI infrastructure often needs full-scale builds, not just old mining rigs converted into something else. It’s not always a simple flip. Still, companies like Core Scientific are trying to cash in while demand is high. With limited data-center space and rising competition for electricity, timing is everything. Being able to deliver infrastructure quickly has become more important than mining blocks. Even so, CoreWeave’s share price fell by about 1% on Thursday. That’s not a massive drop, but it’s a sign the market isn’t reacting the same way on both sides of this possible deal. Core Scientific, meanwhile, has made its turnaround story all about AI. Since leaving bankruptcy in early 2024, it’s shifted large portions of its operations to hosting high-performance workloads instead of mining bitcoin full-time. That move has put it ahead of many competitors who are still trying to adapt. The company is now one of several crypto miners competing for AI clients, looking to make use of every available megawatt of energy and every square foot of hosting space. With the AI race heating up and real estate for GPUs running thin, whoever controls the infrastructure gets the money. And Core Scientific, thanks to its 12-year agreement with CoreWeave , has already locked in its seat at the table.

2025-06-26T21:00:13,"Dogecoin’s Chances Of An Upward Trend Continuation Increases With This Bullish Move","With the growing bullish market sentiment, Dogecoin has flipped positive as the popular dog-themed meme coin slowly builds on its newfound upward momentum. Several technical signals are starting to unfold on the DOGE’s chart, hinting at a possible continuation of the renewed upside movements. Bullish Move Puts Dogecoin On Track For A Rally Following a period of heightened bearish performance, Dogecoin has ventured into a bullish state as it targets the next key resistance located at the $0.17 level. Given that the broader crypto market maintains its current optimistic condition, DOGE could retest this key level in the upcoming days. Delving into Dogecoin’s current price action, Trader Tardigrade, a seasoned technical expert and investor, has drawn attention to a signal that suggests that the meme coin is set for a bullish phase. Dogecoin is showing early indications of a possible recovery, and a recent positive move that reinforces the argument for an upcoming uptrend . In the 1-hour time frame chart, Trader Tardigrade revealed that DOGE has formed a hidden Bullish Divergence. This critical move is observed on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) chart, a key momentum indicator. With this key technical signal emerging, Trader Tardigrade believes that the development could indicate a greater chance of an impending upward trend continuation . A hidden bullish divergence is an indication of a continued uptrend despite a brief price decline. Specifically, this move occurs when a momentum indicator, such as the RSI or MACD, produces a lower low as seen on the DOGE’s chart. Since the divergence often precedes upward movements and price spikes, Trader Tardigrade’s forecast of a continued rally is likely to materialize in the short term. Past Trend Hints At A Massive Upsurge For DOGE Even though Dogecoin has fallen sharply from its yearly high of $0.48, the meme coin is still trending in an ascending trend line. Trader Tardigrade has highlighted a massive ascending support trend line in the 2-week time frame chart. The 2-weekly chart shows that this key rising trend line has been forming for nearly two years, particularly from September 2023 till the current date. Such a trend line reflects Dogecoin’s robust resilience over the years despite several notable pullbacks. Looking at the chart, this move to retest the ascending trend line appears to be a bullish one . In 2023, DOGE witnessed a rally after retesting this trend line. A similar result was also observed in September 2024, which ultimately led to the current yearly high of $0.48. Considering past scenarios as the meme coin retests the trend line once again this year, Trader Tardigrade is confident that a notable rally could be on the horizon. With each scenario resulting in a bigger upward move than the last, DOGE’s price is likely to experience a sharp spike beyond its yearly high and potentially revisit its present all-time high of $0.73.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoins-uptrend-chances-grows/,"AAVE|ADA|ALGO|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CFX|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Ascending Trendline|Bullish Divergence|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt|MACD|Moving Average Convergence Divegence|relative strength index|RSI|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare
2025-06-26T20:56:09,"Coinbase Makes Important Announcement Affecting the Future of Cryptocurrencies in the US: Date Set for July 21","Coinbase Futures announced that it will launch a new perpetual futures-like product in the U.S. on July 21. Dubbed “US Perpetual-Like Futures,” the contracts aim to provide a local, U.S.-regulated alternative to perpetual futures products commonly used on offshore exchanges. “We are excited to offer these products on Coinbase Futures, designed to mirror how global perpetual futures work, yet remain fully compliant with U.S. regulations. Internationally, perpetual futures represent 90% of cryptocurrency trading volume by some reports,” Coinbase said in a statement. The first phase of the offering includes perpetual-style futures contracts for nano Bitcoin (0.01 BTC) and nano Ether (0.10 ETH). These contracts will have a five-year maturity, will be tradable 24/7, and will include a funding rate mechanism to ensure they remain in line with spot market prices. Funding will be processed hourly and collected during designated cash adjustment periods twice a day. Related News: Ripple (XRP) Announces Critical Partnership Agreement with Another Major Platform: Could Have Significant Potential Coinbase says the move will address regulatory, custody and counterparty risk issues with perpetual trading, which many U.S. investors currently access through offshore platforms. The new products aim to eliminate those risks by offering the ability to trade in a regulated environment within the U.S. Coinbase also noted that these futures will provide “regulated access to the crypto market with flexible position sizes and high capital efficiency.” More information on access to the products is expected to be shared ahead of launch. “We are very proud to bring perpetual-style futures to the U.S. market.

2025-06-26T20:55:50,"CoreWeave takes a second shot at Core Scientific acquisition","Last year’s $1 billion offer was a non-starter. Now, with AI demand surging and Bitcoin mining margins tightening, CoreWeave has circled back and is reportedly in new talks to acquire Core Scientific. On June 26, the Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave, the AI cloud infrastructure provider backed by Nvidia and powering clients like OpenAI and Microsoft, has reopened negotiations to acquire Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. The move comes nearly a year after Core Scientific’s board dismissed CoreWeave’s initial $5.75-per-share offer ($1 billion total) as “significantly undervaluing” the company. This time, the terms remain undisclosed, but the market’s reaction was immediate: Core Scientific’s stock surged 28%, pushing its valuation close to $4 billion. People familiar with the matter say the latest negotiations follow a string of multi-year infrastructure deals between the two companies, including a major contract for 200 megawatts of power to support CoreWeave’s high-performance computing services. You might also like: U.S Senate eyes fall finish for crypto rules as House keeps cards close Can the second bid stick this time? CoreWeave’s renewed pursuit of Core Scientific appears to be about securing the infrastructure needed to win the AI race. The AI cloud provider, fresh off a $1.5 billion IPO and partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, is locked in a battle for computing power with rivals like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Unlike those giants, CoreWeave doesn’t own massive data center networks. That’s where Core Scientific comes in. Core Scientific controls something even more valuable than raw computing power: energy infrastructure. The Bitcoin miner’s facilities, mostly located near cheap, abundant power sources, are already wired for high-density computing, making them ideal for AI workloads. The existing 200-megawatt deal between the two companies, signed last year, was just the start. Owning Core Scientific outright would give CoreWeave direct control over power contracts, bypassing the scramble for data center capacity that’s bottlenecking AI expansion. What’s in for Core Scientific? For Core Scientific, the timing couldn’t be more strategic. The company emerged from bankruptcy in early 2024 with a leaner operation and a stronger balance sheet, but Bitcoin’s halving in April slashed mining rewards, squeezing margins across the industry. While some miners are selling off assets or pivoting to AI hosting piecemeal, Core Scientific’s management has held out for a bigger play. Their first-quarter profit of $580 million, largely driven by Bitcoin’s price rebound and efficient operations, proved they’re no longer a distressed asset. Now, they’re a strategic one. Whether the deal closes or collapses, the return of CoreWeave to the negotiating table underscores a broader realignment in digital infrastructure. The boundary between Bitcoin mining and AI compute is thinning, not because the technologies are converging, but because they share the same scarce foundation: power. In that light, Core Scientific’s real value may not be its mining rigs, but the grid connections beneath them.

2025-06-26T20:30:27,"Ethereum Fakes Out Bears – Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout","Ethereum is back in focus after reclaiming the critical $2,444 resistance, following a sharp recovery from its breakdown below the $2,200 mark. The move has revived bullish sentiment, with many analysts calling for Ethereum to lead the long-anticipated altseason. The swift rebound caught traders off guard, reinforcing the view that the recent drop was nothing more than a fakeout. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds Top analyst M-log1 commented on the reversal, stating that ETH is back in range. His analysis points to the idea that Ethereum’s price action has successfully shaken out weak hands while setting the stage for a bullish continuation. If momentum holds, ETH could attempt a move toward the higher range around $2,600–$2,800, a zone that has consistently acted as a battleground in previous cycles. Ethereum’s role as the leading altcoin makes its performance critical for broader market direction. A confirmed breakout here could trigger renewed confidence across the altcoin market and open the door for the long-awaited altseason. For now, bulls are in control—but Ethereum must hold current levels and push higher to keep the momentum alive and avoid another retracement into bearish territory. Ethereum Holds the Line: The Key to Unlocking Altseason? Ethereum surged following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, easing geopolitical tensions and triggering a sharp rebound across the crypto market. ETH, which had briefly broken down below the $2,200 mark, has since reclaimed key resistance near $2,444—indicating growing strength among bulls. While buyers initially lost control during the wave of uncertainty, they are now regaining momentum as the entire market braces for the next decisive move. Despite rising optimism, the macroeconomic backdrop remains fragile. Recession fears in the U.S. continue to build as leading indicators flash warning signs, and tightening global financial conditions may pressure risk assets in the coming months. Yet in the crypto space, focus is shifting toward Ethereum’s performance as the likely spark for the long-awaited altseason. M-log1 shared his view, saying, “ETH is back in range. Nice fake out after all.” His technical analysis suggests that Ethereum has reentered its consolidation zone, a move that could signal strength if followed by continued upward momentum. “If we want alts to do well,” he added, “we want ETH to move towards the higher range here and break out as soon as Uncle Bitcoin makes a new ATH.” With Bitcoin hovering just 4% below its all-time high, Ethereum is now in a critical position. A sustained breakout from current levels could trigger renewed risk appetite across the altcoin market, creating the perfect setup for a rotation. For now, Ethereum is holding the line—but it must maintain this bullish structure and break above resistance to lead the next phase of growth. All eyes remain locked on ETH as it charts the course for what comes next. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure – Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25–$30 Surge ETH Regains Strength Near Key Resistance Levels Ethereum is showing signs of renewed momentum, trading at $2,451 after bouncing back strongly from a brief breakdown below the $2,200 level. The chart shows ETH has reclaimed the short-term descending trendline and is now testing major moving averages, with the 50-day SMA at $2,254, the 100-day at $2,639, and the 200-day just overhead at $2,780. This confluence of resistance above makes the $2,500–$2,800 zone a key battleground. Volume appears to be picking up alongside the price, signaling increased interest as ETH reclaims structure. This rally was partly fueled by the broader market response to geopolitical easing in the Middle East, but the technical setup now holds independent bullish potential. The recent price action forms what could be a classic “fakeout” and re-entry into range — a pattern that often precedes strong breakouts. To confirm a trend reversal, Ethereum needs to push and hold above the $2,650–$2,800 resistance band. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month If bulls can sustain this pressure, a run toward the March highs near $3,200 becomes increasingly likely.

2025-06-26T20:21:07,"IRS warning letters to crypto investors are on the rise: what do they really mean?","Lately, the Internal Revenue Service has ramped up the frequency of warning letters sent to cryptocurrency investors. Reports indicate that most recipients receive one of three letter types: 6173, 6174, or CP2000. But what do these letters mean, and do they signal a broader crackdown on crypto? Regulation of cryptocurrency taxes is still something many people don’t pay attention to; however, ignoring this part of financial life may be dangerous. The most vivid example is the use of alleged tax evasion for the prosecution of Roger Ver, one of the first notable Bitcoin popularizers. Read more: Trump pardons BitMEX founders, is ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Roger Ver next? The surge in IRS letter frequency may be explained by the 1099-DA regulations scheduled to be adopted this year. It is the first cryptocurrency-specific tax form by the IRS. Some investors find the warning letters approach dismaying and feel it is harassment, as in these letters, the IRS informs receivers that the service is aware they performed cryptocurrency transactions, and these transactions must be reported to the IRS properly. Who else got a letter about crypto from the IRS today? 🙋‍♀️ I didn’t do anything wrong. But I’m going to keep getting pissed any time the gov questions me when they don’t hold themselves accountable for anything. — Wendy (@reallywendy) June 17, 2025 What makes some of these letters look creepy is that the IRS is throwing facts like “we know you owned crypto between 2018 and 2020” at the receiver and alleging that the letter receiver may not have reported crypto-related income properly. Let’s check what these letters mean practically. Types of the letters Mainly, crypto investors receive three types of letters from the IRS: 6173, 6174, and CP2000. Form 6174 is regarded as the least disturbing, as it has solely an informational purpose and doesn’t require action. It is a “soft notice” letter and, basically, it can be ignored. Got one too “Letter 6174-A” Told don’t respond you are self incriminating yourself. Still speak with a crypto tax professional since every situation is different. Love how they said this in the letter. pic.twitter.com/MNwU6xYTjZ — 🅽🅾🅳🅴🆉 (@BlueCollarNodes) May 3, 2025 Still, it signals that the IRS is aware of your involvement in crypto investment. If the IRS believes the taxpayer has done something wrong, it may send more urgent letters later. Letter 6174 may be seen as a good reason to check if previous reports were made correctly. 6174 doesn’t indicate that the IRS is aware of any wrongdoing. Taxpayers may receive this letter if they were using U.S.-based exchanges, such as Kraken, Coinbase, Binance US, and others. Another possible reason is that their crypto transactions were reported by someone using Form 1099-MISC or 1099-B. Finally, the receiver’s account could have been flagged by the IRS because of a third-party data match. The 6173 and CP2000 letters are more urgent and require action. Letter 6173 is the letter that wasn’t frequent until now. It states: “We have information that you have or had one or more accounts containing virtual currency and may not have met your U.S. tax filing and reporting requirements for transactions involving virtual currency, which include cryptocurrency and non-crypto virtual currencies.” This letter cannot be ignored as it unambiguously informs a taxpayer that they have allegedly underreported their crypto income, and the IRS can do an audit. The info about the taxpayers’ crypto transactions may be obtained by the IRS from the exchanges they use. Discrepancies between reported crypto transactions and exchange data may lead to a 6173 letter. On top of a complete lack of reports on crypto, the reason may be errors in reporting—such as not reporting staking or mining rewards, not applying capital gains tax on crypto conversions, and more. A tax attorney can help fix the problems before the deadline indicated in the letter. The CP2000 notice includes the specific amount that needed to be reported. The source of this letter is the Automated Underreporter Unit of the IRS, which generates due notices using computers. Given that these notices are generated automatically, there’s a chance they’re incorrect. In some cases, CP2000 claims the taxpayer owes more in taxes than they actually do. Some forms may inform the taxpayer of a refund. If the amount is correct, the taxpayer may fill in the form and pay. If not, it’s better to dispute it. Calling a tax attorney may be an option. Given how much info the IRS may gather, a proactive position of crypto investors and traders is a must. It’s better to work on tax reports diligently and be ready to respond to IRS letters in time. Usually, this means within a 30-day period. The IRS vs. Trump Administration 2.0 The IRS will have more information about cryptocurrency transactions than before. That will happen this year as soon as Form 1099-DA is adopted. The pressure is rising, even as the crypto-friendly Trump Administration 2.0 is planning the abolition of the IRS itself and replacing it with tariffs. In January 2025, Congressman Earl Carter proposed a bill replacing the IRS with a consumption tax—meaning that prices would rise substantially. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained that the plans to abolish the IRS are in line with the protectionist policies of Donald Trump. The replacement of the IRS with tariffs is summed up with the credo: “make the outsiders pay.” It’s unclear whether Trump will actually abolish the IRS anytime soon, but the increased scrutiny of crypto transactions may only fuel supporters’ desire to shut the service down.

The trader pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 321,100 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat ( WIF ), a memecoin built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem, could go up by about 472% to reclaim and surpass the all-time high recorded in March of 2024. “Still a lot of work to put in and need to see price action confirm, but I think there’s a very real chance a new impulse back to all-time high on WIF has commenced.” According to the analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, WIF started a bullish uptrend earlier this month in a five-wave pattern. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Based on Bluntz’s chart on the three-day time frame, WIF bottomed out earlier this year. Source: Bluntz/X Over the short term, the pseudonymous analyst says WIF could undergo a correction before rallying. Based on the widely followed analyst’s chart of the one-hour time frame, WIF could pull back by around 10% from the current level. “Very obvious five-wave rise from the lows on hourly for WIF, would expect a bit of a pullback here before the next major leg up.” Source: Bluntz/X WIF is trading at $0.845 at time of writing.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced the indictment of 25-year-old Kai West on Wednesday. West is accused of using his “IntelBroker” identity to infiltrate computer networks, steal sensitive data, and sell it on underground cybercrime forums. Hacker “West” Ran Global Data Theft Operation, Used Monero to Obscure $2.4M in Sales Authorities say West led a cybercriminal group known as “CyberN[——],” which infiltrated systems belonging to a telecommunications company, a municipal healthcare provider, an internet service firm, and dozens of other organizations. Prosecutors say West and his associates stole sensitive data and sold it online, often requesting payment in Monero, a cryptocurrency favored for its privacy features. Serial hacker “IntelBroker” charged in $25 million cyber scheme. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice,” said USA Jay Clayton. https://t.co/CrMzWtJ1fR pic.twitter.com/ob6gJDsALF — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) June 25, 2025 Over a two-year period, from 2023 to 2025, West allegedly posted and offered stolen data across at least 158 public threads. He listed data for sale in 41 of those posts, asking prices that totaled over $2.4 million. In many cases, he gave away stolen information in exchange for forum credits or to boost his reputation within the hacker community. One breach included patient data from a healthcare provider, exposing names, Social Security numbers, and health records. In another case, West reportedly accessed servers of a U.S. telecom firm and sold customer details. Prosecutors allege that West even served as the “owner” of BreachForums between August 2024 and January 2025, further solidifying IntelBroker’s profile in the cybercrime space. “This action reflects the FBI’s commitment to pursuing cybercriminals around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes, and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice.” FBI Assistant Director Christopher G. Raia described West as a “serial hacker” who profited off stolen data and caused harm to organizations across borders. “Today’s announcement should serve as a warning to anyone thinking they can hide behind a keyboard and commit cybercrime with impunity,” he added. According to the complaint, an undercover agent paid IntelBroker $250 in Bitcoin for stolen data, which included admin-level credentials. The payment was sent to an address linked to Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka IntelBroker), and the data was delivered. Fitzpatrick and his associates allegedly tried to sell more data for over $2 million. West was arrested in France in February 2025. The U.S. is seeking his extradition to face prosecution. He is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized access to protected computers, and wire fraud. If convicted on all counts, he faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison. The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan B. Finkel leading the prosecution. West remains in custody in France pending the outcome of the extradition request. The charges remain allegations, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Massive Credential Leak Raises New Alarms After IntelBroker Indictment Following the indictment of British national IntelBroker for allegedly trafficking stolen data worth over $25 million via BreachForums, a new report from Cybernews has added fuel to the fire, revealing one of the largest credential leaks ever recorded. According to researchers, over 16 billion login credentials linked to platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub have been exposed in a sweeping breach. But this wasn’t a single incident. Over 16 billion login records from Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub exposed in fresh malware-based data breaches. #cybersecurity #databreach https://t.co/YncLGPv9MU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The data, traced back to early 2024, comes from infostealer malware, credential stuffing attacks, and several previously undisclosed leaks. Some individual sets contained as many as 3.5 billion records, with the average around 550 million. For crypto users, the implications are serious. Wallets and exchanges often tie to compromised email providers or cloud services. A breach in one could mean direct access to digital assets. Cybernews urges users to change passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and scan devices for malware immediately. This follows a grim 2024, where the FBI recorded $9.3 billion in crypto fraud losses , up 66% from 2023. The Bureau also reported over 149,000 complaints, and had to intervene in suicide cases linked to crypto scams.

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap looks poised to hit a new ATH by the end of next month, also noting that he expects BTC to dip before skyrocketing. “Bitcoin continues to push upwards and break the all-time high. I still think we’ll have a slight consolidation before the big breakout happens, which means that an all-time high is on the cards for July ’25.” Van de Poppe says that in order for the crypto king to shatter its previous best, it needs to first hurdle a key resistance level at $108,900. “Bitcoin has taken the liquidity. That’s great, there’s a lot of upside momentum here. However, this is the FINAL hurdle before a new ATH. I think we’ll consolidate slightly and break towards new ATHs in the coming 1-2 weeks max.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X According to the analyst, BTC rallying would also send altcoins skyrocketing due to them being short-squeezed, or a rapid increase in price driven by short sellers covering their positions. “Altcoins are looking primed for a big move upwards. If Bitcoin is able to break up, Altcoins are likely to outperform. How? Massive short squeezes across the board accelerating the price action of those altcoins upwards vanishing losses away in days/weeks.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,633 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.

The top cryptocurrency is currently trading for $107,500, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours, while the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 coins by market capitalization, except for stablecoins, exchange coins and stablecoins — lost 0.9% in the same period of time. ""This Friday marks one of the largest option expiries of the year on Deribit,” Jean-David Péquignot, chief commercial officer at Deribit, told CoinDesk. BTC options open interest stands at $40 billion, Péquignot said, and 38% of these contracts will expire on Friday. “Max pain price for Friday is at $102,000, with a put/call ratio of 0.73,"" said Péquignot. Bitcoin’s implied volatility, measured by Deribit DVOL, dropped to 38% from 50% in what was a wild April, signaling perhaps that the market is increasingly confident in the cryptocurrency’s macro-hedge role, according to Péquignot. Meanwhile, put-call skews show no clear directional positioning for traders in the short-term. “Bitcoin’s $105,000 level is pivotal, with technicals suggesting caution if support fails,” Péquignot said. “Low open interest in perps and fairly depressed Bitcoin implied volatility and skew are indicative of limited expectations for sharp price movements going into Friday’s expiry.” A number of crypto stocks are managing gains on Thursday, with Core Scientific (CORZ) surging more than 33% off of a Wall Street Journal report that the bitcoin miner may soon be acquired by AI Hyperscaler CoreWeave (CRWV).

2025-06-26T19:38:20,"Ethereum Price Prediction – ETH Forms Rare ‘Death Cross’ Pattern Last Seen in 2022 – What’s Going On?","The Ethereum price has risen slightly to $2,447 today , making this move as the crypto market as a whole loses 3% in the past 24 hours. Ongoing instability in the Middle East has put the market on a shaky foundation this week, while today’s news regarding Judge Torres’ rejection of a final settlement between the SEC and Ripple has also weighed on prices. ETH therefore remains down by 2% in a week and by 8% in a month, with its two-week chart forming a very bearish death cross that could indicate further losses. However, such crosses precede a clearing out of weaker hands, and with Ethereum’s fundamentals remaining as strong as ever, the long-term ETH price prediction remains bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction – ETH Forms Rare ‘Death Cross’ Pattern Last Seen in 2022 – What’s Going On? Looking at ETH’s two-week chart, we can see that its 20-period average (orange) has just dropped below the 50-period (blue), following the coin’s declines since the start of the year. And if you scan back in time, you can see that the last time these two averages formed a death cross was in September 2022, when the Ethereum price went from around $1,750 to $1,150 by December. Source: TradingView This is a 34% decline, implying that we may be about to see a similarly steep drop in the coming weeks and months. There are other parallels with the second half of 2022, such as the fact that Ethereum’s moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has recently turned negative. And after turning negative in the middle of 2022, it remained below the baseline for more or less a year, as ETH struggled to regain the highs it had enjoyed in late 2021. Of course, past patterns are no guarantee of the future, and it’s possible to argue that circumstances are different this time, what with a pro-crypto White House. But we can also argue that, with the situation tense in the Middle East , the crypto market could encounter shocks that drag down the Ethereum price. ISRAEL & IRAN WAR WILL CONTINUE They will break caesefire, $BTC will dump I spent night reading ALL data and reports Here's 8 things you MUST know and where #crypto goes now (it will save u millions) pic.twitter.com/AAqLckmphe — ᴛʀᴀᴄᴇʀ (@DeFiTracer) June 24, 2025 On a more positive note, we could also suggest that a death cross on ETH’s two-week chart was the beginning of a consolidating period which eventually resulted in new growth. And because Ethereum remains the biggest layer-one network in terms of TVL , it’s a prime position to grow again once conditions are more favorable. Based on this, we can expect that, after dipping in the coming weeks, the Ethereum price will return to $3,000 by Q4, and to $3,500 by the end of the year. Solaxy Continues to Rally After Big Launch and $58 Million Presale: Best New Coin? For those traders worried that history may repeat itself for Ethereum, there are newer tokens that are showing more positive momentum in the near term. A strong example of this is Solaxy (SOLX), a new layer-two platform that has recently listed after raising a massive $58 million in its presale. Solaxy is now LIVE on CoinGecko https://t.co/2PJM0PlkXt pic.twitter.com/5tCJc9WWNY — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 23, 2025 Its native token SOLX has now listed on Uniswap and Raydium, and it’s up by 5% in the past 24 hours, as of writing. In fact, it had a massive opening earlier this week, reaching its current record high of $0.001284 on Tuesday, which made for a 108% gain over its lowest price on the day (Monday) it listed. Investors have been flocking to Solaxy because of its interesting fundamentals, with the project launching Solana’s first proper layer-two network. As such, it offers ultra-low transaction fees and very fast confirmation times, helping users to avoid the congestion that can still impact Solana. It enables instant bridging between itself and Solana, while in the future its team plans to expand its compatibility to other chains. The next few weeks will see the arrival of its own token launchpad, Igniter, through which anyone will be able to issue their own coins. Its own DEX is also on the way, helping to make Solaxy one of the most exciting new platforms in crypto. Holders of its native token, SOLX, will be able to stake the coin for passive income, something which should boost demand for the token over time. And with more exchange listings rumored, now could be a very time to buy the token, while it remains relatively cheap.

Krak is built to be simple, fast, and low-cost. It was released ahead of Kraken’s planned initial public offering (IPO) on the stock market in 2026. The app supports more than 300 cryptocurrencies. Krak Follows A Consumer-Focused Approach Ripple is recognized for facilitating the transfer of money across international borders for banks and large companies. Krak, on the other hand, is built for everyday people and small businesses. Users can transfer money to other Krak app users or directly to their bank accounts, with no transaction fee. This is designed to help people save money when sending funds, making digital payments easy and affordable for everyone. Meanwhile, the Krak app is part of Kraken’s bigger goal to expand its business. In the past months, the exchange introduced zero-fee trading on U.S. stocks and also bought a futures trading platform for $1.5 billion . With Krak, Kraken is now entering the fintech world, competing with popular apps like Venmo, Revolut, Cash App, and Coinbase Payments. Kraken To Expand Krak Use Beyond Digital Payments Kraken has plans to add more features to the app. Soon, Krak users will have access to both physical and virtual debit cards. These cards will let them spend their money directly from the app, just like a regular bank account. Later, Kraken will also offer loans and credit services through the app, demonstrating its plans to become a comprehensive financial service provider. By leveraging the existing strong systems, the company hopes Krak will attract both new and experienced users. Additionally, Krak will offer rewards to users, allowing them to earn up to 10% returns on selected assets. Most recently, Kraken partnered with Babylon, an innovative staking protocol, to let users earn rewards on their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings . This is part of the company’s plan to give more value back to users. Industry Experts See Big Potential in Krak Many experts believe the Krak app is an important move for Kraken. Analysts from Oppenheimer say that Krak could become a bridge between cryptocurrency and traditional financial tools. Financial firms, such as Citi and PwC, also support this view, stating that the timing is right. This comes as new global rules are making it easier for digital money apps to grow safely. However, these experts believe that a good user experience will be key to Krak’s success. At the same time, Ripple is also growing. Its new RLUSD stablecoin was added to Alchemy Pay, making it easier for people to move between traditional money and crypto. Nevertheless, Krak focuses more on helping everyday users make fast and free payments.

What does it mean?","On June 24, 2025, a blogger using the Pledditor handle published an X post that kicks off like this: Bitcoin did go to $1,000,000 this cycle, it’s just the value wasn’t captured by “you”. It was captured by “them”. Then, Pledditor explains how 10x mNAV may help Bitcoin pioneers holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin to trade BTC at $1,000,000. How realistic is this scheme? A sleuth using the Pledditor moniker on Twitter made headlines in 2023 when they shared deleted tweets of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The person behind this account is an avid critic of Bitcoin treasury companies, which they refer to as “grift.” It’s worth saying that Pledditor is far from being a Bitcoin skeptic; rather, they advocate for self-custody and a DIY approach in general. Table of Contents What is the scheme described by Pledditor? Likening treasuries to SPACs Which treasuries can boast 10x mNAV? What is the scheme described by Pledditor? In a recent Twitter thread, Pledditor dissects how the “Bitcoin OGs” (i.e., David Bailey, Adam Back, Ten31, Swan, and others) can trade Bitcoin at one million during the current cycle. Bitcoin did go to $1,000,000 this cycle, it's just the value wasn't captured by ""you"". It was captured by ""them"". If you are a bitcoin OG with a bunch of coins, what you do is securitize your BTC stack by SPAC'ing it on the public markets. You then create a ""irresponsibly long… — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 24, 2025 In the post, Pledditor describes the way the early Bitcoin holders with huge bags can securitize their holdings. According to them, they may launch a Strategy-like treasury company and hype up people on Twitter, urging them to buy their stocks. They may do it themselves or via a third-party frontman (“influencer”). As soon as the market net asset value reaches ten, the company founder may exit the common stock while keeping preferred shares for themselves. Given that the mNAV is 10 and the BTC price is $100,000, the company founder technically sells their bitcoins at $1,000,000 while not fully departing with their bitcoins thanks to keeping preferred shares. In the following tweets, Pledditor adds that the base Bitcoin for such ventures is coming from “Bitcoin OGs,” not even from the OTC desk. So, the impact on the market BTC price is zero. Pledditor concludes , “They tell you buying common gives you __ amount of BTC per share, when in reality *they* own all the preferreds, *they* own the BTC.” Earlier, Pleddior replied “Correct” to a tweet saying that Strategy is an exit scam for executives and Bitcoin OGs. Likening treasuries to SPACs On top of that, in the post, Pledditor compares the treasury companies to Special-purpose acquisition companies (SPACs). Lately, this comparison has been occurring across the crypto Twitter repeatedly; Pledditor is not the only one to bring it up. Bitcoin and other crypto treasury companies are the new SPACs. The only people that got rich off the SPAC model 4 years later were those who created it. It’s financial engineering. It never ends well for retail. Most SPACs are down 90% or more. Only a few are above initial price. — Beanie (@beaniemaxi) June 12, 2025 SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are shell companies created to raise capital via IPOs to merge with a public company or to acquire it. SPACs have no operations. SPACs may be seen as an attractive way to release shares without having to go through the normal disclosures required for companies going public. Two waves of SPAC popularity (in the late 2000s and the early 2020s) ended up rough for retail investors. Most of the time, they saw negative return rates for years. One of the latest popular SPACs was the 2024 Trump Media company merging with Digital World Acquisition Corp. Currently, the DJT stock is traded well below the merging period price. No wonder the comparison between SPACs and treasuries is unfavorable and hints at the lack of real, practical purpose behind companies like Strategy, Metaplanet, and their copycats. Both SPACs and treasuries don’t produce anything and have only a speculative value. While Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy raises concerns as it may seem too risky, Goldman Sachs analysts claimed Bitcoin has to dip 50% to put the company at real risk. According to Fakhul Miah from Go Mining Institutional, newer Bitcoin treasuries don’t have proper safeguards . If the BTC price goes below $90,000, it may trigger liquidations and a ripple effect that will affect bigger treasuries too. More than that, as regulation will allow companies to hold BTC self-custody, Bitcoin ETFs and stocks of Bitcoin treasuries may lose their attraction for corporations.

Micheal ""SELL YOUR CHAIRS"" Saylor must be tripping, telling everyone to buy Bitcoin for years then watching everyone pile into every imaginable explicitly non-bitcoin financial product he offers. Truly amazing, absolute genius on his part. — P (@pmilanovich_bfs) June 24, 2025 Which treasuries can boast 10x mNAV? While most treasuries’ mNAV rate doesn’t exceed a 3.0 mark, several companies already reached the threshold brought up by Pledditor in the post. On June 6, 2025, NYDIG shared the mNAV rates based on the SEC filings. It indicates that GameStop and Nakamoto have mNAV rates above the 10 mark, while Metaplanet and Strive are near this value, with 7.6 and 9.1 rates, respectively. It’s worth saying that GameStop is leading the charge mostly because it had a substantial market cap before allocating Bitcoin, and the BTC share of GameStop’s reserve is relatively small. Was the Pledditor’s post aimed directly at David Bailey, whose company Nakamoto has an mNAV rate above 10? Probably so. The amount of criticism towards Bitcoin treasuries grows accordingly with the number of companies following the footsteps of Strategy. Time will show who’s right.

2025-06-26T19:21:02,"Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price May Retest $92k First Before Reaching $120k in the Midterm","The post Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price May Retest $92k First Before Reaching $120k in the Midterm appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin (BTC) price has experienced heightened resistance around $108k in the past few days amid the de-escalation of the Middle East crisis. The flagship coin dropped slightly to trade at about $107,472 on Thursday, June 26, during the mid-North American session. After recording an impressive comeback, following the 90-day pause on most reciprocal tariffs in April, BTC price has been forming a potential reversal pattern. The bearish sentiment for BTC price has been forming amid the growing demand from institutional investors, led by Strategy, and Metaplanet. Major Factors Weighing Down on Midterm Bullish Sentiment for Bitcoin Price Technical Headwinds The BTC price, in the daily timeframe, has been forming a falling trend following a bearish breakout from a rising wedge formed in late May 2025. The midterm bearish sentiment for BTC price is bolstered by the falling daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) with the MACD line having crossed below the zero line. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC price is well-positioned to retest the support level above $92k again in the coming weeks. The ultimate support level for BTC price was established above $76k earlier this year. High Cumulative Short Liquidation Leverage Bitcoin price faces intensified bearish sentiment fueled by cumulative short liquidation leverage of about $12 billion around $112k. Ideally, it is safe to say that more institutional investors are seeking to suppress BTC price through the futures and leveraged markets to acquire as many coins as possible before the highly anticipated parabolic rally.Furthermore, on-chain data shows that institutional investors have been aggressively accumulating more BTC through leveraging equity markets. According to market data from BitcoinTreasuries , 251 entities hold more than 3.47 million BTCs in their respective treasuries.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-bitcoin-price-may-retest-92k-first-before-reaching-120k-in-the-midterm/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-26T19:00:55,"Trader Pin Points Why XRP Is Being Suppressed So Hard","XRP is once again at the center of controversy in the crypto community, as traders weigh in on the token’s potential and the forces that may be working to hold it back. The conversation reignited after Blockchain Backer posted: “If it isn’t clear yet, XRP is a threat to Bitcoin.” That statement quickly drew a strong reaction from popular XRP advocate Cobb, who responded, “THIS IS WHY THEY TRY TO SUPPRESS XRP SO HARD.” Cobb’s comment reflects a belief shared by many in the XRP community: that XRP’s unique design and growing real-world use cases have positioned it as a direct challenge to Bitcoin’s dominance. And for that reason, it faces persistent suppression from both market influencers and regulatory powers. THIS IS WHY THEY TRY TO SUPPRESS XRP SO HARD https://t.co/xLQkJra2a0 — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) June 26, 2025 XRP vs. Bitcoin: A Fundamental Divide At the heart of this debate is the contrast between Bitcoin and XRP in both function and philosophy. Bitcoin was created as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value. Its slow transaction speeds and high energy consumption are often defended as trade-offs for its security and decentralization. XRP, by contrast, was built for speed, efficiency, and utility, especially in cross-border payments. With transaction finality in seconds, negligible fees, and the ability to handle over 1,000 transactions per second, XRP offers a practical solution for real-time settlement that Bitcoin simply cannot match. This performance gap has led many analysts to argue that XRP threatens Bitcoin’s position, not just in market cap, but in relevance. If institutions and governments begin to prioritize utility over store-of-value narratives, XRP could emerge as the preferred blockchain solution for global finance. The Suppression Theory Cobb’s claim that XRP is being “suppressed” taps into a longstanding theory within the community: that XRP’s growth has been deliberately stalled to protect entrenched interests in Bitcoin and legacy financial systems. This theory gained momentum during Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which began in December 2020. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The timing of the SEC’s lawsuit—just as XRP was gaining traction with institutional partners—raised eyebrows. For nearly three years, XRP was delisted from major U.S. exchanges and excluded from key bull market rallies, while Bitcoin and Ethereum soared. Though the legal cloud is partially lifted, many believe the damage was already done. Cobb and others suggest that XRP’s sidelining wasn’t accidental. With its deep ties to banks, central banks, and payment providers, XRP threatens not only Bitcoin’s dominance but also the interests of those who benefit from the current system. A Real Threat to the Old Guard? The question now is whether XRP can reclaim its momentum. As Ripple expands into CBDCs, tokenized assets, and institutional finance, XRP’s utility continues to grow. And with renewed attention on Bitcoin’s limitations, XRP is once again being viewed as a legitimate alternative. Cobb’s pointed reaction, “This is why they try to suppress XRP so hard”, sums up the sentiment of a growing number of traders who believe that XRP’s biggest obstacle isn’t technology or demand, but the fear it inspires in those who stand to lose the most.

2025-06-26T19:00:20,"Ethereum Not Out Of The Woods Yet: Why Another 30% Crash To $1,800 Is Coming","Crypto analyst Crypto Wave has indicated that Ethereum could witness another significant price crash, presenting a bearish outlook for the altcoin. This price crash is expected to mark Wave C of a corrective move, with ETH dropping to as low as $1,800. Why Ethereum Could Still Drop To As Low As $1,800 In an X post, Crypto Wave declared that the primary expectation remains that Ethereum will see one more leg down in wave c of wave 2, targeting the zone between $1,950 and $1,700. Specifically, his accompanying chart showed that the largest altcoin by market cap could drop to around $1,800. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Crash To $2,100 Triggers Fear, But Why Are Analysts Predicting A Rally To $6,000? The crypto analyst revealed that Ethereum has already hit the 0.5 fib retracement at $2,100, which is the minimum target for a Wave 2 correction. However, structurally, he claimed that this drop still looks like wave A only. Crypto Wave further explained that these ABC corrections are always three-part moves, and that is what he sees forming now for ETH. The broader crypto market, led by Bitcoin, has bounced back following the ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Ethereum has also rebounded, having dropped to as low as $2,100 last week. However, Crypto Wave suggested that the current market sentiment doesn’t invalidate this bearish setup for ETH and that it could still witness a deeper sell-off. The crypto analyst alluded to the fourth quarter of last year when Ethereum was underperforming heavily while many altcoins rallied. In line with this, he remarked that there could be a repeat of this scenario. However, on the other hand, Crypto Wave claimed that if ETH breaks above $2,880 impulsively, especially in one clean wave, then the correction could be over. He added that this would also put the altcoin in the early stages of a new bull cycle. 2021 Pattern Playing Out For ETH In an X post, crypto analyst Merlijn drew similarities between the current Ethereum price action and that of 2021. He stated that the 2021 playbook is repeating, with ETH having a dead count bounce, then a final retest before the parabolic leg. The analyst expects the altcoin to retest the $2,000 level before the massive move to the upside. Related Reading: Market Expert Who Predicted Ethereum Price Crash At $2,800 Reveals What’s Coming Next His accompanying chart showed that Ethereum could rally to as high as $11,000 on this uptrend. Merlijn had remarked that ETH has more firepower this time around than in 2021, which is why the altcoin could witness such a parabolic move to the upside. Interestingly, based on the chart, this rally is expected to happen between now and year-end. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $2,480, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Lingerie Fighting Championships (BOTY), a Las Vegas-based women’s MMA league, announced plans to acquire $230,000 worth of bitcoin within 30 days and up to $2 million over the next six months. The decision to add BTC to its treasury coincides with LFC’s first shows in the UK. LFC43: Sindependence Day 2 is set for July 4 in London and has already sold out. LFC44: Underground Knockouts follows in Cardiff on July 6. The firm did not provide any explanation for its bitcoin adoption in its press release.

2025-06-26T18:50:45,"Coinbase launches regulated alternative to offshore crypto perpetuals","Offshore perpetuals come with counterparty risk, custody concerns, and regulatory uncertainty. Coinbase’s new U.S.-based alternative offers leverage without the baggage, bringing a potential game-changer for cautious but yield-hungry traders. In an a nnouncement on June 26, crypto exchange Coinbase revealed plans to launch U.S. Perpetual-Style Futures on its derivatives platform—marking one of the first regulated attempts to replicate the functionality of offshore perpetual contracts. Slated for a July 21 rollout, the products will feature nano-sized Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) futures with an unusually long five-year expiration, coupled with a funding rate mechanism to maintain alignment with spot prices. Unlike traditional quarterly futures, these contracts will trade 24/7, accrue funding hourly, and settle twice daily. The structure is designed to appeal to both retail and institutional traders seeking perpetual-like exposure without the legal gray areas of offshore venues. You might also like: Judge rejects SEC, Ripple motion on XRP sales and $125m penalty A regulated answer to an offshore dominated market Coinbase’s move is a strategic play to capture a market that has, until now, existed largely in regulatory limbo. Perpetual futures dominate crypto trading globally, accounting for nearly 93% of all crypto derivatives volume, according to Cornell research. Yet U.S. traders have been locked out of this liquidity, forced to either accept clunky, expiration-bound contracts or take their business to offshore exchanges like Bybit and Binance, where regulatory oversight is minimal and counterparty risk remains high. With its new five-year expiring contracts, Coinbase is attempting to repackage the perpetual model in a way that fits within U.S. legal parameters. Unlike traditional futures, which reset quarterly and often drift from spot prices, Coinbase’s contracts apply hourly funding payments to tether positions closely to market rates. Traders pay or receive funding every 12 hours based on long or short positioning, a system borrowed from offshore perpetuals but streamlined for U.S. compliance. The nano sizing (0.01 BTC and 0.10 ETH) lowers the barrier to entry, appealing to retail traders who might otherwise avoid futures entirely. Critically, the five-year expiration is a nod to long-term holders. Most crypto derivatives require rollovers every few months, creating friction for multi-year strategies. By minimizing expiration pressure, Coinbase is betting that traders will prefer holding these contracts over juggling quarterly expiries or risking exposure on offshore platforms. If successful, Coinbase’s initiative could pressure rivals to launch similar hybrid instruments, reshaping the U.S. crypto derivatives landscape.

In May, a scammer called the victim, 68, pretending to represent her bank and claiming that her cards had been compromised, per a press release from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). The scammer said a courier would come to collect her old cards and sent a driver from a rideshare company to pick them up. An hour later, the same scammer told the woman that all of her financial accounts had been compromised and sent a second rideshare “courier” to pick up all of her cards. The scammer also obtained the victim’s PINs over the phone and used the stolen cards and her personal info to drain CA$60,000 ($43,687) from her account. Police have tracked down one of the rideshare drivers, who is cooperating with the investigation, but they have been unable to locate the second driver. RCMP investigators say the victim’s cards were driven to the parking lot of a Home Depot, where they were picked up by a man wearing a face covering. The RCMP says it will continue to investigate the crime but notes that the chances of recovering stolen funds are low. Similar “bank courier” scams occurred in New York state earlier this year.

2025-06-26T18:31:41,"Blockchain-Powered Pokies: How Crypto Payments are Changing Online Slot Play","Online pokies and casino gaming are becoming more and more popular. Thanks to technology, online slot enthusiasts can easily access and enjoy classic and modern pokies with real payouts in a safe environment. So let's take a look at how blockchain and crypto payments in particular, are changing slot play in online pokies. From faster transactions to probably fair gaming, blockchain is reshaping the online slots experience. There are a number of benefits that come with blockchain-powered platforms, including greater security, transparency most importantly, excitement. The evolution of online slots in the age of blockchain Online slots have come a long way since their digital debut in the late 1990s. What started out as a basic, browser-based game with simple graphics and fruit symbols has evolved into immersive experiences. Slot games now feature rich visuals and themes, interactive bonus rounds and progressive jackpots. The integration of blockchain technology marks the next major shift in the industry. The use of decentralised networks and crypto tokens has meant that game developers and casinos are now able to offer players features that were previously impossible. This includes direct crypto wagering, tokenised rewards and smart contract-driven payouts. Blockchain is not just a payment method. It's technology that is completely changing the infrastructure of online gaming platforms, enabling great autonomy and fairness in each and every spin. Enhancing player trust One of the main advantages of using blockchain technology in online casinos is the enhanced trust it offers. Most traditional slot games operate on random number generators (RNGs), but players have historically had to take the casino's word that games are fair. Whereas blockchain has introduced provably fair gaming. This is where the fairness of each spin can be independently verified by players through publicly accessible cryptographic proofs. This level of transparency helps to build confidence among users, knowing they are playing on a platform where manipulation is virtually impossible. This is crucial in the digital world where digital identity is so important and there are so many risks out there. Every spin's outcome is recorded on the blockchain, which has helped to make disputes easier to resolve and also ensures the overall integrity of the game. Faster and safer payments Speed and security have become critical to any online gambling experience. Traditional payment methods like bank transfers or credit cards will often come with delays, fees and in some regions, restrictions on gambling transactions. Whereas blockchain-based casinos allow players to deposit and withdraw using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , Ethereum and stablecoins, which all typically come with near-instant processing times. Cryptocurrency payments are direct; they are peer-to-peer transactions. There are no third parties or intermediaries involved, which means payments tend to be quicker, come with lower fees and come with a reduced risk of fraud or chargebacks. Blockchain payments also come with more privacy, which is perfect for players who are seeking discretion when enjoying online slots. A new gaming ecosystem Beyond payments and fairness, blockchain is driving a new wave of community-driven innovation in the online pokies space. Decentralised casinos and gaming platforms often involve players directly in the decision-making through governance tokens, allowing them to vote on game features, platform updates or promotional campaigns. By participating, a platform can strengthen player loyalty and create an ecosystem where users feel genuinely invested. Plus, collaborations between blockchain developers and game studios are giving rise to unique pokies concepts, from NFT slot themes to cross-game jackpots that link multiple titles across platforms. The growing appeal of classic and modern pokies with real payouts Whether you prefer the nostalgic charm of fruit machines or the thrill of cutting-edge video slots, blockchain-powered platforms cater to a wide audience. They offer everything from simple three-reel games to sophisticated slots with advanced features. Many blockchain platforms incorporate native tokens or loyalty programs too. This has helped to further enhance the value players recieve. These innovations not only help to increase engagement, but also provide new opportunities to win and cash out real rewards securely. So what's next for blockchain integration in online slots The future of blockchain in online slots is full of exciting possibilities. We can expect to see greater adoption of smart contracts, enabling fully automated payouts and bonus triggers. Cross-platform tokens might allow players to transfer balances seamlessly between different casinos or games. Additionally, innovations like NFT-based game assets or community-owned slots could also create more personalised and interactive gaming experiences. Blockchain is completely transforming online slots in a way that benefits both players and operators. From provably fair gaming and faster crypto payments to the emergence of community-driven platforms, the technology is creating a safer, more transparent and engaging experience. As the industry continues to evolve, players can look forward to even greater innovation and opportunity. So whether you're a casual spinner or an experienced slot enthusiast, the future of blockchain-powered pokies promises exciting possibilities on every reel.

2025-06-26T18:30:05,"The Trump Effect: How His Bitcoin (BTC) Treasury Plan Impacts its Race Against Ethereum (ETH)","Donald Trump's approach to managing Bitcoin reserves has sent ripples through the crypto world. This strategic move could shape Bitcoin's standing in its ongoing competition with Ethereum . As the dynamics shift, it raises the question: which cryptocurrency is poised for growth? The article delves into the potential impacts and explores what this means for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin Price Dynamics: Mixed Signals and Clear Price Zones Bitcoin recorded a 1.52% dip over the last month paired with a modest weekly gain of nearly 2.77%, while a robust rise of 14.41% over the past six months marked its extended performance. Price action revealed a period of cautious progress as short-term retracements gave way to an overall upward trend. Oscillator readings have presented mixed signals with softened momentum alongside moderate RSI readings, reflecting a balancing act between upward liquidity and profit-taking pressures. Historical trends indicate Bitcoin has experienced periods of consolidation that allow the market to digest prior highs while paving the way for upcoming bullish rallies. Present trading sees Bitcoin stabilizing between roughly $94,832 and $113,326.8, with significant technical levels anchored at nearest support of $84,880.08 and immediate resistance of $121,869.42. A secondary support around $66,385.41 and resistance at about $140,364.09 further demarcate the battle zones between buyers and sellers. Bulls show promise as indicated by a momentum indicator reading close to 985.37, yet the negative awesome oscillator value near -1,037.44 hints at underlying selling pressure. RSI sits at a balanced 57.36, and mixed technical recommendations necessitate careful trade planning. Trading ideas include seeking long entries near support with measured stops just below the next level, while resistance areas should be watched for potential profit-taking before a sustained move can be confirmed. Ethereum's Recent Downturn and Key Price Levels for Action Ethereum faced a moderate drop of about -3.23% over the past month and a sharper decline of -25.51% in the last six months. Price adjustments have pushed the current range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. This period has seen noticeable loss pressure with overall bearish movements impacting investor sentiment. Monthly and half-year changes indicate that price correction remains the prevailing trend, reflecting market forces that have favored sellers and resulted in significant downtrends that warrant caution among traders. Current prices hover within a tight band, setting the nearest resistance at $3395.40 and the closest support at $1318.72, with a second resistance level at $4433.74 and a deep support around $280.38. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator at -163.45 and Momentum Indicator at -63.69 reflect a market leaning towards bearish pressure, while the Relative Strength Index at 50.11 shows no clear momentum for buyers or sellers. Trading strategies could involve shorting if upward moves stall near resistance while preparing for potential reversals at support levels, advocating for cautious tactics within these ranges amid uncertainties. Conclusion BTC 's potential treasury plan could boost its position. This move may attract more institutional interest. Such backing could drive BTC's value and mainstream acceptance higher. While ETH focuses on improving its ecosystem, BTC may gain a lead in investor confidence. This evolving dynamic will shape the future standings of both cryptocurrencies.

2025-06-26T18:27:52,"Blockchain Smashes the Casino Cage: Your Crypto Keys to a Fairer UK Gamble","Forget clunky old systems. Blockchain is crashing into online gambling, providing UK players with top-notch security, super-fast transactions, and verifiable fairness. This article gives you the real deal. Want to stop relying on blind luck and faceless algorithms when placing an online wager? Blockchain technology is taking over the UK iGaming industry, and it's a bloody time. No doubt, the UK Gambling Commission is on the case, but this tech tango between crypto and entertainment is forging a radically transparent future for your bets. Blockchain Storms the Gaming Arena The magic of blockchain lies in its brutal honesty. Every transaction, every game result is etched onto a decentralized, shared ledger. It's a public record that no one can tamper with - not the casino, not a hacker, nor anyone. And that ends the old dynamic where you cross your fingers and hope the house plays straight. Probable fair systems can change the game for casinos. Verify a roulette spin: With cryptography, platforms give you a hash before you play so you can check the math and be sure the outcome is random. Speed is another advantage - blockchain removes banking middlemen, so deposits can be instant and withdrawals can take minutes. That means lower fees too. All players worldwide can join, but players must register to access licensed casino content in the UK . Smart contracts make payouts and rewards automatic, reducing human errors and delays. Plus, using crypto means your banking details are secret. Licensing: The Rulebook Rewritten for Crypto Mixing volatile crypto with online gambling? Regulators were bound to sit up. The UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) isn’t asleep at the wheel. They haven’t outlawed crypto, but licensed operators using it face a regulatory gauntlet. Online security’s come a long way – from flimsy padlocks (SSL) to fortress walls (TLS and 2FA). Blockchain slams on another deadbolt: an immutable transaction history that’s near-impossible to forge. For UK sites flirting with crypto, the UKGC demands ironclad Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF) drills. This means grilling players about their crypto’s origin story and deploying hardcore Know Your Customer (KYC) checks, especially for hefty bets. Crucially, your Bitcoin or Ether doesn’t stay crypto for long on UKGC platforms. They swiftly convert it into pounds sterling within your account. This shields your stake from crypto’s infamous rollercoaster rides while you play. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) also keeps crypto businesses on a tight leash, demanding registration and rigorous risk controls. It’s a high-wire act: fostering innovation without letting the cowboys in. Why This Tech Tango Wins for UK Players So, what’s actually in it for you, placing bets from Birmingham or Brighton? This isn’t just tech hype; the perks bite hard. Privacy gets a serious shot in the arm. Crypto transactions cloak your real-world financial identity better than traditional methods. Security? Blockchain’s cryptographic muscle makes transactions virtually unhackable. Every quid wagered or won leaves an indelible, verifiable trail – fraud’s nightmare. Speed offers an instant adrenaline rush, with crypto payouts hitting your digital wallet immediately after a win, avoiding lengthy withdrawals. Fees are often minimal, bypassing traditional bank charges. Sticking to UKGC-licensed sites is essential for safety, but some platforms enhance access to global games and offer exclusive bonuses for crypto users. The standout feature? Provable Fairness, giving you the ability to verify that the game is fair. It's a powerful shift in trust. UK Platforms Dipping Toes (and Tokens) in Crypto Hunting for a shouting, full-throttle blockchain casino licensed by the UKGC right now? Keep your shirt on. The regulatory heat means big players prioritise compliance over crowdfunding revolutions. But look closer: a growing crew now quietly accept crypto payments alongside cards and e-wallets. Their UKGC mandate? Prove they can handle crypto’s risks: bulletproof AML/KYC, instant conversion to GBP, and meticulous fund tracking. Pioneers of tokenised economies and DAO-governed casinos often operate in less regulated spaces, unlike the UK, which, despite its caution, could foster responsible innovation. Operators focusing on crypto security, speed, and fairness are poised to lead the next wave. For inspiration, look at ""EVE Frontier,"" a sci-fi MMO with deep Ethereum integration, where players own NFTs like spaceships and trade ERC-20 tokens in a player-run market. This concept suggests a future where gambling platforms could adopt similar decentralised technologies, allowing for player-owned experiences and DAO casinos with token holder votes on the house edge. Crypto Gambling's Next Hand: What’s the Deal? The crypto gamble in the UK is just the first spin. Watch regulators like the UKGC and FCA refine their playbook as the tech evolves . But blockchain’s core strengths of transparency, blistering speed, ironclad security, and giving players real agency align shockingly well with responsible gambling aims. Will provably fair mechanics become the baseline demand, even on fiat sites? You’d bet on it. Fully decentralised platforms, running entirely on-chain via unbreakable smart contracts? They’re the dream, but UK regulatory mountains loom large. Tokenised rewards programs, where your play earns crypto assets you can trade or stake? That’s got legs. And what about those quantum randomness beacons – spooky science magic guaranteeing cosmic-level unpredictability? Could they become the ultimate fairness seal? One thing’s certain: crypto is forcing the industry to lay its cards on the table. Players win when trust is engineered into the system, not just marketed. The tech provides the toolkit. Smart regulation and operator guts will decide if the UK builds the fairest game in town. Place your bets. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-26T18:22:05,"Cloudbet expands crypto crash game portfolio with Galaxsys","Willemstad, Curaçao – June 26, 2025 – Cloudbet has added the full suite of Galaxsys titles to its crash and instant-win lineup, reinforcing its position as a crypto-first casino built for speed, volatility, and direct-crypto play. The rollout includes 42 games across crash, slots, table games, bingo, and arcade-style formats — all playable in over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), USDT, and USDC. Galaxsys is known for fast-cycle gameplay and transparent mechanics — a natural match for Cloudbet’s high-frequency bettors. Crash leaders like Crash, Crasher, Tower Rush, and Rocketon feature rising multipliers, instant resolution, and peak volatility, with potential payouts reaching up to x700,000. In March, Tower Rush was named “Best Crash Game 2025” at SiGMA Africa — its third industry award after receiving the “Best New Game 2025” accolade at the AIBC Eurasia Awards. “These titles reflect our commitment to quality-first curation,” said Cloudbet’s casino product manager. “They align with how crypto players engage — high-speed formats, scalable risk, and real-money outcomes without delay. Galaxsys understands that rhythm, and the games slot naturally into our most active segments.” Crash games have become a cornerstone of crypto gambling, favored for their rapid pace, minimal friction, and high-volatility structure that mirrors the crypto market itself. The core mechanic — riding a rising multiplier and cashing out before the crash — delivers instant resolution and real-money tension in under ten seconds. That simplicity, combined with scalable risk and always-on access, makes crash an ideal fit for the habits of crypto-native bettors. Cloudbet , which launched in 2013, was one of the first crypto casinos to support crash games at scale. Today, instant-win staples like Aviator by Spribe — which alone accounts for more than 33% of daily activity in the site’s instant-win segment — continue to dominate player engagement. Alongside Aviator, games like Mines, Dice, and Plinko, longstanding Spribetitles in Cloudbet’s lineup, each capture between 8% and 12% of daily activity. The Galaxsysintegration adds depth to the category without overlap or filler content. The Galaxsys drop also includes top-ranking slots like Olympian Legends and Funny Faces, along with table game staples Blackjack, RouletteX, and HiLo. Instant-win fans get fresh options too, with arcade-style picks like Maestro, Magic Dice, CoinFlip, and Ninja Crash. All Galaxsys games are now live. Players can browse, demo, or play — no KYC required. $3,000 Cloudbet x Galaxsys tournament now live To celebrate the launch, Cloudbet is running a $3,000 Galaxsys Tournament. Players earn points by betting on any Galaxsys title, with the top 40 finishers winning instant cash prizes — up to $750 — credited directly via the Rewards Calendar. The tournament complements recent site upgrades, including new multiplier profiles, community tipping tools, and enhanced tournament pages — all built for streamers and fast-cycle format fans. About Cloudbet Founded in 2013, Cloudbet is the world’s longest-running crypto casino and sportsbook. Players worldwide have placed millions of bets using over 40 cryptocurrencies. In 2024, Cloudbet launched the most generous welcome offer and loyalty program in the space — featuring stacked rewards and guaranteed daily cash drops for active bettors. With thousands of slots, live casino tables, and deep sports markets — from esports to Premier League and NFL player props — Cloudbet remains the home of secure crypto betting.

2025-06-26T18:15:32,"Ex-Blackstone Exec, Tether Co-Founder to Launch $1B Crypto Reserve SPAC","A Bloomberg report has revealed that former Blackstone Inc. executive Chinh Chu and Reeve Collins, co-founder of stablecoin giant Tether, are teaming up to raise $1 billion for a listed crypto vehicle that aims to build a portfolio of digital assets. The capital is being raised through M3 Brigade Acquisition V Corp, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) backed by the two. A Multi-Token Approach Anonymous sources cited in the report said that the vehicle would hold a diversified mix of tokens, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). They also revealed that the fundraising effort is ongoing, meaning that the details, including the $1 billion target, may change. Cantor Fitzgerald LP is among the parties advising on the deal. Furthermore, Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce in U.S. President Donald Trump’s first administration, has reportedly been tapped to serve as vice chair alongside Binance board chairman Gabriel Abed. The venture will also have ex-Hut 8 Mining head Jaime Leverton as CEO in an acting capacity. Chu and Collins’ multi-token approach is markedly different from that taken by the likes of Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The former has bought over 592,000 BTC, currently valued at more than $60 billion. The latter now holds 12,345 BTC worth over $1.33 billion and recently passed Tesla to become the seventh-largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Meanwhile, others like SharpLink Gaming have taken an Ether-focused approach. The Minneapolis-based company owns 188,478 ETH worth about $457 million and is staking 100% of it to support the Ethereum network. This strategy followed a $425 million private placement led by Consensys and the appointment of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman. Tether Co-Founder Buys $6.47M SPAC In May 2025, Collins acquired a controlling stake in M3-Brigade for $6.47 million. The deal included 7.19 million Class B shares and 5.04 million private placement warrants, with plans to purchase an additional 3.29 million from Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. Following the transaction, Collins was named CEO, with Chinh coming in as the SPAC’s new president. The crypto entrepreneur, who has also just joined the advisory board of Canadian-listed digital asset ETF company Fineqia, was instrumental in founding Tether, NFT platform BLOCKv, and Smart Media Technologies. He is currently chairman of STBL.com (formerly Pi), a yield-bearing stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum and Solana. This decentralized platform enables yield retention from tokenized RWAs such as U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. Meanwhile, Chu was Blackstone’s longest-serving dealmaker before leaving in 2015. While at the firm, he sponsored several SPACs, including deals for Getty Images and Utz Brands.

2025-06-26T18:05:24,"Crypto Trader Unveils Major Level Ethereum Must Break Above To Trigger Rally, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin","A closely followed crypto analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) has to break through one resistance level to ignite a bull rally. In a new thread, crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,100 followers on the social media platform X that Ethereum needs to reclaim the area around $2,500 as support before ETH can mount an explosive move to the upside. “After holding the orange circled area for about six full weeks, Ethereum ended up following through on the blue circled scenario. Still, this orange box is the macro range low ($2,200), and price needs to effectively reclaim around $2,500 to rally across the range.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The analyst also says that until Ethereum closes above $2,500 on the daily chart, ETH will likely hold $2,200 as support as it trades sideways. “For the time being, Ethereum is treating the ~$2,500 level as resistance after it previously held for almost six weeks. But Ethereum just needs a daily close above ~$2,500 to start the reclaim process. Until then, ETH will meander between $2,200-$2,500.” ETH is trading for $2,425 at time of writing, flat on the day. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is showing bullishness on the daily timeframe, having smashed through a downtrend line for the second time in June. “Bitcoin has broken two two-week downtrends over the past month.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Bitcoin is trading for $107,302 at time of writing, flat on the day.

2025-06-26T18:00:56,"Analyst to XRP Holders: This XRP Trendline Is Everything Right Now","XRP is once again in the spotlight as traders zero in on a critical trendline that could define its next major move. According to respected crypto analyst Casitrades, this key support line is “everything right now,” and the market’s reaction to it may signal whether XRP is ready to ignite its next leg upward. A Precise Bounce from Key Support XRP recently tapped the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.145—a zone that also marks the apex of its recent consolidation structure. This convergence of technical levels makes $2.145 a vital area to hold in the short term. So far, the price has responded positively, bouncing cleanly off this support, which suggests strength and renewed bullish momentum. Casitrades described this level as “the most critical on the chart, short-term,” warning that a drop below it would indicate weakness . However, XRP is currently holding above it with confidence. “This is the kind of price action you want to see if XRP is serious about continuing this new trend to the upside,” Casitrades wrote. This Trendline Is Everything Right Now! I’ve been tracking this trendline support as the key level to hold and we just got a clean reaction off it. This correction already reached the .382 retracement at $2.145, which also happens to be the apex of consolidation… that’s… pic.twitter.com/bA79dP1c99 — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 25, 2025 The current structure, where price remains above the consolidation range while showing impulsive upward moves, is often a strong sign of trend continuation. Resistance at $2.25: The Next Test As XRP stabilizes above support, attention now turns to the $2.25 resistance level. According to Casitrades, this is the next major hurdle. A breakout above $2.25 would be a bullish confirmation and could open the door to a move toward $2.69—the next Fibonacci retracement target. “Price is now trying to push back toward the $2.25 resistance. That’s the next big test,” Casitrades noted. “If we can flip that level, we’ll likely open the path toward the $2.69 retrace test—and from there, the breakout potential increases dramatically.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A move beyond $2.69 could trigger an even stronger rally, potentially signaling the ignition of a powerful wave 3, typically the most explosive phase in Elliott Wave theory. Momentum Building Across the Market XRP’s price action is unfolding as the broader altcoin market shows signs of revival. With Bitcoin consolidating, many traders are shifting focus to high-potential assets like XRP. Market indicators such as RSI and Stochastic RSI are also aligning in favor of the bulls, hinting at growing upward momentum. Volume is beginning to increase as XRP approaches resistance, suggesting rising interest and accumulation. Meanwhile, the price continues to respect key support levels, reinforcing the bullish structure. For now, all eyes are on whether XRP can clear $2.25 and confirm a breakout. But one thing is clear: as Casitrades rightly said, “This trendline is everything.” How XRP behaves around it could determine the direction of the next major move.

2025-06-26T17:55:52,"XRP 3 Hammers and 3 Rockets, Here’s What’s Next?","Market analyst EGRAG Crypto has projected when the XRP uptrend will resume after identifying what he calls hammers and rockets on the daily chart. His analysis comes on the back of XRP's consolidation phase, which began after a drop from the $3.4 top in mid-January. Specifically, after XRP collapsed from the $3.4 peak , it immediately relinquished the $3 mark and has since consolidated around $2 over the past five months.XRP Sees Hammers and Rockets Within Descending ChannelWhile the broader market takes a similar path, Bitcoin (BTC) has been witnessing new all-time highs . Now, EGRAG believes XRP is on the verge of breaking out of this consolidation phase, calling attention to a descending channel that has prevailed over the daily chart since November 2024.Interestingly, EGRAG's chart shows that XRP's upswings and declines since November have led to what he calls ""3 hammers"" and ""3 rockets."" Specifically, a hammer refers to the resistance presented by the bears when XRP attempts to break above the channel. Meanwhile, a rocket is the recovery push after XRP retests support at the channel's lower trendline.Notably, each hammer (or roadblock) has eventually resulted in a price correction, while each rocket (recovery effort) has led to a push toward a breakout. XRP Descending Channel | EGRAG Crypto For context, XRP saw three rockets at $1.95 on Dec. 20, 2024, at $1.76 on Feb. 3, 2025, and then at $1.61 on April 7, 2025.However, the three hammers came in at $3.4 on Jan. 16, 2025, at $3.02 on March 2, 2025, and then most recently at $2.65 on May 12, 2025.EGRAG Predicts When XRP Bull Run Will ResumeFollowing the three iterations of each pattern, EGRAG asked for audience opinions on whether XRP would break out or go lower. In his view, the next direction from here could be upward. According to him, XRP could break out from this channel or consolidation structure by mid-June, with the uptrend persisting until August to September 2025.However, his projection came up days before the Israel-Iran war began, which has since skewed the direction of the market. As a result of the conflict, this timeline could be delayed. Meanwhile, EGRAG provided several immediate targets around the breakout from the descending channel. Specifically, XRP would need to breach the $2.6 resistance to break above the channel. From the current price of $2.16, XRP must rise 20.3% to reach this price mark.XRP Breakout TargetsFollowing a breakout from the channel, XRP's next immediate target could be the $3 psychological level, which it has failed to reclaim since March. Beyond this, the next target would be the yearly peak of $3.4. A break above this mark could open the door for greater price heights.While EGRAG failed to present his ultimate targets for when the bull run resumes, he had in previous instances suggested that XRP could reach the $20 range this cycle. Most recently, he predicted that XRP's top for this cycle could be $24. Meanwhile, last month, he predicted a possible XRP rally to $27.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/06/26/xrp-3-hammers-and-3-rockets-heres-whats-next/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-3-hammers-and-3-rockets-heres-whats-next,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction",cryptocompare
