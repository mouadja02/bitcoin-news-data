2025-06-27T08:57:25,"Private Key and Front End Exploits Lead Crypto Thefts in 2025","The majority of the thefts were driven by private key compromises and front-end exploits, which together accounted for more than 80% of stolen funds across 75 incidents. These highly targeted attacks very often involve social engineering and infrastructure vulnerabilities, and they have become much more more damaging, averaging nearly $30 million per breach. A $1.5 billion hack on Dubai-based exchange Bybit, linked to North Korean state actors, was the largest single incident and contributed to nearly 70% of total losses. Geopolitical tensions have also entered the crypto security space, with groups like the pro-Israel hacker collective Predatory Sparrow targeting Iranian exchanges. In the DeFi sector, Resupply lost $9.6 million in a price manipulation exploit involving synthetic assets. Meanwhile, British hacker Kai West was indicted in the US for selling stolen data through BreachForums, raking in millions in Bitcoin and Monero. Crypto Theft Soars in 2025 Crypto-related cyberattacks surged to unprecedented levels in the first half of 2025, which resulted in a staggering $2.1 billion in losses. This is according to a new report from blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs. The majority of these losses stemmed from private key exploits and front-end compromises, which together made up more than 80% of the value stolen across 75 separate incidents this year. These infrastructure-based attacks, which include compromising a user’s private seed phrase or exploiting vulnerabilities in a crypto platform’s interface, have proven to be particularly damaging as they typically net hackers ten times more value than other forms of cyberattacks. (Source: TRM Labs ) TRM Labs explained that these kinds of attacks leverage core weaknesses in cryptosystems and are frequently exacerbated by social engineering tactics that are designed to manipulate users. In addition to infrastructure breaches, protocol exploits were another key threat vector. These attacks, like flash loan exploits and re-entrancy vulnerabilities, accounted for 12% of total losses during the period and target the underlying smart contracts or logic of a blockchain protocol to steal money or destabilize operations. The scale of theft in H1 2025 already exceeds the previous half-year record that was set in 2022 by approximately 10% and is almost equal to the entire year’s total for 2024. A major driver of this year’s record-breaking losses was a $1.5 billion hack on the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit , which was attributed to North Korean state-backed hackers. That single incident represents around 70% of total funds stolen so far in 2025 and pushed the average hack size to nearly $30 million. This is double that of the previous year. State actors and politically motivated hacking groups seem to be playing a larger role in these attacks. TRM Labs pointed to the pro-Israel hacker collective Gonjeshke Darande , also known as Predatory Sparrow, which has possible links to the Israeli government and was responsible for a $100 million exploit on Iran’s largest exchange, Nobitex, in June. The report frames this escalation as a “pivotal shift” in the landscape of crypto hacking, where geopolitical intent increasingly underpins malicious activity. To address this mounting threat, TRM Labs called for a comprehensive overhaul of crypto security practices. This includes implementing multifactor authentication, using cold storage for funds, conducting regular audits, and enhancing detection of insider threats and social engineering attempts. More broadly, the firm pointed out that there is a need for international cooperation between law enforcement agencies, financial intelligence units, and blockchain analytics firms. According to TRM Labs, the first half of 2025 should serve as a wake-up call for the industry. Resupply Hit by $9.6M DeFi Exploit Unfortunately, crypto crime is showing no signs of stopping. Resupply, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, recently confirmed a security breach in its wstUSR market that led to $9.6 million in losses. The exploit was the result of a price manipulation attack involving a synthetic stablecoin called cvcrvUSD. According to blockchain security firm Cyvers , the attacker inflated the share price in the ResupplyPair contract to borrow $10 million in reUSD using minimal collateral. The funds, initially sourced through Tornado Cash, were converted to Ethereum and distributed across two addresses. In response, Resupply paused the affected contracts and stated that only the wstUSR market was compromised. The protocol plans to release a full post-mortem after completing its investigation. Cyvers’ CTO Meir Dolev believes that the attack could have been avoided with better input validation, oracle checks, and real-time anomaly monitoring. This incident is part of the list of DeFi exploits in 2025. Hackers have increasingly shifted to social engineering, which was the case in a $2 million Bedrock UniBTC exploit in 2024 linked to a former Fuzzland employee who used insider access and supply chain attacks to carry out the breach. UK Hacker Busted for Selling Stolen Data Meanwhile, British national Kai West was recently indicted by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York for allegedly operating under the alias “IntelBroker” and selling stolen data on cybercrime forums, leading to over $25 million in damages. West is accused of conspiring with a cybercriminal group known as CyberN***ers to hack into and steal data from more than 40 companies, including a telecom provider, a municipal healthcare system, and an internet service provider. (Source: US Attorney’s Office ) The charges stem in part from an undercover law enforcement operation where an agent purchased stolen credentials from IntelBroker for $250 in Bitcoin. The data included administrative-level usernames and passwords. West allegedly offered data stolen in these breaches for sale for over $2 million and was active on the notorious BreachForums platform between January of 2023 and February of 2025. He was reportedly responsible for at least 158 threads advertising stolen data, 41 of which involved companies based in the United States. Sixteen of those posts contained explicit price listings, amounting to at least $2.4 million. West also accepted payments in the privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero. According to authorities, his activity on BreachForums escalated to the point where he was identified as the platform’s owner starting in August 2024. He was arrested in France earlier this year, and US authorities are now seeking his extradition. Law enforcement officials, including former SEC Chair Jay Clayton and FBI Assistant Director Christopher Raia, placed a lot of emphasis on the severity of the crimes. Raia described West as a “serial hacker” who profited millions from illicit activities. The case now adds to a growing list of high-profile cybersecurity incidents, including a recent breach affecting Coinbase . That incident involved the unauthorized access of customer data by overseas support agents, which led to a $20 million extortion attempt.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9728/private-key-and-front-end-exploits-lead-crypto-thefts-in-2025,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T08:54:32,"Massive $17 Billion BTC and ETH Options Expire Today in 2025 Largest Event – Rally or Crash?","The cryptocurrency market is facing its largest options expiration event of 2025 today, as over $17.27 billion in BTC and ETH contracts expire on Deribit. This massive H1 quarterly delivery represents 30% of the total current positions. H1 Expiry Incoming Over $17B in BTC & ETH options are set to expire tomorrow on Deribit, the largest of the year so far. $BTC : $15B notional | Put/Call: 0.74 | Max Pain: $102K $ETH : $2.3B notional | Put/Call: 0.52 |Max Pain: $2,200 Will Q3 start with a breakout or reset?… pic.twitter.com/ye92lhXP4Z — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) June 26, 2025 Bitcoin leads with $15 billion in expiring options across 139,000 contracts, while Ethereum accounts for $2.3 billion through 939,000 contracts. However, the put-call ratios reveal bullish sentiment across both assets. Bitcoin shows a 0.74 ratio with maximum pain at $102,000, while Ethereum displays a 0.52 ratio with maximum pain at $2,200. Both cryptocurrencies currently trade well above their respective pain points, with BTC at $107,555 and ETH at $2,452. Source: Cryptonews This expiration significantly exceeds the previous 2025 events. Bitcoin contracts jumped from 33,972 last week to 139,390 today, while Ethereum surged from 224,509 to 938,551 contracts. The scale exceeded April’s $8.05 billion, which was previously the year’s largest event. Massive BTC and ETH Expiring Options Drive Market Positioning Strategy The sheer volume of expiring contracts accounts for over 30% of total open interest, a concentration rarely seen in crypto derivatives markets and one that historically precedes significant price movements. Bitcoin’s dominance in the expiration is particularly striking, with 139,000 contracts carrying $15 billion notional value compared to last week’s modest 33,972 contracts. This four-fold increase is due to the monthly nature of June 27 expiries, which aggregate positions built throughout the quarter rather than weekly accumulations. The maximum pain theory suggests both assets face gravitational pull toward their respective strike prices. Source: CoinGlass Bitcoin’s $102,000 max pain sits significantly below current $107,555 levels, while Ethereum’s $2,200 target lies below $2,452 trading prices. This divergence typically creates downward pressure as market makers hedge their exposures. Put-call ratios reveal contrasting sentiment structures despite overall bullish positioning. Source: IntoTheBlock Bitcoin’s 0.59 ratio indicates moderate call dominance, while Ethereum’s 0.46 ratio shows stronger bullish conviction. However, implied volatility patterns diverge sharply, with BTC hovering below 35% while ETH maintains elevated levels of 65%. Notably, block trading activity has also intensified dramatically in the 48 hours preceding expiration. Source: CoinGlass Deribit recorded $1.4 billion in large-scale call transactions, with institutional players actively repositioning ahead of the deadline. This volume surge indicates that investors are preparing for potential volatility rather than simply riding out the expiration. The timing coincides with Bitcoin’s fourth attempt to establish $108,000 as support after recovering from levels below $100,000. Technical analyst Rekt Capital recently identified this as a crucial transitional period, noting that weekly closes above $104,400 will determine whether Bitcoin enters its next price discovery uptrend or faces an extended period of consolidation. Institutional Flows Show Mixed Long-Term Outlook Institutional activity surrounding today’s expiration reveals conflicting signals as traditional finance entities embrace crypto treasury strategies while short-term positioning suggests caution ahead of potential volatility. Bitcoin’s institutional narrative strengthens despite near-term uncertainties. Most recently, billionaire Philippe Laffont included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40” list of top investments for the next five years, projecting that the market capitalization could exceed $5 trillion by 2030. He admitted to previously overlooking Bitcoin as a store of value. Billionaire @plaffont has included Bitcoin in his “Fantastic 40,” his list of top investment opportunities for the next five years. #Bitcoin #Crypto https://t.co/9rwMC189FE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 Similarly, Bakkt, a cryptocurrency exchange, has filed for a $1 billion shelf registration with the SEC , earmarking the proceeds for Bitcoin acquisitions under its updated treasury strategy. However, despite these institutional activities, immediate market dynamics present challenges. Recent CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin miner revenues fell to $34 million daily , the lowest since April 20, driven by reduced transaction fees and price pressure. Despite this stress, miners increased reserves from 61,000 to 65,000 BTC between March and June, indicating long-term confidence. Ethereum faces more complex institutional positioning, with SharpLink Gaming being the recent accumulator of 12,207 ETH , valued at $30.6 million. @SharpLinkGaming becomes world's largest public $ETH holder with $30.6 million purchase, bringing total holdings to 188,478 $ETH worth $457 million. #SharpLink #ETH #Treasury https://t.co/wxbXBFSe5T — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The company now holds 188,478 ETH worth approximately $457 million, representing the largest publicly traded Ethereum position. Spot ETF flows provide additional context for retail sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs recently recorded eleven consecutive inflows of $588 million , while Ethereum ETFs recorded weekly inflows of $205 million at the same time. This retail interest contrasts with institutional selling, creating complex cross-currents in Ethereum markets. The technical outlook remains pivotal for both assets. Analyst Michaël van de Poppe identifies $2,400 as Ethereum’s crucial range low, suggesting upside potential if support holds. So far, so good for $ETH . Holding above this crucial range low and we're likely going to be testing the other side of the range in the upcoming weeks. pic.twitter.com/wgkDmyiPlN — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 26, 2025 Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its weekly support at $104,400 will determine whether the asset transitions into its next major uptrend or faces extended consolidation through the historically weak Q3 period.

2025-06-27T08:30:26,"Senate Targets September for Passing Landmark Digital Asset Market Structure Bill","U.S. Senator Tim Scott, who chairs the Senate Banking Committee, announced plans to advance legislation on digital asset market structure by the end of September, signaling renewed urgency in shaping the crypto regulatory landscape. Speaking during a “fireside chat” with Senator Cynthia Lummis and White House crypto adviser Bo Hines on Thursday, Scott emphasized that a clear market framework is necessary for the crypto market to function effectively in the United States. “For the market to function completely, we need to move forward with legislation for market structure and stablecoins,” Scott stated, setting a September 30 target for passing the bill. In support, Senator Lummis assured, “You’re the chairman, and we will do as you wish. We will make sure that we’re ready to do that,” reflecting strong committee alignment on advancing the crypto agenda. Lummis Pushes Forward with Crypto Legislation At the Bitcoin Policy Summit a day prior, Lummis noted she would be “extremely disappointed” if key legislation like the GENIUS Act and market structure bills were not enacted before 2026. The GENIUS Act, designed to guide stablecoin innovation in the U.S., has cleared the Senate but awaits action in the House of Representatives. As of June, neither chamber has scheduled a floor vote on comprehensive market structure legislation. The timeline shared by Scott and Lummis may differ from President Donald Trump’s push for swift crypto legislative action. On June 18, Trump called on the House to pass the GENIUS Act and deliver it to his desk “ASAP,” reflecting the administration’s prioritization of stablecoin regulation. CLARITY Act in Senate Focus Lummis expressed her intent to draft market structure legislation before the August recess, aiming for a September markup. She highlighted that the Senate may look at the House’s Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) as a reference point for crafting its version. The CLARITY Act, which passed out of committee in June, aims to clarify which digital assets qualify as securities under SEC oversight or as commodities under the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The proposed legislation is intended to establish clear guidelines for digital asset firms , fostering legal clarity that could drive institutional adoption while maintaining consumer protections. If successful, the bill could become a foundational pillar for the United States in regulating and fostering growth within the crypto sector.

2025-06-27T08:29:11,"ETH outperforms BTC amid geopolitical tensions but one top crypto is beating all","Global markets are reeling from geopolitical unrest, with Israeli airstrikes on Iran triggering a 4.7% Bitcoin (BTC) drop to $103,300 and Ethereum (ETH) dipping to $2,694. Yet ETH has surged 40% over three months outpacing BTC as institutional investors pour $1.25 billion into ETH ETFs since mid-May. Meanwhile Singapore’s new crypto regulations are tightening forcing offshore exchanges like Bitget to comply by June 30. Amid this volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as the best crypto to buy now, with its presale in Phase 5 drawing intense interest. Investors are flocking to its $0.03 token price, promising a 100% return at launch. Ethereum’s resilient surge Ethereum (ETH) is showing remarkable strength despite market turbulence. Geopolitical tensions, including recent Middle East conflicts, sparked a crypto sell-off, yet ETH’s 40% quarterly gain remains robust. Institutional interest fuels this momentum, with ETH ETFs attracting $1.25 billion since mid-May. ETH’s dominance is climbing to nearly 10%, signaling a shift toward DeFi and AI-focused altcoins. Bitcoin, meanwhile, saw its dominance slip by 2-3 percentage points. Crypto prices today reflect this divergence as ETH trades at $2,404.82, up 6.95% daily. Consequently, ETH’s resilience highlights its appeal in a volatile crypto market. However, another token is stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out, having raised $11,200,000 since its presale began, with over 570 million tokens sold to 12,500 holders. Furthermore, its robust infrastructure aligns with Singapore’s push for transparency, positioning it as a top crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in decentralized finance. Its presale is blazing through Phase 5, currently over 50% filled at $0.03 per token—a 200% increase from Phase 1’s $0.01. With the listing price of 0.06, you will be looking at a 100% ROI at launch, and a post-launch estimation of 2.50 once in 2025, making the hypothetical maximum possible gain by 8,233%. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a two-L body that integrates peer-to-conract and the peer-to-peer lending systems into a dynamic, safe lending environment. In addition, it has a non-custodial protocol, which means users are in control of the assets, and it is different to centralized platforms. This utility drives its appeal in the crypto market. Security and scalability at Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is prioritizing trust and growth. The team has finalized a CertiK audit, earning an 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. Active monitoring and moderate social media engagement bolster transparency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, fully collateralized to resist depegging risks. Additionally, its Layer 2 strategy aims to slash gas fees and boost scalability. The team recently launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. In addition, a $100,000 giveaway is underway, splitting prizes among 10 winners who invest $50 in the presale. Why Mutuum Finance shines bright As crypto prices fluctuate, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as the best crypto to buy now. Phase 5’s $0.03 price is a fleeting opportunity, with over 50% of tokens already claimed. Phase 6 will raise the price to $0.035, a 16.7% jump, making now the moment for savvy investors. The project’s audited contracts, innovative lending, and stablecoin plans signal long-term potential.

2025-06-27T08:27:58,"The FCA must reassess its stance on digital asset ETPs—now | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. It’s often said that good regulation should promote disruption, not inhibit it; however, the FCA’s stance towards digital asset ETPs has remained stubbornly conservative and set in its ways for the last decade. As things stand, the FCA currently prohibits UK retail investors from accessing digital assets through regulated, exchange-traded products, ETPs. The reasons cited are well known and can essentially be summarised as the following: challenges related to assessing their true value, high prevalence of cybercrime, extreme volatility associated with these speculative assets that people are poorly equipped to understand, and lastly, there’s no legitimate investment need for cryptocurrencies. You might also like: The UK has to get its crypto house in order | Opinion While the aforementioned reasons may have held weight ten or even five years ago, as digital assets enter the mainstream and over 500 million people use them around the world for reasons beyond mere speculation, these arguments look increasingly out of date. For one thing, the criticism that cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and are hard to effectively value applies to many traditional asset classes (early-stage venture capital, art, and commodities) that face comparable challenges when trying to judge their value. However, these are still accessible to retail investors. Often overlooked but no less important is that, unlike the aforementioned traditional assets, cryptocurrencies, particularly those with established utility or monetary properties, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), have transparent, auditable supply mechanisms and globally liquid markets that support valuation frameworks based on adoption, scarcity, and usage. Critics have, since its inception, pointed out how bitcoin and digital currencies can be used for nefarious means. Indeed, my first encounter with Bitcoin came in 2011 when, at GCHQ, I saw it being applied for criminal transfers. While that may have been true over a decade ago, the authorities have cottoned on to its potential use, and illicit activity in cryptocurrency markets has declined and is often more traceable due to the blockchain’s transparency. Major ETPs operate on regulated exchanges with institutional-grade custodians and compliance measures. Cryptocurrency transfers, by definition, leave a signature that can be monitored, unlike suitcases filled with cash, which can be transported without any electronic trace or potential for monitoring. Alongside their speculative nature, critics cite the extreme volatility associated with cryptocurrencies, while this is undeniably true, volatility exists across many retail-accessible asset classes, such as leveraged ETFs or EM equities. Volatility and its accompanying risks don’t on their own merit exclusion from retail investors, especially when access is through diversified and professionally structured ETPs with transparent risk disclosures. A fairer and more addressable criticism is the lack of education and understanding on how to invest in these products by retail customers. Without proper knowledge on how to store assets, check accredited exchanges for purchasing assets, and ensure data is properly managed, consumers are vulnerable to scams and errors that can be costly. Investor education should, for this reason, be a regulatory priority, not a reason for exclusion. Many retail investors routinely allocate to complex products (structured notes, options, etc.) under regulated advice or self-direction. Crypto ETPs offer a familiar, regulated wrapper for exposure, simplifying access and removing custody and technical barriers, thereby improving—not reducing—investor understanding. At Bitwise, we currently work with CFA and directly with the allocator community to improve education for both retail and institutional investors. The final and most used criticism of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general is that it’s a “solution in search of a problem” and that there’s no legitimate investment need. Defining that constitutes a “legitimate need” is highly paternalistic and inconsistent with free-market principles. Retail investors may seek portfolio diversification, long-term growth, or a hedge against monetary debasement—all of which cryptoassets can potentially provide. The demand is clear: UK investors already access crypto through offshore platforms, often at greater risk. It’s clear that the current status quo from the FCA is untenable; 7 million retail investors/users exist in the UK alone, and they can currently only access offshore platforms and unregulated products where corporate governance and compliance levels vary hugely. This technology has proven itself to be more than just a fad; it is now pervasive throughout every sector and industry globally. Digital Assets and blockchain technology sit at the nexus of multiple mega trends such as the digitisation of money, Agentic AI, energy grid optimisation, and tokenization of real-world assets. Retail investors are right to want to support the Web3 economy and future growth of these markets; the FCA should provide them the guidelines and protection they’re crying out for.

ETH recently pushed above $2,520 but has since pulled back, with analysts eyeing potential support around $2,320. Still, if you had the good sense to buy Ethereum three years ago, you’d be sitting pretty today. A $10,000 investment in ETH in 2022 On June 27, 2022. Ethereum was trading at $1,193.68, according to data from CoinMarketCap . That means your $10,000 would have purchased approximately 8.38 ETH tokens. It wasn’t exactly an obvious buy at the time. The cryptocurrency market was in the midst of a brutal bear market , with Ethereum having crashed from its November 2021 peak of over $4,800. The ride has been anything but smooth since then. Ethereum continued falling before eventually clawing its way back, even touching above $4,000 in 2024. How much ETH would you have now? Those 8.38 ETH tokens you bought for $10,000 three years ago are worth $20,490 today, a profit of $10,490, or a 104.9% return. Not bad, but it depends on what you’re comparing it to.

2025-06-27T08:21:33,"Top DeFi coin of summer 2025? This $0.03 underdog is leading the race","A new chapter is unfolding in the DeFi space as investors shift their focus to platforms offering real utility, sustainable income, and flexible risk exposure. With lending protocols dominating headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stepping into the spotlight as one of the most talked-about DeFi entrants of 2025. At just $0.03 per token, it is attracting investors eager to get in early before the next price jump. Phase 5 of the presale is already 50% sold out, and with a higher price coming in Phase 6, this will be the final window to secure MUTM at a discounted rate. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining crypto lending by introducing a two-pronged model that caters to both conservative capital and high-risk digital assets. With a beta platform launch scheduled for release alongside the token going live and a $100,000 giveaway rewarding early believers, Mutuum is pushing on all fronts to lead DeFi innovation this summer. Because of the utility embedded in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) many meme investors are finally waking up. After losing money to coordinated dumps or low-liquidity coins, they’re asking, “Where’s the actual value?” That’s where Mutuum Finance steps in. It’s not just a token—it’s a fully audited DeFi platform that pays users to lend and hold. Early-phase buyers from $0.01 to $0.03 have seen up to 3x profits, and with beta launching soon and exchange listings expected, the next wave of serious investors is now watching MUTM for at least 100% gain from here. P2C or P2P? Mutuum lets you choose Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will operate through two core models—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—providing unmatched lending flexibility. The P2C model will target blue-chip assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Users will deposit these tokens into audited smart contracts, generating mtTokens in return. These yield-bearing mtTokens will accumulate interest and can later be redeemed for the original assets plus earnings, subject to liquidity. Interest rates will be automatically adjusted based on pool utilization, rewarding suppliers when demand rises. As usage increases, lenders will see their returns climb, establishing a self-balancing cycle that ensures capital efficiency and protocol health. Meanwhile, Mutuum’s P2P model will serve more speculative tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). Here, lenders and borrowers will set custom terms, including interest rates and loan durations. With no shared pool, lenders can charge higher rates in exchange for taking on more risk. This model expands lending access for non-traditional assets while preserving P2C liquidity by isolating volatility. Both lending formats will be overcollateralized and governed by a Stability Factor metric to protect all positions. If the collateral value dips too low, the system will automatically initiate liquidation, safeguarding lender funds and keeping the ecosystem solvent. Why investors are jumping on MUTM at $0.03 MUTM isn’t just another utility token. It will serve as the backbone of the Mutuum ecosystem, powering staking rewards and protocol revenue redistributions. Users who stake mtTokens in designated contracts will receive MUTM dividends when the platform performs buybacks using revenue from loan interest. This system will directly link token demand to platform usage, locking in real yield for long-term supporters. Layer-2 infrastructure will further enhance Mutuum’s offering by delivering fast, cost-efficient transactions. The integration of a decentralized stablecoin—minted only through overcollateralized borrowing—will inject even more stability and capital efficiency. As borrowers repay or get liquidated, the stablecoin supply will shrink automatically, reducing risk and supporting peg maintenance. Governance will dynamically control borrowing interest rates, ensuring that price fluctuations are managed without relying on external parties. As the roadmap progresses toward the beta launch, over 12,450 holders have already joined the ecosystem. With more than $11.2 million raised, audit scores from CertiK that include a 95.00 Token Scan and 76.50 Skynet Score, and an engaged 10K+ Twitter following, momentum is building fast. The giveaway—offering ten early participants $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each—adds even more urgency to act now. MUTM is not just a presale token; it’s a full-fledged DeFi engine in the making. Those who move early stand to gain not only from the launch itself but from continued income through dividends, platform rewards, and sustained ecosystem growth. The $0.03 price tag won’t last long, and with the next phase around the corner, the summer of 2025 will belong to Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

Accordingly, Bakkt may purchase Bitcoin (BTC) after the $1 billion shelf offer is presented. At this point, Bakkt aims to raise up to $1 billion through various securities issuances that can be used to finance the purchase of Bitcoin. Since Bakkt has filed Form S-3 with the SEC to issue securities in one or more issues, with the number, price and terms determined at the time of the issuance, with the total issuance not to exceed $1 billion. This process, called shelf registration, allows Bakkt to quickly issue bonds and buy Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies with them when the right conditions are met. “…We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources…” Bakkt’s move comes after it updated its investment policy earlier this month to allow it to buy BTC and other cryptocurrencies. Bakkt announced that its board of directors had approved a plan to invest in cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. However, Bakkt has not yet purchased or announced any Bitcoin or other digital assets under its updated investment policy. *This is not investment advice.

Since April 1, the market leader has climbed 30.2 % , buoyed by a 14.2 % gain in April, an 11.1 % jump in May, and a further 2.6 % rise so far in June. The rally carried price from $104,544 at the start of the month to about $107,370 today, briefly tagging new cycle highs near $107 K. Period Price Change April 2025 +14.2 % May 2025 +11.1 % June-to-date +2.6 % Q2-to-date +30.2 % Crypto Market Today Spot price drifts into Thursday night. A slow slide toward $102 K would hint that option sellers are steering the market. Liquidity at $105 K. A gap in buy orders below that level raises the odds of a swift downdraft. Post-expiry snap-back. Once $15 B in hedges disappear, a sudden volatility spike up or down is common. Friday’s $15 B Options Expiry According to Deribit’s Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David Pequignot , one of the year’s biggest expiries hits the tape this Friday. Roughly $15.2 B in BTC options 38 % of the entire $40 B open interest, will settle at once. The “max-pain” level, where the highest number of contracts expire worthless, sits at $102,000 . Prices often drift toward this magnet because market makers who sell options profit most if Bitcoin lands there at expiry. Sentiment and Volatility Tell a Mixed Story Options data still leans cautiously bullish: Put/Call ratio: 0.73 , meaning there are 73 puts for every 100 calls—more calls signal an upside tilt. Implied volatility: down sharply from 50 % to 38 % , suggesting traders expect smaller price swings in the near term. Yet those expectations can change quickly when billions in contracts roll off. $105 K: The Line in the Sand Technical traders are laser-focused on $105,000 . It has acted as first-line support throughout June: Hold above $105 K: Bulls retain control; a post-expiry relief rally toward $110 K or higher stays on the table. Break below $105 K: Sentiment could flip in a hurry, with price gravitating toward the $102 K max-pain zone and triggering a cascade of stop-loss orders. Bottom Line Bitcoin’s 30 % quarter has impressed even hardened bulls, but the real test comes with Friday’s mega-expiry. Stay alert, whether BTC defends $105 K or succumbs to max-pain gravity will likely set the tone for the rest of the summer.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-news-today-fridays-bitcoin-ethereum-options-expiry-could-trigger-a-volatility-storm/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T08:03:22,"Bitcoin is the sixth-largest asset worldwide","The top digital currency, Bitcoin, surpassed Google in market capitalization and is currently the sixth-largest asset worldwide. Bitcoin is now valued at $2.128 trillion, beating Google at only $2.075 trillion, and ranking just below Gold, Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. BTC’s growing adoption has contributed to the rise in its market cap Bitcoin saw its market cap rise following the massive institutional adoption after the launch of spot ETFs . The US Securities and Exchange Commission’s ETF approval triggered significant capital inflows from institutional players worldwide. As of June 9, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest BTC exchange-traded fund on the market, had pulled in over $70 billion in t otal assets, growing more quickly than any other ETF. Fidelity’s FBTC ranked second with $20 billion, and Grayscale’s GBTC came in third with just under $20 billion. President Donald Trump’s support for Bitcoin has propelled the asset’s status and driven adoption. During his campaign days, he hinted at a Bitcoin reserve, which he signed an executive order on when he assumed office. He also signed an executive order to establish a digital asset stockpile. Analysts now believe BTC could easily surpass $200,000 in the next few years. If this growth trend continues, Bitcoin could approach—or even overtake—Microsoft and Nvidia, and become the largest asset of all time, especially if the US maintains a pro-Bitcoin approach. In the Bitcoin Magazine podcast in April, Zach Shapiro, the head of policy for the Bitcoin-focused BPI think tank, argued that a US government purchase of 1 million BTC would significantly affect the asset’s price. He said, “If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoins, that’s just a global seismic shock. I think first, Bitcoin price goes through the roof. I think we’d probably go very quickly to something like a million dollars per Bitcoin.” BPI executive director Matthew Hines also claimed that other countries are watching closely to see how the US approaches Bitcoin before shaping their policies. Hines added that the Trump administration’s desire to make the US the BTC superpower will hinge on how much Bitcoin they’ll hold. The UK’s CMA is investigating Alphabet, focusing on Google’s search and ad services Alphabet is grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny, antitrust probes, and a dip in its digital ad earnings. The company is also dealing with fierce competition from its AI-focused rivals, threatening to upend the dominance of AI-driven ad tools like Performance Max and its generative search summaries. Google is still under antitrust investigations in the UK and the EU. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is currently reviewing Google’s search and advertising services under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 to determine whether the company should be granted Strategic Market Status (SMS). The CMA’s roadmap includes early priorities such as requiring choice screens for users to access various search providers, ensuring fair ranking principles for businesses, enhancing publishers’ content transparency, and enabling consumer data portability to foster innovation. Meanwhile, the European Union is also looking into AI overviews under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), claiming they favor Google-owned content and divert traffic from third-party websites. According to an Ahrefs study, AI overviews caused nearly a 35% dip in organic website clicks, possibly lowering publishers’ ad revenue. If the EU finds fault with AI overviews and Google, the tech giant could be penalized and obliged to pay fines. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The investment was confirmed in a joint statement by Aqua 1 and World Liberty Financial, highlighting the collaboration as a step towards developing a blockchain financial ecosystem and integrating stablecoins. World Liberty Financial Partners With Aqua 1 Zak Folkman, co-founder of World Liberty Financial, expressed enthusiasm about the partnership, stating, “We’re excited to work hand-in-hand with the team at Aqua 1.” This investment positions Aqua 1 among the largest stakeholders in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency project. It is further strengthened by the backing of crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is the top investor in the company with a substantial $75 million stake. Related Reading: XRP Gears Up For Major Move — Chart Signals Are Clear This marks the second investment from a UAE-based firm in World Liberty Financial within a short span; earlier this year, Abu Dhabi’s MGX used World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance. David Lee, a founding partner at Aqua 1, stated that Aqua 1 and the decentralized platform will collaborate to “identify and nurture promising blockchain projects.” World Liberty Financial also plans to support the Aqua Fund, an investment vehicle focused on enhancing the digital economy in the Middle East. In addition, Aqua 1 will aid World Liberty Financial in expanding its reach into South America, Europe, Asia, and emerging markets. Both companies are also set to develop “BlockRock,” a platform aimed at tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs) to bridge traditional investments like real estate with the Web3 ecosystem. New App Launch Planned In tandem with these initiatives, World Liberty Financial is preparing to release an audit report of its stablecoin, USD1, within days. Folkman, speaking at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn, New York, also mentioned that the platform’s WLFI token may soon become tradable. Launched two months prior to the US presidential election, WLFI has already generated substantial revenue for Trump’s family business through the sale of governance tokens. These tokens grant holders the ability to vote on project changes and influence its strategic direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Top In? Bitcoin MVRV-Score Has The Answer While WLFI is currently not tradable, Folkman hinted at forthcoming updates that users should watch for in the coming weeks.

To further facilitate user engagement, Folkman announced the upcoming launch of a new app designed to simplify cryptocurrency use for everyday investors.

Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Explodes in Charts, Injecting FOMO Into the Meme Coin Market June 27, 2025 • 08:46 UTC Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) surged by 68% in charts , over the last 24 hours, following the news about the ceasefire between Israel and Iran, which triggered a visible response in the crypto market as a whole. Bitcoin itself peaked at $108K during the same period, but couldn’t match $WEPE’s pump. $WEPE’s performance is even more impressive if we consider that the crypto market lost steam, during the last 24 hours, with $WEPE being among the only tokens to stay in the green. Coming from a meme coin, this type of performance could rejuvenate the meme market, with utility-based meme coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) reaping most of the benefits. $SNORT’s presale is garnering a lot of attention thanks to the Snorter Bot, the Telegram-based Aardvark sniper which scouts the crypto market for hot tokens.

Bakkt Fills an S-3 ‘Shelf’ Registration, $1B to Build a $BTC Treasury & Fuel Meme Coin Growth June 27, 2025 • 07:57 UTC Bakkt, the publicly traded crypto custody and rewards company has a pre-approved credit line after it filled an S-3 ‘shelf’ registration with the U.S. SEC on June 26. The company can now tap the market through multiple equity and debt offerings. These can strengthen its balance sheet while also letting it rebrand to a Bitcoin-powered treasury, just like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet. With more listed entities holding $BTC, the SEC and US lawmakers have more incentive to pay more attention to digital assets. This could mean increased compliance costs… or it can also mean more adoption pathways, such as crypto potentially becoming eligible for mortgage applications . Either way, we’re experiencing historic flight-to-quality assets, and having a BTC treasury nowadays is the ultimate sign of long-term thinking. While institutions continue to focus on hard-cap assets, retail will undoubtedly look for on-chain entertainment with the hottest meme coins and 1000x plays. In this respect, crypto initiatives that cover both aspects, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will likely stand to gain a lot from the added visibility and Bitcoin-utility play. Find out what is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER).

What Next?","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. A measure of XRP's XRP price volatility has crashed to the lowest level since President Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. elections in November. Still, it's not yet at the level which has historically presaged strong directional trends. XRP's 30-day annualized realized volatility, a measure of how volatile prices have been over the past four weeks, recently dropped to 44%, the lowest since early November, according to data source TradingView. The decline marks a sharp slide from highs above 150% registered in December and March. The volatility meltdown follows boring price action in the XRP market. This despite the debut of XRP futures on the CME, several issuers applying for spot XRP ETFs and overall positive regulatory developments for the crypto industry under Trump's presidency. Since March, XRP has primarily traded back and forth between $2 and $2.60, barring the occasional short-lived dips below $2. XRP is the payments-focused cryptocurrency used by fintech company Ripple to facilitate cross-border transactions. The price action is consistent with that of bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, which has mostly traded between $100,000 and $110,000 for almost 50 consecutive days. What next? Volatility is mean-reverting, which means that, over time, it tends to fluctuate around its long-term average. In other words, a sharp rise in volatility often paves the way for consolidation, and a prolonged drop in volatility usually sets the stage for strong directional trends. That said, the 30-day realized volatility is still well above the 15% to 30% range, which has marked volatility bottoms and renewed price turbulence since 2014.

2025-06-27T07:40:08,"Tense Wait for $17 Billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum! How Will It Affect BTC and ETH Prices? Here's All You Need to Know…","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) rose from $100,000 at the beginning of the week to over $108,000 with news of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Unable to hold on here, BTC continues to move sideways at the $107,000 level, while today, as every Friday, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come. These options are even more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to the data, $15 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $2.29 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on June 27 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.75, the maximum loss point is $ 102,000 and the notional value is $ 15 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.52, a maximum loss point of $2,200, and a notional value of $2.29 billion. The maximum pain point is the level at which the price of a cryptocurrency settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin prices as the $15 billion options expiration on June 27th. While the maximum pain point is at $102,000 for BTC and $2,200 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. This means that a large portion of investors are in profit. This may lead some investors to realize their profits and increase volatility in prices. Evaluating the options data on Bitcoin, Deribit Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen stated that the ratio of put and call options started to increase and reached 0.75. So, this means that while the number of call options is ultimately greater, the number of put options has also started to increase in recent days. Lin Chen said that this situation is not only due to the expectation of a decline, but also because investors are looking for opportunities to buy at the bottom in case of a possible decline: “The increase in put options does not mean that investors expect a decline in Bitcoin. Investors are acting strategically. Traders are taking positions either to sell put options and earn premium or to avoid being left out in the face of a possible decline and to buy BTC at the bottom.” *This is not investment advice.

Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) believes that owning 0.1 Bitcoin might one day be more valuable than owning a home in the U.S. He shared this bold opinion after a major announcement from U.S. housing officials that could allow Bitcoin to be used as a financial reserve when applying for a mortgage. For CZ, this signals a shift in what the American Dream might look like in the future. Bitcoin for Mortgages? A Big Step Forward On June 26, CZ responded to a post by William J. Pulte, Director at the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), who revealed that the housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been asked to prepare proposals for integrating crypto into mortgage qualifications. The ultimate purpose is to allow borrowers to use Bitcoin holdings as proof of financial reserves, something that until now was strictly limited to fiat-based assets like savings, investment accounts, or retirement funds. New Rules, New Opportunities If accepted, the change could redefine how Americans qualify for mortgages, particularly by broadening access for crypto holders. But there are rules: crypto holdings would need to be verifiable, stored on U.S.-regulated exchanges, and subject to risk-based discounts due to volatility. The FHFA sees this move as a way to modernize borrower assessments and bring crypto into the fold of mainstream financial tools. [post_titles_links postid=”475475″] Crypto Reaction CZ applauded the development, calling it a “great step” and boldly claiming that the new American Dream will soon be about owning 0.1 BTC, not just property. The comment sparked wide debate on X, with supporters praising the institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and skeptics warning about crypto’s unpredictable price swings. While some cheered the move like CZ, This is a big step starting an important conversation. @Pulte is the US Director of Federal Housing FHFA. Bitcoin as pristine collateral will make more and more sense to the right people. Imagine your mortgage payment going down overtime naturally. #Bitcoin $MSTR pic.twitter.com/a1s5ffAqvC — AngryBuhda (@AngryBuhda) June 24, 2025 Adding to this, one crypto user has pointed out that under the previous FHFA leadership, Fannie Mae covered mortgage payments even when homeowners defaulted, and no one questioned that policy at the time. With that financial burden set to surface between August and October, the analyst argues that Pulte is simply trying to keep housing transactions alive with the tools he has. This move could be a big moment for the crypto industry in America.

2025-06-27T07:16:23,"Three reasons why Wormhole could be gearing up for a major rally","Wormhole’s token W is showing early signs of a bullish reversal as its ecosystem continues to gain popularity among major players. According to data from crypto.news, Wormhole ( W ) was exchanging hands at $0.0631, last check June 27, with a market cap of over $293 million. The token remains down more than 80% from its year-to-date high of $0.317. This dramatic drop has left nearly 96% of holders underwater, creating sustained selling pressure as investors try to reduce losses, data from IntoTheBlock shows. Wormhole’s losses also come as it faces heavy competition from other major players in the interoperability space, like Cosmos and Polkadot. Despite months of falling prices, a series of emerging catalysts could finally mark the end of Wormhole’s market downturn and signal a potential bullish reversal in the coming weeks. First, Wormhole has recently partnered with Ripple to bring multichain support to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple’s new EVM-compatible sidechain. The integration will allow both networks to interface with over 35 blockchains, significantly expanding their interoperability capabilities. This enhanced connectivity could increase cross-chain activity via Wormhole, which may, in turn, drive higher demand for the W token. You might also like: Bakkt files to raise $1B with plans to allocate funds to Bitcoin Second, crypto exchange Coinbase has recently added Wormhole to its listing roadmap. A potential listing on a top-tier platform like Coinbase often serves as a major catalyst for market interest, typically boosting liquidity, visibility, and stirring demand from investors. If confirmed, the spot listing could drive renewed hype and upward price momentum for the W token in the near term. Third, Wormhole appears to be in the process of forming a double-bottom pattern on the daily chart, a classic bullish reversal structure often observed at the end of sustained downtrends. The two lows of the pattern are forming around the $0.05 level, while the neckline resistance sits at approximately $0.117. W 1-day price chart — June 27 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators like the MACD line have crossed above its signal line, while the Relative Strength Index is trending upward, both suggesting growing bullish momentum. W MACD and RSI chart — June 27 | Source: crypto.news If Wormhole continues along this trajectory and successfully completes the pattern, it is likely to retest the neckline by late August. A confirmed breakout above the neckline, particularly with rising volume, would validate the pattern and signal a shift in market structure. Such a breakout could open the door for a rally toward the $0.20 psychological resistance level, which would represent a gain of over 200% from current prices. However, if Wormhole fails to hold the $0.05 support, the double-bottom setup would be invalidated. A breakdown below this key psychological level, particularly if accompanied by rising sell volume, could accelerate downward pressure and push the token toward $0.04, marking a new local low.

The US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey says Jhonnatan Steven Rodriguez, 32, of Naples, Florida, has pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of bribes by a bank employee and one count of making false bank entries. The crimes occurred when Rodriguez worked for TD Bank. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a fine of up to $1 million. “In late 2022, Rodriguez began opening bank accounts for unknown individuals in exchange for bribes of approximately $200 to $250 per account. During the scheme, Rodriguez accepted bribes in exchange for fraudulently opening approximately 140 bank accounts, some of which were used for fraud. In carrying out this bribery scheme, Rodriguez would often forge the purported customers’ signatures on account opening documents. To protect his identity, Rodriguez used the alias ‘Jorge’ on a text messaging app to communicate with the individuals seeking bank accounts.” According to prosecutors, Rodriguez opened multiple accounts for several people. “For example, one individual sent Rodriguez 25 payments totaling $6,335 in exchange for opening multiple TD Bank accounts. Similarly, on or about December 17, 2022, another individual sent Rodriguez $1,050 in exchange for opening multiple TD Bank accounts.” Rodriguez is due back in federal court on November 25th for sentencing.

2025-06-27T07:00:52,"Bitcoin Next Price Discovery Coming? Analyst Shares BTC’s 2025 Roadmap","This week, Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered from its recent drop below the $100,000 level and is attempting to turn the crucial $108,000 resistance into support for the fourth time. As we approach the second half of 2025, a market watcher has shared his forecast for BTC. Related Reading: Solana Price At ‘A Very Delicate Level’ – Analyst Says $148 Reclaim Is Key Bitcoin Sees Transitional Period On Thursday, analyst Rekt Capital shared a roadmap for BTC for the rest of the year. He noted that this cycle has been “truly a cycle of re-accumulation ranges,” explaining that these have formed throughout the cycle since the end of 2022 and evolved since the Bitcoin Halving last year. In the pre-having period, BTC registered brief price deviations with downside wicks below the re-accumulation range lows in the weekly chart. Meanwhile, the post-halving period has seen Bitcoin deviations occur with multi-week clusters of full-bodied candles below the range lows. For instance, after its first price discovery uptrend, which lasted around seven weeks, BTC moved within its re-accumulation range for about ten weeks. Then, it transitioned into the first Price Discovery Correction, recording a nine-week downside deviation below the range lows before breaking out and rallying past the range highs toward a new ATH last month. Its past performances suggested that BTC was ready to enter its second Price Discovery Uptrend. But as Rekt Capital detailed, a transitional period has occurred for the first time, with price consolidating around the re-accumulation range high area. According to the analyst, this is “perhaps the first time that we’re seeing a deviation occur below the range high,” making this area a crucial level to transition into a new uptrend. We never really had to pull back substantially, maybe, until that final corrective period, which would last multiple months, but each re-accumulation range would see quite a bit of upside, and that upside would be very quick and no real post-breakout retesting, no real pausing. What we’re seeing here is something very, very different. Weekly Close Key For BTC’s Future Based on its new transition period, the key level for Bitcoin to reclaim in the weekly timeframe is the $104,400 support, which it held for nearly seven weeks before the recent pullbacks. This level was lost after BTC closed last week below it and “should not become a resistance level.” To the analyst, it’s key that this week’s close solidifies the price recovery as it would position the cryptocurrency for a retest and confirmation of $104,400 as support and continue the build the base around this area to transition into the next multi-week Price Discovery Uptrend. Rekt Capital added that the timeline for BTC’s next uptrend will depend on the length of the new transitional period. However, he believes that it will take “a bit longer” to break out. Related Reading: Injective Prepares For Bullish Reversal Amid 25% Recovery – Analyst Forecasts Massive Breakout Additionally, he suggested that what comes after the upcoming uptrend will also depend on how long it takes, as it could lead to an extended cycle or a prolongation of this phase, which could push the cycle peak into deeper stages of 2025. Nonetheless, the analyst affirmed that it’s crucial that the next corrective period, which could see Bitcoin drop between 25% to 33%, is short to potentially enjoy a third Price Discovery Uptrend before the bear market. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $107,555, a 3.2% increase in the weekly timeframe.

Amonyx (@amonbuy), a popular figure in the crypto space, shared footage featuring Ben Armstrong, widely known as BitBoy, claiming that XRP will soon flip Bitcoin. This is not the first time Armstrong has expressed this view, but the timing of his latest remarks has intensified interest in whether such a scenario is realistic. Armstrong has supported XRP for years and is one of the most prominent voices in the crypto space who can see the asset’s true potential. He has often cited the asset’s utility and regulatory clarity as catalysts for growth. With institutional adoption on the rise and the Ripple lawsuit nearing its end, XRP seems to be on the verge of a massive rally. BitBoy says #XRP will FLIP #Bitcoin SOON! pic.twitter.com/kcGNCf8PFu — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 25, 2025 The Path to the Number One Spot Bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency, has always held the top position in market cap since its creation in 2009. For XRP to surpass Bitcoin, it would require an extraordinary increase in both price and overall adoption. XRP is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the market and the third-largest non-stablecoin. The asset has consistently outperformed Ethereum in 2025, and many experts, including Bitboy, believe Ethereum won’t hold its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency for much longer. Surpassing Ethereum would put XRP head-to-head with Bitcoin in a battle for the top spot in the crypto market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Can XRP Flip Bitcoin? The belief that XRP could achieve this is rooted in its design and use case. Unlike Bitcoin, which operates primarily as a store of value, XRP is designed for payments, offering fast and low-cost transactions. XRP’s consensus mechanism also allows for greater scalability compared to Bitcoin’s, and it is significantly more energy efficient . Experts have frequently pointed to XRP’s growing role in cross-border settlements and partnerships with financial institutions as a reason to be bullish. These fundamentals give XRP a path toward mainstream financial adoption at a scale that Bitcoin may not achieve. A closer look at both assets’ performance also shows that XRP has provided greater returns as it has risen by 490% since 2022 , while BTC has only grown by around 10%. However, XRP has a large gap to close if it plans to surpass Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $2.14 trillion, with the asset controlling almost 65% of the entire market. XRP has a market cap of just $129.08 billion, but this has not discouraged Bitboy or other advocates who believe XRP can achieve this feat.

2025-06-27T06:48:39,"Doge ETF inches toward approval as Bitwise updates filing","The proposed spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund ETF may be gaining ground, as growing engagement between issuers and regulators boosts hopes for approval. According to recent filings , Bitwise Asset Management has submitted amended applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for its proposed spot Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Aptos ( APT ) ETFs. Bitwise was one of the first firms to file for a Dogecoin ETF in January, and the amendments come as engagement continues between issuers and the regulatory commission over the proposals. The updated filings also follow the SEC’s recent decision to delay its review of Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF, citing the need for more time to assess whether the product meets legal standards. A key change in the revised proposals is the addition of “in-kind” creation and redemption mechanisms, a feature absent in the original filings. This change allows ETF shares to be exchanged directly for the underlying crypto asset, which can improve tax efficiency and reduce market impact. You might also like: Why “there’s not going to be enough Bitcoin” according to Bitwise CEO Commenting on the amended filings, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the updates as a positive sign, noting they reflect growing momentum around spot crypto ETFs.

In a recent press release , Bit Digital announced that it will be issuing 75 million shares at $2 each, with an additional 11.25 million shares available to underwriters via a 30-day option. In total, the public offering will be enough to raise $150 million in capital. The offering is set to close on June 27 and will be subjected to “satisfaction of customary closing conditions.” According to the company’s statement, the funds generated from the public offering will be used to buy Ethereum ( ETH ) in order to accelerate building an ETH treasury. The company describes itself as a “digital asset platform focused on Ethereum-native treasury and staking strategies.” This marks one of the largest public ETH treasury commitments to date. Not only that, it also marks the company’s first major pivot from Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining as it attempts to fully transition towards Ethereum staking and building a dedicated ETH treasury.

Key Takeaways: A UAE firm has invested $100 million in WLFI, surpassing Justin Sun as the largest holder. The deal aims to boost WLFI’s efforts in tokenizing real-world assets and expanding stablecoin use. Trump family ties to WLFI continue to draw political scrutiny amid growing concerns over foreign influence. In a joint announcement on Thursday, World Liberty Financial and the Aqua1 Foundation described the deal as a strategic move to accelerate the development of a blockchain ecosystem focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, stablecoin infrastructure, and decentralized finance. UAE Firm Aqua1 Becomes Largest WLFI Holder, Overtakes Justin Sun The announcement positions Aqua1, a self-described Web3-native fund, as a major WLFI stakeholder, surpassing Tron founder Justin Sun, who committed $30 million to the project last November. “Aqua1 and WLFI will work together to identify and support blockchain projects with transformative potential,” said Dave Lee, founding partner at Aqua1. He emphasized WLFI’s vision for integrating traditional finance with blockchain protocols, calling it “a trillion-dollar pivot opportunity.” The investment marks another high-profile link between the Trump family and international crypto dealings. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by President Trump’s three sons, has already drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. President Trump disclosed $57.4 million in income tied to WLFI and holds 15.75 billion of the platform’s governance tokens, according to recent filings. Back in May, Eric Trump sparked criticism when he revealed that Abu Dhabi-based MGX planned to use WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance. That announcement came just as U.S. lawmakers ramped up discussions on new rules governing payment stablecoins. The overlap between legislative developments and the Trump family’s crypto business has raised red flags among some members of Congress. During a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing this week, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to comment directly when pressed by Senator Jeff Merkley on the president’s involvement with World Liberty Financial . Merkley warned against foreign influence in American policymaking. “I think it’s important for the leader of the Justice Department of the United States to be very concerned about foreign influence,” he said. “Americans should make American decisions — not have them bought through crypto coins.” Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative.

The analyst, who was known for his bearish statements for a long time in the past, but made bullish statements after the increase in the Bitcoin price reached a level that could no longer be denied, turned bearish again after the latest developments. In his latest statement, il Capo claimed that many altcoins have already regressed to their former ranges following their recent “dead cat bounce” movement and that much lower prices are likely.

2025-06-27T06:09:32,"Bakkt files to raise $1B with plans to allocate funds to Bitcoin","Bakkt Holdings Inc. has disclosed plans to raise $1 billion through a mixed securities offering and use the proceeds to fund Bitcoin buys. According to the crypto software firm’s June 26 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the offering will include any combination of Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or units. The Form S-3 shelf registration enables Bakkt to issue these securities in one or more tranches over time, depending on market conditions. Bakkt may allocate proceeds from future equity or debt financings into Bitcoin or other digital assets. While no purchases have been made yet, Bakkt said its updated investment policy now permits such acquisitions as part of its broader treasury strategy. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our Investment Policy,” Bakkt noted in the filing. The filing also noted that the timing and scale of any crypto asset acquisition will depend on business performance, market conditions, capital availability, and strategic priorities. The firm is exploring various financing options, including convertible notes or bonds, to support these plans.

The pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy aligns Bakkt with a growing trend among corporates and public entities allocating reserves into digital assets. The decision may be an attempt to revitalise investor confidence and strengthen the firm’s long-term positioning in the crypto sector. Bakkt shares rose 3% on Thursday to $13.33, but the stock remains down 46% year-to-date. The firm has been under pressure since March, when its shares plunged 30% after revealing that Bank of America and Webull, two of its largest clients, would not renew their commercial agreements. The latest development also comes after a turbulent year, as Bakkt reported heavy losses and flagged concerns over its ability to continue operations without fresh capital . As previously reported by crypto.news, the Trump Media & Technology Group was reportedly in “advanced talks” to acquire Bakkt was apparently in advanced talks to acquire Bakkt. However, no agreement was finalized, and the status of the negotiations remains unclear.

2025-06-27T06:00:48,"Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Shoots Up: Warning For BTC?","Data shows the Bitcoin Open Interest on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance has recently shot up. What could this mean for the asset’s price? Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Has Seen A Sharp Increase As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Open Interest on Binance has spiked. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC positions that are currently open on a given derivatives platform. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. As the total amount of leverage present in the sector rises when new positions appear, this kind of trend can lead to the asset’s price becoming more volatile. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Since leverage goes down with such a trend, the cryptocurrency can become more stable following it. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-hour percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest for the Binance exchange over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the 24-hour change in the Binance Bitcoin Open Interest recently shot up to a notably positive value, implying the number of positions on the platform saw a significant jump. At the peak of this spike, the indicator hit a value of more than 6%. From the chart, it’s visible that there have been a couple of other occasions that the metric has breached this mark during the past month. Interestingly, each of these spikes coincided with points that preceded a period of consolidation/decline for Bitcoin. As the quant notes, This recurring pattern suggests that large inflows into leveraged positions often precede periods where short-term gains are realized, leading to potential price pullbacks or sideways movement as market participants de-risk. The analyst has also shared another chart, this one tracking the 7-day change in the Realized Cap of the short-term holders and long-term holders. The “Realized Cap” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the capital that the holders have invested into Bitcoin. Below is a chart that shows the change in this metric for two investor cohorts, short-term holders (holding time of 155 days or lesser) and long-term holders (holding time greater than 155 days). As is apparent from the graph, the 7-day change in the Realized Cap has recently been positive for long-term holders, which suggests capital has been maturing from the short-term holders into this cohort. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ That said, earlier in the month, the indicator hit a peak of $57 billion, but today it has come down to just $3.5 billion. So, while capital is still aging into long-term holders, it’s now happening at a much slower rate. BTC Price Bitcoin has been attempting to break past the $108,000 mark, but so far, it hasn’t found success as its price is still trading around $107,200.

2025-06-27T05:58:13,"Crypto Exchange Bakkt Files for $1B Shelf Offering, Plans to Buy Bitcoin","Crypto marketplace Bakkt has filed for a $1 billion shelf registration with the SEC to raise capital, potentially to fund Bitcoin acquisitions under its updated treasury strategy. The shelf offering could include sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, bonds, warrants, and debt securities. This strategy allows for flexible capital raising, without the need for a separate registration every time. Per the S-3 registration , filed on Thursday, the proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Under the newly updated investment policy , a portion of it could be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our investment policy,” it read. According to the SEC filing, the firm has not yet made any Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, Bakkt intends to explore further financing alternatives, including the issuance of convertible notes, bonds, to purchase Bitcoin. Bakkt’s Latest Crypto Treasury Plans Bakkt announced on June 10 that it will allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin and other “top-tier” cryptocurrencies. This aligns with its view in crypto as a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. The firm, founded in 2018, is also actively evaluating global jurisdictions to deploy these strategies. Besides, the timing and magnitude of Bitcoin purchases will depend on market conditions, capital market receptivity and business performance. “This initiative is intended to support Bakkt’s transformation into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company and to enable us to strategically add Bitcoin and other digital assets to our treasury,” said Akshay Naheta, Co-CEO of Bakkt, at the time. Bakkt Warns Regulatory Uncertainty, Evolving Crypto Rules The filing stated risk disclosures, warning of regulatory uncertainties, potential security classification of crypto, and banking access disruptions. Bakkt admitted that it had a “limited operating history and a history of operating losses.” Last year, the company said it was concerned about its operational viability in 2025, owing to inadequate cash reserves. ICE-Backed Bakkt Alerts of Possible Closure, Cites Cash Crisis @Bakkt , the cryptocurrency platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has issued a warning about its financial health. #CryptoNews #news https://t.co/xGlJcXaB9F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 8, 2024 The filing also specifically warned about future operations, where it “identified conditions and events that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” In March 2025, the firm’s shares tanked 27% , after two major clients, Bank of America and Webull, had withdrawn their ties with Bakkt. Following the announcement of the shelf offering on Thursday, the company’s shares surged over 3% and is now trading at $13.33, according to Google Finance.
