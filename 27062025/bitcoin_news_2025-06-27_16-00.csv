2025-06-27T13:53:31,"Bakkt Files $1Bn Shelf Offering, Considers Bitcoin for Treasury Reserves","Bakkt Holdings has filed for a $1 billion shelf offering with the SEC, indicating plans to acquire Bitcoin as part of its expanded treasury strategy. Bakkt Moves Toward Direct Bitcoin Investment Publicly traded digital asset platform Bakkt Holdings has filed a $1 billion shelf registration with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), marking a pivotal step in its strategic pivot toward cryptocurrency treasury allocations. The filing, submitted on June 26, 2025, grants Bakkt the authority to sell a range of securities, including Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt instruments, and warrants in one or more future offerings. This development follows a policy revision earlier this month, enabling Bakkt to invest directly in Bitcoin and other digital assets. While the company has not disclosed any purchases yet, the filing confirms it could use proceeds from this shelf offering to fund crypto acquisitions. In its prospectus, the company stated, “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources.” Strategic Pivot and Business Headwinds A subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange, Bakkt has navigated a challenging year. In March 2025, the company announced it was losing major clients, Bank of America and Webull, triggering a 30% decline in its share price. Further complicating matters, Bakkt disclosed in the filing that its loyalty services segment faces possible divestiture as it sharpens its focus on crypto infrastructure offerings. Bakkt’s revised investment policy is part of a broader repositioning. Co-CEO Akshay Naheta described the plan as a move to “transform Bakkt into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company.” The strategy also includes partnerships, such as a March agreement with Distributed Technologies Research Global Ltd. to enhance crypto payment-processing capabilities. Regulatory Risks and Market Positioning The SEC filing outlines extensive risk factors, with regulatory uncertainty remaining a significant concern. Bakkt warned that evolving legal frameworks, potential classification of digital assets as securities, and disruptions to banking services could materially affect operations. The company also flagged cybersecurity threats and operational complexities in integrating new digital assets. If Bakkt proceeds with a Bitcoin allocation, it would join an expanding list of public firms adding crypto to their balance sheets. At Bitcoin’s current price of $106,800, a full $1 billion investment would secure approximately 9,364 BTC, positioning Bakkt just ahead of Coinbase on the list of top publicly traded Bitcoin holders. Following news of the shelf offering, Bakkt’s Class A shares (NYSE: BKKT) rose 3% to $13.33 on Thursday. However, the stock remains down 46% year-to-date.

2025-06-27T13:50:53,"Belgravia Hartford Propels Strategic Bitcoin Investment with Second $1M Drawdown","BitcoinWorld Belgravia Hartford Propels Strategic Bitcoin Investment with Second $1M Drawdown The world of digital assets continues to attract significant institutional interest, and a recent move by Belgravia Hartford Capital underscores this growing trend. This publicly traded Canadian investment firm has just announced a pivotal step in its strategic foray into the cryptocurrency market: the completion of a second $1 million drawdown specifically earmarked for acquiring Bitcoin. Belgravia Hartford’s Bold Move: A Deeper Dive into Institutional Bitcoin Investment Belgravia Hartford Capital, a name increasingly recognized in the Canadian investment landscape, is making headlines once again with its proactive approach to digital asset integration. Their latest announcement details the completion of a second $1 million drawdown, a clear signal of their ongoing commitment to the Bitcoin market. This isn’t just a one-off purchase; it’s part of a larger, carefully planned strategy to build a substantial Bitcoin portfolio. The funds for this significant Bitcoin investment are sourced from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund, a specialized vehicle designed to navigate the complexities of the crypto space. The firm’s decision to allocate such substantial capital towards Bitcoin highlights a growing confidence among traditional investment entities in the long-term viability and value proposition of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This strategic move by Belgravia Hartford is indicative of a broader shift, where established players are no longer just observing the crypto market but actively participating and shaping its future. Their methodical approach, utilizing regulated channels like Coinsquare’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk, further solidifies the legitimacy and maturity of the crypto ecosystem. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Work? Understanding the Mechanics For those new to institutional crypto investments, understanding the mechanics behind Belgravia Hartford’s strategy is key. This latest $1 million drawdown is not a direct purchase from an open exchange but rather a structured financing agreement. Here’s a breakdown of how this particular Bitcoin investment is executed: The Source Fund: The capital originates from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund. This fund likely pools money from various investors, including Belgravia Hartford, and specializes in digital asset strategies. The Drawdown Mechanism: A “drawdown” in this context refers to Belgravia Hartford accessing a pre-arranged line of credit or capital commitment from the Round13 fund. This particular drawdown is the second of its kind, part of a larger $5 million financing agreement. Purpose-Specific Funds: Crucially, these funds are explicitly designated for one purpose: to buy Bitcoin. This specificity ensures transparency and adherence to the investment firm’s stated digital asset strategy. Regulated Trading Desk: The actual acquisition of Bitcoin is conducted through Coinsquare’s regulated over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk. OTC desks are preferred by institutions for large volume trades as they minimize market impact and offer better pricing, often without revealing the trade size publicly. Coinsquare’s status as a regulated entity adds an extra layer of security and compliance, which is paramount for a publicly traded firm like Belgravia Hartford. Financing Terms: The financing agreement comes with a variable interest rate, which is tied to the Bank of Canada’s prime rate. This detail indicates a sophisticated financial arrangement, typical of institutional lending and borrowing, designed to manage costs effectively. This structured approach allows Belgravia Hartford to systematically accumulate Bitcoin while managing their capital exposure and leveraging established financial partnerships. It’s a testament to the increasing sophistication of how traditional finance is integrating with the digital asset space. The Significance of the Round13 Digital Asset Fund Partnership The collaboration with the Round13 Digital Asset Fund is a cornerstone of Belgravia Hartford’s strategy. This partnership is more than just a source of capital; it represents a strategic alignment with a specialized fund that understands the nuances of the cryptocurrency market. Why is this significant? Expertise and Access: Round13 Digital Asset Fund likely possesses deep expertise in crypto markets, including research, risk management, and access to unique investment opportunities that might not be readily available to traditional firms. Streamlined Acquisition: By partnering with a fund focused on digital assets, Belgravia Hartford can streamline its acquisition process, relying on Round13’s infrastructure and market connections. Risk Management: A specialized fund can offer sophisticated risk management strategies tailored for volatile crypto assets, potentially mitigating some of the inherent risks associated with direct market exposure. Scalability: The $5 million financing agreement suggests a long-term plan for substantial Bitcoin accumulation. The fund provides a scalable mechanism for Belgravia Hartford to increase its crypto holdings over time without immediate large capital outlays from its primary balance sheet. This type of partnership underscores a growing trend where traditional financial institutions are leveraging the expertise of crypto-native funds to gain exposure to digital assets, rather than building the entire infrastructure in-house. It reflects a maturing market where collaboration is key to navigating the evolving landscape. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Adoption? Belgravia Hartford’s continued commitment to Bitcoin through structured drawdowns sends a strong message about the future of institutional crypto adoption. Their actions are not isolated but fit into a broader narrative of increasing acceptance and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Here are some key implications: Validation and Legitimacy: When publicly traded firms like Belgravia Hartford allocate significant capital to Bitcoin, it lends further credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. It signals to other traditional investors that cryptocurrencies are becoming a serious component of diversified portfolios. Market Maturation: The use of regulated OTC desks and structured financing agreements, as seen with this crypto drawdown , points to the maturation of the market infrastructure. This makes it easier and safer for large institutions to participate. Diversification Strategy: For many institutional investors, Bitcoin and other digital assets represent a new frontier for diversification. They offer a potential hedge against inflation, a non-correlated asset, and exposure to a rapidly evolving technological paradigm. Belgravia Hartford’s move exemplifies this diversification play. Precedent Setting: Each major institutional entry or increased allocation sets a precedent, potentially encouraging other firms that have been on the sidelines to reconsider their stance. The domino effect of institutional crypto adoption could accelerate significantly in the coming years. The growing comfort level of these firms with the inherent volatility of crypto, coupled with their focus on long-term strategic accumulation, indicates a fundamental shift in how digital assets are perceived within the global financial system. This institutional embrace is crucial for the long-term stability and growth of the crypto market. Analyzing the Impact of this Crypto Drawdown on Market Sentiment Every significant institutional move, like Belgravia Hartford’s latest crypto drawdown , can influence market sentiment. While a single $1 million purchase might seem small in the grand scheme of Bitcoin’s multi-trillion-dollar market capitalization, its symbolic weight is considerable. What impact might this have? Positive Signal: The consistent buying pressure from institutional entities provides a positive signal to retail and other institutional investors. It suggests that “smart money” continues to see value in Bitcoin, even amidst market fluctuations. Supply Dynamics: While OTC trades don’t directly impact spot exchange prices in the same way retail trades do, they represent Bitcoin being taken off the open market and held by long-term investors. This gradual reduction in liquid supply can contribute to price appreciation over time. Increased Confidence: News of institutional accumulation often boosts overall confidence in the market, potentially attracting more capital inflows. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is an asset for the future, not just a speculative fad. Regulatory Comfort: The emphasis on regulated platforms like Coinsquare also helps to assuage concerns about regulatory uncertainty. Institutions opting for compliant channels sends a message that the industry is professionalizing. This ongoing accumulation by firms like Belgravia Hartford is a quiet but powerful force, slowly but surely absorbing Bitcoin supply and embedding it deeper into the traditional financial fabric. It’s a key indicator of Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a globally recognized and accepted store of value and investment asset. Benefits, Challenges, and Actionable Insights for Investors Belgravia Hartford’s strategy offers valuable lessons for all types of investors interested in the digital asset space. Benefits of Institutional Bitcoin Investment: Diversification: Bitcoin can offer portfolio diversification due to its relatively low correlation with traditional assets. Potential for High Returns: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Early Mover Advantage (for traditional finance): Firms entering now are positioning themselves to capitalize on the long-term growth of the digital economy. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and significant swings, posing risks for short-term investors. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can introduce unpredictability. Security Risks: While institutional platforms are robust, the digital nature of assets means security remains a paramount concern. Market Manipulation: Despite growing maturity, the crypto market can still be susceptible to large movements based on news or whale activity. Actionable Insights for Retail Investors: While most retail investors don’t have access to multi-million dollar drawdowns from digital asset funds, Belgravia Hartford’s approach provides valuable insights: Long-Term Perspective: Institutional investors often adopt a long-term “hodling” strategy. This suggests that daily price fluctuations are less important than the asset’s long-term value proposition. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): The repeated $1 million drawdowns mimic a form of dollar-cost averaging, a strategy where one invests a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This can mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak. Importance of Regulated Platforms: Belgravia Hartford uses Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk. For retail investors, this translates to choosing reputable, regulated exchanges that prioritize security and compliance. Diversification within Crypto: While Belgravia Hartford is focusing on Bitcoin, a broader crypto portfolio might include other strong projects for retail investors, though Bitcoin remains the institutional favorite. Conclusion: Belgravia Hartford’s Strategic Play Reinforces Bitcoin’s Institutional Trajectory Belgravia Hartford Capital’s latest $1 million crypto drawdown to acquire Bitcoin is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a powerful affirmation of Bitcoin’s evolving role in institutional portfolios. This strategic move, facilitated by the Round13 Digital Asset Fund and executed through Coinsquare’s regulated OTC desk, highlights a calculated and confident approach to digital asset integration. As traditional investment firms increasingly recognize the long-term value and diversification benefits of cryptocurrencies, actions like these pave the way for broader institutional crypto adoption. It signifies a future where digital assets are not just an alternative investment but a core component of sophisticated financial strategies. The steady accumulation by entities like Belgravia Hartford quietly reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a robust and legitimate asset, signaling a continued bullish outlook for its institutional trajectory.

The relisting is complementary to the company’s overall Bitcoin-driven strategy. The firm confirmed that, as of a September issue date, more than 10 million of its common stock—listed on the ticker “BTCT”—are issued and outstanding, already sold in the recent brokered offering. The $92 million gross proceeds resulted from a raise of 125 million Canadian dollars, in which BTCT sold 426,650 shares at CA$10 ($7.32) each. The shares have a four-month and one-day holding period. BTCT Buys 292.8 BTC to Power Institutional Lending Initiative BTCT has put some of the raise to use buying 292.8 BTC for around $31.5 million. It is BTCT’s first meaningful Bitcoin buy under its new lending and accumulation initiative. For BTCT, the Bitcoin will be used to offer liquidity services to clients, so it is not just an asset, but a lending and capital optimization tool. The firm will release a “Bitcoin per share” figure after acquisition period, so that shareholders will be able to get more clarity on the value of its Bitcoin holdings. Long-Term Holders Push BTC Supply to Record Levels BTCT’s strategy is part of an overall movement in the crypto space, with long-term holders not even considering selling despite recent price spikes. CryptoQuant data indicates there has been a 800,000 BTC 30-day record accumulation in wallets that have not sold since at least six months ago. CryptoQuant’s analyst Darkfost points out this as a “key signal” for sentiment, as it shows major holders are still bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term value despite institutional investors such as BTCT engaging actively in the market.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/bitcoin-treasury-corporation-relist-venture-exchange/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|Sticky|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-06-27T13:49:46,"From $98K to $108K Amid Major Geopolitical Turmoil, Bitcoin’s Doing Pretty Well: Your Weekly Crypto Recap","The past week was a wild one at the cryptocurrency market but that’s also true for legacy markets as well. This just goes to show that the mounting institutional involvement in crypto is, in part, responsible for the correlation, but that’s a topic for another discussion. Even though Bitcoin is trading almost flat on the weekly chart, the past seven days have been anything but calm. Naturally, most of the volatility had to do with the war between Iran and Israel. Around June 23rd, BTC dropped below $100K for the first time since early May, sending the markets into a state of discomfort and causing over $1 billion worth of liquidated positions. This was caused mostly because of the news that the US had decided to enter the war on the side of Israel and bomb strategic nuclear sites in Iran. The turmoil didn’t stop there, but doomsayers had it all wrong because on the very next day, the situation started de-escalating following what many believed to be a staged retaliation by Iran targeting a US base in Qatar, causing minor damage. Following this situation, US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire and despite the minor tensions, it appears that the conflict is now subdued. Markets reacted positively, with BTC rallying from the sub-$100K region to a high at around $108,000. At the time of this writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $107,000, but the majority of altcoins, as you can see in the heatmap below, took a much more considerable punch. Many of them are down between 4% and 10%, signaling, once again at Bitcoin’s unshakable dominance in the past few months. In other news, one of the more interesting developments came from Chainlink as Mastercard – one of the world’s leading payment processing companies – announced a partnership with the aims of enabling its 3 billion users to seamlessly buy crypto. This is what adoption looks like. Another are that many are monitoring closely is the legal battle between the US SEC and Ripple. A lot of people were expecting the case to officially end this week, but the presiding judge tossed the parties’ motion for indicative ruling, which means that the whole thing will be dragged out, possibly for another few months. It all depends on Ripple now. All in all, the market fared very well in the face of mounting geopolitical turmoil and economic instability, but it’s very interesting to see how things will develop in the weeks to come.

Over the past couple of weeks, market participants have sold about 720,000 BTC, the majority of which was off-loaded by relatively new holders. It’s very impressive that the market was able to absorb this quantity without falling off a cliff. Last Time Bitcoin Did This, the Price Went From $60K to $100K. The LTH/STH ratio is creeping up . This particularly positive on-chain metric has previously been the precursor to massive rallies such as the one from $28K to $60K and from $60K to $100,000.

King Karan posed a direct question to his followers, asking whether they genuinely believe that XRP could ever reach $10,000. In response, Xena XRP delivered a strong and detailed reply, asserting unwavering confidence in the future value of XRP. She emphasized that her position is not based on mere belief but on conviction grounded in past experiences and an understanding of the broader landscape. Without a doubt…and it's not a belief.

And many regret not holding a… https://t.co/DHtcauZGFt — Xena XRP (@XenaXrp) June 25, 2025 Drawing Parallels from Bitcoin and Ethereum History Xena XRP pointed out that skepticism towards XRP mirrors the same sentiment that once surrounded Bitcoin and Ethereum during their early stages. She reminded readers that when articles predicted Bitcoin reaching $1 million, critics dismissed such projections and insisted on focusing first on hitting $1,000. Today, Bitcoin trades significantly higher, and many who doubted regret not having invested earlier. Xena reflected on her own experience, sharing that she acquired Bitcoin when it was priced between $200 and $600 and Ethereum when it was just $5. At the time, many dismissed the possibility of substantial gains, yet those investments turned out to be highly rewarding. She stated that the same type of dismissive commentary now surrounds XRP, with critics frequently repeating the phrase “let’s cross all-time high first” whenever long-term price projections are discussed. Xena stressed that such thought is common among individuals who believe they have all the necessary information, but in reality, lack the full picture. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Referencing Ripple Connections and Riddles Xena XRP further explained her confidence by pointing to longstanding hints within the XRP ecosystem. She referenced the well-known XRP community figure Bearableguy123, claiming he appears to have an insider-level understanding of Ripple’s plans. She highlighted that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse follows Bearableguy123, and Ripple CTO David Schwartz used to follow him as well before facing criticism for doing so. According to Xena, this consistent engagement over the years suggests that Bearableguy123’s advice to “persevere” should not be ignored. She also brought up the frequently discussed number 589 , a figure often mentioned within the XRP community. Xena questioned why Ripple consistently referenced this number, even though the $589 XRP price prediction by the end of 2018 did not materialize. She suggested that Ripple’s leadership, including Brad Garlinghouse, somewhat knows that the number is significant. Trusting the Founders Over the Critics Xena XRP challenged followers to decide whose opinions carry more weight. She contrasted the views of what she referred to as “X haters” and random skeptics with the statements from Ripple co-founder Arthur Britto and CTO David Schwartz. She referenced Arthur Britto’s well-circulated statement that XRP was designed to reach $10,000, emphasizing that even if such a figure were incorrect by several thousand dollars, the implication is still that XRP could hit a substantially high price point. She concluded her response by encouraging people to choose which side they trust. Whether to align with those who dismiss XRP’s potential or to trust the insights of Ripple’s co-founders and individuals who, according to her, understand the project’s true scope. Xena made it clear that she opted for the latter and expressed no doubt in XRP reaching $10,000 , reinforcing that conviction with both historical examples and perceived insider signals.

The move could redefine how digital marketplaces scale. Bolt Financial Inc., the one-click checkout platform that recently partnered with billionaire Peter Thiel’s data analytics firm Palantir Technologies to deliver AI-enhanced payments, has announced two updates targeting some of the most persistent bottlenecks in online commerce. On June 27, the San Francisco-based firm introduced Bolt Connect, a new integration layer that allows marketplaces to onboard merchants with a single click, alongside native support for stablecoin payments. The dual rollout marks a notable expansion of Bolt’s backend infrastructure offerings, as the company shifts focus from front-end user experience to solving legacy pain points under the hood. You might also like: Doge ETF inches toward approval as Bitwise updates filing Bolt’s deepening infrastructure play Bolt’s latest infrastructure update addresses one of digital commerce’s most persistent dilemmas: the trade-off between rapid growth and operational sustainability. While most marketplaces historically faced mounting complexity with each new merchant, Bolt Connect rearchitects the foundation to eliminate traditional scaling barriers. According to the announcement, Bolt Connect’s automated merchant onboarding reduces what was typically a days-long verification process to near-instant approval, while maintaining compliance through built-in regulatory checks. This technical leap could be especially transformative for platforms expanding internationally, where cross-border documentation and payment processing have traditionally required specialized legal and financial teams. Simultaneously, Bolt’s support for stablecoin payments targets the transactional layer of global commerce. The company says this addition enables merchants to access funds immediately, bypassing traditional banking settlement delays. The implications go beyond speed: by sidestepping card networks and correspondent banks, Bolt’s system dramatically reduces the percentage-based fees that eat into marketplace margins. “Marketplaces shouldn’t have to choose between scale and simplicity,” said Ryan Breslow, Founder and CEO of Bolt. “With Bolt Connect, we’re giving them the tools to grow without the usual technical burden, while stablecoin support opens the door to faster, borderless payments for everyone in the network.” Bolt’s strategic pivot toward backend infrastructure reflects a growing recognition in fintech: user experience alone isn’t enough to solve the structural inefficiencies of digital commerce. While Bolt’s earlier products focused on consumer-facing improvements like one-click checkout, these latest developments aim at the operational plumbing that determines whether marketplaces can scale, or stall.

Their collaboration with Avalon Labs highlights a shared objective: to create an environment where innovation in the digital asset space can flourish without undue regulatory burdens. Why is Regulatory Clarity So Crucial for the U.S. Crypto Industry ? The absence of clear and consistent regulation has long been a significant hurdle for the U.S. crypto industry . This ambiguity creates uncertainty for businesses, investors, and developers alike. Here’s why regulatory clarity is not just beneficial, but essential: Fosters Innovation: Without clear rules, companies hesitate to invest heavily in new technologies and services, fearing potential legal repercussions. Clarity encourages research, development, and the launch of new products. Attracts Investment: Institutional investors and traditional financial firms are often wary of entering markets with unclear regulatory landscapes. Defined rules provide the confidence needed to deploy significant capital. Protects Consumers: While often seen as a burden, well-crafted regulations can protect consumers from fraud and market manipulation, building trust in the ecosystem. Ensures Global Competitiveness: Other nations are actively developing comprehensive crypto frameworks. The U.S. risks falling behind if it doesn’t establish its own clear path, potentially losing talent and capital to more hospitable jurisdictions. Reduces Legal Costs: Companies currently spend significant resources navigating a patchwork of state and federal regulations. Clarity can streamline compliance and reduce operational overhead. Unpacking the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA): A Game Changer? During their discussion, Avalon Labs specifically expressed its support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act (BRCA). This proposed legislation aims to provide much-needed clarity for certain entities operating in the blockchain space. At its core, the BRCA seeks to exempt blockchain developers and providers of non-custodial blockchain services from certain money transmission laws, provided they do not take custody of consumer funds. The implications of the BRCA are significant: It distinguishes between entities that hold user assets (like exchanges) and those that simply build the underlying technology (like software developers or decentralized protocol creators). By providing this distinction, it aims to prevent innovative projects from being inadvertently caught under outdated financial regulations designed for traditional intermediaries. This could significantly reduce the compliance burden for many blockchain innovators, encouraging more development directly within the U.S. Avalon Labs views the BRCA as a crucial step towards achieving the regulatory clarity the crypto industry desperately needs to mature and integrate more seamlessly into the broader financial system. Shaping the Future of the U.S. Crypto Industry : What’s Next? The dialogue between Avalon Labs and the Bitcoin Policy Institute is more than just a single meeting; it represents a growing trend of proactive engagement between industry players and policymakers. As the digital asset space continues its rapid evolution, such collaborations are essential to ensure that legislation is both informed by technological realities and aligned with the goals of fostering innovation while safeguarding market integrity. The path to comprehensive regulatory clarity for the crypto industry in the U.S. is ongoing, but these direct conversations in Washington, D.C., are foundational. They help bridge the knowledge gap between complex decentralized technologies and the traditional legislative process. As Avalon Labs stated, they look forward to continuing these vital conversations and contributing to the broader progress of the industry. The future success of the U.S. as a leader in blockchain and crypto innovation hinges on its ability to craft forward-thinking regulations. Initiatives like the support for the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act are pivotal in demonstrating the industry’s commitment to working constructively with lawmakers to achieve a thriving, regulated, and innovative digital economy.

2025-06-27T13:30:37,"Ethereum ETFs Face Initial $26.4M Outflows: A Crucial Market Test","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs Face Initial $26.4M Outflows: A Crucial Market Test The cryptocurrency world is buzzing, and not just with the usual price fluctuations. The much-anticipated arrival of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. market has brought a new dynamic, attracting significant institutional attention. However, their initial days have unveiled a mixed bag of investor sentiment, with recent data highlighting a notable trend. On June 26, these groundbreaking financial products collectively registered a net outflow of $26.4 million, a figure that prompts a closer look at the forces shaping this nascent market. What’s Behind the Initial Ethereum ETFs Outflows? The first few days of trading for any new exchange-traded fund are always a period of intense scrutiny, and Ethereum ETFs are no exception. The $26.4 million in net outflows on June 26, as reported by Farside Investors, offers an early glimpse into how capital is flowing through these new investment vehicles. While a net outflow might sound concerning at first glance, a deeper dive reveals a nuanced picture, characterized by both significant withdrawals from established players and fresh capital injections into newer offerings. Here’s a breakdown of the key movements: Grayscale’s Dominance in Outflows: Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which converted into a spot ETF, saw the most substantial withdrawals. Its ETHE product alone recorded a $27.4 million outflow, while its standard ETH product experienced an additional $12.4 million in withdrawals. This trend mirrors what was observed with Bitcoin ETFs, where Grayscale’s GBTC saw significant outflows post-conversion due to factors like profit-taking, higher fees compared to competitors, and a shift of capital to more competitive offerings. New Entrants Attracting Inflows: In stark contrast, several newer spot ETH ETFs managed to attract fresh capital. BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack with $5.9 million in inflows, followed closely by Fidelity’s FETH with $4.9 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW with $2.6 million. These inflows underscore continued investor appetite for Ethereum exposure through regulated products, particularly from major asset managers. Stability Among Others: The remaining Ethereum ETFs reported no changes in their holdings for the day, indicating a wait-and-see approach from some investors or a more gradual accumulation process. To provide a clearer picture, here’s a snapshot of the activity: ETF Ticker Issuer Daily Flow (June 26) ETHE Grayscale -$27.4M ETH Grayscale -$12.4M ETHA BlackRock +$5.9M FETH Fidelity +$4.9M ETHW Bitwise +$2.6M Total Net Flow -$26.4M Understanding Grayscale ETHE ‘s Significant Withdrawals The outflows from Grayscale ETHE are a critical component of the overall net outflow figure. For many investors, Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) was one of the few avenues available for regulated exposure to Ethereum before the conversion to a spot ETF. Historically, ETHE traded at a significant discount or premium to its underlying net asset value (NAV), creating arbitrage opportunities and unique investment strategies. Upon its conversion to an ETF, ETHE became redeemable at NAV, allowing investors who bought in at a discount to realize profits. Furthermore, Grayscale’s fee structure, which is typically higher than that of newer ETF competitors like BlackRock or Fidelity, incentivizes some investors to rotate their capital into more cost-effective options. This phenomenon was clearly observed with Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) following its conversion, where it saw billions in outflows as investors sought lower-fee alternatives or simply cashed out their long-held positions. The pattern with ETHE appears to be following a similar trajectory, representing a natural market adjustment rather than a wholesale rejection of Ethereum as an asset. The Strength of BlackRock ETHA and Other New Entrants While Grayscale faced headwinds, the positive inflows into products like BlackRock ETHA , Fidelity’s FETH, and Bitwise’s ETHW are a strong indicator of robust institutional and retail demand for Ethereum exposure through traditional investment vehicles. These asset managers bring immense credibility, vast distribution networks, and competitive fee structures to the market, making their ETFs attractive to a broad range of investors who might have previously been hesitant to venture directly into the volatile crypto markets. The inflows suggest that new capital is entering the Ethereum ecosystem via these ETFs, potentially from: Traditional Investors: Pension funds, wealth managers, and institutional investors who prefer regulated products over direct crypto holdings. Retail Investors: Individuals seeking simpler, tax-efficient ways to add crypto to their portfolios through their brokerage accounts. Diversification Seekers: Investors looking to diversify their crypto holdings beyond Bitcoin, recognizing Ethereum’s foundational role in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFT ecosystems. The ability of these new ETFs to attract millions in their initial days, even amidst Grayscale’s outflows, highlights a genuine and growing interest in Ethereum as a legitimate asset class within traditional finance. Navigating Early Crypto Outflows : A Market Perspective Understanding these early crypto outflows requires a balanced perspective. It’s crucial to avoid drawing hasty conclusions based on a single day’s data. The initial phase of any new ETF market is often characterized by significant rebalancing and repositioning of capital. For spot ETH ETFs , this involves a transition from existing trust structures to new, more liquid, and often cheaper ETF formats. Here are some key takeaways and actionable insights for investors: Monitor Trends, Not Just Snapshots: A single day’s outflow is less significant than sustained trends over weeks or months. Investors should look for patterns in inflows and outflows to gauge true market sentiment and adoption rates. Distinguish Between Types of Outflows: Not all outflows are negative. Those from Grayscale’s converted trust are often a function of market maturity and fee competition, rather than a lack of interest in Ethereum itself. New Demand is Evident: The consistent inflows into BlackRock, Fidelity, and Bitwise’s offerings confirm that there is new, net demand for Ethereum exposure from a segment of the market that was previously underserved. Volatility is Expected: The crypto market, by nature, is volatile. ETF flows will reflect this, and investors should be prepared for fluctuations as the market matures and reacts to broader economic and regulatory news. The emergence of these ETFs provides significant benefits to investors, offering ease of access, liquidity, and regulatory oversight that were previously unavailable for direct Ethereum investments. However, challenges remain, including market volatility, evolving regulatory landscapes, and the competitive pressures among issuers. The Road Ahead for Spot ETH ETFs : Challenges and Opportunities The journey for spot ETH ETFs has just begun, and while the initial flows provide valuable insights, the true test will be their sustained performance and ability to attract long-term capital. The market is dynamic, and future flows will likely be influenced by several factors: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Development: Continued innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and scalability solutions on the Ethereum blockchain will enhance its appeal as an underlying asset. Broader Crypto Market Sentiment: The overall health and direction of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin’s performance, often influence investor sentiment towards altcoins like Ethereum. Regulatory Clarity: Further clarity from regulators on crypto assets and related products could encourage more institutional participation. Fee Competition: As the market matures, we can expect fierce competition among ETF issuers, potentially leading to lower fees that could attract even more investors. These ETFs represent a pivotal moment for Ethereum, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy. While initial crypto outflows from one major player might grab headlines, the underlying narrative of new capital entering the space through reputable firms like BlackRock and Fidelity paints a hopeful picture for Ethereum’s continued integration into mainstream investment portfolios. Summary: The initial days of U.S. spot ETH ETFs have presented a mixed but ultimately insightful picture. While a net outflow of $26.4 million on June 26 was primarily driven by significant withdrawals from Grayscale’s converted trust ( Grayscale ETHE ), this was counterbalanced by notable inflows into offerings from new players like BlackRock ETHA , Fidelity, and Bitwise. This suggests a rebalancing of capital within the market rather than a fundamental rejection of Ethereum. As the market matures, monitoring sustained trends and understanding the nuances of these flows will be crucial for investors navigating this exciting new frontier in digital asset investment.

2025-06-27T13:27:40,"Cygnal poll: Bitcoin holders have a strong political influence in the USA","Bitcoin ownership is not just a ticket to long-term wealth. Holders are also a growing political constituency in the US political landscape. Polling and research by Cygnal shows BTC ownership is also a growing indicator of political convictions and influence. US-based owners are a significant force on both a global scale and as a domestic voting group. Crypto dragged Trump across the finish line in 2024 According to Cygnal polling, BTC ownership could predict voting inclinations, with immediate potential results for the 2026 midterms. Its recent poll between June 19-21 targeted a selection of 800 potential voters. “ The Bitcoin constituency is now a critical one in elections, but there is a wide chasm between Bitcoiners and voters as a whole, ” said Pollster and Cygnal President, Brent Buchanan. “ However, this data offers a lot of promise and opportunity to the Bitcoin community and the innovation industries surrounding it ,” he added. Bitcoiners already showed their preferences during the contested 2024 election, voting 59% in favor of Donald Trump , and only 34% in favor of Kamala Harris, a significant shift from the general voter pool. Trump also won over 11% of Democratic voters who were also BTC holders, compared to 6% of general Democratic voters who switched teams. The shift in Trump’s direction followed his campaign claims of more lenient crypto policies, which led to a shift in the leadership of the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). The effect of Trump’s election victory and the subsequent drive to liberalize crypto regulations led to multiple all-time highs for BTC, further solidifying the holder ethos. Following the emergence of crypto owners as a voting bloc, BTC also shows a clear trend of a growing number of corporations building treasuries , alongside older whales that still hold for the long term. Bitcoin holders: leaning Republican, more educated and younger The voting profile of a Bitcoin holder is emerging as a stronger supporter of Trump than the Republican Party. Nevertheless, holders lean Republican politically. Voters owning BTC were younger, predominantly male, with more years of education, and higher-income than the general population. Despite their conviction, Bitcoiners were low-propensity voters, needing a nudge to go to the polls and support their main preferences. Bitcoin owners were also 53% likely to vote in person on election day, or cast an early in-person vote, with just 15.5% for absentee or mail voting, compared to 23.8% absentee voting for the general population. Bitcoiners also have a different profile of voting issues, with inflation and the economy being their biggest concern. BTC holders have a different issue profile compared to general voters, with their biggest concern being inflation and the economy. | Source: Cygnal Poll Bitcoin holders still diverge from the general GOP voters, with more dramatic support for crypto issues ranging from transactions to a national reserve. Democratic voters are more generally opposed to expanding access to crypto. The most supportive crypto holders are in the 30-44 age bracket, with 61% approval for crypto in general. Those voters are also more likely to support Republicans in the upcoming 2026 elections. Surprisingly, Bitcoin holders were also not entirely maximalist, with 42% favorable opinion on meme tokens, compared to just 19% favorable for the general population. Memes were also tied to the last election cycle, sparking the trend of PolitiFi and official meme tokens, including Official Trump ( TRUMP ). Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-27T13:26:31,"XRP price prediction for July 1, 2025","XRP has experienced considerable volatility over the past 24 hours, primarily triggered by Judge Analisa Torres’ decision to deny motions in the ongoing Ripple v. SEC lawsuit . This ruling, a significant development in a case that has loomed over the token for years, has contributed to a sharp market reaction, with nearly $5 billion erased from XRP’s market capitalization. However, the crypto market appears to have largely priced in this outcome, as evidenced by stabilizing trading patterns and a lack of further significant sell-offs in the immediate aftermath. With only a few days until July 1, a deeper analysis of XRP’s price dynamics, technical indicators, and fundamental developments provides valuable insight into its potential trajectory and performance in the first half of 2025. XRP price analysis Currently, XRP trades at $2.09, with a 24-hour trading volume of $5.73 billion, a market cap of $123.46 billion, and a market dominance of 3.76%. XRP 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold XRP’s current price action reveals a mixed outlook. The token is trading below its 200-day simple moving average (SMA), a bearish signal that suggests potential challenges in regaining upward momentum in the near term. Additionally, XRP has recorded only 13 green days in the last 30 (43%), indicating inconsistent short-term performance. The impending unlock of 1 billion XRP tokens on July 1, part of Ripple’s programmed escrow releases, introduces another layer of complexity. With a yearly inflation rate of 6.45% and a fully diluted valuation of $208.79 billion, this token unlock could exert downward pressure on the price, particularly if market sentiment remains cautious. Historically, Ripple’s escrow releases have had mixed impacts, with some unlocks absorbed smoothly due to pre-existing market expectations and others contributing to temporary price dips. Data says XRP sentiment is at 17-day high According to data analytics platform Santiment: “XRP sentiment is currently at a 17-day high, in terms of positive vs. negative commentary. This has happened after a $50M settlement between Ripple & the SEC was stalled.” 📊 With crypto moving sideways, retail optimism toward Bitcoin & Ethereum has died down a bit.

When a major player like ARK Invest makes a significant move, especially concerning a bellwether crypto company, the market takes notice. Recently, the asset management firm, helmed by the renowned Cathie Wood, executed a notable sale of Coinbase stock, prompting many to ask: what’s behind this strategic decision? What Does ARK Invest’s Recent Move Signal? On June 26, ARK Invest, through its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), offloaded a substantial $12.5 million worth of shares in crypto exchange Coinbase. This transaction occurred on a day when Coinbase’s stock had soared to an impressive all-time high of $375.07. For many observers, selling at a peak seems counterintuitive. However, for a firm like ARK Invest, known for its long-term, disruptive innovation thesis, such a move often signals a calculated rebalancing or profit-taking strategy rather than a loss of faith. Profit Realization: Selling at an all-time high allows ARK Invest to lock in significant gains from its investment in Coinbase, which has seen substantial growth. Portfolio Rebalancing: ETFs like ARKK maintain specific weightings for their holdings. When one stock performs exceptionally well, its proportion in the portfolio can become overweight, necessitating a sale to rebalance and adhere to the fund’s investment mandate. Risk Management: While bullish on disruptive technologies, ARK Invest also manages risk. Trimming positions after a sharp rally can reduce overall portfolio volatility. Understanding the Dynamics of Coinbase Stock Performance Coinbase Global Inc. (COIN) has been a cornerstone holding for ARK Invest, representing their conviction in the future of the crypto economy. The Coinbase stock has experienced significant volatility, characteristic of the broader crypto market, but has also demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth, particularly during bull cycles. Its performance is often seen as a proxy for institutional and retail interest in digital assets. The fact that ARK Invest sold shares precisely when Coinbase reached an all-time high of $375.07 highlights the dynamic nature of their investment strategy. It’s a testament to their disciplined approach to portfolio management, where pre-defined thresholds for profit-taking or rebalancing are often triggered by market movements, regardless of long-term conviction. Cathie Wood’s Vision: Beyond the Daily Trades Cathie Wood , the visionary CEO and CIO of ARK Invest, has consistently championed disruptive innovation, with a strong focus on areas like artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, and blockchain technology. Her investment philosophy centers on identifying companies poised to revolutionize industries over the next five to ten years. For Wood, Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem represent a significant disruptive force, and Coinbase, as a leading exchange, plays a pivotal role in this revolution. It’s crucial to view this sale not as a shift in Cathie Wood’s long-term bullish outlook on crypto, but rather as a tactical adjustment within a diversified portfolio. Her public statements and ongoing investments in other crypto-related entities continue to affirm her belief in the transformative power of digital assets. Navigating the ARKK ETF Strategy The ARK Innovation ETF ( ARKK ETF ) is ARK Invest’s flagship actively managed exchange-traded fund. It seeks long-term growth by investing in companies that are the leaders, enablers, and beneficiaries of disruptive innovation. The fund’s holdings are constantly evaluated, and positions are adjusted based on market conditions, company fundamentals, and ARK’s evolving research insights. The sale of Coinbase shares is a prime example of this active management in action. For investors who track ARKK, these sales and purchases provide insights into how ARK Invest manages concentration risk and capitalizes on market movements. It underscores the active nature of the fund, which differentiates it from passively managed index funds. The strategy is to allocate capital to the highest conviction ideas while maintaining a balanced portfolio. Implications for Your Crypto Investment Journey For individual investors navigating the volatile waters of digital assets, ARK Invest’s move offers a valuable lesson in portfolio management. While it’s tempting to hold onto assets indefinitely during a bull run, strategic profit-taking and rebalancing are crucial components of a sound crypto investment strategy. This particular sale by a major institutional investor does not necessarily signal a downturn for Coinbase or the broader crypto market, but rather a disciplined approach to managing risk and optimizing returns. Consider these actionable insights: Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your crypto holdings to mitigate risk. Risk Management: Define your entry and exit strategies. Consider taking profits on portions of your holdings after significant gains. Long-Term Vision: While short-term market movements are impactful, focus on the long-term potential of projects and technologies you believe in. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of institutional moves and market analysis, but always conduct your own research. The crypto market is dynamic and complex. Understanding the rationale behind major institutional decisions, such as ARK Invest’s sale of Coinbase stock, can provide valuable context for your own investment choices. It highlights that even firms with strong convictions employ sophisticated strategies to manage their portfolios effectively.

2025-06-27T13:18:34,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-27: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, TONCOIN: TON, APTOS: APT, COSMOS: ATOM","The crypto market registered a marginal decline over the past 24 hours, as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded in the red. Prices have been consolidating in the past few days, with BTC consolidating around the $107,000-$107,500 mark. The flagship cryptocurrency has been marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $107,402. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) fell from a high of $2,532 on Thursday to close at $2,415. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down over 1% in the past 24 hours, struggling to stay above $2,400. Ripple (XRP) is down over 4%, trading around $2.09, while Solana (SOL) is down nearly 3%, trading around $140. Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , Hedera (HBAR) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines. Coinbase Stock Hits New Closing High According to data from Google Finance, Coinbase (COIN) shares ended Thursday at a new all-time closing high of $369.21. Real Vision CEO Raoul Paul reacted to the stock’s new high, stating, “Wow, $HOOD, $COIN, and $RKLB are going vertical now. All in the RV Pro portfolio (added to all via calls at April lows). $TSLA is likely to follow. The next step is crypto. The liquidity spigot is wide, wide open.” The recent gains are 3.3% higher from the stock’s previous closing high of $357.59 in November 2021. Coinbase was the best-performing S&P 500 stock on Tuesday, rising over 12%. The stock’s stellar performance comes only a month after it became the first crypto firm to join the S&P 500. However, analysts are split on whether the rally could continue. Investment advisor Andy Heilman stated that while COIN has made stellar gains, it is due a correction. Another prominent analyst stated that the daily Bollinger Band, a volatility indicator that uses price bands, is expanding and looking to go higher. Dow Jones Edges Higher As Trump Eyes Powell Replacement US stocks climbed higher on Thursday amid reports that President Donald Trump is close to selecting Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s replacement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.57% or 200 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 gained 500 points. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.23% as investors bet on increased chances of interest rate cuts by the central bank. The market enthusiasm also stemmed from President Trump, who has stepped up criticism of Powell after the Fed decided to keep interest rates steady. Powell testified before lawmakers in Washington amid reports Trump is close to selecting his replacement. Powell’s term is set to end in May 2026. Trump has whittled down the list to four candidates, with reports stating he could announce a replacement as early as this summer. Real-World Assets (RWAs) Hit $24B, Private Credit Leads Growth According to a report by RedStone, private credit has emerged as the primary growth driver in the RWA market, helping it become one of the fastest-growing categories. RWAs surged to $24 billion in value, up from $10 billion in 2022. This was topped only by stablecoins, which registered even stronger growth in the same period. Marcin Kaźmierczak, co-founder of RedStone, believes private credit is the primary driver of the burgeoning growth of RWA assets. Private credit refers to loans made outside the traditional banking system, often issued directly to private entities. “Private credit has emerged as the foundation for tokenization’s real-world impact. What we’re seeing now is institutional finance actively moving into blockchain—not just exploring, but deploying capital in meaningful ways and innovating with RWA looping strategies.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally up during the ongoing session after briefly giving up the $107,000 level Thursday when it fell from an intraday high of $108,343 to $106,970. BTC started the week with a stunning rally as market sentiment improved after the US-brokered Israel-Iran ceasefire. As a result, the flagship cryptocurrency rallied to reclaim $105,000 and went past $106,000 on Tuesday. Bullish sentiment persisted on Wednesday as BTC crossed $107,000 and settled at $107,393 before entering a consolidation phase. Market analyst Rekt Capital shared a roadmap for BTC for the rest of 2025, noting that the current cycle has been one of the reaccumulation ranges. The analyst explained that these have formed throughout the cycle since 2022 and have evolved since the latest Bitcoin halving. Rekt Capital stated that during the downside period, BTC registered short price deviations with downside wicks below the reaccumulation range lows on the weekly chart. On the other hand, the post-halving phase has seen BTC deviations occur with multi-week clusters of full-bodied candles below range lows. Analysts highlighted that BTC formed a bullish engulfing candlestick, fully reversing the weekend’s bearish price action. The pattern also ensured BTC maintained its position above $105,000, indicating a potential shift in market structure, adding weight to the flagship cryptocurrency’s ongoing recovery. However, despite the bullish setup, market sentiment is divided. BTC has recorded 19 instances of the bullish engulfing pattern meeting the defined confirmation criteria. Of these, 15 led to new local highs in the following days or weeks. More importantly, 19 instances occurred within a broader bull market context. The prevailing bull market structure indicates a statistically favorable environment for continuing the current price action, potentially pushing BTC to new highs. BTC registered a sharp drop on Tuesday (June 17), falling over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. Despite the bearish sentiment, it registered a marginal increase on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884. However, it was back in the red on Thursday, dropping 0.24% to $104,631. BTC raced to an intraday high of $106,513 on Friday as buyers attempted to overwhelm upper-level resistance. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388.

BTC plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened, falling to $98,385. It recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982.

The price plunged to an intraday low of $2,116 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened. It rebounded from this level to reclaim $2,200 and settle at $2,229.

2025-06-27T13:14:07,"$15B Bitcoin Options Expire Today: Will This Send BTC Bull Token Soaring?","Bitcoin traders everywhere will be watching their feeds closely, willing the world’s largest crypto to hold steady at or near its current $107K mark. $15B in Bitcoin options expire today, a major portion of the roughly $40B in options outstanding. If $BTC’s price falls to $102K or below, the market would endure a true ‘pain point.’ As long as that doesn’t happen, Bitcoin looks set to press on with business as normal – setting the stage for further growth of the ecosystem and the first meme coin offering direct $BTC exposure, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL). Narrowing Volatility Indicates Positive Outlook The $BTC volatility index has narrowed in recent days, drawing more closely to the historical volatility and generally indicating that traders don’t expect dramatic price moves either way – up or down. That was supported by Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Jean-David Péquignot, who stated : ‘Low open interest in perps and fairly depressed Bitcoin implied volatility and skew are indicative of limited expectations for sharp price movements…’ Where does that leave Bitcoin? Still looking bullish. Crypto treasury strategies are still expanding, adding thousands of $BTC tokens to long-term reserves and increasing demand. Metaplanet just added 1,234 $BTC , bringing its total portfolio north of 12K $BTC. And it isn’t just direct Bitcoin purchases; the ecosystem around the world’s leading crypto continues to fuel demand.

Monday to Thursday, daily cumulative inflows amounted to: $350M $588M $547M $226M Positive inflows point to long-term interest from retail and institutional investors, rather than short-term traders, and contribute to underlying buying pressure. And with the largest Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, holding over $70B in total assets, Bitcoin took advantage of weakening Alphabet stock to overthrow Google as the world’s sixth-largest asset. It’s a combination of fundamentally positive factors, reinforcing a bullish case for $BTC – and the meme coin built on that case. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Meme Coin Trusting $BTC to Hit $250K and Beyond BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is confident that Bitcoin will one day reach $250K and more – so confident that the project is built around key Bitcoin price milestones.

2025-06-27T13:12:21,"Crypto Market Enters Holding Pattern and Fatigue Grows, But Will the Bull Stay?","The world’s first and most popular cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC) , has remained range-bound recently. This comes as crypto market profit-taking slows, spot volume fades, activity metrics cool, and futures sentiment turns cautious, according to the latest report by blockchain data and intelligence platform Glassnode. Without a notable influx of new demand, upside momentum will remain limited. BTC has been trading in a $100,000–$110,000 range , where it has been consolidating since 8 May. Macro elements and sharp reversals are driving price action. Currently, the $99,000 support level holds. We’ve seen this last weekend when the geopolitical tensions pushed the prices down. That said, the coin swiftly recovered to $106,000 with the news of de-escalation in the Middle East. That said, trading within this range reflects “continued uncertainty amid headline-driven volatility,” the report notes. #Bitcoin remains range-bound between $100k–$110k. Profit-taking cools, volume fades, and futures show signs of caution. What would it take for $BTC to break out from this trend? Read more in the latest Week On-Chain: https://t.co/boL6GT7NfS pic.twitter.com/bHEYwb3iv1 — glassnode (@glassnode) June 26, 2025 Moreover, Glassnode writes that there are growing signs of market fatigue, as well as a cooling pattern across key activity metrics. First, there is profit realization. During the 2020–2022 market, BTC investors realized $550 billion in profit across several rallies. But realized profit has already reached $650 billion in the current cycle. Following the third significant wave of profit-taking, the market seems to be cooling down. This suggests that “while large gains have been secured, momentum is now easing as realized profitability tapers off.” Source: Glassnode Next is the onchain transfer volume. The 7-day moving average has dropped some 32%. It fell from a high of $76 billion in late May to $52 billion last weekend. Additionally, unlike the ATH rallies in Q2 and Q4 2024, the latest ATH did not see a surge in spot volume. The current amount of $7.7 billion is significantly lower than the cyclical peaks from earlier in this bull market. This highlights a lack of speculative intensity, crypto market hesitancy, and the consolidation narrative. The analysts conclude that “profit realization is cooling, on-chain activity is declining, and spot volume failed to rise meaningfully during the recent ATH push. While futures participation remains active, falling funding rates and futures rolling basis signal a cautious stance among speculators.” You may also like: Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 27, 2025 The crypto market is down today.

It’s... Crypto Market Key Range Where the Bull Runs Looking at the cost basis distribution (CBD) heatmap, Glassnode found that Bitcoin’s weekend drop to $99,000 found support near the upper edge of a dense supply zone between $93,000 and $100,000. This is notable as this zone has been “a key area of activity since the top formation in Q1 2025, marking it as a structurally important level,” analysts argue. Therefore, they write, as long as the price holds above this particular range, “the bull market structure remains intact.” However, a drop below it could trigger a deeper correction. This will especially be the case if holders with a cost basis in this zone begin to capitulate and add to the sell pressure, the report states. Source: Glassnode That said, analysts note that despite BTC reclaiming the $100,000–$110,000 range, there are visible signs of diminishing profitability and sluggish on-chain activity. They argue that these trends are “typical in choppy consolidation phases, where volatility fades and investor engagement cools.” The report concludes that “until we see a pickup in profitability and activity metrics, the likelihood of a breakout to new all-time highs remains limited. For now, the market appears to be digesting prior gains, awaiting fresh momentum and an influx of new demand.” You may also like: Ripple Taps Wormhole to Link XRP Ledger with 35+ Blockchains — XRP Rally Incoming?

XRP (XRP) price has been relatively steady over the past few months. However, according to insights from analysts at crypto payments platform B2BINPAY, shared with crypto.news on Friday, June 27, the token is poised for a breakout. B2BINPAY analysts highlighted an increase in whale holdings, with large XRP holders adding 50 million XRP this month. At the same time, centralized exchanges saw outflows of a similar amount. Both whale accumulation and exchange outflows suggest a bullish outlook for the token.

Instead, XRP has traded within a narrow range for almost two months. Still, this stability may be masking the potential bullish momentum building under the surface. “We think XRP is now entering a pressure zone — calm on the surface but “coiled” underneath. After trading sideways between $2.00 and $2.30 for nearly two months, the price now sits below $2.20, right under a cluster of major moving averages ($2.21-$2.23).That’s a typical sign of the market gearing up for a bigger move,” B2BINPAY. Additionally, B2BINPAY analysts point out that the RSI and MACD are neutral. This suggests that the token is not overbought, lending more credence to the bullish case.

Still, a potential macro catalyst, or some other development, could propel XRP much higher.

2025-06-27T13:11:03,"Court delays hearing in $234M WazirX crypto hack case to 15 July","The Singapore High Court has scheduled a pivotal hearing in case HC/SUM 940/2025 involving crypto exchange WazirX, now set for July 15, 2025, at 7:30 AM IST, with a backup date on July 16. This new date follows the court’s decision to give WazirX additional time to present further arguments related to its ongoing restructuring efforts after a massive $234 million hack. The rescheduling marks another key procedural step in what has become one of the most closely watched crypto legal battles in Asia. WazirX, in a post on X, confirmed the revised hearing dates and acknowledged the court’s directive to submit new documents before arguments resume. WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange @WazirXIndia · Follow 📢 Update on Proposed Scheme of ArrangementThe Singapore Court has scheduled the hearing for further arguments in HC/SUM 940/2025 on 15 July 2025 at 7:30 AM IST (10:00 AM SGT) with a reserve date set for 16 July 2025, if needed (instead of 10 July 2025, with 11 July 2025 as 1:48 PM · Jun 27, 2025 82 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The exchange is currently attempting to rebuild credibility and operations following the major security breach that compromised user assets and left affected users with few answers over the last year. WazirX ordered to submit new documents by July 4 The court has instructed WazirX to file a supplemental affidavit and written submissions no later than July 4, 2025. While the exchange did not elaborate on the contents of the new filing, it said it is awaiting further instructions regarding attendance logistics for the hearing, which will be shared when confirmed by the court. This development offers a narrow but important opportunity for WazirX to convince the court of its restructuring roadmap, even as users continue to wait for clarity on the future of their funds. No comment from Shetty as users demand answers Despite procedural advances, co-founder Nischal Shetty has remained publicly silent, offering no new updates since the initial disclosure of the breach. Users have repeatedly tagged Shetty on social media seeking responses regarding the progress of the restructuring plan, the status of funds, or a timeline for reimbursements. His silence has further fuelled community concerns about transparency and leadership accountability. Earlier this year, 93% of voting creditors supported WazirX’s proposed restructuring. However, the company has not shared any follow-up communication on what the plan involves, nor how or when user losses might be addressed. While securing creditor support was a milestone, the lack of public updates from senior leadership has led to speculation and uncertainty within the platform’s user base. Why the July 15 hearing could shape WazirX’s future The July 15 court date is shaping up to be a critical juncture for the exchange. Legal experts suggest the hearing may determine whether WazirX is allowed to proceed with its restructuring plan or whether further intervention will be needed. The outcome could influence not just WazirX’s survival but also broader regulatory attitudes toward crypto platforms in Singapore and neighbouring regions. Since the $234 million hack, the platform has provided minimal updates regarding fund recovery or internal investigations. For users still awaiting restitution, this hearing may provide the first real insight into the company’s direction and accountability. The broader crypto industry is also monitoring the situation, as Singapore continues to evolve its approach to digital asset oversight. With the hearing less than a month away, pressure is mounting on WazirX to not only meet the court’s requirements but also re-establish its standing among regulators and users alike.

2025-06-27T13:09:03,"Few central banks see Bitcoin reserves on horizon but interest in diversification still grows","Despite growing buzz around crypto, only 3% of central banks plan to hold Bitcoin reserves over the next decade, according to OMFIF’s latest survey. Bitcoin ( BTC ) may be gaining traction globally, but only a sliver of central banks are planning to hold it, according to this year’s Global Public Investor survey by OMFIF shared with crypto.news. The report found that only 3% of central banks foresee building a strategic Bitcoin reserve in the next decade. Outside of that small group, interest in crypto as a reserve asset remains limited. OMFIF’s central banks’ exposure | Source: OMFIF “Central banks’ cautious approach despite Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy as a digital asset has to do with a mix of volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and structural conservatism,” Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, told crypto.news. “Central banks tend to prioritize stability and liquidity, all the qualities that Bitcoin, despite its resilience, still doesn’t consistently offer yet. The price swings of Bitcoin can pose balance sheet risks that could be hard to justify for institutions with the sole objective to safeguard national economies.” Shawn Young The survey also reveals a clear appetite among many central banks to diversify away from traditional government bonds over the long term. “After gold, corporate bonds and public equities are the asset classes in highest demand over the next decade,” the report notes, with a net demand of more than 25% among respondents looking to increase exposure. Some 16% expect to reduce government bond holdings, and 13% plan to lower cash allocations. Digital assets are beginning to attract some attention, too, with around 10% of respondents considering increasing allocations. However, the focus is mainly on tokenized securities rather than outright cryptocurrencies. The GPI highlights that only “3% of survey respondents foresee building a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” “Aside from volatility, geopolitical and regulatory pressures also play a role,” Young said, adding that many central banks “are closely aligned with frameworks like the Basel Accords or IMF guidelines, both which do not yet classify Bitcoin as a reserve-grade asset.” Seize and hold Blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis noted in a May report that governments have become some of the largest holders of cryptocurrency, primarily through seizures connected to law enforcement actions. Historically, seized crypto was quickly liquidated through auctions or private sales to recover value for victims or treasury accounts. This practice appears to be changing now. The United States, for instance, has begun to formalize an approach that moves from automatic liquidation to strategic retention of seized digital assets. China, which reportedly holds an estimated $50 billion in seized crypto, has a more fragmented system where provincial authorities manage holdings independently, sometimes leading to opacity and concerns over lost long-term value. Analysts say a coordinated national policy could signal a meaningful evolution in China’s stance on digital assets. However, Chainalysis pointed out that most government agencies “are not yet equipped to actively manage or secure volatile digital assets,” so debate continues on whether to hold or sell. You might also like: Bank of England Governor casts doubt on the case for retail CBDC Early adopters Some countries have already embraced Bitcoin reserves more boldly. El Salvador’s 2021 move to make Bitcoin legal tender put it in the global spotlight, though this approach has sparked controversy and raised concerns with the IMF. The organization has tied loan conditions to reducing or eliminating Bitcoin policies, illustrating the political risks involved in adopting crypto at the sovereign level. Eventually, El Salvador had to change its regulatory stance on BTC. “El Salvador’s approach uses Bitcoin as legal tender and a reserve asset to attract investment, tourism, and tech infrastructure,” said Young. “Their dollarized economy allows flexibility to experiment with Bitcoin as a parallel store of value, although the impact on long-term fiscal stability is still under global scrutiny.” Shawn Young Meanwhile, Bhutan offers a quieter but arguably more strategic example. The Himalayan nation mines BTC using renewable hydropower through its sovereign investment fund, turning energy resources into a digital reserve. This approach allows accumulation of Bitcoin without purchasing on open markets or triggering external scrutiny. “Bhutan’s approach allows for a low-key, infrastructure-first access to Bitcoin,” Young explained, adding that “it proves that resource-rich countries have the ability to convert domestic advantages into digital assets without overhauling monetary policy.” While Europe’s approach remains cautious, signs of change are emerging. In the Czech Republic, new central bank governor Aleš Michl has proposed allocating as much as 5% of the country’s reserves to Bitcoin. This stance contrasts with the European Central Bank, where President Christine Lagarde continues to dismiss crypto as unsuitable for reserves, citing liquidity, safety, and anti-money laundering concerns. Switzerland and Sweden probe Bitcoin’s place in reserves Switzerland presents a unique case where popular politics may influence central bank policy. A People’s Initiative launched at the end of 2024 proposes amending the constitution to require the Swiss National Bank to hold bitcoin alongside gold. The campaign argues that including bitcoin would “strengthen national sovereignty and future-proof its monetary base.” Because the SNB is a joint-stock company with strong legal independence, this initiative would require a constitutional amendment and a national referendum, potentially the world’s first on Bitcoin as a reserve asset. While the SNB itself remains cautious, the popular movement signals rising institutional and public comfort with digital assets in a country known for financial privacy and asset protection. Sweden, meanwhile, has taken a more procedural approach. A parliamentary inquiry has been submitted to the Riksbank on whether BTC should form part of its currency reserves. This inquiry follows the EU’s MiCA regulations, which provide clearer legal frameworks for digital assets. Still, the Riksbank’s mandate prioritizes price stability and risk minimization, making rapid adoption unlikely. Read more: ECB chief says digital Euro CBDC will be here by October 2025.

Thielen is recommending a pair trade that comprises a short position in COIN and a simultaneous long position in bitcoin BTC. In a note sent to clients, Thielen explained that Coinbase's fundamentals, mainly trading volumes, haven't kept pace with the rally in share prices, which are fast nearing the overvaluation threshold, a classic setup for a ""tactical reversal."" ""While Coinbase hasn’t quite breached the +30% overvaluation threshold, it’s approaching fast, and despite being one of the few high-quality, listed crypto plays, its current premium suggests the risk of underperformance ahead,"" Thielen detailed. ""Traders looking to capitalize on this dislocation might consider going long Bitcoin while shorting Coinbase, or using options by selling a COIN call and buying a BTC call to express the same view with defined risk."" Fundamental disconnect According to 10x's linear regression model, 75% of Coinbase's stock price action is explained by bitcoin's price and trading volumes. That means just 25% of COIN's price action is led by other factors, such as the potential impact of Circle's IPO or U.S. crypto and macro developments. In quantitative terms, it suggests that COIN's price tends to rise by $20 for every $10,000 move in BTC and by $24 for every $100 billion increase in trading volume. The recent price action suggests the rally is overextended relative to bitcoin's price and trading volumes. Shares in Coinbase have surged 84% over the past two months, while bitcoin has risen by just 14%. ""Not only is this premium stretched relative to bitcoin’s current price, but it also appears disconnected from underlying crypto trading volumes, which are hovering around $108 billion,"" said Thielen. ""This rare deviation suggests Coinbase’s valuation is extended and vulnerable to mean reversion."" The report said that other factors – Circle’s IPO on June 3, the June 17 “GENIUS” stablecoin bill and the buying frenzy from Korean investors – seem to have been priced in. ""As this momentum cools, evident in the recent reversals of Circle, KakaoPay, and Metaplanet, there is growing risk that Coinbase shares could also be nearing a local top,"" Thielen said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/time-to-short-coinbase-coin-and-long-bitcoin-btc-as-high-flying-coinbase-nears-overvaluation-10x-research,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Coinbase|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-27T13:00:44,"Global Watchdog Reveals Surge In Criminal Activity Involving Stablecoins","The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has raised alarms about the “increasing risks” associated with the adoption of stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoin Adoption Raises Security Concerns In a press release issued on June 26, the FATF noted that the growing use of stablecoins by illicit actors—including North Korean agents, terrorist financiers, and drug traffickers—poses significant challenges to global financial security. The report further notes that a considerable portion of on-chain illegal activities now involves stablecoins. The FATF, a global organization dedicated to combating money laundering and terrorist financing, emphasized that mass adoption of stablecoins could exacerbate these risks, especially given the “inconsistent application” of its standards across various jurisdictions. In its report, the Financial Action Task Force pointed to alarming statistics surrounding cryptocurrency thefts , noting that only 3.8% of the $1.46 billion stolen by North Korean hackers from the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit has been recovered. The organization also observed a significant rise in the use of digital assets for fraudulent activities and scams, further complicating the regulatory environment for both issuers, users and companies looking to adopt these assets for clients eager to participate in crypto activities. Cryptocurrency Theft Soars 300% In Q1 To address these emerging threats, the Financial Action Task Force is calling on governments worldwide to enhance their licensing and registration processes for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). This includes identifying individuals engaged in VASP activities, mitigating risks associated with offshore VASPs, and ensuring transparency in cross-border payment information. The FATF stressed that the borderless nature of virtual assets means that regulatory failures in one area can have far-reaching global consequences. Recent reports indicate a staggering 303% increase in cryptocurrency thefts during the first quarter of the year, totaling $1.67 billion. This surge was largely driven by the high-profile hack of the Bybit exchange in February, which saw 197 hacks occur in just three months. Blockchain data platform Chainalysis has also reported that the total value stolen through cryptocurrency hacks reached $2.2 billion in 2024, a figure that, while higher than the $1.8 billion lost in 2023, remains below the record $3.7 billion stolen in 2022. Due to the increased interest in stablecoins, Circle, the issuer of the second largest stablecoin in the market, USD Coin (USDC), has seen notable engagement from investors in its initial public offering (IPO). Since June 5, Circle’s newly traded stock, under the ticker symbol CRCL, has surged significantly. It closed at $84 on its first day of trading, but by June 26, it stood at $213—a 232% increase in just three weeks.

2025-06-27T13:00:34,"Bitcoin Crash Unlikely: Sygnum Analyst Foresees Resilience Amidst Surging Institutional Inflows","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Crash Unlikely: Sygnum Analyst Foresees Resilience Amidst Surging Institutional Inflows In the volatile world of digital assets, the specter of a significant Bitcoin crash often looms large in the minds of investors. However, a prominent voice from the institutional crypto banking sector offers a reassuring perspective, suggesting that while corrections are a natural part of any market, a full-blown catastrophe akin to 2022’s downturn is improbable without truly extraordinary circumstances. This insight provides a crucial lens through which to view the current trajectory of the BTC price and the broader crypto market . Understanding the Sygnum Outlook on Bitcoin’s Future Katalin Tischhauser, the astute Head of Investment Research at Sygnum, a leading crypto bank, recently shared her nuanced outlook on Bitcoin’s potential movements. While acknowledging the possibility of a double-top pattern forming above the $100,000 mark, she stressed that such an occurrence, even if it led to a substantial correction, would not equate to the kind of devastating Bitcoin crash witnessed in previous cycles. Her analysis suggests that if a double-top pattern were to materialize, it could lead to a significant price retracement, potentially seeing the BTC price plummet by approximately 75% from its peak, settling around the $27,000 level. While this sounds dramatic, it’s vital to differentiate this from a ‘crash’ in the context of systemic failure. Such a correction, though sharp, would be a market cycle adjustment rather than an existential threat. What Triggers a True Bitcoin Crash? The Black Swan Event Tischhauser’s core argument hinges on the necessity of a ‘ black swan event ‘ for a truly catastrophic market collapse. But what exactly constitutes a black swan event in the cryptocurrency space? These are unpredictable, high-impact events that are rare and typically beyond normal expectations, yet seem obvious in hindsight. The crypto market has unfortunately experienced several such events that led to significant downturns, demonstrating their profound impact: The Terra (LUNA) Collapse (2022): This event saw the algorithmic stablecoin UST de-peg from the US dollar and the subsequent hyperinflation of its sister token LUNA. The collapse wiped out billions of dollars in market capitalization and sent shockwaves across the entire crypto market , eroding investor confidence and leading to widespread liquidations. It highlighted the systemic risks associated with uncollateralized stablecoins. The FTX Bankruptcy (2022): The sudden downfall of FTX, once one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, due to alleged fraud and mismanagement, was another monumental black swan event . Its collapse triggered a liquidity crisis across the industry, leading to bankruptcies of other crypto firms and a deep bear market. It underscored the critical need for regulatory oversight and transparent financial practices within centralized entities. These examples illustrate that a true Bitcoin crash , characterized by a prolonged and severe downturn driven by fear and systemic contagion, typically requires an unexpected, high-magnitude catalyst that fundamentally undermines trust or market infrastructure. Without such a disruptive force, the market is more likely to experience corrections and cycles rather than outright collapse. How are Institutional Inflows Reshaping the BTC Price? One of the most significant narratives driving Bitcoin’s recent rally, according to Sygnum’s analysis, is the surging wave of institutional inflows . The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States has opened the floodgates for traditional finance players to gain exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated and familiar wrapper. This shift is profoundly impacting the supply-demand dynamics of the asset: Institutional Inflows and Supply Reduction: Increased Demand: Large institutional players, including asset managers, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds, are now able to allocate capital to Bitcoin more easily. Their significant capital pools translate into substantial buying pressure. Liquidity Absorption: As these institutions accumulate Bitcoin, they effectively ‘soak up’ available liquidity from the market. Unlike retail investors who might trade frequently, institutions often adopt a longer-term holding strategy, reducing the circulating supply available for purchase. Supply Shock Potential: Given Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins and the halving events that reduce new supply, sustained institutional buying could lead to a supply shock. If demand from these large entities continues to outstrip the rate at which new Bitcoin is mined, the BTC price could experience significant upward pressure. This dynamic creates a bullish feedback loop: rising institutional interest validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, attracting more traditional capital, which in turn reinforces its scarcity and pushes the price higher. This structural shift in demand makes a full-scale Bitcoin crash less probable in the absence of a catastrophic external shock, as there’s a strong underlying bid from sophisticated investors. Navigating the Evolving Crypto Market: What Does This Mean for You? The insights from Sygnum highlight a maturing crypto market where institutional participation is becoming a dominant force. For investors, this implies a few key takeaways: Distinguish Corrections from Crashes: Be prepared for market corrections, even significant ones, as they are a natural part of asset cycles. However, understand that these are distinct from a systemic collapse triggered by a black swan event . Monitor Institutional Activity: Keep an eye on reports regarding institutional Bitcoin purchases and ETF flows. These metrics can provide valuable insights into ongoing demand trends and their potential impact on the BTC price . Long-Term Perspective: The influence of institutional inflows suggests a more stable, albeit still volatile, long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Short-term fluctuations may persist, but the underlying trend appears to be strengthening due to significant capital commitments. Risk Management: While the likelihood of a major Bitcoin crash is deemed low without extreme catalysts, prudent risk management remains paramount. Diversification and investing only what you can afford to lose are timeless principles that apply equally to the crypto space. Conclusion: Resilience in a Maturing Market Katalin Tischhauser’s analysis from Sygnum provides a compelling argument for Bitcoin’s inherent resilience in the face of typical market volatility. While a significant price correction remains a possibility, the robust influence of institutional inflows is creating a fundamental shift in the supply-demand dynamics, making a systemic Bitcoin crash far less likely without the occurrence of an unforeseen and devastating black swan event . As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these underlying forces is crucial for navigating its complexities and making informed investment decisions. Bitcoin appears to be transitioning from a purely speculative asset to one increasingly underpinned by substantial institutional capital, fostering a new era of stability and growth.

2025-06-27T13:00:26,"Bitcoin Lockdown: 14 Million BTC Now In Cold Storage As Holders Dig In","According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, more than 14 million Bitcoin have sat idle in wallets with little to no spending history. That leaves only about 7 million BTC out of the total 21 million supply ready for trading. This shift points to a growing number of holders who prefer long-term storage over quick trades. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Steep Rise In Illiquid Bitcoin Based on reports, the illiquid supply of Bitcoin climbed from just under 14 million in December 2024—when Bitcoin first broke the $100K mark—to roughly 14.30 million today. Demand for cold storage and self-custody solutions has never been higher. Investors are moving coins off exchanges and into private wallets. That trend has been especially sharp since late March, even though price swings have stayed volatile. Bitcoin’s illiquid supply just crossed 14 million $BTC More and more holders are pulling coins off exchanges choosing cold storage over quick trades. The message is clear: conviction is growing, and they’re here for the long haul. #Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoHODL pic.twitter.com/bQozg31mBK — Erica Hazel (@Erica__Hazel) June 26, 2025 Corporate Buyers Ramp Up Holdings In just the past week, more than five companies announced new Bitcoin purchases. ProCap BTC led the way with two buys: 3,724 BTC for $387 million and 1,208 BTC for $128 million, adding up to 4,930 BTC worth $515 million. Michael Saylor’s Strategy added 245 BTC after spending $1 billion the week before. Smarter Web picked up 197 BTC, while Méliuz S.A. acquired 275 BTC, taking its total to 596 BTC. The Blockchain Group chipped in with 75 BTC, bringing its haul to 1,728 BTC. Most recently, Metaplanet spent around $132 million on 1,234 BTC, lifting its total Bitcoin stash to 12,345 BTC purchased for about $1.20 billion. Supply Numbers Tighten Only one-third of Bitcoin’s fixed supply remains “liquid,” meaning it’s likely to trade hands. That squeeze could make it harder for new buyers to find inventory. Over-the-counter desks and exchange order books report thinner BTC listings. When institutions can’t source coins as easily, they may bid prices higher. On-chain metrics can’t tell us why coins are unmoved—some may be lost forever—but the uptick in self-custody transfers shows real demand. Related Reading: TRUMP Token In Trouble?

2025-06-27T13:00:00,"Bakkt Eyes Crypto Purchases with Potential  $1 Billion Raise","Bakkt made this move despite financial uncertainty and a sharp year-to-date decline in its stock price. In the UK, The Smarter Web Company raised £41.2 million just days after buying nearly 200 BTC, growing its holdings to over 543 Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Genius Group plans to use some of the proceeds from two billion-dollar lawsuits to buy up to 5,000 BTC and pay shareholder dividends. Overall, it is clear that several companies are making strategic moves into Bitcoin as part of their corporate treasury strategies. Bakkt Could Enter Bitcoin Market Bakkt Holdings Inc., the crypto-focused subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, made a bold financial move by filing a Form S-3 with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing outlines the company’s intent to raise up to $1 billion through a variety of securities offerings, including Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or combinations thereof. This capital may be used to purchase Bitcoin and other digital assets, which means that the company is seriously considering a shift in its treasury strategy. Earlier this month, Bakkt updated its investment policy to allow for allocations into digital assets. While the company has not yet made any cryptocurrency purchases, the filing indicates that it may do so using excess cash or proceeds from the forthcoming securities offerings. This approach aligns with the broader trend among tech and finance companies incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Bakkt said that any future acquisitions of crypto assets will be determined based on market conditions, business performance, capital market receptivity, and other strategic factors. However, this ambitious plan comes at a precarious time for Bakkt. The company admitted in the same filing that it faces financial uncertainty, and stated that it has a limited operating history and ongoing operational losses. Moreover, the firm disclosed that it “identified conditions and events that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” This means that raising new capital will be crucial to stabilize its financial footing. Bakkt YTD share price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite these challenges, Bakkt saw a modest 3% uptick in its share price on Thursday, closing at $13.33. Still, the stock is down 46% since the beginning of the year, partly due to the loss of major clients like Bank of America and Webull, which chose not to renew their commercial agreements. Nonetheless, Bakkt is still optimistic about the future of digital assets. The company recently shared its excitement about a wave of upcoming crypto IPOs, including filings from Circle, eToro, and Gemini. In a post on X , Bakkt described these developments as positive indicators that suggest growing institutional momentum and maturity in the crypto market. UK Firm Ramps Up Bitcoin and Raises Millions The Smarter Web Company, a UK-based web design and marketing firm, also recently raised £41.2 million from institutional investors just days after making a large Bitcoin purchase. The capital was secured through an accelerated bookbuild process and a subscription offering, allowing the company to raise £36.27 million from the bookbuild and an additional £4.97 million from subscription participants. The shares were offered at a price of £2.90 ($3.98) each, with the new stock expected to take effect from July 1. This fundraising effort closely followed the company’s announcement that it bought 196.8 Bitcoin at an average price of $103,290 per BTC. It ended up spending over $20 million on the purchase. As of Tuesday, The Smarter Web Company held a total of 543.52 Bitcoin, which was acquired at an average price of $104,450. This means that its crypto treasury has a valuation of around $58.19 million based on current prices. The company has been actively growing its Bitcoin holdings, and increased its stack by 460.28 BTC in June alone. At the end of May, the firm held only 83.24 BTC. The company began its Bitcoin treasury strategy in April, although it has accepted Bitcoin as a form of payment since 2023. Despite these aggressive moves into the digital asset space, its stock performance has shown volatility. The Smarter Web Company trades on the OTCQB market in the United States under the ticker TSWCF. On Thursday, its shares declined by 15%, closing at $3.56 after reaching an intraday low of $3.19. In after-hours trading, the stock slipped an additional 1.8% to $3.49. Nevertheless, the company’s shares are still up 270+% year-to-date. Smarter Web Company YTD share price (Source: Google Finance ) Other UK firms are also jumping into Bitcoin despite the country’s regulatory ambiguity around digital assets. On Tuesday, London-listed Bitcoin treasury firm Vinanz announced the acquisition of 37.72 BTC. Meanwhile, investment firm Abraxas Capital made headlines in April with a $250 million Bitcoin purchase. Genius Group Plans Bitcoin Boost from Lawsuit Wins Other firms are finding creative ways to stock up on crypto. Genius Group, an artificial intelligence-driven education technology firm, announced plans to distribute any proceeds from ongoing billion-dollar lawsuits directly to shareholders while allocating a large portion to expanding its Bitcoin treasury. In a press release that was issued on Thursday, the company’s board of directors approved a strategy to repurpose potential winnings from two legal cases seeking over $1 billion in combined damages. One of the lawsuits has already been filed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), targeting LZGI International with claims exceeding $750 million. The second lawsuit, according to CEO Roger Hamilton , is expected to be filed soon. Based on 2023 figures, Genius Group estimates damages of at least $262 million, although the amount could grow as it accounts for potential harm from 2024 and 2025. Hamilton explained that the legal actions are designed to recover shareholder value lost due to alleged misconduct by the defendants. He also affirmed the board's position that any recovered funds should be used solely to benefit shareholders. Under the proposed distribution model, 50% of any legal winnings will be paid out as a special dividend, while the remaining 50% would be allocated to purchasing Bitcoin for the company’s treasury. If Genius Group successfully wins both cases, the payout will amount to approximately $7 per share, and the firm would acquire around 5,000 Bitcoin based on current market prices. The company clarified, however, that there is no guarantee of winning either case or receiving any proceeds. Genius Group has already made moves to build its Bitcoin holdings. In fact, it increased its treasury by over 50% in June through a series of acquisitions. The company is targeting a total of 1,000 BTC for its corporate treasury.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9734/bakkt-eyes-crypto-purchases-with-potential-1-billion-raise,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

In a recent post, Lord XRP described a video clip as a perfect demonstration of how crucial XRP has become to the financial sector. He further stated that XRP is already indispensable and acknowledged the significant progress made in recent years. His post concluded with the assertion that Ripple will be the solution moving forward. THIS IS A PERFECT CLIP TO SHOW HOW IMPORTANT #XRP IS FOR THE FINANCIAL SECTOR. ITS ALREDY INDISPENSABLE. WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE RECENT YEARS #RIPPLE WILL BE THE ANSWER! pic.twitter.com/rT4oBzQXzj — Lord XRP (@Bitforcoinz) June 25, 2025 Insights from Global Financial Leaders The video attached to the post features key remarks from influential figures in the financial world, including Christine Lagarde, who previously served as France’s Minister for Economic Affairs, Finance, and Employment. Lagarde confirmed that central banks globally have collectively decided to implement digital currencies, indicating that central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are moving from concept to reality. Her statement underscores a major shift towards the adoption of digital financial infrastructure. A second speaker in the video explained that although digital currencies may still seem unconventional to some, they are rapidly moving into the mainstream. He noted that major banks are fully aware of this transformation and are actively investing in the necessary technology. According to him, these institutions are prepared to offer digital currency-related services as soon as it becomes financially viable for them. This perspective reflects the ongoing evolution of traditional banking systems to accommodate digital assets and blockchain technology. Ripple’s Approach to Solving Financial Problems Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse also featured in the video, providing a clear summary of Ripple’s role in the financial landscape. Garlinghouse explained that Ripple offers a suite of technologies designed to help banks and regulated financial institutions settle cross-border transactions more efficiently. He highlighted that Ripple’s solutions dramatically accelerate transaction settlements between financial institutions. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Garlinghouse addressed comparisons between Ripple and Bitcoin , stating that being compared to Bitcoin could be considered a compliment if Ripple is indeed solving real problems at scale. He emphasized the importance of distinguishing between genuine utility and mere hype within the cryptocurrency space. In another part of the video, a speaker asked Garlinghouse whether being compared to Bitcoin should be seen as a compliment. Garlinghouse responded by reiterating that solving meaningful problems in the financial sector is the key metric for success, rather than simply chasing speculative attention. Community Reactions Reflect Broader Sentiments A user commenting on Lord XRP’s post expressed both optimism and frustration. The user acknowledged that Ripple and XRP have made substantial progress in establishing new partnerships across the financial industry. However, they questioned why this growth has not yet translated into significant price movement for XRP. The commenter also wondered why legal proceedings, particularly decisions from the presiding judge, continue to delay progress in terms of market performance. Lord XRP’s post, along with the perspectives shared in the video, highlights the continued integration of blockchain solutions, such as XRP, into mainstream finance. The statements made by leaders such as Christine Lagarde and Brad Garlinghouse underline how the financial sector is steadily embracing digital assets, reinforcing the narrative that XRP plays an increasingly vital role in the transformation of global finance.

In a recent feat, Solana has signed an MoU with Kazakhstan to launch Central Asia’s first Solana Economic Zone. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 51.75% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

With RSI at 46.21 and price trading below the 20-day SMA at $148.56, SOL shows consolidation signs. The Bollinger Bands indicate a potential range, with the lower bound at $132, suggesting a potential low of $130. If bulls reclaim the 20-day SMA, the average price may hover around $150, and in a bullish breakout, the potential high could reach $165. Overall, price action remains range-bound barring major volume inflows. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $130 $150 $165 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.14 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $460M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

2025-06-27T12:19:39,"Kenya Proposes Joint Crypto Regulatory Body as Nation Eyes Leadership in African Crypto Space","The post Kenya Proposes Joint Crypto Regulatory Body as Nation Eyes Leadership in African Crypto Space appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With the cryptocurrency market booming in 2025, Kenya has taken a major step toward regulating digital assets. The country’s National Assembly Finance and Planning Committee has proposed the formation of a multi-agency regulatory framework to oversee crypto operations, marking a pivotal moment for the region’s virtual asset industry. Kenya’s New Crypto Regulatory Framework Driven by the explosive growth of the crypto sector, Kenyan lawmakers are moving quickly to establish oversight mechanisms. The proposed framework brings together five key government agencies to regulate Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs): Central Bank of Kenya Capital Markets Authority Competition Authority of Kenya Communications Authority of Kenya Office of the Data Protection Commissioner These bodies will collectively regulate various aspects of the crypto ecosystem, including market conduct, data protection, and digital infrastructure. Why Kenya Introduced This Crypto Proposal The proposal stems from a recommendation by Credence Sfrica, a social enterprise organization, which called for a cross-sectoral regulatory team to supervise the rapidly expanding crypto market. The initiative is now open for public feedback, as the Finance Committee aims to build a collaborative and transparent crypto policy. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) Bill Gains Momentum Introduced on April 4, 2025, the Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASP) Bill has received strong support from key players in the crypto industry. The Virtual Asset Chamber (VAC) praised the bill but recommended removing a controversial clause that allowed regulators to conduct off-site surveillance of VASPs without clear boundaries. The committee agreed with the VAC and has amended the bill accordingly. [post_titles_links postid=”475547″] Kenya Aims to Become Africa’s Crypto Hub Kenya is positioning itself as a crypto leader in Africa, moving past its earlier caution. The new VASP Bill is designed to strengthen financial transparency, accountability, and combat illicit financial flows. Lawmakers believe it will help protect consumers and legitimize the crypto space in the country. Key Requirement for VASPs If the bill is passed, all entities engaging in crypto operations in Kenya will be required to obtain a local license approved by the five regulatory agencies. These licensed VASPs must also implement internal policies to identify and manage conflicts of interest and report such matters to authorities. “This Bill puts a strong emphasis on conflict prevention and proper management among virtual asset providers,” said MP Kimani Kuria . “It requires entities to establish effective internal controls to ensure transparency and accountability.” Final Thoughts As Kenya prepares to pass its first comprehensive crypto regulation , it sends a clear signal of intent: the nation is serious about embracing digital finance while safeguarding its citizens. If implemented successfully, this could place Kenya at the forefront of Africa’s blockchain revolution.

2025-06-27T12:19:18,"XRP Surpasses BTC, ETH in This Surprising Metric Despite SEC Lawsuit Roadblock","TL:DR Ripple’s lawsuit resolution against the US SEC will have to wait even longer as Judge Torres denied the two parties’ joint motion for an indicative ruling. However, this seemingly negative development has turned the community bullish on XRP, according to data from Santiment. With crypto moving sideways, retail optimism toward Bitcoin & Ethereum has died down a bit. Meanwhile, XRP sentiment is currently at a 17-day high, in terms of positive vs. negative commentary. This has happened after a $50M settlement between Ripple & the SEC was stalled. pic.twitter.com/zJctKgEiPf — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 27, 2025 As the analytics company informed, the bullish vs. bearish posts on social media in regards to the fourth-largest cryptocurrency have skyrocketed to a 17-day high. Consequently, XRP has surpassed the two biggest digital assets by market cap, bitcoin and ether, both of which are performing a lot better in terms of price actions in the past week or so. BTC managed to reclaim the $100,000 line after its brief hiatus below it and now sits at around $107,000 as the geopolitical environment in the Middle East improved. ETH also recovered from its substantial slump and is back to $2,400. In contrast, XRP’s price has been trading downward for weeks and is currently below $2.1 after another 3-4% daily drop. The latest setback took place yesterday following Judge Torres’s decision to deny the joint motion filed by Ripple and the SEC for a quicker resolution in their lawsuit. Nevertheless, it’s not all doom and gloom as the XRP token saw a major adoption announcement earlier this week, as you can check here .

2025-06-27T12:10:37,"Ethereum Price Surge Above $2,500—But Is a Pullback Coming?","The post Ethereum Price Surge Above $2,500—But Is a Pullback Coming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Recently, this final week of June, the Ethereum price has demonstrated a powerful spike, decisively breaking above and re-testing the crucial $2,500 mark. This upward movement reflects a notable price action in ETH crypto driven by a confluence of factors that signal strong bullish sentiment, but also caution against potential short-term volatility has appeared as it began consolidating in $2400- $2500 range. Even popular analyst Degen Hardy noted with caution that he will stay long on ETH as long as it remains above the $2,400 mark. As he believes in the short term, if $2400 is taken out, it will mean that bulls are struggling to reclaim untapped weekly highs. As the second-largest cryptocurrency with $295 billion market cap commands attention, as understanding these underlying forces is crucial for traders and investors alike. Keep reading to know more. Shifting Sentiment and the Impact of Short Squeezes A recent study from a CryptoQuant analyst reported a shift in funding rates on Binance, moving from negative to positive territory. Indicating leveraged long positions are aggressively betting on a continued ETH price rise. Per the analyst, this reflects widespread optimism, but it also raises severe concerns of the market turning into “overheating,” where further increases could precede with a short-term correction. Inflows Signal Potential Selling Pressure Analyst further adds that on-chain data presents a cautionary note, despite the recent strong price action, which was primarily driven by geopolitical ease with war-involved countries agreeing to a ceasefire. As the data reveals, Binance witnessed an inflow of 177,000 ETH over three consecutive days. This movement of ETH crypto onto exchanges has higher odds that some large holders may be preparing to take profits or reallocate their assets. [post_titles_links postid=”475660″] Ethereum Awaiting Correction In Short-Term Outlook Ethereum’s spike clearly highlights the aggressive speculative activity, but the simultaneous and substantial inflow of ETH crypto onto Binance points to a looming possibility of selling pressure, too. Even analysts like Hardy are cautious and willing to close their running positions if bulls can’t push higher in the short term. This increases the likelihood of a dip coming, as the market might aim to normalize the current overheated funding dynamics. $ETH UPDATE Still in my LONG position as long as we hold above this zone ($2.4K) Will cut it if we break down, bulls are struggling to get to the untapped weekly above. Watching closely, lock in profits if you haven't done so already. pic.twitter.com/Psg9VdF7I4 — Hardy (@Degen_Hardy) June 27, 2025 While a retracement might be on the horizon in the short term, the underlying long-term bullish structure of Ethereum crypto price appears intact. In addition, if the box’s lower border is breached, then short-term fall will pull ETH price to June 22nd low at $2120, but if the upper border is pierced, then the minimum aim is set at $2620.
