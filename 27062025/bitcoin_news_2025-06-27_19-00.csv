2025-06-27T16:55:54,"Asian Crime Syndicates Tap Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Other Lenders To Launder Billions Siphoned in Pig Butchering Scams: Report","Reputable financial institutions have reportedly served as stations in the multistep money laundering process that transports funds from US scam victims to crime syndicates in Asia. ProPublica reports that Asian crime syndicates behind pig butchering scams tap on the services of financial titans like Bank of America, Chase, Citibank, HSBC and Wells Fargo, along with many other U.S. and foreign lenders, to convert the proceeds of their illicit operation into crypto. Pig butchering, a scheme in which scammers build a relationship with their targeted victims to financially exploit them, siphons some $44 billion per year. Chinese gangs that operate in prison-like compounds in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar often carry out this scam. The report says that black market bank accounts are thriving because of this fraud, with Chinese-language channels on the messaging service platform Telegram offering to rent US bank accounts to pig butchering scammers. The bad actors need the bank accounts to move stolen funds. Although fraudulent transactions now use cryptocurrency, the typical consumer does not own this asset, so many scams involve getting the victim to wire money through traditional banks. The swindlers receive the funds in their account, then convert them into crypto to send overseas. Later, they exchange the digital assets for standard currency. In a statement to ProPublica, the American Bankers Association, which represents the industry, says banks cannot completely filter out scammers despite their efforts to stop fraud. “With more than 140 million bank accounts opened every year bad actors can sometimes get through despite determined and ongoing efforts to stop them. They hide their true identities, exploit the good names and reputations of banks and other responsible companies, and abuse shell corporations to facilitate moving their ill-gotten gains away from their victims.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-27T16:48:35,"Top 5 Crypto PR Agencies for Market Dominance in 2025","As capital surges back into the digital asset space, crypto projects are playing for dominance. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) attracted over $585 million in inflows, driven by the explosive success of U.S.-approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Overall, global crypto funds drew a record-breaking $44.2 billion in 2024, signaling sustained institutional conviction. Governments and regulators have taken notice. The U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , announced in March, marked a symbolic shift toward treating digital assets as macroeconomic tools. Meanwhile, Europe’s MiCA framework has solidified legal footing for crypto operations across the continent. In this environment, founders launching tokens, protocols, or AI-integrated DeFi tools are aiming to own their category. That means showing up first, often, and everywhere: in search results, media headlines, Google Discover feeds, and regional news cycles. A new class of crypto-native PR firms go beyond conventional media placement. They deliver SEO-optimized, narrative-driven saturation campaigns engineered for rapid market capture and lasting attention. The five firms below are leading that charge in 2025.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) What does “market dominance” mean in crypto PR? Market dominance refers to a crypto project’s ability to own its narrative and visibility across multiple platforms—from Google search and Discover to media headlines and community channels—achieving recognition, traffic, and influence beyond competitors in a short timeframe. Why is PR so critical for crypto projects in 2025? With institutional capital returning, regulatory clarity improving, and token issuance accelerating, attention has become the most scarce and valuable asset. Effective PR ensures your project is consistently seen, understood, and trusted by the right audiences—before, during, and after launch. How is crypto PR different from traditional tech PR? Crypto PR must navigate faster news cycles, decentralized communities, market-fit narratives, and platform-specific nuances like Google Discover and Web3-native media outlets. The top agencies like Outset PR specialize in these dynamics, which traditional PR firms often struggle to address. Which agency is best for early-stage token launches? Outset PR is best positioned for early-stage and emerging token projects that need rapid recognition, traffic, and trust-building through media saturation, SEO strategies, and performance-led content delivery.

2025-06-27T16:45:09,"Record Hodl Move from Bitcoin's Long-Term Investors! Why Whales Aren't Selling? Here's the Latest Data","Bitcoin long-term investors are experiencing one of the strongest accumulation periods in history. Record HODL Move by Bitcoin Long-Term Investors: Monthly Accumulation of 800K BTC Onchain analytics platform CryptoQuant announced that long-term investors have accumulated a net 800,000 BTC in the past 30 days, the highest monthly increase ever recorded. LTHs, i.e. investors who have held their BTC for at least six months without selling, are refraining from selling even as prices reach new highs in 2025. This trend points to a strengthening of the “hodl” spirit in market psychology. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost noted in his analysis published on Thursday that this move is a signal that should not be ignored: “The signal from LTHs this week is quite significant. Such accumulation increases have only been seen six times, the last two of which were precursors to major price increases in July 2021 and September 2024.” The average purchase price of new LTH positions is between $95,000 and $107,000, making this price band a key support zone for analysts. Accumulation in this area suggests that the price could remain strong at these levels. Short-Term Investors Eye $93,000 On the other hand, short-term investors (STH – Short-Term Holders) also play a critical role in the market structure. According to Cointelegraph’s analysis, the average cost of STH is just under $100,000, and this area often acts as support during bull market corrections. Onchain analytics firm Glassnode noted that the $98,000-$93,000 range is critical throughout this week: “As long as the price stays above this range, the bull market structure remains intact. However, if it breaks below this support, a deeper correction could be triggered, especially if investors with costs in this area start panic selling.” The behavior of both short-term and long-term investors in Bitcoin plays a critical role in the sustainability of the current market structure. The aggressive accumulation of long-term investors and the support level formed in the $93,000-107,000 band give hope for the continuation of the bull market. However, any breakout below these levels could reverse the market momentum. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Record Hodl Move from Bitcoin's Long-Term Investors!

2025-06-27T16:32:09,"Bitcoin Miners' Daily Income Drops to Three-Month Low! Is Selling Pressure Coming? Here Are the Details","While daily income of Bitcoin miners dropped significantly in June, according to CryptoQuant data, selling pressure is not yet felt in the market. Despite the decrease in income, miners continue to accumulate BTC. Bitcoin Miner Revenues at 2-Month Low, But No Selling Pressure According to the weekly report shared by CryptoQuant, the daily income of Bitcoin miners fell to $34 million on June 22, reaching the lowest level since April. This level stands out as one of the weakest earnings in the last year. The decline was driven by lower transaction fees and Bitcoin prices trading near local lows, weakening miners’ incentives to stay online. The Bitcoin network’s total processing power, hashrate, has fallen by 3.5% since June 16, the sharpest pullback since July 2024. While this suggests increasing pressure on miners whose profit margins have been squeezed post-halving, the expected panic selling has yet to materialize. The amount of BTC leaving miner wallets has decreased from 23,000 BTC per day in February to around 6,000 BTC currently. No major transfers to exchanges were observed either. Long-term investors, especially those known as “Satoshi-era miners” who produced coins in the early years of Bitcoin (2009-2011), are also maintaining their positions. While only 150 BTC were sold from these wallets in 2025, this figure was around 10,000 BTC in 2024. On the other hand, wallets that usually belong to medium-sized operations, mining addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC, have added another 4,000 BTC since March, bringing their balance to the highest level since November 2024. Long-Term Expectations Dominate According to CryptoQuant, instead of selling, miners are determined to either burn through their cash reserves or wait for prices to recover. The report stated: “This clearly shows that there is no selling pressure from miners at current price levels.” Although revenues are down, Bitcoin miners’ refrain from selling is largely limiting potential selling pressure in the market, suggesting that Bitcoin is finding support at current levels and that long-term bullish prospects remain. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC) is also riding high, having broken back above the $106,000 resistance. Will Bitcoin be the next to attain an all-time high? S&P 500 all-time high - still climbing Source: TradingView The S&P 500 on the weekly time frame shows the complete recovery for the biggest Wall Street companies. The new all-time high pushes the index to 6,177 points, well beyond the 6,000 points resistance, and a good way higher than the previous 6,147 all-time high. With the weekly close just a few hours away, it remains to be seen how much higher the price might go. As can be noted in the chart above, the price is approaching an ascending trendline. Given that the Stochastic RSI indicators (bottom of chart) are beginning to top out, there may be some sideways, accumulative price action to come, with the possibility of a dip, possibly back to the region of 5,700 if 6,000 does not hold. $BTC nears top of channel Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC reveals how the price is being maintained inside the descending channel. The last swing low may have put the fear of God into some investors, as the price hit a low of $98,300. Be that as it may, the price bounced well from there, and is now near the top of the channel. The price could still hit the top of this channel, but the odds are that some sideways and downwards price action could follow from here, allowing the shorter term Stochastic RSIs to reset back to the bottom. The 4-hour Stochastic RSI is already there, and therefore this might provide the momentum needed to touch the top of the channel first. $BTC bull flag has emerged Source: TradingView The daily time frame for $BTC illustrates that the descending channel is probably a bull flag. This makes things even more bullish. If the price can emerge from the top of this flag and confirm above, the next step higher can begin. Bullish weekly Stochastic RSI close Source: TradingView All eyes need to be on the weekly time frame. While there may be one last dip down to come, to the strong supports at $106,000 or $104,000, there could be a bullish close of the Stochastic RSI. If the indicators can continue to flatten out, this augurs well for the following week, where we might see them cross back up, and with this, an impending breakout.

2025-06-27T16:22:04,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price surpass previous ATH?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction toward $0.55. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious. In this outlook, we’ll assess how Pi’s price has responded to recent events and provide an informative Pi network price prediction model from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.5575 Price Change 24h -2.8% Market Cap $4.1 Circulating Supply 7.44B PI Trading Volume 24h $217.6M All-Time High $2.98 (Feb 26, 2025) All-Time Low $0.4012 (Apr 05, 2025) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.546 Price Prediction $ 0.477123 (-25.39%) Fear & Greed Index 62 (Greed) Sentiment Neutral Volatility 22.32% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 41.98 Pi Price Analysis Pi hits resistance at $0.58, indicating that it is holding back the new bullish trend. RSI crosses the overbought territory, indicating reduced buyer strength in the daily frame. The MACD histogram is weakening, pointing to buying pressure in short-term charts. On June 27, 2025, the Pi Network sells at $0.5575 and reflects a pullback following an unsuccessful rally. The level of resistance is found at $0.58, and the immediate support is at $0.54. A decline below this line may cause additional losses. Pi 1-day chart shows weakening momentum as Pi Network struggles below key resistance Pi Network (PI/USDT) fell 2.84% to approximately $0.5575 in value. This was after an upward rally since buyers bounced off the $0.66 rejection area, and sellers took control. The relative strength index (RSI) oscillator currently stands at a daily reading of 37.19, and it is well below the 50 neutral level, thus indicating rising bearish momentum. The indicator indicates that the asset is approaching the oversold area, exposing it to further fluctuations in the downward direction. At the same time, the daily MACD demonstrates declining bullish momentum. The MACD line crossed upwards through the signal line, that is 0.0076 compared to -0.0309 now. Yet the bars in the histogram are weakening, showing that there is a possible break and an absence of purchasing power. In case of further weakness, Pi can challenge the significant support at the level of $0.54. Pi Price Chart Pi/USDT 4-hour price chart The 4-hour diagram of Pi Network (PI/USDT) reveals attempts at short-term consolidation following a strong fall on this chart. The price is standing around 0.5569 now and has had a minor rise of 0.20 per cent in the last four hours. This slight increase indicates less selling pressure, though it is not yet confirmation of recovery. The 4-hour RSI is 47.62, which is less than 50, indicating that there is no solid bullish pressure developing. But the RSI average is still quite high at 58.32, with some buyers still lingering in the recent trading sessions. The MACD line stands at -0.0065 under the signal line 0.0101. Although this indicates continued bearish pressure, the histogram is starting to fade, pointing to a possible slowing down in the bearish pressure.

The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.72 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline.

This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

The new vehicle, first available with bitcoin BTC and ether ETH, will trade on the Coinbase Derivatives Exchange, a CFTC-regulated venue. Unlike offshore perpetuals, which dominate global crypto derivatives markets but are not approved in the U.S., Coinbase’s instruments are structured as long-dated futures with five-year expirations. They incorporate a funding rate mechanism that accrues hourly and is settled twice daily to mimic the price dynamics of perpetual swaps. Trading will be available 24/7 and settlements will be handled through regulated clearing. Separately, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the company also accumulates bitcoin on a regular basis as an investment. ""We're buying more bitcoin every week. Long Bitcoin,"" Armstrong said in a Thursday X post in response to David Bailey, CEO of the bitcoin treasury firm Nakamoto Holdings . This comes after Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas revealed in the first quarter 2025 earnings call that the firm purchased $150 million in crypto, predominantly bitcoin.

2025-06-27T16:00:12,"Bitcoin Braces For Fed Shake-Up As Trump Eyes Powell Exit","Bitcoin held steady Friday as traders braced for a potential shake-up at the Federal Reserve. United States President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell, a move that could shift the central bank’s approach to interest rates and market liquidity. The Dow Jones climbed more than 300 points midweek, and the ripple reached the crypto market too—Bitcoin nudged higher to around 106,950 before easing slightly. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Markets are reading this as a signal. If Powell is pushed out in favor of someone more open to cutting rates, risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum could benefit. The US dollar slipped to a three-year low, and bond yields retreated, adding to the sense that easier money may be coming. For crypto investors, this is a setup worth watching. The #USD fell to a three-year low on intensifying speculation that President Trump could soon nominate a new Fed Chair to replace Powell after his term ends next May, a development that could render him a lame duck writes @johnjhardy in today’s #forex update.… — Ole S Hansen (@Ole_S_Hansen) June 26, 2025 Trump Moves Toward Possible Fed Overhaul Reports from multiple outlets say Trump is seriously considering replacing Powell before his term ends in 2026. Though no official announcement has been made, sources suggest Trump has discussed potential successors with advisors. His criticism of Powell’s policies isn’t new, but the recent rise in inflation concerns and election-year pressure may be accelerating the timeline. The market response was immediate. Traders began to price in a more dovish Fed policy, which generally means lower interest rates and increased liquidity. That would be good news for crypto, which has languished under tighter monetary conditions throughout the last year. Bitcoin, which is often used as a hedge against fiat debasement, likes to rally when the dollar declines and rates come down. Bitcoin Price Reacts With Caution Bitcoin was trading at 106,950 Friday, with a daily high of 107,250 and a low of 106,145. It wasn’t a breakout, but it was a clear sign of rising interest. Ethereum and other top coins saw similar quiet moves upward. Traders are treading carefully, knowing that talk of replacing the Fed chair is one thing, but actually doing it is another. Stocks Lead The Way, Crypto Follows The bullish mood started with equities. The Dow surged more than 300 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also closed higher. Tech stocks led the rally, pushed by falling Treasury yields and hopes that rate hikes are off the table for now. That optimism spilled into crypto markets, where risk sentiment plays a big role.

2025-06-27T15:59:32,"Moscow Court Jails ‘Crypto Expert’ and Mother for $23M Bitcoin Scam","A Moscow court has sentenced a Russian woman, Valeria Fedyakina, to seven years in a penal colony for running a crypto scam that defrauded victims of $23 million worth of Bitcoin in just two months. Fedyakina, who reportedly branded herself as a cryptocurrency expert, orchestrated what prosecutors described as a pyramid scheme targeting investors in 2023. She was accused of promising quick returns through digital asset deals while ultimately draining clients’ funds. Moscow Court Sentences ‘Bitmama’ to 7 Years Over $23M Bitcoin Scam The scam involved at least four known victims and totaled around 2.2 billion rubles, approximately £17 million at the time, according to The Telegraph . Fedyakina reportedly told her clients that their money would be converted to cryptocurrency in Dubai, helping them avoid Russian sanctions. In return, she offered a 1% bonus on the transferred funds. But investigators say the promised returns never materialized. Instead, the funds disappeared soon after the transfers. A spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee said Fedyakina acted with intent to deceive. “Fedyakina had a criminal intent to steal money or cryptocurrency by deceiving an indefinite number of people,” the spokesperson said. “She did so under the guise of investing in her activities in the transportation and purchase and sale of oil, oil products, gold, and other minerals.” Russian media reports did not link the stolen funds to any specific international cause, but some sources outside the country claimed prosecutors believed some of the money may have been transferred to Ukraine. Those claims have not been independently verified, and Russian outlets reporting on the case made no mention of them. Fedyakina’s defense team denied the fraud charges. They insisted she supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and had expressed willingness to financially support the Russian military. She was arrested in 2023 while attempting to leave Russia for the United Arab Emirates. At the time of her detention, Fedyakina was six months pregnant. She later gave birth in a maternity hospital before being returned to custody. On June 24, the Presnensky District Court in Moscow delivered the final judgment. Despite her appeals, she was sentenced to seven years in prison and ordered to repay 2.2 billion rubles to her victims. Due to inflation, the compensation amount is now estimated at around £20 million. Fedyakina had marketed herself under the nickname “Bitmama,” claiming she ran global operations and could deliver massive returns in cryptocurrency. Prosecutors said it was all a front designed to lure in investors and steal their funds under the promise of sanctioned-proof crypto trading. The sentencing marks one of the largest crypto fraud cases in Russia in recent years and adds to growing scrutiny over unregulated crypto schemes in the country. Russia Intensifies Crypto Crackdown with Arrests, Seizures, and Hydra-Linked Investigations The sentencing of a so-called “crypto expert” and her mother in Moscow for a $23 million Bitcoin scam is just one piece of a much broader crackdown by Russian authorities on crypto-related crimes. In recent months, Russian law enforcement has intensified efforts to trace, seize, and prosecute crypto assets linked to illicit activity. On June 2, investigators confiscated $8.2 million worth of crypto from Dmitry Pavlov, a key figure in the now-defunct Hydra darknet market. Pavlov, who admitted to managing the platform’s servers, reportedly earned his crypto “salary and bonuses” for maintaining Hydra’s infrastructure. Prosecutors say he held the coins, anticipating price growth, rather than converting them to fiat. Hydra, once a dominant player on the darknet, is believed to have facilitated over $5 billion in crypto transactions before being dismantled . In December, a Moscow court sentenced 16 individuals involved in Hydra’s operations , with mastermind Stanislav Moiseev receiving a life sentence. Stanislav Moiseev, the mastermind behind the notorious online black market Hydra, has been handed a life sentence by a Russian court. #Hydra #Crypto https://t.co/9uuAfft63K — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2024 The crackdown has also extended to illegal crypto mining. On June 3, police in Amur Oblast seized ₽7 million (~$88K) in BTC from a former power company official who operated unauthorized mining rigs. Two weeks later, officials shut down a large-scale farm in Krasnoyarsk Krai , which earned over ₽4.6 million (~$58K) monthly by exploiting state-owned land. Together, the arrests, seizures, and undercover activity paint a stark picture of how deeply entangled crypto has become in Russia’s underground economy and how aggressively authorities are now moving against it.

2025-06-27T15:55:46,"Weekly Crypto Regulation News Roundup: June 23-27, 2025","Bitcoin roared back to life this week, climbing to $105,000 following a truce announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump on June 23 as crypto regulation efforts across the globe continue in full force. The digital asset briefly touched $106,000 before settling at its current level. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $105,064 — a welcome reprieve for investors who have weathered weeks of regulatory uncertainty and political tension. But it’s not just the price of Bitcoin making headlines this week. In Washington, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are ramping up their efforts to bring clarity and oversight to the U.S. crypto sector, with several key developments pointing to a turning point in digital asset regulation. Lummis: Two Crypto Bills Must Pass in 2025 Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a longtime proponent of responsible crypto legislation, has renewed her call for decisive action in Congress. Speaking with CNBC’s Joe Kernen on Squawk Box this week, Lummis emphasized the importance of passing both the GENIUS Act — focused on digital asset developments and user safety — and the much-anticipated crypto market structure bill. Senator Cynthia Lummis spoke with CNBC on Wednesday about the importance of passing crypto legislation before the year's end. #CynthiaLummis #CryptoLegislation https://t.co/dhmb7SKv6J — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 “I’m not saying combine them, but they both need to pass this year,” Lummis asserted, stressing the urgent need for legal clarity around stablecoins. Her remarks come amid bipartisan deliberations over how to reconcile separate House and Senate proposals into a unified framework that can win cross-chamber support. GOP Lays Groundwork for Crypto Market Rules In a separate but closely related development, senior Senate Republicans unveiled a set of foundational principles for digital asset regulation. Spearheaded by Senator Tim Scott (R-SC) , the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, the new guidelines aim to establish regulatory clarity while protecting investors. Senate GOP has laid out crypto market structure principles, clarifying regulation and oversight for digital assets. #CryptoRegulation #USSenate https://t.co/4hKf2Ktbim — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 “These principles will serve as an important baseline for negotiations on this bill,” said Scott, who was joined by Senators Thom Tillis, Bill Hagerty, and Cynthia Lummis in crafting the proposal. The document marks one of the clearest signs yet that the Senate is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue with the House on comprehensive crypto legislation. The GOP principles are expected to influence the upcoming round of congressional negotiations and could shape the next wave of policy that governs everything from token classifications to consumer protections and compliance requirements for stablecoin issuers. COIN Act Targets Regulation of Politicians’ Crypto Profits Meanwhile, the intersection of politics and crypto has triggered a legislative response of its own. Senator Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the COIN Act (Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure), which would ban presidents and their immediate families from issuing, sponsoring, or endorsing digital assets, including meme coins, NFTs, and stablecoins. Senator @SenAdamSchiff has introduced legislation that would bar the president, vice president, and their family members from crypto. #Crypto #Trump https://t.co/9niXxDMAc0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 The bill — clearly aimed at potential conflicts of interest — also mandates disclosure of any digital asset transactions exceeding $1,000. Violators could face up to five years in prison and civil penalties equivalent to the profits earned. Schiff’s legislation comes amid growing concerns over President Trump’s expanding involvement in the digital asset space. Trump-Linked Crypto Firm Prepares Stablecoin Audit Those concerns are far from hypothetical. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a cryptocurrency firm tied to Donald Trump, is stepping up efforts to bolster credibility. Co-founder Zak Folkman announced at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn that the company is preparing to release a third-party audit of its stablecoin holdings, alongside a new mobile app launch. Trump-linked crypto firm World Liberty Financial plans to release a stablecoin audit and debut a new app soon, co-founder Zak Folkman confirmed Wednesday. #Trump #WLFI https://t.co/yVPQqslR4F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 26, 2025 The audit, conducted by an independent accounting firm, is intended to boost transparency as WLFI faces mounting political and regulatory scrutiny. Folkman also hinted at upcoming changes to WLFI’s governance token, suggesting that enhanced token liquidity may be on the horizon. “I think everyone is going to be very, very happy,” he told the audience, stopping short of revealing concrete details. Trump Media Moves Ahead with $400M Buyback Rounding out the week’s Trump-crypto nexus, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. — the parent company of Truth Social — announced a $400 million share buyback plan. The buyback, approved by the board of directors, is positioned as a move to return value to shareholders while retaining strategic flexibility. @TrumpMediaTech has unveiled a $400M stock buyback and maintains a $2.3B Bitcoin reserve. #TrumpMedia #Bitcoin https://t.co/oCc9eMHuSo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 23, 2025 Also the company continues to guard a sizeable $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury, showing the president’s growing entanglement with the digital asset world. “The Board took a vote of confidence in our company, our stock, and our strategic plans,” said Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media. Crypto Regulation To Face Crossroads Ahead Taken together, these developments show a pivotal moment for U.S. crypto regulation. From legislative momentum in Congress to headline-making moves by politically connected crypto firms, the digital asset landscape is rapidly evolving. While price action may grab the headlines, it’s the slow grind of regulatory clarity that will ultimately determine the shape and success of the U.S. crypto market.

Both projects set for massive moves and big breakouts! $Pi $ICE $ION #Pi #ice #Ion https://t.co/Yg4QoARG1B pic.twitter.com/iRoPVJFeyu — zuzu (@PiGlobal314) June 25, 2025 Users started to speculate that Pi could be about to reveal a partnership with Google. To support that theory, X user @PiGlobal314 compared the imagery of Pi’s latest tweet with the logo of Gemini – the search engine’s proprietary generative AI model. Surprisingly, the token went up by 38% right after that rumor gained traction across social media platforms and messaging boards. A partnership with Google would support a bullish Pi Coin price prediction . If that’s the case and they announce it officially, how high could PI go? Pi Coin Price Prediction: Pi Hits Key Support at $0.56 – Time for the Next Leg Up? Pi’s 4-hour chart shows that the strong boost produced by these rumors pushed the token above its 200-period exponential moving average (EMA). Although the token’s rise to these levels was met with strong selling pressure once it got to $0.67, this bullish breakout is a strong indication that the trajectory of the price trend has changed from bearish to bullish. In the past 4 hours, Pi has found strong support at $0.56 and could use this level as a launchpad for its next leg up. The key driver for Pi’s move toward $0.70 again, or possibly to a higher level, would be confirmation of what the community has been speculating about. A partnership with Google would give Pi a much-needed credibility boost. With Google as a top backer or even partner, a plausible Pi Coin price prediction would estimate a move to $1 at least. In the meantime, analysts emphasize that well-established assets like Bitcoin (BTC) could outperform smaller projects like Pi. One of the hottest crypto presales of the year called BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) offers investors a way to generate passive income as the top crypto rises to make new all-time highs. BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) Introduces Innovative Rewards System Tied to Bitcoin’s Performance BTC Bull Token (BTCBULL) has created a fun way to earn Bitcoin tokens through a meme coin whose primary use case consists of distributing rewards to token holders. Its milestone-based roadmap is quite simple. Starting at a baseline price of $100,000, every time that BTC adds an additional $25,000 to its price, a new reward will be unlocked. The first milestone is set at $125,000, at which point a portion of BTCBULL’s circulating supply will be burned. This should produce an immediate increase in the price of this meme coin. Next up, once the price of Bitcoin hits $150,000, token holders will get a direct BTC airdrop. You can take advantage of BTCBULL’s discounted presale price and reap the highest return once this meme coin is officially launched. To buy the token, head to the BTC Bull Token website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for it or use a bank card to invest.

2025-06-27T15:35:39,"Is the crypto bull run here? Bitcoin wavers as traders take profits","Macroeconomic concerns and profit-taking are slowing down crypto’s momentum, but a bull run may be in the works Crypto markets are in recovery mode, but profit-taking and macroeconomic risks continue to weigh on sentiment. On Friday, June 27, Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $106,600, pulling back 1% over the past 24 hours. Altcoins saw similar performance, with the top 100 assets by market cap down about 1%. Bitcoin and major altcoins have mostly recovered their losses following the initial crash sparked by the Iran-Israel conflict. With the geopolitical tensions easing, the market correction appears to have concluded, with most tokens now posting modest declines rather than steep selloffs. Because of this, the recent strength in price action suggests that markets are normalizing. However, further bullish momentum will likely depend on key catalysts, especially in the regulatory and macroeconomic spheres. You might also like: Surprise Fed statement sparks hopes of Bitcoin and altcoin rally Rate cuts, regulation to fuel next crypto bull run Macroeconomic conditions continue to play a central role in crypto price dynamics. Currently, the Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates until at least September. According to analysts at B2BINPAY, this is limiting the performance of altcoins, unless a significant shift in monetary policy occurs. “The bigger picture? Macro uncertainty is keeping altcoins in check. Markets still see only a small chance of a Fed rate cut in July, though odds rise sharply for September. Until that’s clearer, BTC dominance at 62.5% keeps altcoin upside capped,” B2BINPAY analysts. Despite increasing pressure from the White House, the Fed remains committed to a cautious monetary policy, a stance unlikely to change unless President Donald Trump takes drastic action, such as replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell. That said, the more likely catalyst for the next crypto bull run may lie in regulatory developments. The U.S. Congress is set to deliberate on the Genius Act, a bill that could finally bring stablecoins out of the regulatory gray zone and offer much-needed clarity to the sector.

However, despite the positive data, the Fed prefers to keep interest rates steady due to concerns about tariffs. At this point, the FED left interest rates unchanged in June. While the next interest rate cuts are expected to be made in July and September, the market expects the first interest rate cut of 2025 to be made in September. I Expect Two Interest Rate Cuts in 2025, The First in September! At this point, Minneapolis FED President Neel Kashkari announced that he expects two interest rate cuts in 2025. Kashkari said in an article published today that he expects two rate cuts in 2025, with the first likely to occur in September. Neel Kashkari, one of the most hawkish Fed members, noted that inflation had fallen, which would allow him to cut the policy rate twice starting in September. While the FED member mentioned the possibility of the first interest rate cut being made in September, he stated that the FED could pause the reduction policy if necessary if the tariffs have a negative impact. “I expect two interest rate cuts in 2025. At this point, the first cut could be in September. “But if the Fed cuts interest rates in September and the inflationary effects of the tariffs become apparent later, we may temporarily pause the rate cuts.” Finally, Kashkari said economic data so far suggest that the impact of tariffs on prices, activity or the labor market has been extremely modest, and inflation is making renewed progress toward the Fed's 2% target. Kashkari is known as one of the members of the FED who is hostile to Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies. At this point, the FED member describes cryptocurrencies as worthless, fraudulent and ridiculous. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-27T15:30:03,"Nasdaq Hits Record While Bitcoin, Gold Remain Under Pressure After Latest Macro Data","Bitcoin BTC continues to consolidate in the $102,000 to $108,000 range and gold is lower by 2% today and roughly 7% from its record high. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 has reached new all-time highs. A couple of U.S. macroeconomic data points Friday morning — though nearly two months old at this point — might have added to the modestly negative tone for BTC and gold. Personal income in May came in at -0.4%, falling short of the expected increase of 0.3%. Personal spending month over month printed at -0.1%, missing the forecast of a 0.1% increase. Maybe of more import to markets, the core PCE price index in the US, which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is the Federal Reserve's chosen gauge of underlying inflation, rose by 0.2% in May compared to expectations of a 0.1% increase. On a year-over-year basis, core PCE prices rose 2.7% versus 2.6% expected. This data further supports the view that the economy may be heading toward stagflation. Noted goldbug and no-coiner Peter Schiff : ""Traders continue to sell gold even as this morning's release of weak economic data and stronger-than-expected inflation data pushed the dollar index to new lows.

2025-06-27T15:25:24,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Continues To Consolidate Around $107,000","Bitcoin (BTC) is consolidating around $107,000 as it takes a breather after reclaiming key levels during the week. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged below $100,000 on Sunday as market sentiment worsened. A ceasefire announcement saw markets recover, reclaim $100,000, and push towards $105,000 on Monday. Despite a pause in the rally, analysts remain optimistic about a push to $110,000. BTC is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $107,000. Metaplanet Pushes Bitcoin Holdings Past $1.3 Billion After 1,234 BTC Purchase Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet has purchased an additional 1,234 BTC worth $132 million, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to 12,345 BTC , worth over $1.3 billion. The purchase is the firm’s third-largest Bitcoin buy to date, according to a disclosure released on Thursday. Metaplanet purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $108,129 per coin. However, the purchase date was not disclosed. Metaplanet aims to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 100,000 BTC by 2026. Metaplanet is just one of many publicly traded firms that have pivoted to Bitcoin, adding the asset to their balance sheet. According to data from Bitcoin Treasuries, over 140 publicly traded firms hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet, amassing $90 billion worth of Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s Strategy accounts for two-thirds of this amount, holding over $64 billion worth of Bitcoin. The latest purchase makes Metaplanet the seventh-largest holder of Bitcoin. Indian Politician Calls For Bitcoin Reserve Pilot A spokesperson for India’s ruling party has urged the government to consider launching a Bitcoin reserve pilot, believing it to be a strategic step towards economic resilience. Bharatiya Janata Party spokesperson Pradeep Bhandari stated in an article that the US strategic Bitcoin reserve and Bhutan’s state-led mining operations signal a shift towards crypto in global financial markets. The spokesperson said that India could create a sovereign Bitcoin strategy by leveraging its expanding renewable energy infrastructure. “This isn’t a reckless pivot. It’s a calculated step toward embracing digital assets.” However, India’s tax policy indicates uncertainty. Crypto in India is unregulated but heavily taxed, with the government imposing a hefty 30% flat rate tax on virtual digital assets. However, it has been slow to establish a regulatory framework for crypto. Under section 115BBH of India’s Income Tax Act, all profits acquired by selling crypto are taxed at 30%. While traders can deduct purchase costs, there are no provisions for other expenses and losses. A 1% TDS also applies to all crypto transactions. According to Bhandari, India must offer regulatory clarity, beginning with the sovereign Bitcoin reserve. He added that regulations could bring transparency and oversight to the emerging asset class, enabling innovation while protecting users. Bhandari concluded, “India stands at a pivotal juncture,” Bhandari wrote. “A measured Bitcoin strategy —perhaps a reserve pilot — could strengthen economic resilience and project modernity.” Bitcoin Treasury Corporation To Relist On Toronto Exchange Canadian Bitcoin lending company Bitcoin Treasury Corporation (BTCT) is set to resume trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) Venture Exchange. The company announced its common shares will trade under the ticker BTCT from Monday. The trading resumed after a brokered offering raising $92 million in gross proceeds. The company issued shares at 10 CA$ ($7.32) each. The financing was supported by a concurrent capital raise. BTCT also used a portion of the proceeds to purchase 292.8 BTC at $31.5 million. This is the company’s first major Bitcoin purchase since launching its Bitcoin accumulation and institutional lending strategy. The firm plans to use its Bitcoin reserves to offer clients liquidity solutions. It also plans to publish its initial Bitcoin share per figure after concluding its acquisition phase. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is trading around $107,000 as its rally takes a breather around $107,000. The flagship cryptocurrency started the week with a substantial rally after President Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. As a result, BTC reclaimed $105,000 and ended the day at $105,442. Analysts believe BTC is on the cusp of a bullish breakout and could potentially set a new all-time high. A potential catalyst is the decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY), with President Trump considering candidates to replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair. Powell’s term ends in May 2026. The US Dollar Index has fallen 12% this year, with Morgan Stanley anticipating an additional 9% decline. Leading candidates include Scott Bessent, Kevin Hassett, and Kevin Warsh. President Trump has been highly critical of Powell, repeatedly urging the Fed Chair to cut interest rates. However, Powell reiterated the central bank’s wait-and-see stance. Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin agreed with Powell, stating, “There is little upside in heading too quickly in any one direction. Given the strength in today’s economy, we have time to track developments patiently and allow the visibility to improve.” Analysts believe a breakout is coming, with two major indicators supporting their argument. The daily chart shows that BTC has maintained its position above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which provided support since April. Additionally, Bitcoin has formed a bullish flag pattern consisting of a vertical line and a descending channel. Analysts also noted the formation of a bullish engulfing candlestick, reversing the weekend’s bearish price action. The pattern also ensured BTC maintained its position above $105,000, indicating a potential shift in market structure, adding weight to the flagship cryptocurrency’s ongoing recovery. However, despite the bullish setup, market sentiment is divided. BTC has recorded 19 instances of the bullish engulfing pattern meeting the defined confirmation criteria. Of these, 15 led to new local highs in the following days or weeks. More importantly, 19 instances occurred within a broader bull market context. The prevailing bull market structure indicates a statistically favorable environment for continuing the current price action, potentially pushing BTC to new highs. BTC registered a sharp drop on Tuesday, falling over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,000 to $104,519. It recovered on Wednesday, rising 0.35% to $104,884, but was back in the red on Thursday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $104,631. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as BTC fell 1.19%, slipping below the 50-day SMA and settling at $103,388. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the flagship cryptocurrency fell to an intraday low of $100,979 before settling at $102,180. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $98,385 on Sunday as market sentiment turned bearish. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,982. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment returned on Monday as the price surged over 4% to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,442. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as BTC crossed $106,000 on Tuesday and $107,000 on Wednesday to settle at $107,393. The price lost momentum on Thursday, dropping 0.39% to slip below $107,000 and settle at $106,970.

2025-06-27T15:00:51,"Bullish: Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges. Here’s The Latest","Corporate Bitcoin adoption is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, marking a significant shift in the way companies view the world’s leading cryptocurrency. According to a recent report from Cointelegraph, 134 corporations now hold Bitcoin (BTC), nearly doubling the number from 2024. Bitcoin’s surge highlights a growing trend: it’s being viewed as a core treasury asset rather than a speculative investment. Corporate Treasuries Embrace Bitcoin Throughout 2025, corporate accumulation of Bitcoin has intensified. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.net and other trusted sources indicates that over 800,000 BTC, worth tens of billions of dollars, are now held in the treasuries of public and private companies. This figure represents nearly 4% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply and reflects a deepening conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value. The surge has been particularly notable among publicly listed companies. A Q1 2025 report from Bitwise revealed that corporate BTC holdings grew by over 16% in the first three months of the year alone, with more than 95,000 BTC added to balance sheets. The momentum is fueled by concerns about inflation, declining confidence in traditional currencies, and Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a reliable hedge. BULLISH: Corporate Bitcoin adoption is accelerating rapidly with 134 corporations now holding $BTC , nearly doubling from 2024. pic.twitter.com/dEkUDxGVss — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) June 27, 2025 Catalysts Behind the Surge Several key factors are driving this rapid adoption. Regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions, particularly the United States, has removed the legal uncertainty that previously hindered corporate involvement. With the SEC greenlighting Bitcoin spot ETFs and providing clearer guidelines for crypto accounting, companies are now more confident in allocating capital to digital assets. Additionally, macroeconomic pressures have pushed corporations to seek alternatives to traditional cash reserves. With interest rates fluctuating and inflation remaining a persistent concern, Bitcoin offers an attractive, decentralized hedge that’s easily auditable and globally liquid. Industry Leaders Pave the Way MicroStrategy (now operating as Strategy) remains the poster child of corporate Bitcoin adoption. As of mid-2025, the company holds over 470,000 BTC, more than 2% of the total supply. Its consistent accumulation strategy has inspired a growing wave of followers, including firms like Metaplanet in Japan, Trump Media, and GameStop, all of which have recently disclosed Bitcoin purchases. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Meanwhile, new players are emerging with Bitcoin-centric business models. ProCap Financial, a newly formed firm backed by veteran investors, recently announced a $1 billion merger aimed at building one of the largest Bitcoin treasury companies in the U.S., following the Strategy playbook. Looking Ahead While the trend is bullish, it isn’t without challenges. As Bitcoin becomes more intertwined with corporate finance, questions about volatility management, treasury governance, and custodial security grow more pressing. Additionally, the growing correlation between Bitcoin and equity markets has led some analysts to warn that BTC may behave more like a tech stock during downturns, potentially undermining its hedge narrative. Nevertheless, the data speaks volumes. With more than 134 corporations now holding Bitcoin, and hundreds more considering similar strategies, the asset’s legitimacy in boardrooms and financial planning is no longer in doubt. As Cointelegraph highlights, Bitcoin’s transformation from a fringe innovation to a mainstream corporate asset is well underway, and the implications for global finance are only just beginning.

2025-06-27T15:00:48,"BTC, ETH & SOL: Institutional Inflows Surge—Whales & ETFs Fuel Next Leg","Big players are making moves in the crypto market. Significant funds are pouring into top digital currencies. Whales and investment funds are driving this next wave. Discover which coins are primed for growth. Explore how institutional interest is reshaping the landscape. Read on to uncover the details behind this surge. Bitcoin Analysis: Moderate Volatility with Key Levels in Focus Bitcoin showed a modest weekly gain of 2.25%, while the month recorded a slight decline of 1.82%. Over the past six months, the price advanced by 12.52% despite experiencing fluctuations. The movement within a range of established price points indicated a market with both upward momentum and minor setbacks. Recent price action demonstrated recovery after the monthly dip, allowing the coin to maintain a positive trend in the longer timeframe with steady accumulation and improvements in market sentiment. The current situation places Bitcoin within a defined range between $94,832 and $113,326, with nearby support at $84,880 and resistance at $121,869. Further out, the second support and resistance levels are set at $66,385 and $140,364. The market appears balanced, with bulls aiming to push prices above resistance, while bears are active at lower thresholds. Indicators show the trend is not strongly directional, as the relative strength index hovers around neutral at 55.13. Traders might consider accumulating near support and taking profits near resistance, employing staggered entry points and risk management strategies while awaiting a clear breakout. Ethereum Market Outlook: Past Declines and Key Support/Resistance Levels Ethereum experienced a decline of about 8.09% over the past month and nearly 28% over the last six months. Price action maintained a downward trend with small recoveries that failed to break the overall bearish sentiment. This consistent decline highlights growing investor caution and reduced trading enthusiasm, reflecting pressure in the market. Each drop emphasizes the ongoing struggle to regain upward momentum as participants remain wary of future movements. Current levels place Ethereum’s price between approximately $1,923 and $2,961. Immediate resistance is near $3,395, with another barrier at about $4,433. Key supports are around $1,318 and a deeper level near $280. Indicators show sustained selling pressure, with the Awesome Oscillator at -120 and a Momentum indicator at -65. The Relative Strength Index is near neutral at 48. Traders might consider buying near the $1,318 support while monitoring the $3,395 resistance for signs of reversal. The market appears range-bound, encouraging a cautious approach between these key levels. Solana Price Behavior: Recent Trends and Current Market Levels In the last month, Solana experienced a decline of nearly 20%, while over the past six months, the coin fell more than 27%. It traded within a range of about $136 to $182, highlighting heightened volatility during this period. Recent price corrections indicate a downward trend, with a short-term decline of approximately 3.4% over one week. Technical indicators suggest a weaker market sentiment, reflecting the performance trends observed over these time spans. Current price action focuses on crucial support and resistance levels. Immediate support is near $115.84, with a secondary zone around $69.81. On the upside, the first resistance is approximately $207.90, followed by a second near $253.93. With a negative Awesome Oscillator, Momentum, and an RSI of about 44, bears seem to dominate the market. Although there is no clear, sustained trend, traders may consider buying near support levels and selling closer to resistances, watching for breakouts or reversals that could indicate a shift in momentum. Conclusion BTC , ETH , and SOL are experiencing a significant rise in institutional interest. Large investors and exchange-traded funds are driving this trend. This momentum suggests strong potential for growth in the near term. As institutions increase their stakes, these cryptocurrencies could see further appreciation in value. This heightened activity highlights their growing acceptance and potential for mainstream adoption. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-27T15:00:30,"How VTrader is Automating the Alpha Layer of Crypto Markets","In the world of crypto trading, speed, and fees often determine who wins. Therefore, a new player is quietly redefining the equation, aiming to automate trading tools and alpha discovery. That player is VTrader, a next-gen, no-fee trading platform built around on-chain transparency and AI-powered intelligence. At the core is Steve Gregory, a former compliance officer and attorney who has scaled three major exchanges and helped secure full U.S. money transmission licensing (MTLs) in under a year at CEX.IO. Now, he's taking on one of the valuable crypto's profit centers: trading fees. ""Between the spread and the exchange fee, you often lose around 5% just for showing up. This hurts the average return for customers."" Gregory told Crypto Daily. ""We believe a major shift is coming to the industry just as retail stock brokerages moved to zero-fee trading; crypto is heading the same way."" VTrader operates on a fee-less trading model, instead earning yield from user deposits . This model allows the platform to avoid trading commissions while offering a transparent view of customer balances permanently verifiable on-chain. It's a pivot away from the closed, opaque custody models most exchanges still rely on. The vision is clear: build trust by default and let automation do the heavy lifting. AI Meets Alpha VTrader is doing more than cutting fees—embedding artificial intelligence directly into the trading stack. Its recent feature is a price prediction engine that forecasts the near-term movement of Bitcoin and Ethereum based on real-time data scraped from news, social sentiment, and technical indicators. Users can view how past predictions performed against actual market outcomes, giving the system an uncommon level of transparency for an AI-powered tool. Gregory explains, ""The AI tool is meant to supplement the user's research and give users confidence when they place a trade."" Perhaps most innovative is the platform's focus on what Gregory calls ""narrative-based alpha."" Unlike traditional equities, where fundamentals dominate, crypto often trades on hype, sentiment, and memes. VTrader's upcoming feature will track token popularity, momentum shifts, and sentiment swings across the crypto news cycle and then alert users when it detects actionable signals. It's a modular, plug-and-play approach to trading intelligence where traders don't just react to news; they're notified before the hits. Intent-Based DeFi Trading, Powered by AI The VTrader team is also exploring intent-based trading, where users create strategies based on values or themes like green energy or decentralized infrastructure and let AI execute those strategies with discipline. As trading automation becomes more accessible, some critics argue that AI-enhanced tools like VTrader give users an unfair advantage. Gregory disagrees, sharing that information asymmetry has always existed, but the point is to democratize access to better tools. VTrader is not here to hide alpha ; rather, it is working towards unlocking it. The platform is structured so that users can freely access performance data on the AI models, enabling a rare level of openness in an industry often criticized for its opacity. What Comes Next? While AI and predictive tools are central to VTrader's roadmap, Gregory argues that user experience is still the most significant barrier to mass adoption in crypto.

2025-06-27T14:54:20,"Top blue-chip altcoins to buy as Nasdaq 100 Index hits ATH","Cryptocurrency prices have pulled back in the past few days, but a few signals point to an eventual comeback. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, pointing to potential gains that could take it to $140,000. ETF inflows have also jumped and are nearing the key milestone of $50 billion. Similarly, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has surged to a record high of $22,500, while the S&P 500 Index has climbed to $6,170. Both indices are up over 27% from their April lows. Further, there are signs the Federal Reserve may begin cutting interest rates in September, while the US dollar index has plunged. Additionally, the U.S. and China are reportedly close to signing a new trade agreement. Best altcoins to buy today ahead of the bull run The bullish Bitcoin pattern and the surging S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices may trigger the next crypto bull run. Some of the top altcoins to buy are Sei ( SEI ), Aptos ( APT ), and Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ). 1. Sei Sei price chart | Source: crypto.new Sei is one of the best-positioned altcoins ahead of the next bull run. It’s a fast-growing EVM-compatible chain gaining traction in gaming, DeFi, and stablecoins. It’s also under consideration to run Wyoming’s stablecoin initiative. The Sei price has risen from a year-to-date low of $0.1315 to a high of $0.3337 on June 25. It recently broke through resistance at $0.2767, invalidating the previous double-top formation. With the price now above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages and the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, further gains are likely. Bulls may target the 50% retracement level at $0.4340.

Like Sei, it’s a layer-1 blockchain slowly gaining traction. According to DeFi Llama’s data , Aptos-based DEXs processed over $4 billion in the past 30 days, with a total value locked (TVL) of $1.3 billion, ranking it 12th in the industry. APT price has formed a double-bottom at $3.88, with the neckline at $6.30. This bullish pattern points to a potential breakout, with an upside target near $10 if the neckline is breached. 3. Aerodrome Finance AERO price chart | Source: crypto.news Aerodrome Finance is a leading DEX on the Base blockchain, processing billions in monthly trading volume. The AERO price has rallied from a low of $0.2963 in April to $0.80 as of June 27. It has formed an ascending triangle pattern and is hovering near the 23.6% retracement level. A mini golden cross, where the 50-day moving average crosses above the 100-day MA, has formed, a bullish signal. If momentum holds, the next target is the $2 resistance level.

This surge is reshaping investor interests and market dynamics, compelling traders to look towards these novelty coins for potentially lucrative opportunities. The Rise of $XYZ in the Sports and Crypto Arena One standout in the memecoin category is XYZVerse ($XYZ), which cleverly merges the worlds of sports fanaticism with cryptocurrency. This unique approach has not only garnered it the accolade of Best New Meme Project but also a dedicated following eager to support a project that resonates with their interests. The ethos of XYZVerse, encapsulated by the G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time) vision, elevates it above typical memecoins, offering a structured roadmap aimed at sustainable growth rather than short-term hype. $XYZ is positioned as not just a meme or a token but as a symbol of honor amongst sports and crypto enthusiasts, promising to bring competitive spirit into the crypto market. Market Enthusiasm Around $XYZ's Pre-Launch Phase The ongoing presale of $XYZ offers early investors a chance to buy into the project at ground-floor prices, potentially setting the stage for significant returns as the coin reaches broader exchanges. Starting at $0.0001, the token's price has climbed to $0.003333 and is anticipated to hit $0.02 by the end of the presale, with a final listing target of $0.10. Such growth prospects have already attracted over $14 million in investments. These early stages provide a critical opportunity for maximum ROI, drawing in both seasoned and novice crypto investors. To join the presale and potentially turn minimal investments into substantial returns, interested parties can visit Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Memecoins Broadening the Crypto Spectrum Other notable memecoins like Shiba Inu (SHIB), BONK, Floki, and FARTCOIN are also making waves by leveraging community support, integrating innovative technologies, and even diving into philanthropy and gaming. SHIB, for instance, has extended beyond its meme origin to develop a suite of decentralized finance (DeFi) tools and community-driven initiatives. BONK, launched on the Solana platform, and Floki are equally establishing themselves as more than transient tokens, by fostering ecosystems that offer tangible utilities and engaging experiences to their holders. The quirky FARTCOIN, despite its humorous undertone, is pioneering engagement through a combination of AI and user-generated content, showcasing the dynamic and evolving nature of memecoins. Conclusion and Further Information In a crypto market that's as volatile as it is vibrant, XYZVerse stands out this season by bridging the enthusiasm for sports with the speculative world of cryptocurrency. Its strategic approach may set a precedent for how new entrants in the meme category can achieve lasting impact.

The number of Bitcoin wallets holding 10 BTC or more just hit a 3.5-month high, according to on-chain data from Santiment. As of June 27, 152,280 wallets now fall into this “whale and shark” category, each holding over $1 million in BTC. It’s the highest count since March 12, and it’s happening despite the sideways action in price. “As markets have been volatile, smart money has accumulated on most retail panic sell cycles,” Santiment noted in its report. Bitcoin whale and shark wallets. Source: Santiment Bitcoin whale and shark purchases It’s worth highlighting that a pattern where large holders accumulate as smaller investors exit, is not new, but it is telling. While retail investors grow weary during consolidation phases, institutions and high-net-worth players often treat them as accumulation windows. Bitcoin is up more than 70% over the past year but has traded relatively flat in the short term: down 1.12% on the day, up just 1.28% over the past week, and slightly negative on the month. That’s precisely the type of lull where professional money quietly builds positions, often anticipating the next major leg up. So should everyday investors follow the whales? Historically, spikes in whale wallet counts have preceded significant moves in Bitcoin’s price. It’s not a guarantee, but it’s often an indicator that confidence remains high among long-term holders, especially in a backdrop of ETF inflows, macroeconomic easing, and growing global adoption. With retail interest cooling, the smart money appears to be positioning ahead of the crowd, again.

2025-06-27T14:20:09,"Crypto Blockchain Industries Unveils Bold $23.4M Bitcoin Investment Strategy","BitcoinWorld Crypto Blockchain Industries Unveils Bold $23.4M Bitcoin Investment Strategy Are you keeping an eye on the latest moves in the crypto space? A significant development from Europe is catching attention: Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI), a prominent French-listed fintech firm, is gearing up for a substantial capital raise. This move isn’t just about bolstering their balance sheet; it’s a direct signal of their confidence in the future of digital assets, specifically through strategic BTC purchases and investment in mining infrastructure. It’s an exciting time to see traditional financial structures adapting to the decentralized world. Crypto Blockchain Industries’ Strategic Expansion Crypto Blockchain Industries (CBI), already a recognized name in the European fintech landscape, is making headlines with its ambitious plans. The company aims to secure up to €20 million, equivalent to approximately $23.4 million, to significantly expand its footprint in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it represents a considerable commitment to digital assets and the underlying technology that powers them. Their strategy highlights a growing trend among publicly traded companies to directly engage with cryptocurrencies, viewing them as both an asset class and a foundational technology for future growth. Funding Future Growth: The Shareholder Loan Approach The method CBI has chosen for this capital injection is particularly interesting: a shareholder loan . This approach involves existing shareholders providing funds to the company, typically with an agreement for repayment, often with interest. It’s a common financing mechanism that demonstrates strong internal confidence and commitment from the company’s existing investor base. For CBI, opting for a shareholder loan over other financing methods like issuing new equity or traditional debt could indicate: Strong Shareholder Support: Existing investors believe in the company’s vision and are willing to directly fund its strategic initiatives. Flexibility: Shareholder loans can sometimes offer more flexible terms compared to bank loans or public offerings. Minimized Dilution: Unlike issuing new shares, a loan doesn’t immediately dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. This method underscores a deep alignment between the company’s management and its shareholders regarding its bold crypto-centric direction. Powering Up: Focusing on BTC Purchases and Mining Equipment The primary use of these substantial funds is twofold: direct BTC purchases and investment in mining equipment. This dual strategy is designed to maximize their exposure and participation in the Bitcoin network. Acquiring Bitcoin directly allows CBI to: Hold a Store of Value: Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a digital gold, and holding it can be a hedge against inflation or a long-term value appreciation play. Participate in the Ecosystem: Direct BTC ownership allows for more active participation in the broader crypto economy. Simultaneously, investing in mining equipment positions CBI to earn Bitcoin through the mining process. This not only generates new BTC but also contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. It’s a comprehensive approach that seeks to leverage both the asset’s value and its production mechanism. What This Means for French-listed Crypto Firms CBI’s move could set a precedent for other French-listed crypto firms and even broader European companies. As regulatory clarity slowly emerges in the European Union, particularly with initiatives like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets), more traditional companies might feel confident enough to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets or core operations. This could signal a broader institutional adoption wave, not just from crypto-native companies but from established fintech players. France, with its growing tech scene, is increasingly becoming a hub for blockchain innovation, and CBI’s decision further solidifies this position. Navigating the Crypto Investment Strategy Landscape Every significant financial decision comes with its own set of considerations, and CBI’s bold crypto investment strategy is no exception. While the potential for upside is considerable, particularly with Bitcoin’s historical performance, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies presents inherent risks. Companies embarking on such ventures must carefully consider: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, impacting the value of holdings. Regulatory Changes: The evolving regulatory landscape could introduce new compliance requirements or restrictions. Operational Risks: Managing mining operations comes with its own set of technical and energy-related challenges. However, for a company like CBI, which operates in the fintech and blockchain space, these risks are likely weighed against the long-term strategic advantages of being an early mover in what many believe is the future of finance. A Bold Leap into Bitcoin’s Future Crypto Blockchain Industries’ plan to raise $23.4 million for BTC purchases and mining equipment through a shareholder loan is a significant indicator of growing institutional confidence in digital assets. This strategic move by a French-listed firm not only strengthens CBI’s position in the crypto economy but also sends a powerful message to the broader financial market: Bitcoin is here to stay, and smart capital is increasingly recognizing its value and potential. It will be fascinating to watch how this bold investment strategy unfolds and its impact on both CBI and the wider European crypto landscape.

This ranking is based on sovereign-held Bitcoin reserves, where the state actively manages and declares its holdings. What’s even more impressive about this is that Bhutan’s reserves were not seized or purchased but mined, which distinguishes them from other countries’ holdings. How Did Bhutan Build Its Bitcoin Reserve? The country began Bitcoin mining in late 2020, using two small units installed by Druk Holding & Investments (DHI) near Dochula Pass.
