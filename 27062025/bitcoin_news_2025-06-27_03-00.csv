2025-06-27T00:40:07,"HIVE Digital: Unveiling a Robust $181.1M Digital Asset Portfolio","BitcoinWorld HIVE Digital: Unveiling a Robust $181.1M Digital Asset Portfolio In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, a company’s strategic management of its treasury assets is a powerful indicator of its long-term vision and resilience. Canadian cryptocurrency mining powerhouse, HIVE Digital Technologies, recently captivated the market with an announcement that vividly illustrates its robust financial health and astute foresight. As the fiscal year 2025 concluded, HIVE Digital proudly disclosed an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , a substantial portion of which is anchored by a significant 2,201 Bitcoin. This pivotal revelation offers more than just a financial snapshot; it provides profound insights into the operational prowess and sophisticated asset management framework of a true trailblazer in the digital economy. HIVE Digital’s Strategic Accumulation of Digital Asset Holdings What does it truly signify for a pioneering entity like HIVE Digital to command such a formidable sum in digital asset holdings ? This figure is not merely a number; it represents a meticulously curated portfolio of cryptocurrencies, predominantly Bitcoin, which HIVE has diligently mined and, critically, chosen to retain rather than immediately liquidate. This deliberate strategy transcends conventional corporate treasury management, reflecting a profound bullish conviction in the enduring value of these assets and a proactive decision to fortify its financial bedrock. A Modern Treasury Approach: Unlike traditional corporations that might hold cash or government bonds, HIVE Digital’s treasury strategy embraces the native assets of the digital realm. This approach positions them to directly benefit from the growth and adoption of cryptocurrencies. Balance Sheet Fortification: These substantial holdings are a direct infusion of strength into the company’s balance sheet. They serve as a formidable reserve, offering unparalleled flexibility to fund future operational expansions, invest in cutting-edge technologies, or provide a vital buffer during inevitable market downturns. Unwavering Market Confidence: By choosing to ‘HODL’ a significant portion of its self-mined assets, HIVE Digital unequivocally signals its deep-seated confidence in the long-term appreciation trajectory of cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin leading the charge. This transparency can foster immense trust among investors, demonstrating that the company’s interests are intrinsically aligned with the success of the broader crypto ecosystem. What Does HIVE Digital’s Bitcoin Portfolio Reveal? The precise mention of 2,201 Bitcoin as a cornerstone of HIVE Digital’s treasury illuminates a critical facet of its financial strategy. Bitcoin, often hailed as ‘digital gold,’ remains the preeminent cryptocurrency, serving as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . For a dedicated mining company, accumulating and safeguarding such a significant Bitcoin portfolio is a nuanced strategic maneuver that extends far beyond routine operational considerations. The HODL Philosophy in Action: HIVE’s decision to hold over two thousand Bitcoin is a clear manifestation of a ‘HODL’ strategy. This implies a calculated long-term bet on Bitcoin’s future price appreciation, indicating that the company is not merely covering immediate operational expenses but actively building wealth through asset accumulation. Proof of Operational Excellence: The ability to retain such a large Bitcoin reserve strongly suggests that HIVE Digital’s mining operations are not just profitable, but exceptionally efficient. They are generating enough revenue to comfortably cover their considerable expenses without being forced to liquidate all their freshly mined Bitcoin. This speaks volumes about their rigorous cost management, energy optimization, and overall operational superiority, especially in light of the escalating mining difficulty and the recent Bitcoin halving events that compress margins for many miners. Strategic Market Exposure: This substantial Bitcoin portfolio also provides HIVE Digital with direct and significant exposure to Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. While this introduces a degree of volatility to their balance sheet, it also offers immense upside potential, allowing the company’s valuation to soar during pronounced bull markets, directly benefiting shareholders. The Dynamics of Cryptocurrency Mining in Today’s Market The landscape of cryptocurrency mining is a relentless arena of innovation, constantly reshaped by technological breakthroughs, evolving regulatory frameworks, and the fluctuating economics of energy. Companies like HIVE Digital operate at the vanguard of this demanding industry, where sustained success is inextricably linked to unparalleled efficiency and visionary strategic planning. Sustainability as a Core Pillar: A paramount consideration in modern crypto mining is energy consumption. HIVE Digital has consistently championed its unwavering commitment to harnessing sustainable and green energy sources. This dedication is not merely an environmental statement; it’s a strategic imperative that significantly reduces operational costs, enhances their global reputation, and aligns perfectly with critical ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment criteria. This focus on clean energy also mitigates regulatory risks associated with high energy usage. Relentless Hardware Innovation: To maintain a competitive edge, mining companies must perpetually invest in the most advanced and energy-efficient mining hardware. This necessitates substantial capital expenditure, a challenge that robust digital asset holdings can effectively help finance, ensuring HIVE remains at the technological forefront. Navigating Halving Events: Bitcoin’s programmed halving events, which periodically halve the block reward for miners, represent a significant operational hurdle. These events fundamentally alter the revenue model. However, companies possessing strong balance sheets, exemplified by HIVE Digital’s asset base, and highly efficient operations are uniquely positioned to weather these periods of reduced revenue. They can often consolidate their market share as less efficient or undercapitalized miners are compelled to exit the industry, making the strong stronger. Navigating the Volatile Crypto Market: HIVE’s Approach The crypto market is famously characterized by its extreme volatility, with asset prices capable of experiencing dramatic swings within remarkably short periods. For an enterprise whose core product and treasury are intrinsically linked to these digital assets, the masterful management of this inherent volatility is not just important—it is existential. HIVE Digital’s substantial holdings are a clear indicator of a meticulously calculated approach to risk management and astute market timing. Sophisticated Treasury Management: It is highly probable that HIVE employs advanced treasury management strategies. These would dictate precise protocols for when to liquidate a portion of mined coins to cover operational expenditures and, crucially, when to strategically hold them for long-term capital appreciation. This dynamic balance is key to optimizing profitability and stability. Prudent Risk Mitigation: While accumulating significant assets offers immense upside potential, it inherently exposes the company to downside risk during market corrections. HIVE Digital’s reported holdings underscore a profound, long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s foundational value. This suggests they are strategically prepared to endure and even capitalize on market downturns, viewing them as opportunities rather than existential threats. Commitment to Transparency: By transparently disclosing their digital asset holdings , HIVE Digital significantly enhances its credibility and builds robust investor confidence. This level of openness is a distinguishing factor in the often opaque crypto space, setting them apart and fostering a stronger relationship with their shareholder base. Beyond the Numbers: The Future of HIVE Digital The announcement of an impressive $181.1 million in digital asset holdings is far more than a mere financial snapshot; it serves as a powerful testament to the strategic direction and ambitious future trajectory of HIVE Digital . This exceptionally strong financial bedrock strategically positions the company for sustained expansion and continuous innovation within the rapidly burgeoning digital economy. Unlocking Expansion Opportunities: Armed with a formidable war chest of digital assets, HIVE Digital is exceptionally well-equipped to pursue a myriad of expansion opportunities. This could manifest as the acquisition of new, high-capacity mining facilities, significant investments in pioneering blockchain technologies, or strategic diversification into other lucrative blockchain-related ventures, such as high-performance computing or AI infrastructure powered by their extensive GPU fleets. Solidifying Industry Leadership: By consistently demonstrating robust financial stability, unwavering operational efficiency, and a crystal-clear long-term vision, HIVE Digital is actively reinforcing its esteemed position as a leading innovator in the global cryptocurrency mining industry. Their steadfast commitment to environmentally responsible and sustainable practices further solidifies this leadership, resonating with a growing segment of environmentally conscious investors and regulators. Elevating Investor Confidence: For current and prospective investors, these substantial holdings send a resounding message: this is a company that is not only generating significant profits from its core mining operations but is also astutely accumulating wealth in the very assets it produces. This deep alignment of interests with the broader success of the crypto ecosystem makes HIVE Digital an attractive proposition for those seeking exposure to the digital asset space. In summation, HIVE Digital Technologies’ impressive disclosure of $181.1 million in digital asset holdings , featuring a substantial 2,201 Bitcoin portfolio , paints a vivid portrait of a meticulously managed and forward-thinking enterprise. This strategic accumulation profoundly underscores their resolute confidence in the enduring value of cryptocurrencies, their exemplary operational efficiency within the challenging cryptocurrency mining sector, and their demonstrated ability to expertly navigate the inherent volatility of the broader crypto market . As HIVE Digital continues its trajectory of innovation and expansion, its robust digital asset base will undoubtedly serve as a pivotal cornerstone for sustained success, cementing its formidable presence in the rapidly evolving digital economy. This strategic move by HIVE Digital is a powerful declaration, signaling the increasing maturity and sophisticated strategic depth emerging within the digital asset investment landscape.

2025-06-27T00:10:16,"Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Accumulation Signals Unprecedented Gains","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Potential: LTH Accumulation Signals Unprecedented Gains Are you tracking the pulse of the Bitcoin market? If so, you’ve likely heard the buzz around its incredible potential. The cryptocurrency world is often a whirlwind of rapid movements and unexpected turns, but savvy analysts look for underlying patterns to guide their predictions. One such pattern, highlighted by crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr., points to a compelling indicator for future growth: the persistent accumulation by Long-Term Holders (LTHs). This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a historical blueprint that has previously paved the way for significant rallies, making it a crucial signal for anyone interested in the future trajectory of the leading digital asset. Understanding Long-Term Holders: The Backbone of Bitcoin’s Strength Who exactly are these Long-Term Holders , and why does their behavior matter so much for Bitcoin ‘s market dynamics? LTHs are individuals or entities who hold their BTC for extended periods, typically over 155 days, signaling a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value rather than short-term speculative gains. They are often seen as the ‘diamond hands’ of the crypto space, less likely to sell during price dips and more inclined to buy during periods of consolidation or even correction. Reduced Selling Pressure: When LTHs accumulate, it means fewer coins are available on exchanges for sale, naturally tightening supply. Strong Conviction: Their holding behavior reflects a deep belief in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and future appreciation. Market Stability: LTHs act as a stabilizing force, absorbing supply and reducing volatility compared to short-term traders. Their collective actions provide a powerful insight into the underlying sentiment of the market’s most patient participants. When these experienced investors are actively increasing their positions, it often suggests they anticipate significant upward movement, reinforcing the overall bullish outlook for the asset. Historical Precedent: When LTH Accumulation Ignited Bitcoin’s Rallies Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis isn’t based on mere speculation; it’s rooted in observable historical patterns that have consistently preceded major Bitcoin surges. Examining past cycles reveals a clear correlation between sustained LTH accumulation and subsequent price explosions. This isn’t just anecdotal evidence; it’s a recurring theme in Bitcoin’s journey. Consider these compelling examples from Bitcoin’s history: Accumulation Period (Approx. BTC Price) LTH Action Subsequent Price Rally (Approx. Target) Timeframe $28,000 Ramped up long positions Jumped to $60,000 Approx. 2 months later $60,000 Continued strong accumulation Rose to $100,000 Following period These instances are not isolated. They demonstrate a consistent pattern where a period of quiet, yet persistent, accumulation by LTHs sets the stage for explosive upward movements. This behavior is akin to winding a spring; the more it’s compressed, the more force it releases when unleashed. For Bitcoin , LTH accumulation represents that compression. Current Trends: What Does LTH Accumulation Signal for Bitcoin’s Price Prediction? If history is any guide, the current robust accumulation by Long-Term Holders paints an incredibly optimistic picture for Bitcoin ‘s immediate future. Analyst Axel Adler Jr. explicitly states that if the present situation mirrors past cycles, the flagship cryptocurrency is poised for a significant rally, potentially targeting a remarkable $160,000. This projection isn’t merely a hopeful guess; it’s an extrapolation based on established market behavior. The fact that LTHs are consistently building their positions, even amidst market fluctuations, underscores a profound confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. They are not deterred by short-term volatility, instead viewing current prices as opportune entry points for future gains. This sustained accumulation reduces the circulating supply available for sale, creating an environment ripe for upward price pressure when demand eventually surges. The Broader Crypto Market: How Bitcoin’s Trajectory Influences Altcoins Bitcoin ‘s dominance often dictates the overall sentiment and direction of the wider crypto market . As the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, its movements have a ripple effect across thousands of altcoins. When Bitcoin experiences a significant rally, it often pulls the entire market upward, leading to an ‘altcoin season’ where other cryptocurrencies also see substantial gains. Why is Bitcoin’s performance so pivotal? Gateway Asset: Bitcoin is typically the first cryptocurrency institutional and retail investors buy, acting as the primary entry point into the crypto ecosystem. Liquidity Anchor: Its sheer size provides a foundational layer of liquidity that supports the entire market. Sentiment Driver: Positive news or price action for Bitcoin tends to generate broader enthusiasm and investor confidence across the board. Therefore, if LTH accumulation indeed propels Bitcoin towards the $160,000 mark, it’s highly probable that we will witness a broader bullish trend engulfing the entire crypto market , offering opportunities across various digital assets. This interconnectedness means that understanding Bitcoin’s signals is paramount for navigating the broader crypto landscape. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Investors While the signals from Long-Term Holders are undeniably bullish, it’s crucial for investors to approach the crypto market with a well-informed strategy. A potential Bitcoin price prediction of $160,000 is exciting, but responsible investing requires diligence and a clear understanding of both opportunities and risks. What Should Investors Consider? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the underlying fundamentals of any asset you invest in. Analyst predictions are indicators, not guarantees. Long-Term Perspective: Emulate the LTHs. Bitcoin’s volatility can be intense in the short term, but its long-term trend has historically been upward. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin, if appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on on-chain metrics, macroeconomic factors, and regulatory developments that could influence the market. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Consider regularly investing a fixed amount, regardless of price, to smooth out market volatility and benefit from long-term accumulation . The consistent accumulation by LTHs is a powerful vote of confidence, but the path to $160,000, while projected, will likely not be a straight line. Market corrections and unexpected events are always possible, making a resilient strategy essential. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Remarkable Journey Continues, Fueled by LTH Conviction The compelling evidence presented by analyst Axel Adler Jr. regarding Long-Term Holders ‘ persistent accumulation provides a potent bullish narrative for Bitcoin . This isn’t just about a hopeful price prediction ; it’s about understanding the deep-seated confidence of the most committed participants in the crypto market . History has repeatedly shown that when LTHs are actively building their positions, significant rallies often follow, transforming what might seem like ordinary market activity into a prelude for extraordinary gains. As Bitcoin continues its remarkable journey, the unwavering conviction of its LTHs serves as a powerful testament to its enduring value proposition. While no investment is without risk, the current patterns suggest a future brimming with potential, positioning Bitcoin for what could be one of its most impressive surges yet. For those looking to understand the core drivers of Bitcoin’s next potential leap, the actions of its long-term holders offer an invaluable compass.

Bloomberg, citing info from Crane Data LLC, reports that the amount of capital invested in the money-market industry has now soared to a record $7.4 trillion, with $320 billion pouring into the funds in 2025 so far. Money-market funds are financial instruments that allow people to invest in lower-risk and short-term debt securities, including US Treasuries. Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes, tells Bloomberg that the Federal Reserve’s ongoing monetary policy choices suggest the money market industry could continue to grow and easily stretch to $7.5 trillion in assets this year. “Five-percent-plus rates were nirvana, four-percent-plus is still very good – and if we dip down into the high threes, that’s quite acceptable as well.” The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced last week that it planned to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4.25-4.5%, arguing that it was the most suitable level to achieve both maximum employment and controlled inflation. The Fed has held interest rates steady since December, when it cut the rate by 0.25%. Michael Bird, senior fund manager at Allspring Global Investments, tells Bloomberg that it’s “not surprising” that asset levels in the money-market sector have grown. “Even if the Fed picks up its easing campaign this year, rates will still be relatively high…” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-27T00:00:03,"Stablecoin Checkup: Trump-Backed Company Plans To Launch App, Audit","A big name in crypto is about to get a closer look. US Liberty Financial (WLF), the firm tied to US President Donald Trump, will release its first audit for the USD1 stablecoin in just days. The token hit over $2 billion in market cap since its March debut. And that’s not all. WLF is also rolling out a new mobile app for regular investors. Audit To Reveal Reserve Details According to reports , the audit will spell out what backs every USD1 token. WLF says the stablecoin is covered by US dollar deposits, cash equivalents and US Treasuries. BitGo holds those assets in custody. Once the audit hits, WLF plans to publish monthly reserve updates. That level of transparency could help win over big players and everyday users alike. Zak Folkman, the co-founder of U.S. President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency platform World Liberty Financial, said on Wednesday that the company will issue an audit of its stablecoin “within days” and that it planned a new app. https://t.co/kTZVLB7n7O — Reuters Legal (@ReutersLegal) June 26, 2025 Mobile App Aims At Everyday Investors Based on reports, the upcoming app will make it easier for people to buy, hold and send USD1. It looks to simplify on-ramps and off-ramps so that someone new to crypto won’t feel lost. WLF co-founder Zak Folkman shared the news on June 25 at the Permissionless conference in Brooklyn. He said the app will come with clear financial data, showing what funds back each token. Governance Token May Open Trading WLF also hinted that WLFI, its governance token, could soon hit exchanges. WLFI has been non-tradable so far and lets holders vote on changes to the USD1 protocol. Folkman teased that, within weeks, holders “will be very, very happy.” If WLFI starts trading, it could bring new cash into the project—but also fresh price swings. Trump Family’s Stake Shift Draws Scrutiny Reports disclose that the Trump family cut its WLF stake from 60% to 40% in June, pocketing about $130 million. In total, that reduction brought in roughly $190 million for the family business. Lawmakers and ethics watchdogs have pointed to potential conflicts, given that WLF’s stablecoin operations moved ahead as crypto rules were being eased. Institutional Deals And Airdrop Boost USD1 has already found big users. In March, MGX, a firm in the UAE, invested $2 billion in Binance using USD1 tokens. Earlier in June, WLF ran a $4 million USD1 airdrop that reached over 85,000 wallets. What Comes Next The key will be how the audit actually reads. Will the numbers match WLF’s claims? Then there’s the app’s rollout and whether it draws a crowd. Finally, a WLFI listing could shake up trading desks. If everything lines up, USD1 could sit alongside the top stablecoins by the end of the year. But any surprises in the audit or a rocky app launch could slow that momentum.

2025-06-26T23:55:01,"BTC.com Mining Pool Drives 98% of Bitcoin Miner Flows to Binance","The BTC.com mining pool currently dominates miner flows to Binance, as it now accounts for nearly 98% of all BTC transfers from miners to the exchange. This trend provides critical insight into miner behavior, according to the latest report by CryptoQuant. Bitcoin Miners Show Patience Historically, BTC.com increases its outflows to Binance when Bitcoin’s price rises, indicating strategic profit-taking at local tops. On the other hand, when flows drop, it reflects growing miner confidence, as they choose to hold their Bitcoin rather than sell. Interestingly, despite Bitcoin trading above $100K in recent months, BTC.com’s flows to Binance have sharply declined. This suggests that miners are anticipating further price appreciation and are reducing selling pressure, potentially supporting a more sustained rally. “Miners are among the smartest players in the market. Watching their moves helps us understand where we are in the cycle.” Zooming out, a deeper look at network-level data reveals a “seasonal” trend. Hash Rate Seasonality The latest development comes as Bitcoin briefly fell below $100,000 this weekend after reports emerged of a US strike on Iranian nuclear sites, dropping to $98,000 in a swift response to geopolitical tensions. However, the dip was short-lived, as the crypto asset rebounded by early Monday. Despite the recent price milestones, Bitcoin’s on-chain transaction fees remain weak, as per the latest observation by Digital Mining Solutions. In 2025, fees have consistently accounted for less than 1% of the total block reward and have failed to offset the halving-induced subsidy cuts. This weak fee environment means miner revenue, or hash price, is tightly correlated to Bitcoin’s price. When BTC falls, hashprice drops nearly in sync, with minimal fee support to cushion the decline. Bitcoin’s network hash rate has been highly volatile this year, and has seen several record highs and sharp drops. It peaked at 950 EH/s in mid-June before plunging to 827 EH/s – a 13% decline. This pattern of surges followed by steep corrections has been consistent, with seasonal factors playing a role. With around half of US mining centered in Texas, heatwaves and energy curtailments in the summer often cause hash rate dips.

2025-06-26T23:30:21,"Extended Wave 5 Scenario Puts Bitcoin Price Above $300,000 With Step-Like Structure In Place","The Bitcoin price could be entering the final and most explosive phase of its current market cycle, as an analyst maps out the cryptocurrency’s next movements onto a parabolic step-like structure. Reinforcing this bullish outlook is the Elliott Wave 5 count, which points to an epic price rally that could propel Bitcoin above $300,000, eclipsing its previous all-time high and current market value by a substantial margin. Bitcoin Price Ultimate Parabolic Push Unveiled A newly released Bitcoin price forecast by X (formerly Twitter) crypto analyst Gert van Lagen boldly suggests that the leading cryptocurrency may be on the verge of its most aggressive bull run this cycle. Lagen’s price chart indicates that BTC is firmly locked into a parabolic step-like growth structure, potentially eyeing an extended Wave 5 breakout that could drive prices well beyond $345,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Elliott Wave Count Predicts Further Crash To $94,000, But What Next? The trajectory of the analyst’s chart illustrates a clear parabolic growth curve anchored by four distinct formations, labeled Base 1 through Base 4. Each of these bases represents a phase of accumulation and consolidation that preceded a Bitcoin price breakout. This structure also mirrors a textbook parabolic setup, where each new base sets the stage for steeper upward moves. Most notably, after the completion of Base 3, marked by the inflection point on the chart, Bitcoin launched into a sharp rally, confirming the expected parabolic behavior. Lagen’s analysis now indicates that BTC’s current Base 4 has been completed, followed by a corrective A-B-C structure that appears to have reached its bottom, positioning the cryptocurrency for the anticipated final leg of its cycle. Using Elliott Wave theory, Bitcoin’s price action is still unfolding within the fifth wave, which is the final advance in the five-wave impulsive cycle. The price chart identifies Wave 1 as beginning shortly after the 2022 lows. This was followed by a powerful breakout in 2023, which defined Wave 3, while Wave 4 concluded more recently with a classic corrective pattern. Notably, the upcoming Wave 5 could see Bitcoin skyrocket anywhere between $300,000 and $425,000, depending on the timing and strength of its bullish momentum. Timeline For Game-Changing Rally A key element in Lagen’s analysis is the dynamic “sell line” drawn near the upper end of the parabolic arc that runs underneath the Bitcoin price movement on the chart. According to the analyst, the longer it takes for Bitcoin to hit this projected vertical trajectory, the higher the price at which the potential market top might occur. This is due to the upward curvature of the parabolic trend line itself, which steepens over time. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Surge To $130,000 Next? What The Wave Count Says Currently, Lagen forecasts an early breakout by July 7, 2025, if momentum resumes immediately. However, if Bitcoin continues consolidating through the summer, the projected peak could rise further, as the sell line would continue climbing over time.

The Central Bank says that it expects the largest commercial banks in the nation to start providing their clients with a full range of CBDC transaction options as of September next year. Digital Ruble Rollout: Can Moscow Prevent Further Delays? Its previous statements on the matter would appear to suggest the Central Bank will follow up with an order for smaller and regional banks to follow suit in September 2027. A Russian crypto mining firm executive has claimed Bitcoin (BTC) prices could climb to the $130k mark in the second half of summer 2025. #BitcoinMiining #BitcoinPrice https://t.co/nPpvHr4KJ9 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 25, 2025 The digital RUB had been slated to launch on July 1 this year. But the Central Bank abruptly postponed the launch “indefinitely” in early March . The bank stunned the public when it initially gave no alternative launch timeline. This led to a flurry of speculation that Moscow was preparing to ditch its CBDC. Others suggested Moscow might push back the rollout to at least 2027 . Some forecasted that the Central Bank would pursue crypto-powered alternatives to the digital ruble. They cited a lukewarm reception for digital RUB plans from both the public and the banking sector. However, the Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that some of the biggest banks in the country are looking forward to the launch. The Russian Central Bank in Moscow. (Source: NVO [CC BY 2.5]) A VTB spokesperson said the megabank was already technologically prepared for the rollout. Sovcombank, meanwhile, said that it would be “completely ready” for customers to make digital RUB transactions by the Central Bank’s deadline. Both banks are currently working with Moscow on the ongoing digital ruble pilot. VTB said that “as the first bank to join the pilot project,” it was “technologically ready” for the launch. It added: “We are interested in providing our clients with access to the latest financial instruments as soon as possible. We expect a wide-reaching digital ruble launch for Russian citizens.” President Donald Trump said that it is possible that Russian President Vladimir Putin has territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine https://t.co/zyOyowqMjB pic.twitter.com/q2zRmeE8ST — Reuters (@Reuters) June 25, 2025 Legislation Heads to State Duma The Central Bank says it has sent a draft bill to the State Duma. It is hoping to rapidly enshrine its demands to the banking sector in Russian law. Lawmakers have previously claimed that the Russian CBDC will be interoperable with the digital currencies issued by other BRICS member states. Some have claimed that it will be put to use in the cross-border trade sector, where it will help Russian traders avoid sanctions regimes. But critics claim that the coin may violate citizens’ privacy rights. They also complain that the digital RUB will be hard to use in more remote parts of Russia, where internet connectivity is often unstable.

2025-06-26T23:24:13,"US stock futures open with a new all-time high as Bitcoin stumbles","Stock futures in the United States opened Thursday night flat, but the S&P 500 still managed to press its face against a fresh record, leaving investors glued to the screen as they wait for the official inflation numbers due Friday morning. This comes as the index climbed 0.8% during the day, ending the session at 6,141.02, just inches away from the 6,147.43 intraday record last hit in February. The Dow Jones added 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite moved up nearly 1%, also heading toward a potential all-time high of its own. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added just 33 points in after-hours trading, a 0.1% lift. Meanwhile, Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 futures stayed mostly unchanged. This cautious positioning comes ahead of key inflation data that will either keep the rally going or yank it off course. Investors wait for new inflation data According to CNBC, Rick Rieder, who heads global fixed income at BlackRock, said, “There is so much money that wants to come into the market that didn’t for a while. And I just think if you don’t have any negative news, the natural gravitational pull is across all these assets.” On Friday, traders are set to dig into May’s personal consumption expenditures price index. It’s a big deal—this is the Fed’s preferred inflation measure. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect a monthly increase of 0.1%, and a year-over-year jump of 2.3%. The core PCE, which takes out food and energy, is also forecasted to rise 0.1% for the month and 2.6% for the year. That’s not all investors are watching. The morning will also bring updates on consumer spending, personal income, and consumer sentiment. The results could decide if the recent rally continues or runs out of steam. Despite the Fed still dancing around its rate strategy and ongoing geopolitical pressure, the stock market has clawed its way back from its lows earlier this year. All three major indexes have posted solid weekly gains: the S&P 500 and Dow are up over 2%, and the Nasdaq has jumped more than 3%. Bitcoin trapped in tight range as whales unload While equities flirt with records, Bitcoin is stuck pacing the same ten-foot circle it’s been walking since May 9. The price has mostly bounced between $102,000 and $112,000, with just one brief spike beyond that ceiling to hit a new high, still barely ahead of its last one. It hasn’t managed a strong rally, despite an insane amount of interest from institutions. Just this Wednesday, Bitcoin ETFs recorded their 12th straight day of inflows and are now heading toward their ninth positive week in eleven, pulling in $3.5 billion just this month, according to Coin Metrics. Yet Bitcoin itself has only risen by 2%. Markus Thielen, who leads 10x Research, explained why. “We are not seeing a lot of real demand right now because the demand has been almost perfectly offset by the selling from these larger wallets,” he said. Markus called it an “orderly” change of ownership, where old megawhales are taking their time to sell off coins to new buyers like ETFs and corporate treasuries. The wallets that are buying the most this year? Those holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC. CryptoQuant classifies these holders as dolphins, and Julio Moreno, the firm’s head of research, says that many ETFs probably fall into this group. Whales and miners control the game The biggest players in crypto right now are still whales (wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC) and megawhales (10,000+ BTC). But they’re not buying. They’ve been net sellers since the start of the year. Retail wallets, those holding less than one full bitcoin, are also dumping. It’s the dolphins who are stepping in to soak up that pressure. But that balance is fragile. Julio said that companies like BlackRock and Strategy (the company formerly known as MicroStrategy) have built large positions using hundreds of wallets. BlackRock holds around 550 wallets, each averaging 1,290 BTC. Strategy controls about 490 wallets, with an average of 927 BTC per wallet. But even with these holdings spread out, they’re considered large buyers behind most of the recent ETF flows. Despite all the buying, price movement has stayed muted. That’s because some of the biggest bitcoin reserves on the planet are still in the hands of Chinese miners. Between 2013 and 2021, China controlled up to 75% of the global hashrate. Out of the 19.9 million bitcoins mined so far, between 11 and 15 million came from China-based miners. Of that, about 5 million are still under their control, according to Markus. Normally, during a big price rally, these wallets start dumping on exchanges. This time, they haven’t. “It seems that these wallets are holding – holding tight and only releasing as many bitcoin as can be scooped up by ETFs and by Strategy,” Markus said . Strategy, now focused on corporate crypto adoption, has slowed down its BTC buying this year. That’s mostly because its stock premium has narrowed, and competition from other treasury buyers is rising fast. Markus warned that “if megawhale selling accelerates further, a deeper correction is likely.” On the other hand, if those big sellers back off and whale accumulation starts to rise, the next leg up might finally begin.

2025-06-26T23:05:35,"Crypto Founder Hints on Optimal XRP Sell Point","Edoardo Farina, a well-known supporter of XRP and Head of Social Adoption at XRP Healthcare, recently made a strong statement reinforcing his long-term confidence in the digital asset. According to Farina, there is no conceivable global or financial crisis, no matter how severe, that would compel him to sell any portion of his XRP holdings for less than $100 per token. Despite XRP struggling to hold above $2, Farina continues to promote a mindset of long-term accumulation within the XRP community. His comments are intended to strengthen the commitment of other investors who may be discouraged by market volatility. Unshaken by Global Disasters or Market Crashes In a recent statement , Farina outlined a list of hypothetical catastrophes, including global warfare, widespread economic collapse, artificial intelligence revolts, and even highly improbable scenarios such as a zombie outbreak or extraterrestrial invasion. He stressed that even under these extreme conditions, he would not sell his XRP unless the price surpasses the $100 mark. I'M NOT SELLING $XRP !!!!! World War III, alien invasion, atomic bomb, financial collapse, AI takeover, zombie apocalypse, NOTHING will shake me out. The Blackrocks and market manipulators can already give up. They ain't getting 0.1 XRP below $100! — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 24, 2025 This declaration follows recent geopolitical tensions that triggered notable market fluctuations. After the U.S. launched strikes on Iranian nuclear sites amid the Israel-Iran conflict, markets experienced a temporary downturn. During this period, Bitcoin briefly dropped below $100,000, while XRP fell below $2. The crypto market has since shown signs of recovery. According to Farina, such events only serve to reinforce his strategy. He believes that long-term value will ultimately prevail over short-term disruptions. His refusal to liquidate XRP holdings under pressure reflects his conviction that temporary shocks should not dictate investor behavior. Outlook on XRP Reaching $100 Farina has consistently expressed the belief that XRP is undervalued and possesses the potential to rise to $100 per coin . This target represents a projected increase of over 4,500% from its current value of approximately $2.19. He previously argued in March that, under fair market conditions, XRP should already be trading well above this benchmark. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other market analysts have raised similar projections. The Modern Investor recently described XRP’s current price as evidence that the asset is still in an early phase of market recognition. Likewise, analyst BarriC stated last month that XRP could potentially hit $100 before the close of 2025. Strategic Holding and Long-Term Goals Farina has not disclosed the exact number of XRP tokens he holds. However, he frequently advises fellow investors to aim for a minimum of 10,000 XRP as part of a serious long-term investment strategy. At current prices, this would amount to roughly $21,900. If XRP were to reach $100, such a holding would be valued at $1 million, supporting the rationale behind his firm stance against selling prematurely. Edoardo Farina’s declaration reflects a broader sentiment among XRP supporters who remain optimistic despite market turbulence and skepticism. His position is built on a belief in XRP’s long-term growth potential and his commitment to strategic holding, even in the face of extreme global events. While his outlook may seem aggressive to some, it underscores the deep conviction shared by many within the community.

2025-06-26T23:00:20,"From DAG Speed to DeFi Power: BlockDAG’s $323M Roadmap to Real-World Crypto Finance","Over the past few years, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) chains have gained attention for their speed and scalability. Kaspa stands out with high throughput and rapid transaction finality. But even with these improvements, one thing remains missing: practical adoption. DAG networks have yet to connect their tech with global payments, DeFi, and mainstream usage. BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping into this space. It uses a hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) plus DAG model, supports EVM tools, and is focused on real-world functionality. Rather than just speeding up transactions, BlockDAG is building a usable network for finance, remittance, and on-chain tools, bridging the gap that other DAG chains have left open. Why DAG Speed Alone Hasn’t Been Enough DAG chains like Kaspa have solved issues like slow confirmation and throughput limits. But most of these projects stop at core infrastructure. They rarely expand beyond the protocol layer. As a result, adoption stays small. BlockDAG is taking a different approach. It doesn’t rely only on DAG speed. Instead, it combines multiple missing features: Proof-of-Work for trustless security EVM compatibility for Ethereum-native app building A no-code dApp builder to open access Integrated DeFi tools: DEX, oracles, and cross-chain bridges This structure helps BlockDAG grow into a high-speed network that actually supports financial use, not just technical performance. How BlockDAG Plans to Power Real Financial Use BlockDAG’s roadmap outlines its plan to add finance-focused tools into its base layer. In Q4 2025, just two weeks ahead of listing, major modules will go live: A native DEX for seamless swaps Lending and borrowing tools Real-time oracles and on-chain indexers A bridge to other chains for liquidity These aren’t ideas for later. They’re ready for release before exchange trading starts. That’s key. Many Layer 1s delay real features until after launch. BlockDAG’s financial stack is part of its early release phase. Its long-term aim goes further. BlockDAG wants to be a DAG-based payment backbone for fast transactions, remittance, and DeFi trading. That’s what many scalable chains miss: how to turn speed into usefulness. PoW + DAG: A Practical Blueprint for Payments BlockDAG’s system blends DAG’s fast confirmations with PoW’s security, similar to what powers Bitcoin. The result is a network that can manage thousands of transactions every second while staying decentralized and secure. Most chains use validators to bundle transactions for efficiency. But bundling creates delays, something payments can’t afford. BlockDAG avoids this by confirming in parallel and anchoring it with PoW, removing both latency and trust issues. This setup supports: Decentralized crypto point-of-sale systems Live foreign exchange settlements Cross-border micro-payments Lightning-fast DEX trades These are not future dreams. If BlockDAG sticks to its plan, real users could be making these transactions by mid-2026. The Numbers Behind BlockDAG’s Growing Adoption So far, BlockDAG has secured over $323 million from its crypto presale and sold 23.3 billion BDAG coins. Over 2 million mobile users have joined its X1 mining app . Meanwhile, 18,170 ASIC miners have been purchased. X30 and X100 rigs ship starting July 7, and X10 follows on August 15. This is clear traction. The project is already powering its builder tools, DeFi roadmap, and high-speed chain with strong financial backing. Its pricing also shows market planning. Batch 29 now sells at $0.0276, showing a 2,660% gain from Batch 1. A temporary $0.0030 price still applies, ahead of its fixed listing at $0.05. For current entries, that’s 2,400% in projected returns. More Than Just Speed: A Financial Layer 1 in the Making DAG technology has given chains a performance edge, but few use it for actual financial tools. BlockDAG is doing both, layering DeFi features on top of scalable tech. Its testnet is live, presale is thriving, and its product suite is built to launch just before market entry. That timing is rare among new chains. If its plan plays out, BlockDAG could not only match Kaspa’s throughput but go further, becoming the first DAG-based Layer 1 to drive crypto payments, DEXs, and real-world financial use. Because speed alone doesn’t drive adoption. But the speed that powers real finance just might.

2025-06-26T22:57:49,"Wall Street sees stablecoins as trillion-dollar shortcut to kill banks and dominate payments","Wall Street is quietly betting big on stablecoins, not as a crypto side hustle but as a full-blown replacement for bank wires and card networks. Today, Circle, which went public on the New York Stock Exchange earlier this month, saw its shares jump almost 8%, recovering from a brief dip. The stock has now surged over 600% since its IPO. That price action is coming at a time when big financial firms are laying new tracks to run global payments through stablecoins instead of traditional banks. The excitement around Circle didn’t happen in a vacuum. Bitcoin and ether have both been climbing this week, pushed higher by hopes of lower interest rates, a calmer stance from President Trump’s White House on tariffs, and a temporary breather in Middle East conflicts. But for investors chasing Circle and the stablecoin market, it’s not just about riding the crypto wave. It’s about ripping out the old money pipes and laying down a whole new system. Fiserv and Mastercard start connecting stablecoins to payments rails According to CNBC, Fiserv, a payments company with deep ties in banking, released a stablecoin earlier this week. Almost immediately after, Mastercard linked that coin into its existing payments network. It’s one of the clearest signs yet that old-school finance is loading up the backend for what they see as a trillion-dollar opportunity. Zach Abrams, the co-founder and CEO of Bridge, told CNBC’s MacKenzie Sigalos on Thursday’s “Crypto World” that stablecoins could grow into the trillions, calling them “an entirely new money-movement platform, like credit cards were decades ago.” He added, “Credit cards created trillions in value, and I think stablecoins will be the same.” Abrams says this transformation will unfold over years, not months, but it’s already happening behind the curtain. His company, Bridge, which just got bought by Stripe in a $1.1 billion deal, is already powering real transactions. ScaleAI, which recently received a $14 billion investment from Meta, uses Bridge to pay its global network of data labelers. SpaceX is also using Bridge to collect payments from Starlink customers in local currencies and convert them back to U.S. dollars. These are real-use cases, not test pilots. Traditional banks want in before the trillions show up Today, the $400 billion stablecoin market is controlled mostly by Tether and Circle, but that’s not the ceiling. Abrams said most major banks expect the market to reach a few trillion. That’s why he believes traditional players like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Fiserv will need to take a piece of the traffic. “It won’t get to a few trillion without a huge percentage being handled by traditional financial institutions,” Abrams said. What this means is clear: the banks that helped build the old system are now racing to rewire it before it’s fully out of their hands. And the tools they’re using are stablecoins, not wires, not ACH, not SWIFT. Meanwhile, Wall Street’s push into tokenization keeps expanding. Republic, an investment startup based in New York, announced this week that it will let users buy digital tokens representing shares in private companies like SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The price of entry? Just $50. That’s a massive drop from the usual $10,000 minimum required for investing in these kinds of deals. It’s the kind of retail-access play that shows how far tokenization has already gone, and how much more Wall Street thinks it can extract from packaging real-world assets into tradable tokens.

2025-06-26T22:20:00,"XRP Price Prediction – Major “Breakout” Predicted Within 90 Days – $589 XRP Possible?","XRP (XRP) is quietly regaining traction after a weekend dip below $1.90, bouncing back as geopolitical headlines reshaped market sentiment. A brief slip under the $2 psychological level was quickly reversed after President Trump stepped in to broker a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, sparking a wave of renewed buying. Yet despite the rebound, XRP has struggled to break out of a months-long consolidation phase, frustrating investors who expected follow-through after its late-2023 surge near all-time highs. One popular crypto trader seems to think that the wait could be over soon. Egrag Crypto, a pseudonymous account followed by more than 85,000 users on X shared a bullish XRP price prediction that sees an upcoming spike to $27 per token. #XRP – The Breakout Is Coming – Base On Math : Based on historical patterns, breakouts from triangle formations (symmetrical, ascending, or descending) typically happen around 75% to 95% of the total pattern duration. Calculations for a 334-day pattern: 75% of 334… pic.twitter.com/64hhEK0J0A — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 24, 2025 This rally should begin from July to September based on a bull flag pattern Egrar has been tracking for a while. According to his estimate, the full upside potential of these patterns typically unfolds in 75% to 95% of the time that it took them to be fully formed and broken. XRP Price Prediction: On Track to Hit $2.6 If Positive Momentum Gains Traction Heading to the charts, we can see that XRP has broken above a descending price channel and has already retested the upper bound of this pattern from above twice. These retests confirm the setup’s bullish bias and anticipate a significant rally that could push XRP to at least $2.6 in the near term based on the channel’s height. The 9-period and 21-period exponential moving average (EMA) have made a bullish crossover in this 4-hour chart already and they seem to be headed for a ‘golden cross’ with the 200-period EMA as well. The $2.3 level is the key resistance to watch in the short term. A move above this area will confirm a bullish XRP price prediction to the $2.6 target. A move toward $589 seems quite unlikely at the time but Egrar’s prediction does favor a strong bullish movement to uncharted territory. That said, the best crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) can offer the kind of upside potential that well-established tokens can’t. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises $1.6M to Launch its Bitcoin L2 Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is an ambitious crypto project that aims to unlock the untapped potential of Bitcoin’s decentralized finance (DeFi) and meme coin segments. Through a Solana-based layer-2 scaling solution, Bitcoin Hyper aims to attract the attention of both developers and users who will now be able to stake, lend, borrow, and transfer BTC tokens rapidly and cheaply. The protocol’s architecture is quite simple. A Bitcoin wallet address will be used to receive users’ Bitcoin tokens. Once the assets are deposited, the Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge, which will monitor this address 24/7, will mint that same amount of tokens in the Bitcoin Hyper L2. As the protocol becomes rapidly adopted by top wallets and exchanges, the demand for HYPER will rise rapidly. To buy this token at its discounted presale price and reap the highest returns, head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

The removal of over $7.5 million from the TRUMP liquidity pool, widely interpreted as an intention from insiders to cash out, casts doubt on the long-term Trump coin price outlook . For a meme coin so closely pegged to the social momentum and influence of U.S. President Donald Trump, a move from its core team to pull away from the token could mark a collapse. TRUMP is now 45% below its late-May peak following the presidential dinner for top holders, struggling to regain traction and in need of a fresh social catalyst to reignite retail attention. Whale Ramps Up Sell-Offs Following $7.5 Million Withdrawal According to an X report from smart money tracker Lookonchain, the TRUMP coin team moved $4.4 million in USDC and $3.12 million worth of TRUMP from its liquidity pool on June 25. The #Trump Meme Team removed 4.4M $USDC and 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) in liquidity 6 hours ago. They then bridged 4.4M $USDC to #Ethereum and transferred 347,438 $TRUMP ($3.12M) to a new wallet. https://t.co/ORSLE6vJiA https://t.co/SYyNae1nio pic.twitter.com/okTk1u0Ow9 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 26, 2025 The USDC has since been bridged to Ethereum, while the remaining 347,438 TRUMP tokens were transferred to a newly created Coinbase wallet. With no details on the purpose or intention of the transfer, speculation-fueled FUD around an insider sell-off could be detrimental for a meme coin that is already struggling with low demand. Lookonchain also flagged that a known whale has quietly ramped up profit-taking efforts following the transfer, placing a limit order to sell 275,672 TRUMP worth nearly $2.5 million.

The mass movement of capital from large hands could put pressure on the Trump coin price as it approaches the conclusion of a falling wedge forming since its late May peak. TRUMP / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. This comes as wider market dynamics flip bullish for the first time since, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line in a golden cross—an early sign of a potential trend reversal. The RSI has also bounced from oversold territory at 30, an indication of seller exhaustion. However, FUD may have stopped buyers from filling the gap as it stalls at 33. This bullish momentum coincides with a critical bounce from the wedge’s lower support, aligned with a historic accumulation zone below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement at $9.30. If bulls can defend it, the zone creates a confluence zone with the patterns’ upper descending trendline and a prime setup for a breakout. A successful breakout sets a technical target around the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $14.50, representing a potential 60% gain from current prices. However, if the accumulation zone fails, the next major support sits at 20% lower at $7.15, mirroring the mid-April market bottom and likely invalidating the bullish setup. Bitcoin Season Just Got a Whole Lot More Bullish Those who jumped to more speculative plays like TRUMP coin over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin.

2025-06-26T22:04:52,"CoreWeave Returns With New $1B+ Bid for Core Scientific After Rejection","CoreWeave is back at the negotiating table with a renewed push to acquire Core Scientific, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. The AI-focused cloud infrastructure firm is reportedly in advanced talks to buy the Bitcoin mining and hosting giant, after a previous $1 billion bid was rejected last year. Core Scientific Jumps 27% as CoreWeave Reignites Acquisition Talks The earlier offer, made at $5.75 per share, was turned down by Core Scientific’s board, which said the proposal undervalued the company. Since then, Core Scientific’s stock has surged. It jumped more than 27% to $15.67 on Thursday after the report surfaced, briefly triggering a trading halt. The company is now valued at around $3.7 billion, more than double CoreWeave’s earlier bid. *COREWEAVE IN TALKS TO BUY CORE SCIENTIFIC: WSJ Blocks are always moving in the #Bitcoin mining industry. $MNRS Learn more about $MNRS : https://t.co/kCpi8yOYF1 pic.twitter.com/sy9DG1f8dR — Grayscale (@Grayscale) June 26, 2025 Talks are ongoing, and the deal could close within weeks if negotiations continue without major setbacks. So far, the exact terms of the new offer have not been disclosed. Core Scientific operates one of the largest digital infrastructure networks for Bitcoin mining and data hosting in North America. In recent months, it has attracted attention beyond crypto, thanks to the global demand for data center capacity driven by artificial intelligence workloads. The two companies already have a deep relationship. In June last year, Core Scientific signed a series of 12-year contracts to host CoreWeave’s AI operations, supplying hundreds of megawatts of capacity. The agreement is expected to bring in billions in revenue over time and represents Core Scientific’s broader shift toward AI infrastructure. CoreWeave, which went public in March and now holds a market cap of roughly $75 billion, has rapidly scaled its AI infrastructure business. The company rents out access to Nvidia GPUs, often through partnerships with big tech firms. Microsoft alone accounted for over 60% of CoreWeave’s revenue in 2024, with Meta and IBM also among its clients. A successful acquisition would bring Core Scientific’s infrastructure under CoreWeave’s control, forming a major player in both Bitcoin mining and AI compute power. As demand continues to stretch global data center resources, the combination of Core Scientific’s scale and CoreWeave’s AI expertise could prove strategically valuable. Carlos Ramírez, an analyst following the sector, noted the shift. “Core Scientific is no longer just a crypto company,” he said. “Its infrastructure is becoming key to AI growth, and CoreWeave knows it.” While Core Scientific’s shares rallied on the news, CoreWeave’s stock slipped slightly. Market reactions to takeovers often reflect concern over deal execution, especially when integration or financing challenges loom. For now, all eyes remain on the negotiation table as CoreWeave looks to seal what could become one of the largest deals at the intersection of crypto infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Core Scientific Eyes AI Future Amid Revenue Decline, New CoreWeave Offer As CoreWeave returns with a renewed $1 billion-plus offer for Core Scientific, the backdrop tells a story of a mining firm in transition. Back in February, the Bitcoin mining firm secured a $1.2 billion agreement with CoreWeave to boost data center capacity for high-performance computing (HPC), signaling a pivot toward AI infrastructure. The move is expected to drive $360 million in colocation revenue by 2026, offering a buffer as traditional mining revenue comes under pressure. In Q1 2025, Core Scientific posted a net profit of $580 million , up from $210 million a year earlier. But revenue fell short of expectations, dropping to $79.5 million, down from $179.3 million in Q1 2024. @Core_Scientific reported a first-quarter net profit of $580 million for 2025, a sharp increase from $210 million a year earlier. #Bitcoin #Mining https://t.co/a2zHWUsRcs — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 The slump reflects weaker mining yields after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving and a strategic shift from self-mining to HPC hosting. Self-mining still brought in $67.2 million, but hosted and colocation mining lagged, contributing just $12.4 million combined. Industry-wide, miners are feeling the squeeze. According to CryptoQuant, daily miner revenues dropped to $34 million on June 22 , the lowest since April, due to falling BTC prices and lower transaction fees. Bitcoin miners just saw their worst payday in a year. Daily revenue slipped to $34 million in June, the lowest since April. Falling fees and Bitcoin’s price drop are crushing margins. pic.twitter.com/TXdN06CU1F — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 26, 2025 Analysts say miners are now the “most underpaid” they’ve been all year. Meanwhile, sustainability is improving. A Cambridge University study shows that 52.4% of Bitcoin mining now runs on sustainable energy , up from 37.6% in 2022. But uncertainty looms as President Trump’s proposed tax bill threatens to slash incentives for solar and renewable-powered miners, potentially raising energy costs across the sector.

2025-06-26T21:30:14,"A Tale Of 3 Mayors And Bitcoin’s Climb From $754 To $107,000","According to Bitwise’s Jeff Park, Bitcoin has gone from a risky experiment to a six-figure asset over three New York mayoral terms. Related Reading: Bunker Buster: Ethereum Titans Stake $100 Million Amid US-Iran Hostilities It started near $754 when Michael Bloomberg left office in December 2013. Now, as the city prepares for its next election, it’s trading above $107,000. These numbers show a rise of about 14,590% in just over a decade. Mayoral Timeline Marks Bitcoin Growth Bill de Blasio took over in January 2014. At first, Bitcoin barely budged. But by December 2021, it hit roughly $47,000. That climb happened while de Blasio’s two terms played out on City Hall’s stage. The crypto market had its ups and downs, yet the overall trend pointed skyward under his watch. Worth noting that in the time it took New York to go from Bloomberg to Mamdani, Bitcoin soared from $754 to $106,000+ today. You may not see nor believe it right away, but this is actually not a coincidence. Separate money from state. — Jeff Park (@dgt10011) June 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Surge Through Political Change When Eric Adams stepped in as mayor in January 2022, he made headlines by taking his first paychecks in Bitcoin. The move sent a clear message that New York was open to crypto. The market then endured a tough 2022 bear phase. Still, Bitcoin bounced back strong in 2023 and kept going. This month, it’s up about 3% and sits at $107,567, according to figures by Coingecko. Separate Money From State Park used the mayor count as a storytelling tool. He’s calling for a break between money and government. His view: people should choose how they handle their own cash. Political shifts come and go, but Bitcoin keeps growing on its own terms. That steady rise speaks to the idea of financial freedom outside state control. New Leadership And Future Trends Zohran Mamdani has surged ahead in the Democratic primary after Adams declared an Independent bid. Since Democrats usually win in New York, many see Mamdani as the likely next mayor. Related Reading: Double Win: Dogwifhat Jumps 24% Alongside Bitcoin’s $107K Push Park even joked that Bitcoin’s journey has moved “from Bloomberg to Mamdani.” That line underlines how the asset climbed, even as the city’s politics reshuffled itself. It’s easy to draw lines between mayoral posters and price charts. But Bitcoin’s real drivers go beyond City Hall. Global demand, big investors, shifts in mining, and moves by the Federal Reserve have all shaped its path. New York’s mayors provide handy markers on the timeline, not the engine of growth. On Crypto & Politics As New York eyes November 2025, Bitcoin stands as proof that financial tools can live beyond politics. The question now isn’t whether the next mayor will back crypto. It’s how far Bitcoin will go when its story isn’t tied to any single office.

2025-06-26T21:20:24,"Sharplink sees unrealized losses of $36 million on its ETH holdings","Gaming company Sharplink is at a $36 million loss despite increasing its ETH stash. This follows the recent decline in ETH value, with the token falling more than 6% in the last 30 days amidst market uncertainties. On-chain analyst Ember CN shared the development on X, noting that the company bought another 5,989 ETH worth $14.47 million on June 26. With its latest acquisition, Sharpink has 194,000 ETH, worth around $507 million. The company purchased its ETH at an average price of $2,611, slightly below the current price of $2,474. However, the sizable accumulation of ETH by the company is impressive given that it has been less than a month since it transitioned to an Ethereum treasury company after closing a $425 million funding round led by Consensys. However, the Sharplink is far from done with its accumulation, given that a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last month shows that it has plans for another $1 billion raise, with all the funds expected to go towards accumulating ETH. Since its first purchase using funds raised from the funding round, Sharplink has been using proceeds from the sales of its shares through its at-market offering to buy more ETH. The company has also been staking all its ETH holdings to earn more Ether. Corporations showing interest in altcoin treasuries Meanwhile, the continued accumulation by Sharplink is likely part of its goal to become the biggest corporate holder of ETH in its reserves. Given its current stash, it appears to have already achieved that, especially since only a few companies have an Ethereum treasury. While it might be the one with the biggest ETH treasury, Sharplink was not the first public company to consider ETH as a treasury asset, with BioNexus Gene actually releasing an Ethereum Strategy Whitepaper back in March. Another public company with a known ETH treasury is Bit Digital. The Bitcoin miner recently transitioned to focusing solely on ETH staking and treasury, stating that it holds over 24,000 ETH and 417.6 BTC as of March 31, 2025. However, it plans to convert its Bitcoin holdings to ETH while also planning to sell its Bitcoin mining infrastructure and divert the proceeds to ETH. Unsurprisingly, the move caused its stock to fall. Nevertheless, it highlights how several companies are now hopping on the altcoin treasury trends instead of choosing BTC. For instance, companies such as Upexi, Sol Strategies, DeFi Development Corp, and MemeStrategy have all opted for a corporate Solana treasury to acquire and stake SOL. Other firms have also picked altcoins, such as HYPE, XRP, and BNB, as treasury assets. A Chinese chip maker, Nano Labs, recently released a plan to buy $1 billion BNB, while companies like ViVoPower and Webus plan to buy XRP and Lion Group Holdings is targeting a HYPE treasury. Despite this diversification among public companies, Bitcoin treasuries remain the biggest trend, with more companies establishing corporate Bitcoin strategies. Crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano’s firm, ProCap BTC, recently announced a plan to go public as a Bitcoin treasury company through a special purpose acquisition deal. The company has been busy buying BTC in anticipation of the move. However, concerns about establishing crypto treasuries continue to grow, especially as the adoption keeps increasing. Some experts believe this poses a major risk, especially as many firms now leverage debt to acquire crypto assets. Sharplink stock continues to perform well Meanwhile, the unrealised loss on Sharplink’s ETH treasury has no major impact on its stock performance. According to Yahoo Finance data, Sharelink SBET closed on June 25 with a 6.42% gain and has already seen an extra 4.57% increase in pre-market. It is now trading at $10.28, with a 52.98% gain over the past month. It is also up 33.85% year to date, showing that the optimism around ETH recovery is spreading to SBET. With market observers bullish on Ether rebound, some believe Sharplink is getting in early. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-06-26T21:01:21,"Core Scientific’s stock jumped 35% after reports that CoreWeave is in talks to buy the company","Core Scientific’s stock price shot up 35% on Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave is in talks to buy the crypto miner. The news caused a temporary halt in trading, but the rally picked up again once the pause ended. This was Core Scientific’s second-biggest trading day since its return to the Nasdaq in January 2024, after it came out of bankruptcy. The sharpest jump the company ever saw was last June, when it climbed 40% in a single session after announcing a major AI expansion deal with CoreWeave. The new acquisition talks are tied to that same relationship, which has turned into a billion-dollar partnership over time. The companies signed a series of 12-year contracts last summer worth $10.2 billion, with Core Scientific committed to delivering 590 megawatts of AI-ready infrastructure by early 2026. CoreWeave’s 2024 bid rejected, deal now being revisited The Journal report said the buyout deal could be finalized in the next few weeks, unless something derails it. If agreed, the acquisition would deepen CoreWeave’s involvement with Core Scientific beyond just contracts. It also highlights how the AI boom has changed the game for miners. Core Scientific was once just a bitcoin miner struggling to stay afloat. Now it’s sitting on close to $5 billion in market value, five times higher than when CoreWeave first tried to buy it. In 2024, CoreWeave made a $5.75 per share offer for Core Scientific . At the time, that offer put the company’s value at just over $1 billion. But Core Scientific turned it down, saying the bid undervalued the business and that it preferred to focus on its existing deals. With its stock now trading well above that old offer, the tables have turned. The partnership between the two has grown stronger since that rejected proposal. They’ve been working together for years, but the 12-year contract signed in June 2023 formalized things. Core Scientific agreed to supply hundreds of megawatts of hosting power to support CoreWeave’s compute-heavy AI infrastructure. Bitcoin miners rush into AI as space and power run low Core Scientific’s shift into AI isn’t unique. Many crypto mining companies are now trying to retool their data centers to meet demand from AI firms. But analysts have warned that AI infrastructure often needs full-scale builds, not just old mining rigs converted into something else. It’s not always a simple flip. Still, companies like Core Scientific are trying to cash in while demand is high. With limited data-center space and rising competition for electricity, timing is everything. Being able to deliver infrastructure quickly has become more important than mining blocks. Even so, CoreWeave’s share price fell by about 1% on Thursday. That’s not a massive drop, but it’s a sign the market isn’t reacting the same way on both sides of this possible deal. Core Scientific, meanwhile, has made its turnaround story all about AI. Since leaving bankruptcy in early 2024, it’s shifted large portions of its operations to hosting high-performance workloads instead of mining bitcoin full-time. That move has put it ahead of many competitors who are still trying to adapt. The company is now one of several crypto miners competing for AI clients, looking to make use of every available megawatt of energy and every square foot of hosting space. With the AI race heating up and real estate for GPUs running thin, whoever controls the infrastructure gets the money. And Core Scientific, thanks to its 12-year agreement with CoreWeave , has already locked in its seat at the table.

2025-06-26T20:55:50,"CoreWeave takes a second shot at Core Scientific acquisition","Last year’s $1 billion offer was a non-starter. Now, with AI demand surging and Bitcoin mining margins tightening, CoreWeave has circled back and is reportedly in new talks to acquire Core Scientific. On June 26, the Wall Street Journal reported that CoreWeave, the AI cloud infrastructure provider backed by Nvidia and powering clients like OpenAI and Microsoft, has reopened negotiations to acquire Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. The move comes nearly a year after Core Scientific’s board dismissed CoreWeave’s initial $5.75-per-share offer ($1 billion total) as “significantly undervaluing” the company. This time, the terms remain undisclosed, but the market’s reaction was immediate: Core Scientific’s stock surged 28%, pushing its valuation close to $4 billion. People familiar with the matter say the latest negotiations follow a string of multi-year infrastructure deals between the two companies, including a major contract for 200 megawatts of power to support CoreWeave’s high-performance computing services. You might also like: U.S Senate eyes fall finish for crypto rules as House keeps cards close Can the second bid stick this time? CoreWeave’s renewed pursuit of Core Scientific appears to be about securing the infrastructure needed to win the AI race. The AI cloud provider, fresh off a $1.5 billion IPO and partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, is locked in a battle for computing power with rivals like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud. Unlike those giants, CoreWeave doesn’t own massive data center networks. That’s where Core Scientific comes in. Core Scientific controls something even more valuable than raw computing power: energy infrastructure. The Bitcoin miner’s facilities, mostly located near cheap, abundant power sources, are already wired for high-density computing, making them ideal for AI workloads. The existing 200-megawatt deal between the two companies, signed last year, was just the start. Owning Core Scientific outright would give CoreWeave direct control over power contracts, bypassing the scramble for data center capacity that’s bottlenecking AI expansion. What’s in for Core Scientific? For Core Scientific, the timing couldn’t be more strategic. The company emerged from bankruptcy in early 2024 with a leaner operation and a stronger balance sheet, but Bitcoin’s halving in April slashed mining rewards, squeezing margins across the industry. While some miners are selling off assets or pivoting to AI hosting piecemeal, Core Scientific’s management has held out for a bigger play. Their first-quarter profit of $580 million, largely driven by Bitcoin’s price rebound and efficient operations, proved they’re no longer a distressed asset. Now, they’re a strategic one. Whether the deal closes or collapses, the return of CoreWeave to the negotiating table underscores a broader realignment in digital infrastructure. The boundary between Bitcoin mining and AI compute is thinning, not because the technologies are converging, but because they share the same scarce foundation: power. In that light, Core Scientific’s real value may not be its mining rigs, but the grid connections beneath them.

2025-06-26T20:30:27,"Ethereum Fakes Out Bears – Altcoin Rally Depends On Key Level Breakout","Ethereum is back in focus after reclaiming the critical $2,444 resistance, following a sharp recovery from its breakdown below the $2,200 mark. The move has revived bullish sentiment, with many analysts calling for Ethereum to lead the long-anticipated altseason. The swift rebound caught traders off guard, reinforcing the view that the recent drop was nothing more than a fakeout. Related Reading: Ethereum Gears Up For Breakout Above $2,800 – Bullish Momentum Builds Top analyst M-log1 commented on the reversal, stating that ETH is back in range. His analysis points to the idea that Ethereum’s price action has successfully shaken out weak hands while setting the stage for a bullish continuation. If momentum holds, ETH could attempt a move toward the higher range around $2,600–$2,800, a zone that has consistently acted as a battleground in previous cycles. Ethereum’s role as the leading altcoin makes its performance critical for broader market direction. A confirmed breakout here could trigger renewed confidence across the altcoin market and open the door for the long-awaited altseason. For now, bulls are in control—but Ethereum must hold current levels and push higher to keep the momentum alive and avoid another retracement into bearish territory. Ethereum Holds the Line: The Key to Unlocking Altseason? Ethereum surged following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, easing geopolitical tensions and triggering a sharp rebound across the crypto market. ETH, which had briefly broken down below the $2,200 mark, has since reclaimed key resistance near $2,444—indicating growing strength among bulls. While buyers initially lost control during the wave of uncertainty, they are now regaining momentum as the entire market braces for the next decisive move. Despite rising optimism, the macroeconomic backdrop remains fragile. Recession fears in the U.S. continue to build as leading indicators flash warning signs, and tightening global financial conditions may pressure risk assets in the coming months. Yet in the crypto space, focus is shifting toward Ethereum’s performance as the likely spark for the long-awaited altseason. M-log1 shared his view, saying, “ETH is back in range. Nice fake out after all.” His technical analysis suggests that Ethereum has reentered its consolidation zone, a move that could signal strength if followed by continued upward momentum. “If we want alts to do well,” he added, “we want ETH to move towards the higher range here and break out as soon as Uncle Bitcoin makes a new ATH.” With Bitcoin hovering just 4% below its all-time high, Ethereum is now in a critical position. A sustained breakout from current levels could trigger renewed risk appetite across the altcoin market, creating the perfect setup for a rotation. For now, Ethereum is holding the line—but it must maintain this bullish structure and break above resistance to lead the next phase of growth. All eyes remain locked on ETH as it charts the course for what comes next. Related Reading: Chainlink Reclaims Key Structure – Quiet Accumulation Could Fuel $25–$30 Surge ETH Regains Strength Near Key Resistance Levels Ethereum is showing signs of renewed momentum, trading at $2,451 after bouncing back strongly from a brief breakdown below the $2,200 level. The chart shows ETH has reclaimed the short-term descending trendline and is now testing major moving averages, with the 50-day SMA at $2,254, the 100-day at $2,639, and the 200-day just overhead at $2,780. This confluence of resistance above makes the $2,500–$2,800 zone a key battleground. Volume appears to be picking up alongside the price, signaling increased interest as ETH reclaims structure. This rally was partly fueled by the broader market response to geopolitical easing in the Middle East, but the technical setup now holds independent bullish potential. The recent price action forms what could be a classic “fakeout” and re-entry into range — a pattern that often precedes strong breakouts. To confirm a trend reversal, Ethereum needs to push and hold above the $2,650–$2,800 resistance band. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Loads Up: $422M In ETH Bought In Under a Month If bulls can sustain this pressure, a run toward the March highs near $3,200 becomes increasingly likely.

Reports indicate that most recipients receive one of three letter types: 6173, 6174, or CP2000. But what do these letters mean, and do they signal a broader crackdown on crypto? Regulation of cryptocurrency taxes is still something many people don’t pay attention to; however, ignoring this part of financial life may be dangerous. The most vivid example is the use of alleged tax evasion for the prosecution of Roger Ver, one of the first notable Bitcoin popularizers.

But I’m going to keep getting pissed any time the gov questions me when they don’t hold themselves accountable for anything. — Wendy (@reallywendy) June 17, 2025 What makes some of these letters look creepy is that the IRS is throwing facts like “we know you owned crypto between 2018 and 2020” at the receiver and alleging that the letter receiver may not have reported crypto-related income properly. Let’s check what these letters mean practically. Types of the letters Mainly, crypto investors receive three types of letters from the IRS: 6173, 6174, and CP2000. Form 6174 is regarded as the least disturbing, as it has solely an informational purpose and doesn’t require action. It is a “soft notice” letter and, basically, it can be ignored. Got one too “Letter 6174-A” Told don’t respond you are self incriminating yourself. Still speak with a crypto tax professional since every situation is different. Love how they said this in the letter. pic.twitter.com/MNwU6xYTjZ — 🅽🅾🅳🅴🆉 (@BlueCollarNodes) May 3, 2025 Still, it signals that the IRS is aware of your involvement in crypto investment. If the IRS believes the taxpayer has done something wrong, it may send more urgent letters later. Letter 6174 may be seen as a good reason to check if previous reports were made correctly. 6174 doesn’t indicate that the IRS is aware of any wrongdoing. Taxpayers may receive this letter if they were using U.S.-based exchanges, such as Kraken, Coinbase, Binance US, and others. Another possible reason is that their crypto transactions were reported by someone using Form 1099-MISC or 1099-B. Finally, the receiver’s account could have been flagged by the IRS because of a third-party data match. The 6173 and CP2000 letters are more urgent and require action. Letter 6173 is the letter that wasn’t frequent until now. It states: “We have information that you have or had one or more accounts containing virtual currency and may not have met your U.S. tax filing and reporting requirements for transactions involving virtual currency, which include cryptocurrency and non-crypto virtual currencies.” This letter cannot be ignored as it unambiguously informs a taxpayer that they have allegedly underreported their crypto income, and the IRS can do an audit. The info about the taxpayers’ crypto transactions may be obtained by the IRS from the exchanges they use. Discrepancies between reported crypto transactions and exchange data may lead to a 6173 letter. On top of a complete lack of reports on crypto, the reason may be errors in reporting—such as not reporting staking or mining rewards, not applying capital gains tax on crypto conversions, and more. A tax attorney can help fix the problems before the deadline indicated in the letter. The CP2000 notice includes the specific amount that needed to be reported. The source of this letter is the Automated Underreporter Unit of the IRS, which generates due notices using computers. Given that these notices are generated automatically, there’s a chance they’re incorrect. In some cases, CP2000 claims the taxpayer owes more in taxes than they actually do. Some forms may inform the taxpayer of a refund. If the amount is correct, the taxpayer may fill in the form and pay. If not, it’s better to dispute it. Calling a tax attorney may be an option. Given how much info the IRS may gather, a proactive position of crypto investors and traders is a must. It’s better to work on tax reports diligently and be ready to respond to IRS letters in time. Usually, this means within a 30-day period. The IRS vs. Trump Administration 2.0 The IRS will have more information about cryptocurrency transactions than before. That will happen this year as soon as Form 1099-DA is adopted. The pressure is rising, even as the crypto-friendly Trump Administration 2.0 is planning the abolition of the IRS itself and replacing it with tariffs. In January 2025, Congressman Earl Carter proposed a bill replacing the IRS with a consumption tax—meaning that prices would rise substantially. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explained that the plans to abolish the IRS are in line with the protectionist policies of Donald Trump. The replacement of the IRS with tariffs is summed up with the credo: “make the outsiders pay.” It’s unclear whether Trump will actually abolish the IRS anytime soon, but the increased scrutiny of crypto transactions may only fuel supporters’ desire to shut the service down.

The trader pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 321,100 followers on the social media platform X that dogwifhat ( WIF ), a memecoin built in the Solana ( SOL ) ecosystem, could go up by about 472% to reclaim and surpass the all-time high recorded in March of 2024. “Still a lot of work to put in and need to see price action confirm, but I think there’s a very real chance a new impulse back to all-time high on WIF has commenced.” According to the analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, WIF started a bullish uptrend earlier this month in a five-wave pattern. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Based on Bluntz’s chart on the three-day time frame, WIF bottomed out earlier this year. Source: Bluntz/X Over the short term, the pseudonymous analyst says WIF could undergo a correction before rallying. Based on the widely followed analyst’s chart of the one-hour time frame, WIF could pull back by around 10% from the current level. “Very obvious five-wave rise from the lows on hourly for WIF, would expect a bit of a pullback here before the next major leg up.” Source: Bluntz/X WIF is trading at $0.845 at time of writing.

2025-06-26T19:58:02,"IntelBroker Indicted: British National Faces Charges for $25M+ Data Breach on BreachForums","A British national has been indicted in the United States for allegedly orchestrating a large-scale hacking operation under the alias “IntelBroker,” resulting in over $25 million in damages to businesses and institutions worldwide. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York announced the indictment of 25-year-old Kai West on Wednesday. West is accused of using his “IntelBroker” identity to infiltrate computer networks, steal sensitive data, and sell it on underground cybercrime forums. Hacker “West” Ran Global Data Theft Operation, Used Monero to Obscure $2.4M in Sales Authorities say West led a cybercriminal group known as “CyberN[——],” which infiltrated systems belonging to a telecommunications company, a municipal healthcare provider, an internet service firm, and dozens of other organizations. Prosecutors say West and his associates stole sensitive data and sold it online, often requesting payment in Monero, a cryptocurrency favored for its privacy features. Serial hacker “IntelBroker” charged in $25 million cyber scheme. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice,” said USA Jay Clayton. https://t.co/CrMzWtJ1fR pic.twitter.com/ob6gJDsALF — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) June 25, 2025 Over a two-year period, from 2023 to 2025, West allegedly posted and offered stolen data across at least 158 public threads. He listed data for sale in 41 of those posts, asking prices that totaled over $2.4 million. In many cases, he gave away stolen information in exchange for forum credits or to boost his reputation within the hacker community. One breach included patient data from a healthcare provider, exposing names, Social Security numbers, and health records. In another case, West reportedly accessed servers of a U.S. telecom firm and sold customer details. Prosecutors allege that West even served as the “owner” of BreachForums between August 2024 and January 2025, further solidifying IntelBroker’s profile in the cybercrime space. “This action reflects the FBI’s commitment to pursuing cybercriminals around the world,” said U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton. “New Yorkers are all too often the victims of intentional cyber schemes, and our office is committed to bringing these remote actors to justice.” FBI Assistant Director Christopher G. Raia described West as a “serial hacker” who profited off stolen data and caused harm to organizations across borders. “Today’s announcement should serve as a warning to anyone thinking they can hide behind a keyboard and commit cybercrime with impunity,” he added. According to the complaint, an undercover agent paid IntelBroker $250 in Bitcoin for stolen data, which included admin-level credentials. The payment was sent to an address linked to Conor Brian Fitzpatrick (aka IntelBroker), and the data was delivered. Fitzpatrick and his associates allegedly tried to sell more data for over $2 million. West was arrested in France in February 2025. The U.S. is seeking his extradition to face prosecution. He is charged with conspiracy to commit computer intrusions, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, unauthorized access to protected computers, and wire fraud. If convicted on all counts, he faces a maximum sentence of 50 years in prison. The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Ryan B. Finkel leading the prosecution. West remains in custody in France pending the outcome of the extradition request. The charges remain allegations, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Massive Credential Leak Raises New Alarms After IntelBroker Indictment Following the indictment of British national IntelBroker for allegedly trafficking stolen data worth over $25 million via BreachForums, a new report from Cybernews has added fuel to the fire, revealing one of the largest credential leaks ever recorded. According to researchers, over 16 billion login credentials linked to platforms like Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub have been exposed in a sweeping breach. But this wasn’t a single incident. Over 16 billion login records from Apple, Google, Facebook, Telegram, and GitHub exposed in fresh malware-based data breaches. #cybersecurity #databreach https://t.co/YncLGPv9MU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 19, 2025 The data, traced back to early 2024, comes from infostealer malware, credential stuffing attacks, and several previously undisclosed leaks. Some individual sets contained as many as 3.5 billion records, with the average around 550 million. For crypto users, the implications are serious. Wallets and exchanges often tie to compromised email providers or cloud services. A breach in one could mean direct access to digital assets. Cybernews urges users to change passwords, enable multi-factor authentication, and scan devices for malware immediately. This follows a grim 2024, where the FBI recorded $9.3 billion in crypto fraud losses , up 66% from 2023. The Bureau also reported over 149,000 complaints, and had to intervene in suicide cases linked to crypto scams.

2025-06-26T19:55:27,"New Bitcoin All-Time High In the Cards, According to Analyst Michaël van de Poppe – Here’s His Timeline","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) surging to a new all-time high (ATH) is still a very real scenario. In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 792,000 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap looks poised to hit a new ATH by the end of next month, also noting that he expects BTC to dip before skyrocketing. “Bitcoin continues to push upwards and break the all-time high. I still think we’ll have a slight consolidation before the big breakout happens, which means that an all-time high is on the cards for July ’25.” Van de Poppe says that in order for the crypto king to shatter its previous best, it needs to first hurdle a key resistance level at $108,900. “Bitcoin has taken the liquidity. That’s great, there’s a lot of upside momentum here. However, this is the FINAL hurdle before a new ATH. I think we’ll consolidate slightly and break towards new ATHs in the coming 1-2 weeks max.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X According to the analyst, BTC rallying would also send altcoins skyrocketing due to them being short-squeezed, or a rapid increase in price driven by short sellers covering their positions. “Altcoins are looking primed for a big move upwards. If Bitcoin is able to break up, Altcoins are likely to outperform. How? Massive short squeezes across the board accelerating the price action of those altcoins upwards vanishing losses away in days/weeks.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,633 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours.
