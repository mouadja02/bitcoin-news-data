2025-06-27T06:49:48,"BitBoy Says XRP Will Flip Bitcoin Soon","A recent video circulating on X has reignited debate within the crypto community. Amonyx (@amonbuy), a popular figure in the crypto space, shared footage featuring Ben Armstrong, widely known as BitBoy, claiming that XRP will soon flip Bitcoin. This is not the first time Armstrong has expressed this view, but the timing of his latest remarks has intensified interest in whether such a scenario is realistic. Armstrong has supported XRP for years and is one of the most prominent voices in the crypto space who can see the asset’s true potential. He has often cited the asset’s utility and regulatory clarity as catalysts for growth. With institutional adoption on the rise and the Ripple lawsuit nearing its end, XRP seems to be on the verge of a massive rally. BitBoy says #XRP will FLIP #Bitcoin SOON! pic.twitter.com/kcGNCf8PFu — Amonyx (@amonbuy) June 25, 2025 The Path to the Number One Spot Bitcoin, as the first cryptocurrency, has always held the top position in market cap since its creation in 2009. For XRP to surpass Bitcoin, it would require an extraordinary increase in both price and overall adoption. XRP is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency in the market and the third-largest non-stablecoin. The asset has consistently outperformed Ethereum in 2025, and many experts, including Bitboy, believe Ethereum won’t hold its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency for much longer. Surpassing Ethereum would put XRP head-to-head with Bitcoin in a battle for the top spot in the crypto market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Can XRP Flip Bitcoin? The belief that XRP could achieve this is rooted in its design and use case. Unlike Bitcoin, which operates primarily as a store of value, XRP is designed for payments, offering fast and low-cost transactions. XRP’s consensus mechanism also allows for greater scalability compared to Bitcoin’s, and it is significantly more energy efficient . Experts have frequently pointed to XRP’s growing role in cross-border settlements and partnerships with financial institutions as a reason to be bullish. These fundamentals give XRP a path toward mainstream financial adoption at a scale that Bitcoin may not achieve. A closer look at both assets’ performance also shows that XRP has provided greater returns as it has risen by 490% since 2022 , while BTC has only grown by around 10%. However, XRP has a large gap to close if it plans to surpass Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $2.14 trillion, with the asset controlling almost 65% of the entire market. XRP has a market cap of just $129.08 billion, but this has not discouraged Bitboy or other advocates who believe XRP can achieve this feat.

2025-06-27T06:48:39,"Doge ETF inches toward approval as Bitwise updates filing","The proposed spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund ETF may be gaining ground, as growing engagement between issuers and regulators boosts hopes for approval. According to recent filings , Bitwise Asset Management has submitted amended applications to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for its proposed spot Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Aptos ( APT ) ETFs. Bitwise was one of the first firms to file for a Dogecoin ETF in January, and the amendments come as engagement continues between issuers and the regulatory commission over the proposals. The updated filings also follow the SEC’s recent decision to delay its review of Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF, citing the need for more time to assess whether the product meets legal standards. A key change in the revised proposals is the addition of “in-kind” creation and redemption mechanisms, a feature absent in the original filings. This change allows ETF shares to be exchanged directly for the underlying crypto asset, which can improve tax efficiency and reduce market impact. You might also like: Why “there’s not going to be enough Bitcoin” according to Bitwise CEO Commenting on the amended filings, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas described the updates as a positive sign, noting they reflect growing momentum around spot crypto ETFs. He added that the inclusion of in-kind mechanics is a “huge update,” likely to set a positive precedent and become standard across the board.

Meanwhile, other firms, including Grayscale and 21Shares , are also in the race for a Dogecoin ETF approval, while Bitwise remains the only issuer to file for an Aptos fund to date.

2025-06-27T06:46:54,"Bit Digital falls 15% after Bitcoin departure, raises $150m to buy more Ethereum","The crypto mining firm Bit Digital officially marks its departure from Bitcoin mining and towards Ethereum staking by issuing $150m shares in a public offering to buy more ETH. In a recent press release , Bit Digital announced that it will be issuing 75 million shares at $2 each, with an additional 11.25 million shares available to underwriters via a 30-day option. In total, the public offering will be enough to raise $150 million in capital. The offering is set to close on June 27 and will be subjected to “satisfaction of customary closing conditions.” According to the company’s statement, the funds generated from the public offering will be used to buy Ethereum ( ETH ) in order to accelerate building an ETH treasury. The company describes itself as a “digital asset platform focused on Ethereum-native treasury and staking strategies.” This marks one of the largest public ETH treasury commitments to date. Not only that, it also marks the company’s first major pivot from Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining as it attempts to fully transition towards Ethereum staking and building a dedicated ETH treasury. Bit Digital’s stock saw a 15% drop after it effectively quit Bitcoin by accelerating ETH accumulation efforts, June 27, 2025 | Source: Yahoo Finance You might also like: Ethereum co-founder: Wall Street will ‘go deep’ into DeFi and Ethereum After the news broke, indicating that it would be formally ditching Bitcoin in favor of Ethereum, the Bit Digital stock BTBT plummeted by 15.32% upon the latest closing price.

As of June 14, Bit Digital held approximately 24,434 ETH (nearly $59.6 million) and 417.6 BTC ($44.85 million). With the recent public offering, the company will be able to increase its Ethereum holdings to $209.6 million based on the current value of ETH, which sits at $2,441. The company declared that it plans to convert all its Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum in the future. Earlier this month, amidst the rapidly growing trend of institutions vying for BTC reserves, companies focused on building corporate Ethereum reserves are also catching up. As previously reported by crypto.news, on June 19 strategic reserves among institutions amounted to 1.190 million ETH.

2025-06-27T06:29:37,"UAE Firm Buys $100M in WLFI Token Backed by Trump-Linked Crypto Venture","A company based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has purchased $100 million worth of WLFI, the governance token of World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency platform tied to U.S. President Donald Trump and his family. Key Takeaways: A UAE firm has invested $100 million in WLFI, surpassing Justin Sun as the largest holder. The deal aims to boost WLFI’s efforts in tokenizing real-world assets and expanding stablecoin use. Trump family ties to WLFI continue to draw political scrutiny amid growing concerns over foreign influence. In a joint announcement on Thursday, World Liberty Financial and the Aqua1 Foundation described the deal as a strategic move to accelerate the development of a blockchain ecosystem focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, stablecoin infrastructure, and decentralized finance. UAE Firm Aqua1 Becomes Largest WLFI Holder, Overtakes Justin Sun The announcement positions Aqua1, a self-described Web3-native fund, as a major WLFI stakeholder, surpassing Tron founder Justin Sun, who committed $30 million to the project last November. “Aqua1 and WLFI will work together to identify and support blockchain projects with transformative potential,” said Dave Lee, founding partner at Aqua1. He emphasized WLFI’s vision for integrating traditional finance with blockchain protocols, calling it “a trillion-dollar pivot opportunity.” The investment marks another high-profile link between the Trump family and international crypto dealings. World Liberty Financial, co-founded by President Trump’s three sons, has already drawn scrutiny from lawmakers. President Trump disclosed $57.4 million in income tied to WLFI and holds 15.75 billion of the platform’s governance tokens, according to recent filings. Back in May, Eric Trump sparked criticism when he revealed that Abu Dhabi-based MGX planned to use WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance. That announcement came just as U.S. lawmakers ramped up discussions on new rules governing payment stablecoins. The overlap between legislative developments and the Trump family’s crypto business has raised red flags among some members of Congress. During a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing this week, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi declined to comment directly when pressed by Senator Jeff Merkley on the president’s involvement with World Liberty Financial . Merkley warned against foreign influence in American policymaking. “I think it’s important for the leader of the Justice Department of the United States to be very concerned about foreign influence,” he said. “Americans should make American decisions — not have them bought through crypto coins.” Trump Continues to Capitalize on Crypto Market Momentum Meanwhile, Donald Trump continues to capitalize on crypto market momentum. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative.

According to the crypto software firm’s June 26 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the offering will include any combination of Class A common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, or units. The Form S-3 shelf registration enables Bakkt to issue these securities in one or more tranches over time, depending on market conditions. Bakkt may allocate proceeds from future equity or debt financings into Bitcoin or other digital assets. While no purchases have been made yet, Bakkt said its updated investment policy now permits such acquisitions as part of its broader treasury strategy. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our Investment Policy,” Bakkt noted in the filing. The filing also noted that the timing and scale of any crypto asset acquisition will depend on business performance, market conditions, capital availability, and strategic priorities. The firm is exploring various financing options, including convertible notes or bonds, to support these plans.

2025-06-27T06:00:48,"Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Shoots Up: Warning For BTC?","Data shows the Bitcoin Open Interest on the cryptocurrency exchange Binance has recently shot up. What could this mean for the asset’s price? Bitcoin Binance Open Interest Has Seen A Sharp Increase As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Open Interest on Binance has spiked. The “Open Interest” refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of BTC positions that are currently open on a given derivatives platform. When the value of the metric goes up, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. As the total amount of leverage present in the sector rises when new positions appear, this kind of trend can lead to the asset’s price becoming more volatile. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction On the other hand, the indicator observing a decline suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Since leverage goes down with such a trend, the cryptocurrency can become more stable following it. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 24-hour percentage change of the Bitcoin Open Interest for the Binance exchange over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the 24-hour change in the Binance Bitcoin Open Interest recently shot up to a notably positive value, implying the number of positions on the platform saw a significant jump. At the peak of this spike, the indicator hit a value of more than 6%. From the chart, it’s visible that there have been a couple of other occasions that the metric has breached this mark during the past month. Interestingly, each of these spikes coincided with points that preceded a period of consolidation/decline for Bitcoin. As the quant notes, This recurring pattern suggests that large inflows into leveraged positions often precede periods where short-term gains are realized, leading to potential price pullbacks or sideways movement as market participants de-risk. The analyst has also shared another chart, this one tracking the 7-day change in the Realized Cap of the short-term holders and long-term holders. The “Realized Cap” refers to an indicator that keeps track of the capital that the holders have invested into Bitcoin. Below is a chart that shows the change in this metric for two investor cohorts, short-term holders (holding time of 155 days or lesser) and long-term holders (holding time greater than 155 days). As is apparent from the graph, the 7-day change in the Realized Cap has recently been positive for long-term holders, which suggests capital has been maturing from the short-term holders into this cohort. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ That said, earlier in the month, the indicator hit a peak of $57 billion, but today it has come down to just $3.5 billion. So, while capital is still aging into long-term holders, it’s now happening at a much slower rate. BTC Price Bitcoin has been attempting to break past the $108,000 mark, but so far, it hasn’t found success as its price is still trading around $107,200.

2025-06-27T05:58:13,"Crypto Exchange Bakkt Files for $1B Shelf Offering, Plans to Buy Bitcoin","Crypto marketplace Bakkt has filed for a $1 billion shelf registration with the SEC to raise capital, potentially to fund Bitcoin acquisitions under its updated treasury strategy. The shelf offering could include sales of Bakkt’s Class A common stock, preferred stock, bonds, warrants, and debt securities. This strategy allows for flexible capital raising, without the need for a separate registration every time. Per the S-3 registration , filed on Thursday, the proceeds are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. Under the newly updated investment policy , a portion of it could be allocated to Bitcoin and other digital assets. “We may acquire Bitcoin or other digital assets using excess cash, proceeds from future equity or debt financings, or other capital sources, subject to the limitation set forth in our investment policy,” it read. According to the SEC filing, the firm has not yet made any Bitcoin purchases. Additionally, Bakkt intends to explore further financing alternatives, including the issuance of convertible notes, bonds, to purchase Bitcoin. Bakkt’s Latest Crypto Treasury Plans Bakkt announced on June 10 that it will allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin and other “top-tier” cryptocurrencies. This aligns with its view in crypto as a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. The firm, founded in 2018, is also actively evaluating global jurisdictions to deploy these strategies. Besides, the timing and magnitude of Bitcoin purchases will depend on market conditions, capital market receptivity and business performance. “This initiative is intended to support Bakkt’s transformation into a pure-play crypto infrastructure company and to enable us to strategically add Bitcoin and other digital assets to our treasury,” said Akshay Naheta, Co-CEO of Bakkt, at the time. Bakkt Warns Regulatory Uncertainty, Evolving Crypto Rules The filing stated risk disclosures, warning of regulatory uncertainties, potential security classification of crypto, and banking access disruptions. Bakkt admitted that it had a “limited operating history and a history of operating losses.” Last year, the company said it was concerned about its operational viability in 2025, owing to inadequate cash reserves. ICE-Backed Bakkt Alerts of Possible Closure, Cites Cash Crisis @Bakkt , the cryptocurrency platform backed by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has issued a warning about its financial health. #CryptoNews #news https://t.co/xGlJcXaB9F — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 8, 2024 The filing also specifically warned about future operations, where it “identified conditions and events that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.” In March 2025, the firm’s shares tanked 27% , after two major clients, Bank of America and Webull, had withdrawn their ties with Bakkt.

This event is a big one, being the end of the month and end of the second quarter, so there could be an impact on spot markets. They have been recovering since Monday’s crash, but Bitcoin is really the only asset that has seen notable gains, and momentum was waning as the week ended. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.74, meaning that there are more long sellers than shorts. There is also a max pain point of $102,000, around $5,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at the $140,000 strike price, with more than $1.7 billion, and $120,000 is also a hot level. However, OI has also increased to over $1.5 billion at $85,000 and $95,000 as bearish speculators increase, according to Deribit. “Bitcoin options open interest on Deribit just hit an all-time high, $40 billion and counting,” the firm said on X.

This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $17.3 billion. Crypto Market Update Total market capitalization has retreated 2.5% this Friday, falling just below $3.4 trillion at the time of writing. However, it remains within a two-month sideways trading channel. Bitcoin failed to surpass resistance at $108,000 and had fallen back to the $107,000 area during the Friday morning Asian trading session, though it was looking resilient, having recovered from its Monday crash to $98,500. Ethereum prices were still stagnant , with the asset failing to break resistance at the former support price level of $2,500.

While that won’t happen, Scott’s updated timeline is still faster than what many expected. Just a day earlier, Senator Cynthia Lummis had suggested the process might drag into year-end. But during the event, she threw her support behind Scott’s deadline, saying, “Yes, sir. You’re the chairman, and we will do as you wish.” GENIUS Act Ready—But House Still Hesitating A big piece of the puzzle is the GENIUS Act , a bill focused on regulating stablecoins. The Senate passed it last week, and Scott urged the House of Representatives to fast-track it to the President’s desk, aligning with Trump’s stance. “The president’s mandate to move the GENIUS Act immediately is in the best interest of the American people,” Scott emphasized. [post_titles_links postid=”475444″] White House crypto adviser Bo Hines backed the push, praising both Scott and Lummis for staying aligned with the administration’s crypto vision. But not everyone’s in sync. Representative French Hill from the House Financial Services Committee pointed out that differences still exist between the Senate’s version and the House’s stablecoin bill. That could delay things. One More Hurdle? Another hurdle is the Agriculture Committee, which must also approve the market structure part of the bill. So far, it hasn’t matched the pace of the Banking Committee, making it a possible bottleneck. Still, if everything comes together, the U.S. could have a full crypto framework by the end of September, finally giving the industry the clarity it’s been waiting for.

2025-06-27T05:30:00,"Miner Conviction Grows While India Eyes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve","Bitcoin’s role in global finance appears to be evolving, with miners increasingly choosing to hold their coins amid a revenue downturn and India’s ruling party proposing a sovereign Bitcoin reserve pilot to strengthen economic resilience. Bitcoin Miners Defy Market Logic, Hoard BTC Despite Declining Revenue and Record Prices Bitcoin miners have significantly increased their BTC holdings despite a challenging profitability environment and Bitcoin trading near its all-time highs. According to new data published by on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, miners have collectively added 4,000 BTC to their reserves since April 2025 — bringing their total holdings between 100 and 1,000 BTC to approximately 65,000 BTC, the highest level since November 2024. This accumulation has occurred against the backdrop of mounting operational strain. Daily revenues for miners have plunged to a two-month low of $34 million as of June 22, largely due to falling transaction fees and a slight dip in BTC’s price following a recent all-time high. Despite these pressures, miner selling activity has dropped dramatically. Outflows from miner wallets, which peaked at 23,000 BTC per day in February 2025, are now down to just 6,000 BTC — a trend that suggests miners are prioritizing long-term value over short-term cash flow. Bitcoin Miner Total Outflows (Source: CryptoQuant) Miners Endure “Extreme Underpayment” Conditions CryptoQuant’s latest Weekly Report describes Bitcoin miners as being “extremely underpaid,” noting that the current income environment is the harshest it’s been over the past year. This downturn in miner revenue comes just months after April’s halving event, which reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC — effectively halving the amount of new Bitcoin earned per mined block. Bitcoin Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability (Source: CryptoQuant) Hashrate — the measure of computational power on the Bitcoin network — has dropped by 3.5% in the last 10 days, marking the largest drawdown since July 2024. This has likely put added pressure on marginal mining operations, particularly those in regions with high energy costs or aging equipment. Still, many miners appear to be weathering the storm. CryptoQuant attributes this resilience to an average operating margin of 48%, which allows larger, more efficient mining firms to continue stockpiling BTC rather than liquidating it to cover expenses. Perhaps the most notable trend is the near-complete cessation of sales from so-called “Satoshi-era” miners — individuals or entities who mined Bitcoin in its earliest days, likely between 2009 and 2011. These early adopters are often regarded as market-moving whales due to their large BTC holdings and historical tendency to sell into strength during major bull markets. Bitcoin Satoshi-era Miner netflows (Source: CryptoQuant) However, 2025 appears to mark a change in strategy. According to CryptoQuant, Satoshi-era miners have sold just 150 BTC this year, compared to nearly 10,000 BTC in 2024. That’s a staggering 98.5% decrease in sales volume, even as BTC/USD continues to flirt with new record highs. Historically, movement of coins from these dormant addresses has signaled market tops and sparked panic among retail investors. The lack of activity from these wallets suggests either a newfound patience — or a deeper conviction that Bitcoin’s bull run is far from over. Capitulation or Conviction? This collective refusal to sell, even in the face of dwindling revenue, may be a bullish signal for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Earlier in June, the widely-followed “Hash Ribbons” indicator — which monitors miner capitulation phases — flashed a classic “buy” signal. The metric has proven historically reliable in identifying price bottoms, as miner capitulation tends to precede recoveries when weaker operators exit and long-term holders double down. With BTC currently trading just a few percentage points below its all-time high, miners’ behavior could suggest that they believe the market still has considerable upside. Their unwillingness to sell at or near the top may be signaling a longer-term price horizon beyond even the most optimistic projections currently circulating in the crypto space. The implications of miners turning into net accumulators are significant. As one of the few consistent sources of sell pressure in the Bitcoin ecosystem, a decline in miner sales reduces the overall supply of BTC available on the open market. Coupled with continued institutional inflows and increasing adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs, this creates a supply-demand imbalance that could act as a catalyst for further price appreciation. Moreover, the alignment between miner activity and long-term holding behavior reinforces a broader narrative of Bitcoin’s maturation. Gone are the days when miners rushed to dump their holdings after each halving cycle. Instead, the trend is shifting toward strategic reserve management and capital discipline — a sign of the industry’s growing sophistication. India’s Ruling Party Spokesperson Urges Bitcoin Reserve Pilot to Boost Economic Resilience Meanwhile, in a move that could significantly reshape India’s digital asset landscape, Pradeep Bhandari, the national spokesperson for India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has publicly advocated for a pilot program to establish a sovereign Bitcoin reserve. The proposal, outlined in an op-ed for India Today , positions the initiative as a pragmatic step toward strengthening national economic resilience and embracing the growing legitimacy of digital assets on the global stage. Bhandari cited the United States' strategic moves to accumulate Bitcoin and Bhutan’s government-led crypto mining initiatives as indicators that traditional finance is undergoing a crypto transformation. “This isn’t a reckless pivot,” he emphasized in the article. “It’s a calculated step toward embracing digital assets’ legitimacy.” The Global Context: Bitcoin Becomes a Strategic Asset Bhandari’s call for a Bitcoin reserve pilot is not made in isolation. The United States has recently outlined plans for budget-neutral Bitcoin acquisitions to bolster its strategic reserves. At least three US states have authorized Bitcoin as an official reserve asset. Meanwhile, Bhutan has deployed its renewable energy surplus to power state-backed Bitcoin mining operations. These developments reflect a broader shift in how nations view crypto—not merely as speculative assets but as strategic instruments with geopolitical and macroeconomic utility. According to Bhandari, India is uniquely positioned to lead this global shift, citing the country’s rapidly growing renewable energy sector. With vast potential in solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, India could develop a sustainable, state-managed Bitcoin reserve without compromising its environmental goals. He stressed that such a pilot would not only align with India’s ambitions to be a global digital leader but also stimulate innovation and attract institutional interest. A government-supported Bitcoin reserve could provide confidence to both domestic and international investors, positioning India as a pioneer in the responsible adoption of crypto infrastructure. Taxed but Unregulated: India’s Crypto Conundrum Currently, India’s regulatory stance on cryptocurrencies remains ambiguous. While digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are taxed under a flat 30% capital gains regime, there is no formal regulatory framework guiding their use, trading, or custody. Under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, profits from selling virtual digital assets (VDAs) are taxed at 30%. While acquisition costs can be subtracted from gains, no deductions are allowed for losses or other expenses. Moreover, a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is applied to all crypto transactions exceeding ₹10,000 (approximately $115), further dampening liquidity and market participation. This duality—taxation without regulation—has stifled innovation and deterred retail and institutional involvement alike. Bhandari referenced India’s leadership during its 2023 G20 presidency, where it spearheaded a crypto policy working group in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, he warned that the international community is moving faster than India. While recommendations will take their due course, Bhandari said, jurisdictions like Russia, China, Brazil, and other G20 nations led by the US are not pausing their crypto efforts to wait for a consensus. He argued that India risks falling behind if it fails to act with urgency. A sovereign Bitcoin reserve pilot could serve as both a policy accelerator and a signaling mechanism to global markets. A Strategic and Transparent Path Forward According to Bhandari, the first step toward embracing this opportunity is the launch of a Bitcoin reserve pilot program, accompanied by well-defined regulatory policies. He emphasized that such a framework should be transparent, investor-friendly, and designed to foster innovation while upholding consumer protections. He believes the initiative could act as a testing ground for broader digital asset strategies, from public-private partnerships in crypto infrastructure to government-backed mining operations powered by renewables.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9727/miner-conviction-grows-while-india-eyes-strategic-bitcoin-reserve,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

A key catalyst behind investor calm was the arrest of British national Kai West, known online as “ IntelBroker ,” who allegedly ran BreachForums and facilitated the sale of stolen corporate data. The FBI stated that West caused damages exceeding $25 million by leaking data from over 40 companies in exchange for Bitcoin and Monero. He was arrested in France and now awaits extradition to the U.S. Interesting report on how ""IntelBroker"" got caught.

India Proposes Bitcoin Reserve to Boost Economy In addition, there’s another bullish report came from India, where Pradeep Bhandari, a national spokesperson for the ruling BJP party, advocated for a Bitcoin reserve pilot. Writing for India Today , Bhandari highlighted how nations like Bhutan and the U.S. are already exploring sovereign crypto strategies, suggesting India could benefit from joining that list.

He argued that regulatory clarity, still lacking in India’s tax-heavy environment, could unlock innovation, attract capital, and position India as a leader in financial technology. India currently taxes crypto gains at 30% under Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act, without a formal regulatory infrastructure. Despite this, domestic interest in crypto remains strong. Bitcoin hovered at $107,100 after Bhandari’s remarks, signaling steady institutional confidence. Bitcoin Technicals Signal Potential Reversal Technically, Bitcoin faces stiff resistance at $108,250, the top of a descending trendline visible on the 2-hour chart. After bouncing sharply from $99,717, the asset broke above major Fibonacci levels—0.618 at $102,977 and 0.5 at $103,984—before stalling in a narrowing range. Price action suggests a rising wedge pattern, which often precedes a breakdown. Bitcoin price chart – Soruce: Tradingview The 50-EMA at $106,147 and the 23.6% Fib level at $106,237 offer critical support. Meanwhile, MACD is flashing bearish divergence, with momentum fading as histogram bars shrink. Recent candlesticks resemble spinning tops and doji formations—signals of indecision. Bearish trigger: Break below $106,200 Downside targets: $104,991 and $103,984 Upside invalidation: Daily close above $108,250 If bulls fail to clear $108,250 with conviction, we could see a pullback toward $104K. On the flip side, a clean break could set up a run toward $109,257 and $110,448.

2025-06-27T05:00:35,"Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Spikes as Billions Exit Derivatives, What Going On?","Bitcoin has regained some upward momentum, with its market price currently hovering around $107,155 at the time of writing. This marks a 0.4% decrease in the past 24 hours, and a 4.3% drop below its all-time high of $111,000, set in May. Despite the rebound, analysts are closely watching for potential shifts in momentum as a number of market indicators and macroeconomic signals suggest a more cautious short-term outlook. Among the recent developments drawing attention is a sharp rise in Net Taker Volume on Binance, along with significant stablecoin outflows from derivative platforms. CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha noted in a recent market commentary that these changes could indicate increased speculative activity. While some traders interpret such surges as bullish signals, they often occur due to short liquidations or sudden retail buying rather than consistent organic demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Floor Rises Toward $100,000, Reinforcing Bullish Sentiment Derivatives Activity and Fed Commentary Fuel Market Caution On June 24, Binance’s Net Taker Volume crossed $100 million for the first time since early June. This level of activity, according to Taha, can sometimes signal buying momentum but may also point to forced closures of short positions, especially in high-leverage environments. Taha emphasized that without strong capital inflows to back the movement, these bursts tend to be short-lived. Simultaneously, more than $1.25 billion in stablecoin liquidity has exited derivative exchanges, marking the largest capital outflow from these platforms since May. These outflows reduce the base for opening new leveraged positions, potentially dampening future market momentum. Taha also pointed to external economic cues, particularly a recent statement by US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. During his testimony before Congress, Powell signaled that rate cuts may be on the table depending on upcoming economic conditions. While looser monetary policy is often viewed as favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin, the shift also reflects underlying uncertainty. The analyst also mentioned that the Swiss Franc, traditionally seen as a safe-haven currency, has also surged against the US dollar, suggesting that some investors are leaning risk-off amid broader macroeconomic developments. Market Structure Remains Firm, But Momentum Is Slowing Separately, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Dan offered a different perspective using a bubble chart model that visualizes trading volume trends across exchanges. According to Dan, Bitcoin is currently experiencing a “cooling” phase. This implies reduced trading activity without dramatic spikes in volume, often seen as a sign that the market is consolidating rather than overheating.

2025-06-27T05:00:09,"Bitcoin Miners Face Worst Payout In A Year As Revenue Crashes To $34 Million","On-chain data suggests the Bitcoin miners have recently been the most underpaid in around a year, as daily revenue hits a $34 million low. Bitcoin Miner Revenue Has Observed A Plummet According to data from the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant , the margins of the Bitcoin miners have recently taken a notable hit. Miners earn their revenue through two sources: block subsidy and transaction fees . The first component, the block subsidy, refers to the reward that these chain validators receive as compensation for adding a block to the chain. The network gives out this reward as a fixed BTC-denominated amount. Due to the existence of a feature known as the difficulty , miners are only able to add blocks at a more or less fixed rate of time, which adds another constraint to the block subsidy. If speed and amount are fixed, that leaves only one variable related to this reward: the Bitcoin spot price. Changes in the price directly affect miners’ income from the block subsidy. The other component of miner revenue, the transaction fees, is connected to the level of activity that BTC is observing. Investors attach these fees to their transfers as a small payment for the validators. In times when the network isn’t handling any notable traffic, senders have little incentive to pay any significant amounts, as chances are that their transfers will go through quickly anyway. When there is congestion present, however, transactions can get stuck in the mempool for a while. During such periods, investors who want their moves to go through fast have no choice but to outcompete the other users in transfer fees. As such, the total transaction fees being received by the miners tend to spike during times of high activity. Now, here is the chart shared by CryptoQuant that shows the trend in the two components of Bitcoin miner revenue over the past year: As displayed in the left graph, the combined daily revenue of the Bitcoin miners has recently gone through a plunge. “Falling fees and Bitcoin’s price drop are crushing margins,” notes the analytics firm. During the price low earlier, the metric reached a low of $34 million, which is the lowest that its value has been since April 10th. This comparison, however, doesn’t accurately portray how bad the current situation is for the miners. The chart on the right shows the data of the Miner Profit/Loss Sustainability, a model that compares the miners’ revenue against the difficulty to determine how fairly paid the group is. From the indicator’s trend, it’s apparent that the recent low in mining revenue corresponded to miners being the most underpaid since July 2024.

2025-06-27T04:55:35,"XRP, Solana Lead Profit-Taking Among Crypto Majors Even as Bullish Mood Persists","Bitcoin BTC traded around $107,000 on Friday as crypto markets took a breather, with investors booking profits in majors like XRP XRP and Solana’s SOL SOL despite strong macro tailwinds. XRP dropped over 4% to reverse gains from earlier in the week, while Solana slid 3% to retest the $140 support level. BNB Chain’s BNB BNB, dogecoin DOGE, Cardano’s ADA ADA and ether ETH showed losses below 2%. The slight pullback follows a generally positive week for crypto majors, driven by cooling inflation indicators, diminishing geopolitical risks, and renewed optimism surrounding crypto policy frameworks in Asia. “We think that conditions are ripe for Bitcoin to surpass its previous all-time high of about $112,000,” said Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at crypto exchange BTSE, said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. “Especially given that the Iran-Israel conflict seems to be over for the time being.”“Easing inflation fears and the likelihood of tariffs being watered down are compounding pressure on Fed Chairman Powell and he will likely either cut rates soon or be replaced earlier than expected, both of which would propel markets upwards,”Mei added. The remarks come as both traditional and crypto markets digest signs of softening macro stress. U.S. inflation data last week showed continued deceleration. Risk appetite across markets has rebounded quickly. The S&P 500 hit a new high this week, and crypto ETF inflows remain firmly positive — a trend market watchers see as a key indicator of growing institutional participation. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is reportedly considering reducing proposed trade tariffs to ease pressure on U.S. businesses, a move that could lower inflation and prompt the Federal Reserve to consider rate cuts sooner than expected. “As bitcoin hovers around $107K due to geopolitical uncertainty, institutions and investors keep a bullish perspective as crypto ETF inflows remain positive,” said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer of OSL, in a message to CoinDesk. “An update further drives this to Hong Kong's regulations on digital assets under its Policy Statement 2.0, which could enable the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) and implement licensing for stablecoins. We hold an optimistic outlook as regulators continue to develop approachable policies for the crypto industry,” Cheung said.

2025-06-27T04:51:12,"Why Judge Torres Said No to Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Settlement","The post Why Judge Torres Said No to Ripple vs SEC Lawsuit Settlement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Judge Analisa Torres has denied a joint motion filed by Ripple and the SEC — a move that’s now triggering deep conversations across the XRP community. Despite both parties seemingly on the same page for once, the court made it clear—there are no shortcuts when it comes to justice. Let’s break down what happened and why the judge blocked their attempt to move forward quietly. Ripple SEC Joint Motion Denied Ripple and the SEC, who have battled in court for years over XRP’s legal status, recently teamed up to ask Judge Torres to approve two key changes to their case: first remove the long-standing injunction, and second reduce Ripple’s penalty from $125 million down to $50 million . While the request came as a surprise to many, it was seen as a joint attempt to wrap things up early and cleanly. However, the judge wasn’t on board. She denied the request, stating that she cannot comment on or undo any part of the final judgment while the appeal is still active In essence, she made it clear, “You don’t get to erase a final judgment just because you’re now friends.” The ask was BIG: Cancel the permanent injunction Cut Ripple’s $125 million penalty by more than 60% Yes, Ripple and the SEC — two courtroom adversaries — came to the judge with a handshake and a proposal. But Judge Torres said: “You don’t get to erase a final… — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 26, 2025 Why Judge Torres Said No Ripple and the SEC tried using a rarely granted legal option under Rule 60(b)(6) , which allows for changes to a final judgment in extraordinary cases. But Judge Torres rejected this, pointing to Ripple’s earlier behavior—deliberate violations of securities laws, continued misconduct, and a lack of accountability. In her words, Ripple had shown no convincing sign of changing, and the existing injunction was still necessary to protect investors. She made it clear, no shortcuts will be allowed while the case is still on appeal. [post_titles_links postid=”475460″] Quoting a past U.S. Supreme Court decision, Judge Torres reminded both parties that a final court ruling belongs to the legal system, not just those involved. Courts are not tools for convenience, and legal decisions cannot be quietly erased even when both sides want to move on. Speculation Over Ripple SEC Allies? XRP supporters raise a bigger question: Why did Ripple and the SEC suddenly act like allies? Some believe both parties are preparing for something bigger—possibly a major shift in how digital assets will be used globally. With stablecoins launching, central bank digital currencies emerging, and even XRP ETF applications underway in Canada and Asia, the timing of this legal pushback feels significant. With the motion denied, the judge’s message is clear: settlements must happen in the open, and legal shortcuts won’t be tolerated.

Judge Torres denied the motion because a final court judgment cannot be reversed or altered via private settlement while an appeal is active. She also cited Ripple’s prior violations and lack of demonstrated change. How does the judge’s denial affect Ripple’s legal strategy moving forward? The denial means Ripple must either proceed with its appeal of the injunction (and the $125M penalty) or withdraw it, thereby accepting the judge’s existing rulings. It closes the door on a swift, private settlement to alter the final judgment. Could this ruling influence future negotiations between regulators and crypto firms? Yes, this ruling sets a precedent that courts may not easily allow private settlements to override final judgments, especially where public interest and investor protection are concerned. It signals that regulators and firms must engage through proper legal channels, like appeals, to challenge or alter final court decisions.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/judge-torres-blocks-ripple-sec-deal-no-shortcut-to-justice/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|XRP","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

It creates a national set of rules for stablecoins , which are digital currencies tied to real-world assets like the U.S. dollar. This would make it easier and safer for companies to issue stablecoins in the U.S., while also encouraging more homegrown innovation and cutting down on the country’s dependence on foreign financial tech. CLARITY Act: Defining the Crypto Landscape At the same time, the CLARITY Act is moving to the Senate. It aims to finally define what different types of crypto assets are, something the industry has lacked for years. This lack of clarity has kept large financial institutions on the sidelines, unsure how to legally get involved. If passed, the bill could unlock trillions of dollars in potential investment, giving the crypto space a massive boost. [post_titles_links postid=”475441″] A Turning Point for U.S. Crypto Leadership Together, these two bills represent a turning point. Industry leaders are calling this a “defining moment” that could make the U.S. a global leader in blockchain and digital finance. If July sees both laws move forward, it could mark the beginning of a new, more regulated, but more confident era for American crypto. Trump’s Tariff Plan in July However, apart from the bills, there is more to the story. The crypto space is also awaiting the July 8–9 tariff deadline, but as per recent talks, there are hints that Trump could delay it. So far, talks with China and the UK have begun, but no deals have been finalized. If progress is slow, Trump may step in to set his fair tariffs. Some countries, like India, are close to reaching a deal, and more could follow after Trump’s big tax-and-spending bill, expected by July 4. For now, extensions look likely for countries that are negotiating in good faith.

2025-06-27T03:57:54,"Bitcoin's Double Top Warrants Caution, But a Full-Blown Price Crash Seems Unlikely: Sygnum Bank","Bitcoin's BTC double top prospects above $100,000 warrant caution, but a full-blown 2022-style crash looks unlikely unless an unexpected black swan hits, according to digital asset banking group Sygnum's Head of Investment Research Katalin Tischhauser. ""The crypto market is strongly sentiment-driven as fundamental valuations are challenging; therefore, technical analysis signals such as the double top warrant caution. That said, a full-blown crash needs a catalyst like the Terra collapse of 2022 or the FTX blowup. Barring a similar black swan, we could see a prolonged bull cycle, based on the current political and regulatory support and sticky institutional capital flowing in,"" Tischhauser told CoinDesk in an interview. Bitcoin has spent 50 days mainly trading back and forth between $110,000 and $100,000, signaling an exhaustion of the uptrend near the highs reached in January this year. That has prompted several observers, including veteran technical analyst Peter Brandt , to consider the possibility of the BTC trend flipping bearish with a double-top pattern. The double top comprises two consecutive peaks at approximately the same price – near $110K in BTC's case – with a trendline drawn through the low point between these peaks. The low point in BTC's case is the early April slide to $75,000. Analysts are concerned that a potential double top breakdown, involving a downturn from $110,000 and a drop below $75,000, could lead to a crash to around $27,000. Yes, you read that right. Such a crash would mean a 75% slide from the peaks. Technical patterns, such as the double top, often become self-fulfilling prophecies – once traders spot the pattern, their collective action reinforces the expected outcome. So, it's natural for prospects of double top above $100,000 to cause some caution and price drop. However, technicals alone seldom cause a price crash of 75%. For instance, BTC's crash from $70,000 to $16,000 over the 12 months to November 2022 happened as the Fed's rate hike cycle exposed asset classes like crypto where excess speculation had built up, setting the stage for the demise of the Terra blockchain and the FTX exchange. Both events caused massive wealth destruction. Flows-led bull run The latest rally, however, is driven mainly by institutional flows rather than the story or pretence that DeFi is better than traditional finance or Ethereum is the new world computer, as Bloomberg's Joe Weisenthal noted last year. Since their debut on the Nasdaq in January 2024, the 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have registered net inflows of over $48 billion, per data tracked by Farside Investors . Meanwhile, BTC's adoption as a corporate Treasury asset has picked up the pace, adding to the bull momentum. As of the time of writing, 141 public companies held 841,693 BTC, according to bitcointreasuries.net . The flows-driven nature of the latest bull run makes it more resilient than the previous bull markets, according to Tischhauser. ""Institutions implement rigorous due diligence and risk assessment before they add a new asset class like bitcoin to the model portfolio. But when they do, the eventual allocation is for the long term. This trend of sticky institutional allocation is just beginning, and the resulting demand will continue to provide price support for some time to come,"" Tischhauser told CoinDesk. Tischhauser explained that these investment vehicles are sucking out liquidity, skewing the demand-supply dynamics in favour of a continued uptrend. ""These investment vehicles are sucking liquidity out of the market, which means, every time a new big-ticket investor hits the market with bids, this is addressing less and less supply, and the bullish impact on prices becomes more pronounced,"" Tischhauser noted. The halving cycle may be dead The bearish double-top crash scenario appears plausible to many observers, as we are in the post-halving year, which has historically marked bull market tops, paving the way for year-long bear markets. Halving is a programmed code in Bitcoin's blockchain that reduces the pace of BTC supply expansion by 50% every four years. The last halving occurred in April 2024 and reduced the per-block BTC reward to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. However, the halving cycle may not unfold as expected, as sticky institutional adoption has a greater bearing on price than miners. Moreover, BTC sold by miners, who regulatory offload coins earned to fund operational costs, now accounts for a tiny percentage of the average daily trading volume. ""The change in market leadership means the four-year halving cycle may not play out religiously as it did before. Earlier, most BTC holders were miners, and the BTC issued per year was a huge percentage of the outstanding bitcoin supply. So, selling pressure from miners mattered greatly to the market price. Now, the BTC mined is 0.05-0.1% of the average BTC daily trading volume and halving this supply has no impact on the supply/demand balance in the market. So the halving cycle may be dead,"" Tischhauser said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/27/caution-on-bitcoin-double-top-but-a-full-blown-price-crash-seems-unlikely-sygnum-bank-s-tischhauser-says,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Sygnum Bank|Markets|News",cryptocompare

She criticized both sides for trying to reverse a final court ruling through a private settlement. “The Ball Is Back in Our Court” If the parties “genuinely wish to end the case”, they are now given two options by the court: Ripple and the SEC can either drop their appeals or move forward to appeal her injunction. To this, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, reacted by saying, “The ball is back in our court.” With this, the ball is back in our court.

Judge Expected Strong Arguments John Deaton says that Judge Torres pushed back in a way the SEC didn’t expect. He explains that the SEC cited the wrong rule and failed to show any exceptional circumstances to justify changing her earlier decision. Judge Torres said that “the parties haven’t come close” to doing that. According to Deaton, there is a high bar to meet, and the SEC didn’t clear it. After years of work on the case, the judge was not convinced by the SEC’s sudden request to reduce the fine by 60% and expected a much stronger argument. [post_titles_links postid=”475450″] Deaton also expected more solid arguments from both sides and admits he underestimated the chances of the judge denying the motion, giving it only a 30% likelihood. He backed Judge Torres for following the law despite political changes. He said that protecting investors is important, especially in a crypto world full of scams like Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi, and FTX. Will Ripple and SEC Withdraw Their Appeals? Attorney Fred Rispoli said Ripple and the SEC will likely drop their appeals and settle around $50 million , keeping Judge Torres’ ruling in place. He also added that the SEC may privately or publicly assure Ripple that it won’t face further restrictions, as long as it stays compliant. The court’s injunction will stay in place, but only matters if the SEC chooses to enforce it, which he sees as unlikely.

The rejection means Ripple remains subject to the permanent injunction restricting institutional XRP sales and the original $125 million penalty. However, XRP’s legal status as “not a security” for programmatic sales remains unchanged. How might Ripple and SEC’s decision to drop or appeal affect XRP’s future regulation?

If they appeal, the case prolongs, potentially leading to a higher court ruling that could either reinforce or alter XRP’s regulatory classification.

2025-06-27T03:30:24,"Bitcoin and Solana Bulls Believe MAGACOINFINANCE Is the Way to $1.3 Million","Bitcoin’s latest stabilization phase and Solana’s ecosystem resilience have sparked a new conversation among bullish traders — where’s the next asymmetric opportunity? For many, MAGACOINFINANCE is fast becoming the top answer . Backed by aggressive accumulation, staking participation, and community-led growth, this rising altcoin is earning serious attention from both early traders and long-term capital allocators aiming for the next $1.3 million payoff. Solana (SOL) Expands as Developer Activity Surges Solana remains one of the most active and stable Layer 1 networks. Recent upgrades have further improved throughput and lowered latency, driving consistent engagement from both developers and dApps. With top-tier NFT platforms, liquid staking protocols, and meme tokens flourishing in its ecosystem, Solana has once again cemented its role as a high-performance alternative to Ethereum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Case for Explosive Growth MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioned as a politically themed meme token with robust tokenomics, a capped supply of 100 billion, and a presale price under $0.0. Its early-stage status, viral marketing, and rapidly expanding community (over 12,500 holders and counting) are fueling speculation that it could replicate the exponential runs seen by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in previous cycles. Key factors driving bullish sentiment include: Community and Hype : Aggressive viral campaigns and a swelling grassroots following have made MAGACOINFINANCE a trending topic across crypto forums and social media. Audited Security: The project’s smart contracts have been audited by HashEx, adding a layer of trust and transparency. Strategic Bonuses: Early investors can secure up to 100% extra tokens during the presale, maximizing their upside potential. Ethereum (ETH) Consolidates While Institutions Accumulate Ethereum is now trading in a tightly coiled range between $2,500 and $2,600. While price has paused, behind the scenes, whales and institutions are buying. Nasdaq-listed firms have added ETH to treasuries and staked reserves, and spot ETF inflows continue to rise. ETH’s future looks more like traditional finance than ever before Aptos (APT) Maintains Engagement in a Competitive Layer 1 Field Aptos continues to be among the top Layer 1 chains by active addresses, even as price action remains subdued. Developer interest remains high, and the team is investing heavily in ecosystem tools. Kaspa (KAS) Holds Its Ground with a Loyal Community Kaspa remains quiet in major headlines but continues to build within its niche. Its high-throughput blockDAG architecture remains unique in the space, but lack of new catalysts has slowed speculative volume. Why Bitcoin and Solana Bulls Are Buying In Early-Stage Momentum: MAGACOINFINANCE is still in its infancy, offering the kind of ground-floor entry that produced life-changing returns in prior cycles. Narrative and Timing: The blend of political meme energy, robust tokenomics, and a market hungry for new narratives is a potent formula for viral adoption. Conclusion Bitcoin and Solana bulls believe MAGACOINFINANCE offers a rare shot at outsized returns, with $1.3 million dreams rooted in both historical precedent and current market momentum. Whether it can deliver remains to be seen, but in a market driven by narrative, hype, and early entry, MAGACOINFINANCE has quickly become the altcoin to watch in 2025.

In a discussion shared by prominent crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) on X, Vias explained how the XRP Ledger (XRPL) was purpose-built to handle high-volume financial transactions with unmatched efficiency. Vias emphasized that the XRPL is “very much a payments-focused ledger,” specifically engineered to support the demands of global financial infrastructure. He pointed to the payment channels feature on the ledger, which can handle up to 50,000 transactions per second. He added that, unlike experimental solutions elsewhere in the crypto space, this capability is live and functional today. RIPPLE: XRP IS THE “PERFECT” DIGITAL ASSET TO REVOLUTIONIZE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS This is Miguel Vias from Ripple. Listen closely. He even states that the “The ledger can CURRENTLY scale to 50,000 TPS so it’s designed for high volume.” pic.twitter.com/3LGuXifMqp — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 25, 2025 The Technology Behind the Vision According to Vias, the technical design of XRP Ledger directly reflects Ripple’s mission to modernize and enhance cross-border payments . He explained that scalability was always a core objective. It allows the ledger to process massive transaction volumes without compromising speed or security. This network is also highly efficient, as Ripple President Monica Long recently noted that the XRPL is 120,000 times more energy efficient than Bitcoin’s network. Vias shared that this robust architecture was a key reason he decided to join Ripple. He described the combination of XRP, Interledger, and Ripple’s solutions as a marriage that made complete sense from a technological standpoint. In his view, these components together form the foundation for a modern international payment system capable of displacing outdated processes . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Proven Use Cases Remain Relevant Reflecting on Ripple’s earlier projects, Vias pointed to Ripple Trade and the Ripple Payments Platform as examples of how the digital asset’s capabilities were already being applied as far back as 2014. Ripple Trade functioned as an on-ledger exchange, while RPP facilitated fiat-to-XRP conversions for cross-border payments. While both products were eventually phased out, Vias noted that the core use cases they supported have become essential parts of today’s digital asset ecosystem. He emphasized that XRP and its ledger are still deeply integrated with Ripple’s broader strategy. “It’s clear as day how all of these worlds are merging,” Vias said, showing that XRP remains the optimal asset for facilitating seamless, high-speed global transactions. Vias also addressed a question that often arises within the XRP community regarding whether the XRPL is central to Ripple’s plans. He stated that the ledger is not only part of Ripple’s story but continues to be a vital element of the company’s strategy moving forward.

A high was formed at $2,520 and the price is now correcting some gains . There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2,114 swing low to the $2,520 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $2,500 level. The next key resistance is near the $2,520 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,550 level. A clear move above the $2,550 resistance might send the price toward the $2,600 resistance. An upside break above the $2,600 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,720 resistance zone or even $2,800 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,520 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,400 level. The first major support sits near the $2,320 zone. A clear move below the $2,320 support might push the price toward the $2,250 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,200 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,150. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

2025-06-27T03:00:43,"Genius Group’s Bold Strategy: Bitcoin Purchases & Shareholder Dividends from Legal Wins","BitcoinWorld Genius Group’s Bold Strategy: Bitcoin Purchases & Shareholder Dividends from Legal Wins In a move that has captured the attention of both the financial and cryptocurrency worlds, AI-focused education firm Genius Group has announced a truly innovative approach to managing its future legal windfalls. Imagine a company deciding to split its hard-won legal proceeds right down the middle, with half going into the volatile yet promising world of Bitcoin and the other half directly into the pockets of its shareholders. This is exactly what Genius Group is doing, setting a precedent that could reshape corporate financial strategies. Unpacking Genius Group’s Innovative Financial Strategy According to a GlobeNewswire press release, Genius Group has committed to allocating 50% of any future legal settlement proceeds to acquire Bitcoin. The remaining 50% will be distributed as special dividends to its shareholders. This dual-pronged strategy is not just about managing funds; it’s a statement about embracing new asset classes while rewarding loyal investors. The company is currently pursuing substantial damages, totaling over $1 billion, through two significant lawsuits. This includes a massive $750 million RICO case and an upcoming suit specifically targeting alleged short selling activities against the company. The potential for such a large inflow of capital makes their allocation strategy particularly impactful and intriguing. The Dual Appeal: Why Bitcoin Purchases and Shareholder Dividends? Why would a company choose such a distinctive path for its potential gains? The decision to dedicate half of its legal winnings to Bitcoin purchases and the other half to shareholder dividends reflects a strategic blend of forward-thinking investment and immediate shareholder gratification. The Allure of Bitcoin Purchases For many corporations, holding Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly attractive proposition. Here are a few reasons why Genius Group might be leaning into this: Potential for Capital Appreciation: Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has shown immense growth potential over the long term. Allocating funds to Bitcoin could allow Genius Group to benefit from future price surges, effectively growing their treasury. Diversification: Adding a digital asset like Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments, offering a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainties. Embracing Innovation: As an AI-focused education firm, embracing cutting-edge technology and digital assets aligns with Genius Group ‘s identity as an innovative entity. It signals a willingness to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. Attracting a New Investor Base: This move could appeal to a segment of investors who are enthusiastic about cryptocurrency and digital assets, potentially broadening Genius Group ‘s investor appeal. The Benefit of Shareholder Dividends On the other side of the coin, distributing shareholder dividends is a classic way to reward investors and boost confidence. Here’s why this half of the strategy is equally important: Direct Return to Investors: Special dividends provide a direct, tangible return on investment for shareholders. This can significantly increase investor satisfaction and loyalty. Signaling Financial Health: The ability to issue substantial dividends, especially from extraordinary income like legal settlements, signals strong financial health and management confidence to the market. Immediate Gratification: While Bitcoin offers long-term growth potential, dividends offer immediate cash flow to shareholders, which can be particularly attractive to income-focused investors. Market Confidence: A clear commitment to sharing profits with shareholders can enhance a company’s reputation and potentially attract more investment. Navigating the Legal Landscape: The Billion-Dollar Legal Settlement Pursuit The success of Genius Group ‘s strategy hinges entirely on the outcome of its ongoing legal battles. The company is seeking over $1 billion in damages, a significant sum that underscores the seriousness of its claims. Understanding the RICO Lawsuit One of the core components of their legal pursuit is a $750 million RICO lawsuit . RICO stands for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law in the United States designed to combat organized crime. However, it is also used in civil cases against individuals or organizations involved in patterns of racketeering activity. For Genius Group , this likely involves allegations of a pattern of illegal activities that have caused them significant financial harm. The specifics of Genius Group ‘s RICO lawsuit are not fully detailed in the initial press release, but such cases often involve complex allegations of fraud, extortion, or other illicit schemes that have impacted the company’s operations or market value. Winning a RICO case can be challenging, requiring substantial evidence to prove a pattern of criminal enterprise. The Short Selling Lawsuit In addition to the RICO case, Genius Group is preparing an upcoming lawsuit related to alleged short selling. Short selling is a trading strategy where an investor bets on a stock’s price decline. While legal, certain manipulative short selling practices, often referred to as ‘naked short selling’ or coordinated ‘short and distort’ campaigns, can be illegal and highly damaging to a company’s stock price and reputation. Genius Group ‘s pursuit of damages here suggests they believe they have been targeted by such illicit activities. The outcomes of these lawsuits are uncertain and can be lengthy processes. However, the company’s public commitment to how it will use the proceeds, should they win, adds a layer of transparency and investor confidence. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Crypto Adoption? Genius Group ‘s bold move could serve as a fascinating case study for other companies contemplating similar strategies. While some corporations like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury asset, Genius Group ‘s approach of linking it directly to legal windfalls and simultaneously rewarding shareholders is relatively unique. Implications for Corporate Treasuries: Increased Crypto Exposure: If Genius Group ‘s strategy proves successful, it could encourage other companies to consider incorporating cryptocurrency into their treasury management, even if only for specific, extraordinary revenue streams. Hybrid Models: This could pave the way for more hybrid financial models where companies balance traditional financial practices with innovative digital asset adoption. Regulatory Scrutiny: As more companies venture into crypto, regulatory bodies will likely increase their scrutiny, leading to clearer guidelines and potentially more structured corporate crypto policies. Challenges and Considerations: Despite the excitement, this strategy is not without its challenges: Bitcoin Volatility: The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly. While this offers potential for significant gains, it also carries the risk of substantial losses, which could impact the perceived value of the legal settlement. Legal Outcome Uncertainty: Winning large lawsuits, especially complex RICO cases, is never guaranteed. The entire strategy hinges on favorable legal rulings. Shareholder Expectations: Once this precedent is set, shareholders might expect similar distributions from future extraordinary gains, potentially creating pressure on the company. Tax Implications: The tax treatment of Bitcoin purchases from legal settlements and the distribution of special dividends can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Finance? Genius Group ‘s decision to split potential legal wins between Bitcoin purchases and shareholder dividends is a remarkable demonstration of innovative corporate finance. It showcases a company willing to embrace the future of finance while remaining committed to its investors. As the legal battles unfold, the world will be watching to see if this audacious strategy pays off, potentially setting a new benchmark for how companies manage extraordinary income and integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. This move by Genius Group is more than just a financial decision; it’s a statement about confidence in both their legal claims and the long-term value of Bitcoin. It’s a testament to a company looking beyond traditional boundaries to create value for its stakeholders in an ever-evolving economic landscape.

2025-06-27T03:00:24,"Solana and Bitcoin Traders Say MAGACOINFINANCE Is Headed for a 1.1M Milestone","With high-cap assets like Bitcoin and Solana showing strength in the mid-2025 cycle, traders are now scanning the altcoin landscape for early entries with breakout potential. One project has quickly become the talk of those rotating capital: MAGACOINFINANCE. Analysts’ attention is shifting toward this new altcoin as it nears a highly anticipated listing price of $0.007 — a metric signaling deepening interest and layered buying behavior. Why MAGACOINFINANCE Is Attracting Big Players In a market full of recycled narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is offering something different — a fully capped 170 billion token supply, community-controlled governance, and verified smart contract infrastructure. But the real draw isn’t just tokenomics — it’s behavior. Long-term staking participation, wallet consolidation, and absence of dump cycles are the signals whales watch. And those signals are loud right now. Institutional whispers and early whale wallets suggest that many view MAGACOINFINANCE as more than just a meme contender — they see it as a positioning asset ahead of major price discovery. Solana (SOL) Maintains Ecosystem Momentum Solana continues to outperform expectations, both in user activity and network stability. With fast finality, low fees, and rising developer adoption, the Solana ecosystem has become a magnet for decentralized apps and retail traders alike. Its consistent infrastructure updates and growing TVL show long-term durability, reinforcing its role as a cornerstone in any serious crypto portfolio. As new capital flows into Solana, some of it is now being diverted into earlier-phase plays like MAGACOINFINANCE. Injective (INJ) Eyes a Breakout Range Injective is another altcoin drawing analyst attention, especially after new ETF-related developments and strong technical setups. Its current price action is consolidating above key support levels, and forecasts point to possible movement toward the $15–$16 range if bullish patterns hold. INJ’s growing on-chain value and increasing TVL are boosting investor sentiment — and yet, some capital is flowing into MAGACOINFINANCE as traders seek diversification ahead of major listing events. Kaspa (KAS) Signals Support Amid Volatility Kaspa is trading in a relatively tight range after facing volatility in early June. Although not yet signaling a definitive breakout, it remains on watch due to its strong community presence and fast block confirmation model. Momentum has slowed temporarily, but high engagement rates suggest that once the market pivots, KAS could regain traction — just as early holders of MAGACOINFINANCE expect similar timing for their project’s next wave. Uniswap (UNI) Tries to Reclaim Investor Confidence Uniswap is aiming to reclaim its status as a key DEX platform, especially as Layer 2 usage increases. However, competition has cut into its dominance, and UNI’s price action remains choppy. New upgrades and governance changes are being discussed, but capital rotation patterns suggest some traders are looking beyond established DEX names toward projects with cleaner entry profiles — a shift favoring altcoins like MAGACOINFINANCE. Final Thoughts With Solana delivering strong ecosystem growth, Injective testing bullish structures, Kaspa holding support, and Uniswap searching for momentum, traders are diversifying. And MAGACOINFINANCE — with its early performance and disciplined investor base — is quickly rising as the stealth contender ready to join 2025’s elite assets.

2025-06-27T03:00:09,"Bitcoin Retests $108,000, But Holders Disagree On Direction","As Bitcoin pushes back toward the $108,000 level, on-chain data reveals the investor cohorts are still divided in their accumulation behavior. Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Shows Mixed Behavior From Holders In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the BTC investor cohorts aren’t showing a unified behavior on the Accumulation Trend Score. The Accumulation Trend Score refers to an indicator that basically tells us whether Bitcoin holders are accumulating or not. The metric bases its value on two factors: the balance changes happening in the wallets of the investors and the size of those wallets. Related Reading: Tron’s 374% Profit-Taking Spree Uncovered—Here’s Who Was Behind It When the value of the indicator is greater than 0.5, it means the large holders (or a large number of small hands) are leaning toward net accumulation. The closer the score is to 1.0, the stronger the buying. On the other hand, the metric being under the threshold suggests the investors are in a phase of distribution (or simply, that they aren’t accumulating). This behavior is the strongest at the zero mark. Now, here is the chart for the Accumulation Trend Score shared by Glassnode, showing the trend in the metric separately for the various holder groups: As displayed in the above graph, the Accumulation Trend Score has recently varied in value across these cohorts. Investors who hold between 1 to 10 BTC appear to be distributing, while those with 10 to 100 BTC are accumulating. Among the large holders, the trend leans more neutral, but the indicator still doesn’t show any clear uniformity. Members of the 1,000 to 10,000 coins group, popularly referred to as the whales, are currently tending toward accumulation, but those part of the 10,000+ cohort, the ‘mega whales,’ are showing slight distribution. According to the analytics firm, the Accumulation Trend Score of the network as a whole stands at 0.57. As such, it seems there is no majority behavior being followed by the traders at the moment. Related Reading: Chainlink Holders Set Record As 1-Yr MVRV Signals ‘Opportunity’ That said, while a unifying buying push hasn’t appeared alongside the latest price rally toward $108,000, there has still been an improvement that has occurred in the score. According to the analytics firm, the indicator dropped to a low of 0.25 earlier. It only remains to be seen, however, whether the Bitcoin investors would continue to move in this direction, or if indecision is here to stay for a while. BTC Price Bitcoin attempted to find a break above the $108,000 level earlier, but the asset has so far not been able to maintain a sustainable move, and its price has even seen rejection toward $107,100.

This legal update immediately impacted the market, causing the price of XRP to drop to $2.09 before recovering slightly to around $2.10. The token saw a 5% dip following the news. XRP Price Prediction XRP’s overall price trend still leans bearish. The coin continues to make lower highs and lower lows, a pattern that signals weakness in the market. While small price jumps can happen even in a downtrend, a proper trend reversal would require XRP to start forming higher lows and eventually break past previous highs. JUST IN: Judge Torres has denied @Ripple and the @SECGov joint motion for an indicative ruling. pic.twitter.com/iPzD4aMG1H — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 26, 2025 At the moment, XRP is struggling to break through an important resistance zone between $2.19 and $2.20. If the price does manage to move above $2.20 with a strong daily close, the next target area would be around $2.30 to $2.35. A breakout past this point would signal a much stronger bullish trend and could open doors for a rally towards $2.60 . Can XRP Price Dip Below $2? On the downside, the key support zone to watch is between $2.05 and $2.10. If XRP falls below this, the next support would be around $1.92 to $1.95. Right now, momentum remains weak, with short-term gains appearing within a generally bearish market structure. [post_titles_links postid=”475448″] For this bullish scenario to stay intact, XRP needs to hold above the $2.08 support area. If the price drops below this, it increases the risk of the market making a fresh low. If that happens, the focus would shift to the bigger support level around $1.79. At the moment, while Bitcoin has already shown signs of forming five waves up, XRP has yet to do the same. Until clearer signs of strength appear, experts are watching for signs of support holding and any move that could lead to a fifth wave upward.
