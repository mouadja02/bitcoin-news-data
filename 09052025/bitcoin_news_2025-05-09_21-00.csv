Cost of revenue rose sharply to $24.5 million, up from $14.4 million a year earlier.As a result, TeraWulf's cost of revenue accounted for 71.4% of total income from operations in Q1 2025, more than double the 34% recorded in the prior-year quarter. In Q1 2024, the company posted a net loss of $9.6 million.TeraWulf’s profit and loss statement for Q1 2025. Source: TeraWulfTeraWulf attributed the decreased revenue to Bitcoin's (BTC) post-halving economics that reduced the block subsidy from 6.25 BTC per block mined to 3.125 BTC per block mined, rising network difficulty, and severe weather in the upstate New York area that is home to a TeraWulf mining facility.The company is not alone in posting losses for the quarter, as the already competitive mining industry faces reduced block rewards and the macroeconomic uncertainty of geopolitical trade tensions that have created turmoil for financial markets and businesses alike.Related: Riot Platforms posts Q1 loss, beats revenue estimatesMiners hit by trade tariffs, high uncertaintyThe trade tariffs introduced by US President Donald Trump have raised concern among mining companies and analysts that the import duties will drive up the costs of hardware and other physical infrastructure necessary to run crypto nodes.Rising Bitcoin network difficulty means miners must expend computing resources to mine blocks. Source: CryptoQuantImposing tariffs on mining hardware like application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) will also give miners outside the United States a price advantage over US-based competitors in obtaining the critical equipment needed.As a result of the ongoing tariff negotiations, miners sold 40% of their mined BTC in March 2025, reversing the post-halving trend of miners accumulating BTC for corporate treasuries or reserves.March's sell-off was the highest month for miner BTC liquidations since October 2024 — the month ahead of the 2024 US presidential election, which was pivotal for the crypto industry and represented high uncertainty for businesses and investors.Related: Illegal arcade disguised as … a fake Bitcoin mine?

2025-05-09T20:17:15.000Z,"Ethereum&#039;s new staking limit is not a risk to decentralization, says Consensys researcher","Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade doesn’t pose a threat to decentralization, according to Mallesh Pai, senior research director at blockchain software firm Consensys, describing the update as a cleanup of the behind-the-scenes “busy work” currently handled by validators. During a May 9 Cointelegraph X Space, Pai said a validator’s chances of proposing a block or earning rewards remain tied to how much ETH they hold, adding that larger validators don’t gain any new advantages under the upgrade: “Rewards continue to be proportional to the amount of ETH you have. […] it's not the case that if you're a big validator, you somehow have any more advantages than you did before.”Pectra is Ethereum’s most extensive network upgrade since the Merge took place in September 2022. Pectra allows validators to stake as much as 2,048 ETH, up from the previous limit of 32 ETH. The new standard has raised community concerns about the risks of centralization on the network.According to Pai, the Pectra upgrade has taken “a bunch of busy work that the network was doing behind the scenes and removed it.”Pai noted that while there are about a million technical validators on Ethereum, many aren’t truly distinct — large validators often operate numerous virtual keys from a single physical machine. With the Pectra upgrade, those keys can now be consolidated — something he says they are already seeing.“In the best case, we’ll get to about 30,000 validators,” he said, adding that this consolidation reduces auxiliary work and enables network stakeholders to focus on what matters, such as lowering gas limits.Related: Ethereum Pectra upgrade adds new features — How long before ETH price reacts?New Pectra staking limit paves the way for institutionsThe new limit could pave the way for institutions to stake ETH, according to Artemiy Parshakov, vice president of institutions at Ethereum staking service P2P.org. “EIP-7002 makes institutional staking much easier to integrate without taking too much risk.”Ether staking within exchange-traded funds has been a hot topic in 2025. BlackRock has said that the successful Ether ETFs are less perfect without staking, and multiple financial institutions have filed for amendments to their Ether ETFs to allow for staking.If approved, investors might be more inclined to buy into the ETFs, as they could receive yield. The SEC has yet to rule on staking amendments. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently forecast in a podcast interview that if staking were to be approved for Ether ETFs, it would have “a little impact” on inflows. “The bigger problem with Ethereum is performance; it just doesn’t ever go on a nice long rally.”Magazine: Pectra hard fork explained — Will it get Ethereum back on track?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-new-staking-limit-not-risk-decentralization-consensys?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-09T19:35:00.000Z,"US senators ask DOJ, Treasury to consider Binance-Trump ties — Report","A group of Democratic senators has reportedly sent a letter to leadership at the US Department of Justice and the Treasury Department expressing concerns about US President Donald Trump’s ties to cryptocurrency exchange Binance and potential conflicts of interest in regulating the industry. According to a May 9 Bloomberg report, Democratic senators asked Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to report on the steps Binance had taken as part of its November 2023 plea agreement with US authorities, amid reports that Trump and his family had deepened connections with the exchange. That settlement saw Binance pay more than $4 billion as part of a deal with the Justice Department, Treasury, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and had then-CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao step down.However, since Trump won the presidency in 2024, many lawmakers have accused the president of corruption from profiting off crypto while being in a position to influence laws and regulations over the industry. Trump has launched his own memecoin — which earns the project millions of dollars in transaction fees — and offered the top tokenholders the opportunity to attend an exclusive dinner in Washington, DC. His family-backed crypto venture World Liberty Financial also recently announced that an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm, MGX, would settle a $2 billion investment in Binance using the platform’s USD1 stablecoin.“Our concerns about Binance’s compliance obligations are even more pressing given recent reports that the company is using the Trump family’s stablecoin to partner with foreign investment companies,” the senators said in the letter, according to Bloomberg.Related: Trump tricked into pushing XRP for crypto reserve: ReportStablecoin bill fails to pass the US SenateThe letter came less than 24 hours after some of the same senators blocked a crucial vote on a bill to regulate stablecoins, named the GENIUS Act. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who reportedly signed the letter and opposed moving forward on the stablecoin bill, suggested the Senate should not be aligned with “facilitat[ing] this kind of corruption” from Trump.Bessent said the Senate “missed an opportunity” by not passing the stablecoin bill, but did not directly address any of the concerns over Trump’s crypto interests. It’s unclear if or when the chamber could consider another vote on the bill.In an April 23 report, the nonpartisan organization State Democracy Defenders Action said roughly 40% of Trump’s net worth was tied to crypto. The group noted that the GENIUS Act, in its current version, “would not prevent President Trump from using his executive powers to establish a regulatory environment and enforcement agenda that prioritizes his personal enrichment over the broader interests of US stakeholders.”Amid the concerns with the stablecoin and proposed market structure bills, Zhao reportedly applied for a federal pardon from Trump. Though the former CEO already served four months in prison, a pardon for his felony charge could allow him to get more involved with the crypto industry through a management position.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senators-investigation-binance-donald-trump?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-09T19:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price rallies as global liquidity growth accelerates — Analysts","Key takeaways:Bitcoin’s price closely tracks global liquidity growth, with liquidity explaining up to 90% of its price movements, according to Raoul Pal.In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?Liquidity is Bitcoin's silent price driverRaoul Pal, the founder of Global Macro Investor, recently gave a speech on the strong correlation between Bitcoin and global M2 liquidity. In a recap posted by Paul Guerra, Pal’s message refers to: despite looming concerns—recession risks, geopolitical tensions, and other global stressors—rising liquidity as the dominant force behind asset price action. According to Pal, expanding liquidity backs up to 90% of Bitcoin’s price action and as much as 97% of the Nasdaq’s performance. Indeed, a chart comparing global M2 (with a 12-week lead) and Bitcoin’s price shows an almost uncanny alignment.Global M2 and BTC/USD. Source: Real VisionPal also frames the issue in personal finance terms. He says there's an 11% \""hidden tax\"" on all of us, composed of 8% currency debasement and 3% global inflation. He notes,“If you’re not earning more than 11%/yr, you’re getting poorer by definition.”Bitcoin has returned an average of 130% annually since 2012, despite dramatic drawdowns. That makes it one of the most asymmetric bets of the past decade—and it’s outperformed the Nasdaq by over 99%.What drives global liquidity?At its core, global liquidity is fueled by expanding the money supply. As independent investor Lyn Alden puts it,“Fiat currency systems are primarily based on ever-growing debt levels. The money supply continuously grows in every country for this reason.”This offers a high-level view of global liquidity and suggests its long-term expansion is structural. However, this growth isn't linear. Over shorter time frames, it fluctuates based on specific drivers. Michael Howell, author of “Capital Wars,” identifies three main drivers currently impacting global liquidity: the US Federal Reserve, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), and banks lending through collateral markets.Global liquidity drivers. Source: Michael HowellHowell also points to indirect influences that act with a lag of 6 to 15 months. These include the world business cycle, oil prices, dollar strength, and bond market volatility. A weak global economy and a softening dollar typically boost liquidity. But rising bond volatility tightens collateral supply and chokes lending, undermining liquidity.Related: New bull cycle? Bitcoin's return to $100K hints at ‘significant price move’How long will global liquidity rise?Michael Howell believes that global liquidity moves in roughly five-year cycles, and is now on the way to its local peak. He projects the current cycle to mature by mid-2026, reaching an index level of around 70 (below the post-COVID index of 90). That would mark a turning point, with a subsequent downturn being a likely outcome.Global liquidity cycle. Source: Michael HowellThe recent growth in global liquidity stems from the rapidly weakening world economy, which is likely to prompt further easing by central banks. The People’s Bank of China has already begun injecting liquidity into the system. The Fed now faces a tough choice: continue fighting inflation or pivot to support an increasingly fragile financial system. At its May 7 meeting, rates were held steady, but the pressure on Chair Jerome Powell is mounting, especially from US President Donald Trump.At the same time, economic uncertainty is driving up US Treasury yields and fueling bond market volatility, both indicators of collateral scarcity and tightening credit conditions. Over time, these pressures are likely to become headwinds for liquidity expansion. Meanwhile, a looming recession is expected to weaken investor risk appetite, further draining liquidity from the system.Even if a downturn lies ahead in 2026, global liquidity still has room to run, at least through 2025. And that matters for Bitcoin.Howell notes,“The likely inevitable policy response of ‘more liquidity’ is a great future omen. It establishes the upward path of persistent monetary inflation that ultimately underpins hedges such as gold, quality equities, prime residential real estate, and Bitcoin.”Interestingly, Howell’s liquidity cycle roughly aligns with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle. The former points to a potential peak in late 2025, and the latter in early 2026. If history rhymes again, that convergence could set the stage for a major price move.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential elections. Data from its “Industry Rollup” report highlights Bitcoin’s high Sharpe ratio of 1.72, a key financial metric that measures risk-adjusted returns by dividing an asset’s average return (minus the risk-free rate). A higher Sharpe ratio reflects superior risk-adjusted returns, and in 2025, Bitcoin’s robust score, surpassed only by gold, highlights its growing maturity as an asset.Bitcoin price performance in different environments.

Hidden Road will also migrate its post-trade operations to the XRP Ledger, the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) and several of Ripple’s institutional services.Omni Network founder and CEO Austin King knows Ripple’s strategy firsthand. He sold his startup, Strata Labs, to Ripple in 2019 and describes the approach as a “SoftBank-type” acquisition strategy.Instead of in-house development like Google or Meta (formerly Facebook), SoftBank built its empire through aggressive investments, joint ventures and acquisitions. Ripple seems to be following a similar playbook, but not everyone’s convinced the comparison holds.XRP reaches over 300 institutional clients through Ripple’s Hidden Road acquisition. Source: Brad GarlinghouseThe SoftBank model in RippleTwo deals put SoftBank on the global map: an early investor in Yahoo and the legendary $20-million bet on Alibaba, which exploded to $60 billion when Alibaba went public in 2014. SoftBank recycled its returns into fresh capital, exits and a sprawling ecosystem. That included the $20-billion move into US telecom via Sprint and semiconductors through its $31-billion acquisition of UK-based ARM.“This wide breadth of coverage allowed SoftBank to create synergies across their entire portfolio of companies,” King told Cointelegraph. “Ripple is performing a similar strategy focused on financial services, but instead of venture bets on Yahoo and Alibaba enabling this, it is XRP.”Related: Does XRP, SOL or ADA belong in a US crypto reserve?Considering Ripple’s recent acquisitions, both firms buy infrastructure instead of building it from scratch and treat their portfolios as ecosystems rather than one-off investments.Both companies rely on capital as leverage. SoftBank used its $100-billion Vision Fund to outbid competitors. Ripple also has a war chest of XRP and cash. As of March 31, Ripple had 4.56 billion XRP (around $11 billion at current prices) and another 37.13 billion XRP ($89.8 billion) in escrow.Acquisitions expand the footprint for XRP and RLUSD in traditional finance, turning them into embedded components of custody, brokerage and payment flows. This creates what King describes as a token-fueled flywheel. Ripple uses its assets to acquire infrastructure, which in turn drives usage back into those assets.XRP ranks third among non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Meanwhile, RLUSD can provide a regulated, USD-pegged unit of account that institutions want,” said Sid Powell, co-founder and CEO of institutional blockchain lender Maple.King’s analogy has its skeptics.“SoftBank operates more as a conglomerate or holding company, taking broader investment positions across industries. On the other hand, Ripple is taking a more focused and product-related approach with its recent acquisitions tied to payment missions and core blockchain,” Powell said.Casper Johansen, co-founder of Spartan Group, told Cointelegraph the comparison seems “a bit stretched,” noting that SoftBank’s success came from acquiring and turning around operating businesses, joint ventures, minority stakes and eventually exiting some for large gains.Ripple joins the crypto M&A arms raceInstead of spanning telecom, media and chips, Ripple is assembling a financial infrastructure stack. It acquired custody firms Metaco in 2023 and Standard Custody in 2024. The latest addition, prime broker Hidden Road, brings 300 institutional clients clearing $3 trillion annually.“Where Metaco lays the foundation — the vault for storing assets — Hidden Road allows Ripple to leverage its massive balance sheet to turbocharge Hidden Road’s business, in which access to capital — a lot of capital — is critical in order to keep growing and competing,” Johansen said.The move echoes a broader M&A wave among US crypto firms. Kraken recently acquired NinjaTrader for $1.5 billion, while Coinbase has acquired Deribit for $2.9 billion.These acquisitions follow a shift in the US regulatory climate that’s clearing the runway for crypto firms to scale. For years, companies like Ripple were stuck in limbo, facing lawsuits, enforcement actions and denied access to basic banking services under Gary Gensler’s Securities and Exchange Commission. Related: Ripple celebrates SEC’s dropped appeal, but crypto rules still not setWhile “debanking” remains a concern, industry leaders say momentum is changing. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a recent media interview that the SEC is expected to take a “very constructive and positive” stance toward the industry.Ripple itself spent years in a legal battle with the SEC, which sued the company in December 2020. On May 8, Ripple and the SEC reached a settlement to formally end the case, pending court approval.Ripple’s next moves include stablecoinsGarlinghouse said Ripple intends to continue exploring acquisitions.“I wouldn’t be surprised if in the next year or two we saw the acquisition of a large-scale point-of-sale company to expand their territory from backend financial services to more direct consumer payments,” King said.On April 30, Bloomberg reported that Ripple made a $4 billion-to-$5 billion bid to acquire Circle, which was rejected for being too low.Ripple’s recent moves show it’s willing to pursue high-stakes acquisitions, including plays to absorb stablecoin rivals.All banks will jump on stablecoins soon, and that will reshape US finance, according to King.

2025-05-09T15:00:00.000Z,"AI&#039;s GPU obsession blinds us to a cheaper, smarter solution","Opinion by: Naman Kabra, co-founder and CEO of NodeOps NetworkGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.CPUs aren't outdated. More people need to realize they can be used for AI tasks. They're sitting idle in millions of machines worldwide, capable of running a wide range of AI tasks efficiently and affordably, if only we'd give them a chance.Where CPUs shine in AIIt's easy to see how we got here. GPUs are built for parallelism. They can handle massive amounts of data simultaneously, which is excellent for tasks like image recognition or training a chatbot with billions of parameters. CPUs can't compete in those jobs.AI isn't just model training. It's not just high-speed matrix math. Today, AI includes tasks like running smaller models, interpreting data, managing logic chains, making decisions, fetching documents, and responding to questions. These aren't just \""dumb math\"" problems. They require flexible thinking. They require logic. They require CPUs.While GPUs get all the headlines, CPUs are quietly handling the backbone of many AI workflows, especially when you zoom in on how AI systems actually run in the real world.Recent: ‘Our GPUs are melting’ — OpenAI puts limiter in after Ghibli-tsunamiCPUs are impressive at what they were designed for: flexible, logic-based operations. They're built to handle one or a few tasks at a time, really well. That might not sound impressive next to the massive parallelism of GPUs, but many AI tasks don't need that kind of firepower.Consider autonomous agents, those fancy tools that can use AI to complete tasks like searching the web, writing code, or planning a project. Sure, the agent might call a large language model that runs on a GPU, but everything around that, the logic, the planning, the decision-making, runs just fine on a CPU.Even inference (AI-speak for actually using the model after its training) can be done on CPUs, especially if the models are smaller, optimized, or running in situations where ultra-low latency isn't necessary.CPUs can handle a huge range of AI tasks just fine. We're so focused on GPU performance, however, that we're not using what we already have right in front of us.We don't need to keep building expensive new data centers packed with GPUs to meet the growing demand for AI. We just need to use what's already out there efficiently.That's where things get interesting. Because now we have a way to actually do that.How decentralized compute networks change the gameDePINs, or decentralized physical infrastructure networks, are a viable solution. It's a mouthful, but the idea is simple: People contribute their unused computing power (like idle CPUs), which gets pooled into a global network that others can tap into.Instead of renting time on some centralized cloud provider's GPU cluster, you could run AI workloads across a decentralized network of CPUs anywhere in the world. These platforms create a type of peer-to-peer computing layer where jobs can be distributed, executed, and verified securely.This model has a few clear benefits. First, it's much cheaper. You don't need to pay premium prices to rent out a scarce GPU when a CPU will do the job just fine. Second, it scales naturally.The available compute grows as more people plug their machines into the network. Third, it brings computing closer to the edge. Tasks can be run on machines near where the data lives, reducing latency and increasing privacy.Think of it like Airbnb for compute. Instead of building more hotels (data centers), we're making better use of all the empty rooms (idle CPUs) people already have.Through shifting our thinking and using decentralized networks to route AI workloads to the correct processor type, GPU when needed and CPU when possible, we unlock scale, efficiency, and resilience.The bottom lineIt's time to stop treating CPUs like second-class citizens in the AI world. Yes, GPUs are critical. No one's denying that. CPUs are everywhere. They're underused but still perfectly capable of powering many of the AI tasks we care about.Instead of throwing more money at the GPU shortage, let's ask a more intelligent question: Are we even using the computing we already have?With decentralized compute platforms stepping up to connect idle CPUs to the AI economy, we have a massive opportunity to rethink how we scale AI infrastructure. The real constraint isn't just GPU availability. It's a mindset shift. We're so conditioned to chase high-end hardware that we overlook the untapped potential sitting idle across the network.Opinion by: Naman Kabra, co-founder and CEO of NodeOps Network.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Siu believes this type of infrastructure investment goes further than symbolic funding.“What our industry needs a lot more is these kinds of positive-sum use cases that everyone else understands,” Siu said in the interview. “If students can receive better, cheaper and more effective opportunities and interest rates through crypto student loans, what happens? They’re going to be more pro-crypto.”Related: The Giving Block starts disaster fund for California wildfire victimsUnlike a one-time donation, the Pencil Finance model integrates crypto directly into the financing mechanism—leveraging blockchain rails to make lending more transparent, efficient, and accessible.“While money has influence, it doesn’t necessarily change the system for the better per se. The technology… actually provides a way we can onboard people into that.”Crypto in the classroomSiu said the crypto industry still suffers from a perception problem, especially among those unfamiliar with financial tools or blockchain-native culture. That’s why educational use cases need to move beyond highbrow NFT art or meme coins and offer something universally relatable.“When you’re sitting at the table and someone’s saying, ‘What is crypto really good for?’—what do we say?” he asked. “Memecoins? Or do we say student loans? That’s something everyone understands.”Siu also emphasized the long-term impact of onboarding students early—both for growing crypto literacy and building a foundation for adoption. “You want to onboard them at the earliest levels and let them understand what’s going on,” he said. “That’s what Apple did with education discounts. It wasn’t about profit at first—it was about future influence.”Ripple’s donation may be a step forward for awareness and much-needed funding support in the education sector, but Animoca’s approach aims to make crypto indispensable, not just visible, in education systems around the world.“We have to show what [crypto] is good for.

2025-05-09T12:45:00.000Z,"TapSwap on Telegram: Is it legit or a scam?","What is TapSwap on Telegram?              TapSwap is a tap-to-earn Web3 application that lives inside Telegram — no separate download required.Are your crypto friends obsessed with tapping their phones all the time? Welcome to the world of TapSwap. TapSwap is a tap-to-earn game released in mid-2024 in the Telegram Mini Apps ecosystem. The game quickly catches your attention: one minute you’re just curious… the next, you’re tapping away at 2 am trying to squeeze out one more energy boost. At its core, TapSwap is simple:You tap your screen.You earn TAPS tokens.Repeat.It’s built as a Mini App inside Telegram, which means no downloading or setting up complicated wallets just to play. Just hit “Start” and you’re in. Launched in early 2024, it quickly amassed over 72 million users, with 3 million daily active participants as of February 2025, as per the official website. As of late April 2025, the platform has a strong presence on social media, with 6 million followers on X and 5 million on Telegram. Built on The Open Network (TON), TapSwap rose to popularity due to its simple tapping mechanics, which, combined with word-of-mouth and social media sharing, allowed it to grow fast among Telegram’s massive user base.While TapSwap currently operates primarily through its tap-to-earn mechanics on Telegram, the platform has ambitious plans to expand into a full-fledged gaming ecosystem. Per TapSwap, new games like Treasure Hunt and Warrior’s Legacy are expected to launch soon.In addition to expanding its gaming catalog, TapSwap is also focusing on attracting third-party developers. It has introduced an SDK and various tools to help game creators easily integrate their games into TapSwap’s ecosystem. This will allow developers to reach TapSwap’s massive Telegram user base and unlock new monetization opportunities.TapSwap’s shift toward becoming a developer-friendly, multi-game platform hints at a larger ambition: transforming from a simple tap-to-earn project into a Web3 gaming hub.In this article, you’ll find out exactly how TapSwap works, how to play smarter and tap faster, whether it’s legit, and what’s next for this viral sensation.Did you know? By June 2024, TapSwap had surpassed 59.7 million users, establishing itself as the second-largest player in the tap-to-earn industry, just behind Hamster Kombat.                  How to play TapSwap on Telegram              Playing TapSwap is simple, and it’s designed for mass adoption, especially among users new to crypto.Here’s how it works:Open Telegram: You must have a Telegram account. TapSwap operates as a Mini App within Telegram.Find the TapSwap bot: Search for “TapSwap bot” in Telegram or access it through an invite link from another user.Start the game: Tap “Start” to launch the TapSwap Mini App. Grant basic permissions to connect.Tap to earn energy: The core gameplay involves tapping your screen repeatedly to generate “Energy” or points. The more you tap, the more points you accumulate.Upgrade and boost: Use earned Energy to upgrade your in-game equipment (like tap strength or auto-tapper speed). Upgrades allow you to generate Energy faster without manual tapping.Complete tasks: Daily missions, social media tasks and inviting friends can earn additional bonuses and multipliers.Climb the leaderboard: Players can compete for higher rankings, which could influence future token rewards and airdrop eligibility. Did you know? By mid-2024, TapSwap players had collectively executed over 2.7 trillion taps within the game, showcasing the platform’s immense engagement.                  How to maximize your TapSwap rewards              If you want to make the most out of your TapSwap journey, here are some key strategies to boost your Energy production, leaderboard ranking and eventual TAPS token rewards. Daily codes: TapSwap releases daily codes that give free Energy or multipliers. Find them in the TapSwap app and redeem daily to stay ahead.Watch videos: Take advantage of the “Watch Video” feature to earn bonus Energy. Most of the videos are educational or promotional in nature. Upgrades: Use your earned Energy wisely to upgrade key attributes like Tap Strength and Auto-Tapper speed. Higher upgrades mean you earn more Energy even while idle, making your gameplay more efficient.Complete daily tasks and missions: Daily missions offer bonus rewards, XP boosts and sometimes even special upgrade opportunities.Invite friends: TapSwap has a referral system where you can earn extra bonuses.Participate in events: TapSwap occasionally hosts time-limited events, challenges or contests with exclusive prizes. Keep an eye on announcements to join early and maximize benefits.                  Common mistakes new TapSwap players make              While TapSwap is easy to start, many new users make avoidable mistakes that could cost them.Using fake bots: TapSwap’s popularity has led to the rise of fake Telegram bots pretending to be official. Always double-check the bot’s username and verify through TapSwap’s official channels.Expecting immediate payouts: Energy points earned in-game are not instantly withdrawable. These are convertible to tokens, and TAPS can be staked to earn in the ecosystem. Falling for withdrawal scams on Telegram: If a bot or user asks for upfront payment or private keys for “faster withdrawal,” it’s a scam. TapSwap has stated that no fees are required to claim tokens.Ignoring game updates: TapSwap frequently announces changes (such as tokenomics or blockchain updates). Players who ignore updates may miss important steps like Know Your Customer (KYC) verification or instructions for claiming their airdrop or rewards.                  Is TapSwap legit or just a hype train?              When evaluating whether TapSwap is legit or not, it’s important to weigh the positives and the concerns carefully. Let’s get to the big question: Is TapSwap legit?Favorable factors include:Massive user base: TapSwap has attracted over 72 million users worldwide, including 3 million daily active players, a sign of strong organic growth.Official token audit: TapSwap partnered with security firm Hashlock to conduct an audit of its smart contract in 2024. Minor issues (low-severity issues, minor inconsistencies in event parameter ordering, the use of default return values, etc.) were identified. Importantly, no critical vulnerabilities were found, and the minor concerns were corrected following the audit.KYC compliance: TapSwap requires users to complete Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for airdrop claims and larger transactions, aligning with global regulatory practices.Active communication: TapSwap maintains verified channels on Telegram and X, regularly posting updates, fixes and clarifications to user concerns.Roadmap and white paper: TapSwap has published a detailed roadmap and white paper outlining the project’s goals, tokenomics and future plans, indicating a serious long-term vision.Some reasons for concern:Anonymous founding team: TapSwap’s core team remains undisclosed to the public, which raises questions about accountability and transparency.Telegram bot issues: Users have frequently reported bugs, downtime and access issues with the TapSwap bot, especially during high-traffic periods.Scam impersonators: The popularity of TapSwap has led to a surge of fake Telegram bots and phishing scams pretending to be official TapSwap channels.Withdrawal delays: Token withdrawals and airdrop claims have faced multiple delays, with users sometimes waiting months for updates and timelines to be clarified.                  What’s next for TapSwap?              As the platform matures and cements its place, the team behind it has hinted at a much bigger vision. Here’s what’s reportedly on the roadmap:Transition to skill-based gaming: TapSwap is evolving into a skill-based gaming platform, moving beyond simple tapping mechanics. This shift aims to introduce competitive gameplay where players can participate in tournaments and earn rewards based on their performance, fostering a more engaging and merit-based environment. TON, the official blockchain of TapSwap, has hinted at fight-to-earn models in upcoming skills. TAPS token listing and trading: The TAPS token was officially launched on Feb. 14, 2025, with trading commencing on exchanges like Bitget under the trading pair TAPS/USDT. There is a growing push for more listings across social media, and these will enhance liquidity, enabling users to trade their earned tokens. Introduction of staking mechanisms: TapSwap plans to implement staking features, allowing users to lock their TAPS tokens in exchange for rewards. This initiative aims to incentivize long-term holding and contribute to the platform’s stability, while users earn passive income. Enhanced user interface and features: To improve the user experience, TapSwap is working on integrating new features such as comprehensive leaderboards, integrated wallets for seamless transactions and social features that allow players to showcase their achievements and progress.Community engagement and governance: TapSwap is focusing on strengthening its community by encouraging user feedback and participation in decision-making processes. Holders of TAPS tokens may gain governance rights, allowing them to vote on future developments and upgrades within the platform. ​Developer engagement: For developers who want to build their games inside TapSwap, there will be a full developer kit to create games that plug directly into TapSwap’s Mini App structure. Builders may benefit from the instant access to TapSwap’s massive Telegram audience, solving for adoption hurdles that Web3 game developers often face. Guides, documentation and API references, integrated options for revenue sharing and microtransactions will further enable developers to make onboarding seamless. TapSwap may have started as a simple tap-to-earn game, but recent updates suggest it’s evolving beyond just casual tapping. Whether you’re playing for casual fun, the upcoming skill-based tournaments or potential token rewards, there’s plenty of action (and taps) ahead.Of course, like anything in Web3, it’s smart to stay cautious.

Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  “Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation,“ Scott said.The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.Related: Trump tricked into pushing XRP for crypto reserve: ReportScott criticizes last-minute oppositionScott, a South Carolina Republican, said that “the GENIUS Act was a bipartisan achievement at the Banking Committee.” By working on it, he claimed those involved “made the decision to make America's economy safer and cheaper for the American people.” Still, in his view, Democrats changed their minds when the “light and cameras were watching.”Scott alleged that the shift was driven not by changes in the bill, but by efforts to deny President Donald Trump a legislative win:“It was a vote against President Trump and President Trump’s legislative agenda. It was a vote to stop President Trump from having a victory in the digital asset space.“Related: Democrat lawmakers object to hearing, citing ‘Trump’s crypto corruption’Democrats cite corruption concernsMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading voice on crypto regulation, raised concerns that the Trump family-linked stablecoin, USD1, surged in market value due to a “shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates.”“The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption,“ she said.On May 1, Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX used the Trump-linked stablecoin USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance.

Four of the five pro-crypto Democrats who passed the GENIUS Act in the Senate Banking Committee signed their names to a statement on May 3, saying that they do not feel comfortable with the direction stablecoin legislation is taking. While the letter did not mention Trump directly, Representative Maxine Waters was more explicit in her opposition.“If there is no effort to block the President of the United States of America from owning his stablecoin business [...] I will never be able to agree on supporting this bill, and I would ask other members not to be enablers,” Waters said.Democrats propose stricter crypto lawsDemocrats also recently sponsored the Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, to prevent federal officials from profiting from memecoins. US Senator Jeff Merkley and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also introduced the End Crypto Corruption Act earlier this week.The End Crypto Corruption Act would ban the president, vice president, senior executive branch officials, members of Congress, and their immediate families from financially benefiting from issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets, such as memecoins and stablecoins.In a statement published on Merkley’s website, he said that “people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls.”“This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let’s end this corruption immediately,” Merkley added.In a statement to CBS News, Warren echoed that sentiment, saying that both Democrats in favor and opposed to the GENIUS Act “agree that green-lighting Donald Trump’s corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong.”“The GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump’s crypto corruption,” Warren claimed.Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/senator-tim-scott-blames-politics-for-failed-stablecoin-bill?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Ko Ju-Chun, a legislator at-large in Taiwan’s legislative body, the Legislative Yuan, took to X on Friday to report that he advocated for Bitcoin (BTC) investment by the Taiwanese government at the National Conference on May 9.In his remarks, Ko cited Bitcoin’s potential to become a hedge amid global economic risks, urging Taiwan to recognize the cryptocurrency alongside gold and foreign exchange reserves to boost financial resilience.Source: Ko Ju-ChunKo’s announcement came shortly after the legislator held talks with Samson Mow, who advocates for Bitcoin adoption by states like El Salvador at his BTC tech firm Jan3.Taiwan is an export-oriented economyKo highlighted that Taiwan is an export-driven economy that has experienced significant fluctuations in its national currency, the New Taiwan dollar, amid global inflation and intensifying geopolitical risks.“We currently have a gold reserve of 423 metric tons, and our foreign exchange reserves amount to $577 billion, including investments in US Treasury bonds,” the lawmaker stated.In a scenario of more intense currency volatility or potential regional conflicts, Taiwan may “very likely be unable to ensure the security and liquidity,” Ko continued, adding that Bitcoin could be a great new addition to Taiwan’s reserves due to a number of reasons.Ko Ju-Chun advocated for the adoption of Bitcoin by the Taiwanese government before the Legislative Yuan.

2025-05-09T08:10:00.000Z,"Is Pi Network dead? What really went wrong behind the hype","What Pi Network promised              When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app?It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.Did you know? Pi Network utilizes the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which aims for energy efficiency and decentralization, differing from Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work.                  What the Pi Network delivered              The roadmap was supposed to be gradual: start with mobile mining, then move toward a testnet, KYC rollout and, finally, full mainnet launch with real trading and utility. But that last step took a lot longer than anyone expected.After years in limbo, the Pi Network finally opened its mainnet to external trading in February 2025. That should’ve been a big win. But it didn’t go smoothly. For one, not all users were able to migrate their balances. Know Your Customer (KYC) verification became a bottleneck, and many were left wondering when — or if — they’d ever be able to access the tokens they’d mined for years.Then there was the price. When Pi first started trading on external platforms, the price spiked, hitting as high as $2.98 in late February. But the hype didn’t last. As early adopters started selling off their tokens and real-world use cases remained thin, the price slid hard. By early May 2025, it had dropped to around $0.58, wiping out more than 70% of its value.There’s also still no real utility. You can’t spend Pi on much (only in small, community-run markets and pilot programs). And while the team talks about building a full ecosystem of apps and services, it’s unclear how fast — or how seriously — that’s progressing.                  Why the crypto community grew skeptical              As the months turned into years, more and more red flags started popping up, and the community started asking hard questions.1. Still waiting on the mainnetPi launched in 2019, and for years, users kept hearing that the open mainnet was “just around the corner.” First there was the testnet. Then the “enclosed mainnet.” Then a roadmap update. The actual open network didn’t arrive until early 2025 — six years later. And by that time, a lot of early believers had started losing faith.2. All roads lead back to the core teamDespite the talk of decentralization, the reality is that the Pi Core Team has retained almost total control over the project. Every active mainnet node? Controlled by them. Most of the token supply? Still in their hands. That doesn’t sit well with crypto users who believe in distributed power and community-driven networks. Right now, Pi feels more like a private company than a decentralized protocol.3. Where’s the transparency?Another sticking point has been the lack of detail on how Pi actually works under the hood. The white paper is vague. There’s no clear breakdown of tokenomics, no timelines on when tokens unlock, no burn mechanics and no insight into supply control. Without that info, it’s hard for anyone to judge the health or future value of the project.4. Exchange listingsDespite years of hype, Pi still isn’t listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. It is tradable on some platforms like OKX and Bitget, but even there, things are shaky. Some users have reported trouble withdrawing their tokens, with exchanges blaming “traffic spikes” and other vague technical reasons. It all feels a bit fragile.For instance, one user on Bitget reported depositing 1,500 Pi tokens but found them inaccessible, with no clear timeline for resolution. On OKX, withdrawals were suspended for over 24 hours, with users asked to provide ID and email verification but given vague responses like “Your request will be completed within 24-48 hours.”By April 2025, users reported that MEXC, another exchange listing Pi, suspended Pi withdrawals, sparking concerns about liquidity and platform reliability. This was compounded by reports of large Pi transfers from MEXC, Gate.io and Bitget to OKX wallets, raising suspicions of coordinated price manipulation or exchange-level issues.5. Fake volume and fading hypeAt its peak in February 2025, Pi was trading at nearly $3 and generating billions in volume. Fast forward a few months, and that volume has dropped off a cliff — down to around $40 million. That kind of collapse raises serious questions: Was the demand real, or was it inflated by speculation, bots or internal market-making?6. Users trapped in a closed loopEven now, many users can’t actually use or withdraw their Pi tokens. Without access to real exchanges or spending options, they’re stuck in a kind of token limbo, watching a number go up in an app but with no way to convert that into anything useful.Did you know? While Pi Network claims over 70 million users, blockchain data indicates that only about 9.11 million wallets exist, with approximately 20,000 showing daily activity.                  Is Pi Network a scam or just a failed vision?              Not every crypto project that stumbles is a scam. Some are just ambitious ideas that don’t quite pan out. So, where does Pi Network fall?On the surface, Pi doesn’t fit the classic scam mold. There was no initial coin offering (ICO), no upfront investment required — just an app that lets you “mine” Pi by tapping your phone daily. That’s a low bar for entry, and it attracted millions.But dig a little deeper, and things get murkier. The whole system leans heavily on referrals, encouraging users to bring in more people to boost their mining rate. That kind of structure starts to resemble a multi-level marketing scheme more than a decentralized crypto project.Then there’s the monetization angle. The app is filled with ads, and users are required to complete KYC verification, handing over personal data. So, while you’re not paying money, you’re paying with your attention and information.Given these developments, critics such as Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, and Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, have publicly expressed skepticism regarding Pi Network’s legitimacy.Pi Network might not be a blatant fraud, but the combination of opaque operations, aggressive referral tactics and questionable monetization strategies certainly raises eyebrows.Did you know? Pi Network was officially launched on March 14, 2019 — Pi Day — symbolizing the mathematical constant π (3.14).                  Can Pi recover, or is it over?              Is there a path forward for Pi Network? Possibly, but it’s a steep climb.First, transparency is key. Open-sourcing the code would allow the community to verify what’s under the hood and build trust.Second, Pi needs real utility. Right now, holding Pi doesn’t offer much beyond the hope of future value. Integrating Pi into actual use cases — like payments or decentralized applications — would give the token purpose.Third, broader exchange listings are crucial. Currently, Pi is available on a limited number of exchanges, which hampers liquidity and price discovery. Major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have yet to list Pi, citing concerns over transparency and regulatory compliance.Fourth, decentralization must be more than a buzzword. Currently, the Pi Core Team maintains significant control over the network, which contradicts the principles of decentralization. Implementing decentralized governance would distribute decision-making power and align with the ethos of blockchain technology.But even if all these boxes are checked, time is a factor. Since its mainnet launch in early 2025, Pi’s price has dropped significantly, and user engagement has waned. Rebuilding momentum is challenging.Without significant changes, the Pi Network risks fading into obscurity, remembered more for its unfulfilled promises than its achievements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-pi-network-dead-what-really-went-wrong-behind-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: Dune AnalyticsAnother factor is Solana’s tokenomics, which Sygnum said was “a comparable issue” to the criticism levelled at Ethereum over its mainnet’s stagnant transaction volumes due to it lowering the cost for its layer 2 networks.The company said Solana is leading Ethereum in market share for layer-1 fee generation, but “most of the fees are paid to validators and do not grow the value of the Solana token.”“In fact, when it comes to revenues, Ethereum still exceeds Solana 2- 2.5x,” Sygnum said.It argued that Solana’s tokenomics are “easier to modify” than Ethereum’s scaling strategy. Still, it said that Solana “does not appear inclined to drive more value to the token,” as its community shot down a proposal to cut the SOL’s inflation rate in March.Solana could gain with stable revenue focusSygnum noted that Solana, which some have hailed as an “Ethereum killer” that could challenge the network’s market share, could make some gains on the No. 2 blockchain.The company said Ethereum has the dominant market share in “use cases that are showing traction” with support from governments, regulators, and traditional finance — such as tokenization, stablecoins, and decentralized finance.However, it added that Solana had made progress in the amount of value locked on its decentralized finance protocols, and if it gains in “more stable revenue sources” such as tokenization and stablecoins, it could gain on Ethereum.Sygnum added that Solana still has a strong backing, even with the Ethereum Foundation reshuffling its priorities to the layer 1 and recognising “the need to adjust its go-to-market strategy.”However, that could give a sentiment tailwind to Ethereum as the blockchain’s “2-year-long underperformance vs Solana has been temporarily arrested” since the foundation’s pivot.Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-no-convincing-signs-besting-ethereum-memecoin-bias?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Pseudonymous crypto trader Daan Crypto Trades said it was a “pretty insane candle.” Over the same 24 hours, Ether Open Interest (OI) spiked 21%. Ether price pump caught traders offsideThe surge followed the long-awaited Pectra Upgrade, which went live on May 7, introducing new wallet features, increased staking limits and scalability improvements to Ethereum. Popular crypto trader Alex Kruger said on May 8 that Ether’s price spike was primarily due to “new longs.”If Ether were to fall back to $2,000, approximately $2.06 billion in long positions would be at risk of liquidation, according to CoinGlass data. The price surge caught many traders offside, with approximately $328 million in Ether short positions liquidated over the same period.Crypto trader Bob Loukas said, “ETH holders thinking this might finally be the turning point.” 2025 has not been a strong year for Ether’s price, which fell 56% from its Jan. 1 price to $1,472 by April 9 — its lowest point this year — as sentiment weakened throughout the year.Ether is up 52% over the past 30 days.

A May 8 report from Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, said the company is working on new processors to power its future devices, including its first smart glasses to rival Meta’s Ray-Bans, more powerful Macs, and artificial intelligence servers.The smart glasses — a first for Apple — would rely on a specialized chip codenamed N401. The processor is based on Apple Watch chips but is further optimized for power efficiency and designed to control multiple cameras planned for the glasses, the sources said. Apple’s smart glasses will initially be non-augmented reality versions that will include cameras, microphones and integrated AI, much like rival offerings from Meta. They would presumably have similar functions like snapping photos, recording video and offering translation options, the report added. The product may also integrate a visual intelligence feature for scanning the environment and describing objects, looking up information about products and providing directions.Mass production targeted for late 2026 or 2027, suggesting a product launch within approximately two years, they added.  Apple is targeting rival Meta’s smart Ray-Bans.

Source: BanklessThe SFS didn’t share an image of Yu outside his family’s house. Many initially believed that Yu’s suicide was legitimate after reports of the incident emerged on May 4. But several pieces of information that began circulating on X two days later led some to conclude his suicide attempt was faked. One piece of evidence was an unverified letter purportedly sent by Yu to an investor confirming that he hadn’t died; another included transfers from several crypto wallets owned by Yu after the alleged incident and the removal of his obituary from the memorial site Legacy.com.Wallets tied to Yu have moved $1.5M since the suicide incidentAccording to blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps, wallets tied to Yu have offloaded around $1.5 million worth of the Zerebro (ZEREBRO) tokens since the suicide incident, strengthening the SFS’ report that Yu is still alive.Some of those funds have been transferred to the same wallet address Yu used to create the so-called “Legacy Memecoin” — Legacoin (LLJEFFY) — Bubblemaps noted.Related: Doodles NFT sales surge 97% ahead of DOOD token airdropYu’s AI-powered, content-focused Zerebro platform burst onto the scene in late 2024, with the ZEREBRO token soaring to a near $660 million market cap on Jan. 3 before tanking below $20 million around three months later, CoinGecko data shows.ZEREBRO currently boasts a $47.2 million valuation, while several LLJEFFY tokens have notched multimillion-dollar valuations across different blockchain networks.Yu’s PTSD claims reflect a concerning industry trend of harassment, violenceThe PTSD comment that Yu made to the SFS reporter appears to be related to the constant harassment, blackmail and threats that he talked about in his apparent letter sent to the Zerebro investor.He claimed that with his house address publicly known, he’s been in constant fear of robbery and physical harm — an unfortunate trend that has escalated in the crypto space in recent months.There have been more than 150 crypto-related physical attacks since 2014, according to a GitHub list tracked by Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp. Forty-six of those reported incidents have occurred over the last 12 months alone. Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths:",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/zerebro-dev-jeffy-yu-reported-alive-after-being-spotted-parents-house?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.Source: James Filan“This settlement, alongside the programmatic disassembly of the SEC’s crypto enforcement program, does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws,” she said.“In the meantime, the settlement joins a line of dismissals that collectively erode the credibility of our lawyers in court who are being asked to take legal positions today contrary to the ones taken just months ago.”Under the Trump administration, the SEC has slowly been walking back its hardline stance toward crypto firms forged under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s reign, dismissing a growing number of enforcement actions against crypto firms.At the same time, Crenshaw argues that if Judge Torres accepts the settlement, it would erase “the investor protections we already won” and leave a “regulatory vacuum,” until the crypto task force hammers out a regulatory framework.“The settlement is not in the best interests of the investors and markets that our agency is tasked with serving and protecting. It creates more questions than answers.”In August last year, a Judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in penalties after ruling the firm’s XRP (XRP) token was covered by securities laws only when sold to institutional investors.What’s next for the Ripple case? It’s not over yetWhile the SEC and Ripple have agreed to a settlement, it’s still not a done deal, according to ex-federal prosecutor James Filan, because there are several steps before the long-running legal saga can conclude.For a start, Judge Torres needs to provide an indicative ruling if she agrees to the settlement letter, Filan said in a May 8 analysis on X.Source: James FilanIf Torres provides an indicative ruling, the SEC and Ripple will ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for a limited remand back to Judge Torres, which, if granted, will result in another motion being filed for the agreed settlement, according to Filan.Related: Bitnomial drops SEC lawsuit ahead of XRP futures launch in the US“After the injunction is dissolved and the funds distributed, the SEC and Ripple will ask the Court of Appeals to dismiss the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal.

Jay Clayton, the Trump-nomianted US attorney leading the prosecution, said on April 28 that the suggested 20-year sentence serves as a “critical warning to other entrepreneurs, executives, and promoters in the cryptocurrency industry and in any future industry as-yet unconceived: that fraud will be punished severely, regardless of the technology or industry in which it occurs.”Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp quotes the prosecution’s argument that Mashinsky targeted retail investors. Source: Jameson LoppClayton argued that a strong sentence was warranted as the fraud targeted unsophisticated retail investors rather than institutional parties with protections and expertise. Mashinsky “preyed on ordinary individuals who relied on his promises of safety and financial security.” The Mashinsky defense team drew attention to Mashinsky’s character, highlighting his long career in business, devotion to family and service with the Israel Defense Forces. His lawyers also drew distinctions between Mashinsky’s case and that of Bankman-Fried, claiming, “There are no allegations — let alone any proof — that Alex misappropriated, embezzled or stole any customer assets or any Celsius money.”On May 5, Mashinsky’s legal team argued that these mitigating factors should warrant a sentence of no more than 366 days.“The government’s venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” his team said.Mashinsky’s lawyers called the suggested 20-year term a “death-in-prison sentence.”Mashinsky’s sentence follows high-profile Trump pardons for crypto execsTrump started his term with the pardon of Silk Road 2.0 founder Ross Ulbricht, whose acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) on his narcotics trading platform endeared him to the crypto community. The president also commuted the sentences of Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, three BitMEX crypto exchange executives who pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and failing to establish a proper Anti-Money Laundering program.Sam Mangel, a consultant to white-collar convicts who advised former Trump staffer Steve Bannon and Bankman-Fried, told Politico there has been a large spike in interest in presidential pardons. “Everybody that is in prison now is keenly aware of the environment, and it’s become a very hot topic within the low- and minimum-security inmate communities,” said Mangel.Related: US stablecoin bill loses democrats amid Trump corruption concernsHigh-profile crypto defendants seem to have taken notice, too. Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin advocate and libertarian activist, is facing federal tax evasion charges. In January, he released a video making an outright plea to Trump for a commutation. Ver claimed that he is the victim of lawfare and likened his persecution to Trump’s legal problems following the Jan. 6 scandal. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of now-defunct exchange FTX, likened his court experience with Trump’s defamation lawsuit in an interview with The New York Sun on Feb. 18. He claimed his trial was politicized under the Biden administration and that he didn’t think there was “a very fair and balanced view or approach.” His parents also reportedly met with lawyers and people close to the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon. Trump’s commutation of the BitMEX executives has even led former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to apply for clemency. On May 6, Zhao said that his lawyers had submitted an application and were awaiting a response. The current administration is still writing the rules of the road as regulators reshuffle personnel and priorities and new legal frameworks for crypto take shape.

2025-05-08T17:00:00.000Z,"Are layer 2s good for Ethereum, or are they ‘extractive?’","Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees. “People in the Ethereum Foundation [the nonprofit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem] will tell you that, ‘Yes, we effed up by being too ivory tower.’ I have heard that multiple times,” said David Hoffman, an owner at Bankless, during a panel discussion at the Cornell Tech event in New York City on April 25. Hoffman, left, at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference. Source: Andrew SingerElsewhere, Hoffman has urged Ethereum to make a “strategic pivot,” noting that the crypto environment has changed in the last few years. Ethereum no longer has the “luxury of being a peace-time research project…. exploited by its competition.”L2s are reaping millions of dollars in transaction order fees (sometimes called sequencing fees), but none of these revenues are being passed on to Ethereum, according to James Beck, head of growth at ENS Labs and another speaker at the New York City conference. Beck told Cointelegraph:So, this cultural layer of podcasters and researchers are saying, ‘Well, the price of ETH has been dropping compared to these other tokens. What do we do to make Ethereum more powerful?’In short, Ethereum is a neutral verification layer, but the Ethereum mainnet is not being fairly compensated for the work that it is doing. Centralized for-profit L2s like Base, Optimism and Arbitrum are gathering the lucrative sequencing fees while enjoying the security and liveness guarantees of the Ethereum mainnet at relatively little economic cost.L2s soared after Dencun upgradeL2 rollups are a recent innovation; they only emerged in 2023. The idea was to reduce chain congestion and gas fees by moving transaction processing from the main blockchain (layer 1) to separate chains that sit atop the mainnet (L2s). But transaction processing is arguably the most profitable part of the revenue game, especially when users opt to pay priority fees to get their orders processed faster.Fee-sharing was rarely much of an issue before Ethereum’s March 2024 Dencun upgrade, which introduced blob transactions to help scale layer 2s. Blobs significantly reduced the cost for L2s to post data to Ethereum, allowing them to operate more profitably, CoinMetrics researcher analyst Tanay Ved told Cointelegraph this week. Since then, L2 user demand has soared, especially on Base, the L2 launched by Coinbase in August 2023 on the Ethereum mainnet. As Ved noted in an April 8 blog, Base has earned a total of ~$98 million in revenues from user-transaction fees (including base and priority fees), “while paying only ~$4.9M to the Ethereum base layer, resulting in a total estimated profit of $94M since the Dencun upgrade.” Ved added:This dynamic has led to many questioning whether Layer-2s are net positive for Ethereum, or whether they are ‘extractive.Base’s responseAsked about fees, a Base spokesperson told Cointelegraph, “Today, Base already pays Ethereum fees for every transaction on Base. All transactions are settled on Ethereum, and so far, Base has paid Ethereum more than $20 million in settlement fees since Base’s inception.” One can see these fees on Token Terminal under “cost of revenue,” the spokesperson added. “Overall, Base makes getting onchain more accessible with fast and cheap transactions and helps grow the Ethereum ecosystem by onboarding more users, builders, apps and assets, all of whom are transacting in ETH and driving demand,” said the spokesperson.Related: Institutions break up with Ethereum but keep ETH on the hookHowever, in many, if not most months, Base’s overall fees are roughly 10 times the amount paid to Ethereum for settling trades, according to examination of the referenced Base financial statement. In April, for instance, the most recent full month, Base reaped $3.7 million in fees, but only $305,000 was delivered to Ethereum as settlement fees — about 8% of total fees.Still, maybe things aren’t quite so dire. Even if fees are out of kilter now, the imbalance may not last, others caution. Ethereum hard forks like Pectra, which went live yesterday (May 7), and Fusaka, scheduled for late 2025, will increase blob throughput. “This means L2s will be able to post more blobs, potentially driving higher total blob fees to mainnet,” Ved told Cointelegraph. Ethereum is already consistently hitting the current blob target of three per block, as the chart below shows. “Pectra will raise this to six blobs per block — with a max of nine — creating room for increased fee capture as L2 activity scales,” added Ved.Average blobs per block and their total blob fees (USD) on Ethereum. Source: CoinMetricsAre “based rollups” the answer?Some Ethereum researchers, podcasters — and even L2s — have been leaning into “based rollups” as a more permanent way to fix the fee problem and provide better security in the bargain. Here, transaction ordering (i.e., sequencing) would be done on the mainnet, not on L2s.The sequencers used by Optimism, Arbitrum One, Base and others are more prone to attack or failure, given that they are centralized, with a single point of failure, some researchers say. Polygon’s Jarrod Ward writes:If a centralized sequencer goes down, the rollup effectively stops doing its job entirely. It stops handling transactions from users on the L2 and also stops sending batch data back to Ethereum.“Layer-2 sequencers have become dangerously centralized,” added Tom Ngo, executive lead at Metis — an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain. Last June’s $2.6-million hack of Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Linea drove home to Ngo and others the importance of decentralization and the perils of centralized sequencers. Related: ‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story’ is less about crypto and more about being humanSeveral based-rollup L2s have launched this past year. Taiko Alethia, the first and largest, went live in May 2024. A year later, it had $148.3 million in total value secured — ranking 14th on L2Beat’s list of L2s, though far behind leader Base’s $12.06 billion. Top Ethereum layer 2s ranked by total value secured. Source: L2BeatSpeedwise, Taiko was averaging a respectable 20.3 user operations per second (UOPS) on May 7, a far cry from Base’s 86.3 UOPS, but on par with Arbitrum One’s (21.6 UOPS) and significantly better than Optimism’s (10.3 UOPS).A tax on L2s?Another idea floated in the Ethereum community is imposing a sort of tax on L2s. But doing this could have some unintended consequences, according to Ved. It could make L2s less competitive. It also risks “leakage of activity to competing layer 1s outside the Ethereum ecosystem.” Activity that flows to Base today could flow instead to Solana or other L1s, Ved said.There could be philosophical issues, too, were Ethereum to lay a surcharge on its L2s. Ved noted:A tax could be seen as contrary to Ethereum’s ethos of decentralization, which would opt for market-driven forces rather than enforcing a tax. Generally speaking, the Ethereum Foundation seems to be prioritizing long-term growth over short-term revenue, Ved explained. Proposals like EIP-7762, though, which raises the minimum blob base fee to speed up price discovery during demand surges, could drive more fee income to Ethereum mainnet, having an effect like a tax. Social pressure?According to ENS Labs’ Beck, it may take some social pressure to get the leading centralized L2s to voluntarily give up their sequencing fees. Other L2s like Linea may need to step in and say to centralized L2s something along the lines of: “Look, you guys have these risks inherent in a more centralized design, and here’s the chance to bake [the order processing] into Ethereum, which is more decentralized.”Along these lines, ENS took part in a three-day workshop in the UK in January with leading researchers and developers from entities like Linea, Status, OpenZeppelin, Titan, Spire Labs and the Ethereum Foundation. The immediate task was how to create scalable, decentralized infrastructure for ENS Labs’ Namechain, but also to bring together various Ethereum ecosystem teams to collaboratively solve L2 interoperability challenges with based rollups. It’s not always easy to get things done in a flat (non-hierarchical), multi-voice entity like Ethereum, Beck acknowledges. “Ethereum is a decentralized ecosystem. You can’t get everyone on the same page all at once.” But a collaboration like the recent one that took place in the UK is a start. Cornell Tech conference panelist Hoffman expressed some confidence that Ethereum could pivot and “turn the layer 1 into a rollup” with processing speeds comparable to today’s L2s. As noted, Hoffman has criticized the Ethereum Foundation for being too insular and academic, but he sees signs that things may be changing now, writing recently:The appointment of co-executive directors Tomasz Stańczak and Hsiao-Wei Wang marks a new era of accountability, direction, and internal cohesion.“I’m feeling optimistic,” added Beck. “Ethereum still has the most assets locked for DeFi; the most stablecoins are on Ethereum. BlackRock has a fund that’s settling on Ethereum.” Put another way, Ethereum is still well-positioned to provide the infrastructure for the “network of networks” — i.e., the smoothly interacting network of multitudinous private and public blockchains that many hope will be the technology’s future.Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/layer-2s-good-for-ethereum-or-extractive?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-08T15:00:00.000Z,"User experience could be crypto’s superpower—or its kryptonite","Opinion by Jonathan Farnell, CEO of FreedxIt’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.Take complexity. A 2024 Chainalysis report pointed out that 43% of would-be crypto users shy away from the technical tangle of private keys and gas fees. Have you ever lost a seed phrase? You’re not alone. More than $200 billion in crypto has been lost forever because of it. That’s not just a statistic — it’s a gut punch for someone who thought they’d unlocked the future of finance. Streamlining this chaos could fling open the doors to 5 billion internet users, pushing crypto’s $2.91 trillion market cap, as reported by Cointelegraph, into the stratosphere — potentially reaching $4 trillion in the second quarter of 2025.From headaches to high fivesMany decentralized finance (DeFi) apps currently feel like a hacker’s playground — all data and API integrations, but nothing intuitive that speaks to an ordinary person. Simply swapping cryptic jargon for plain English would be a solid start. Consider swapping “gas fees” to “transaction costs.” Those 12-word seed phrases send users into panic mode, but a familiar gear icon for settings could put users’ minds at ease. Suddenly, managing a wallet isn’t a high-stakes game anymore. It’s just another tool.This isn’t about dazzling users with blockchain’s inner workings. Most people don’t care about the tech under the hood, just like they don’t ask whether their favorite app runs on AWS or Google Cloud. Blockchain isn’t a shiny new internet. It’s infrastructure — powerful, but invisible, when done right. Users want solutions — quick payments, secure savings, and easy access. Streamlined experiences could draw in everyday folks — retirees sending cash to grandkids, small business owners managing cash flow — expanding cryptocurrency’s reach. It’s about turning a daunting process into something approachable, paving the way for broader economic effect. Build confidence through clarityTrust is another sticking point. Transactions can feel uncertain, with phishing scams and tales of lost savings heightening unease. Vague error messages like “transaction failed” frustrate users, but specific feedback — “insufficient funds, please top up your balance” — offers reassurance. Guides on staying secure and pre-set options to avoid errors can make the system feel reliable, not reckless. When technology fades into the background, confidence takes center stage.Design quality shapes perceptions, too. Unpolished interfaces raise doubts about credibility, especially for those accustomed to refined digital tools. Clean, professional layouts signal trustworthiness, while clear benefits — faster payments and control over data — make the case compelling. This shift could reposition cryptocurrency as a practical alternative, not a gamble. It’s not about buzzwords like “trustlessness” or “censorship resistance.” Most users don’t lose sleep over those ideals. They care about quality, ease, and value, not the blockchain badge.Adoption depends on usabilityCryptocurrency could reshape how people trade, save, and connect — growing from 617 million users to billions. Success hinges on accessibility. Platforms that prioritize straightforward design already see more engagement and trust, driving market potential into the trillions, rivaling traditional finance. Poor usability, though, risks leaving this vision unrealized. The promise of self-custody or transparency won’t lure the masses if the experience feels like a chore.Recent: Stop making crypto complexChallenges like regulation and old habits persist, but confusing experiences remain the most significant barrier, keeping everyday users at arm’s length. Blockchain’s promise is real, yet its breakthrough relies on design that feels human and dependable. People don’t adopt tools because they’re built on cutting-edge tech. They adopt tools because they solve real problems — cheaply, simply, and reliably. Cryptocurrency stands ready to expand — it needs to meet people where they are, not where the tech wants them to be.Focus on benefits, not features, and the market could soar. Consider a freelancer who is paid instantly across borders or a parent gifting digital cash without a hitch. That’s what hooks users — not the mechanics of account abstraction or zero-knowledge proofs. Platforms that nail this could turn crypto into a daily staple, boosting adoption and market value. Exchanges leading the charge with intuitive design already prove it: Usability drives growth. Cryptocurrency’s future isn’t about preaching blockchain’s brilliance — it’s about making it so seamless no one even notices it’s there.Opinion by Jonathan Farnell, CEO of Freedx.

2025-05-08T13:30:00.000Z,"Beyond digital gold, Bitcoin’s next chapter is about to be unlocked — Dan Held","Bitcoin (BTC) has long been branded as “digital gold,” a store of value for believers in scarcity, decentralization and self-sovereignty. As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.Political shiftsWith US President Donald Trump openly backing Bitcoin — and reportedly owning it himself — Held said he sees a regulatory and reputational change. “We have the most open administration toward Bitcoin in the United States,” he said. “It kind of feels weird... Normally in the press, Bitcoin mining is destroying the environment. It’s being used by money launderers… And instead, you've got the president encouraging Bitcoin.”Held traced Bitcoin’s unlikely rise through moments of adversity, from China’s mining crackdowns to the Biden administration’s strict approach to crypto banking. Yet despite those challenges, roughly 25% of Americans now own Bitcoin, he said.DeFi on BitcoinWhat comes next may push the asset into a new phase. Held and Jenkinson are proponents of building decentralized finance (DeFi) tools on top of Bitcoin, functionalities traditionally associated with blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.“If we could bring [DeFi] back to Bitcoin, then Bitcoin could utilize not just spot speculation... but these other speculative games then would allow bitcoin to grow even faster.” That includes borrowing, lending, and staking, all mechanisms that allow users to interact with Bitcoin beyond simple holding or trading.Related: How crypto payments can become the new ‘tap-and-go’ — Pulsar co-founderJenkinson echoed the potential, highlighting a shift in attitude: “If you can use [Bitcoin] and bring DeFi to it, you’re basically allowing people to use digital gold as the underlying asset... It’s a very hard thing to do, because most hardcore Bitcoin maximalists don’t want people to give up their Bitcoin for something else.”That tension between so-called “Bitcoin puritans” and more moderate voices is not new, Held noted. He recounted the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork, describing it as “a civil war... brother against brother.” But unlike that contentious split, today’s evolution is happening without rewriting Bitcoin’s base rules. “No one’s proposing to change the rules of Bitcoin,” Held said. “This is innovation built on top.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-08T13:15:00.000Z,"Browser-based crypto mining in 2025: Still viable or virtually dead?","Key takeawaysAfter the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy lifting.The idea blew up in the late 2010s with tools like Coinhive, which let website owners mine Monero (XMR) using JavaScript. At first, it seemed like a clever alternative to ads; visitors donated a bit of unused CPU power, and websites earned crypto. But then came cryptojacking. Sites began running these scripts without user permission, draining resources and slowing down devices. In 2019, Coinhive shut down, citing shrinking returns and mounting scrutiny.Now, in 2025, browser crypto mining is making a low-key comeback. New tools, new rules and a fresh generation of crypto users are reviving the concept. But is it worth it or just a relic of crypto’s scrappier past?Let’s break down where things stand today.Did you know? In 2018, Coinhive was responsible for approximately 1.18% of all Monero blocks mined.What’s the status of browser-based crypto mining in 2025?Active platformsThe biggest name in browser crypto mining today is CryptoTab Browser. It’s a Chromium-based browser with a built-in mining feature that lets users passively earn Bitcoin (BTC). It also offers tools like Cloud Boost to multiply earnings and a mining pool for better efficiency.Meanwhile, mobile-first platforms like Pi Network and YouHolder cater to users who want to mine via smartphones — or at least simulate the process while collecting rewards. These platforms blur the line between real mining and gamified engagement, but they’ve drawn millions of users, especially in emerging markets.Supported coinsMonero is still popular for browser mining; its RandomX algorithm is CPU-optimized and ASIC-resistant, which means regular computers can handle it. CryptoTab, meanwhile, focuses on Bitcoin, though it uses a form of pooled hash power to make it viable through a browser interface, though its efficiency and profitability are often debated due to Bitcoin’s high mining difficulty and reliance on specialized hardware.Who is mining crypto via browsers?The browser mining audience today is surprisingly broad:Casual users: People who like the idea of passive income without much commitment.Newcomers to crypto: Those testing the waters without risking capital.Crypto-curious users: Folks who want to earn something on the side while they browse.Browser mining won’t make you rich — let’s be clear. But it does lower the barrier to entry, especially for users in lower-income regions or without access to advanced hardware.Did you know? Some browser-based mining scripts have been designed to continue operating even after a user closes the browser tab by opening hidden windows that persist in the background.Is browser mining profitable in 2025?Short answer: not really. It’s more about novelty or experimentation than making serious money.Mining in a browser might get you a few cents’ worth of crypto per day, but only if you leave your computer running non-stop. And that leads to two problems: electricity costs and hardware stress. Over time, those costs can far outweigh the value of the crypto you earn.For example, in the US, the average residential electricity rate is about $0.15 per kilowatt-hour. Leaving a mid-range laptop mining all day could consume roughly 0.1–0.2 kWh per hour — that’s over $10 per month in electricity for maybe a dollar or two in mined crypto. And you’re putting constant load on your CPU.Compared to other methodsBrowser mining can’t hold a candle to GPU or ASIC setups. A modern ASIC miner like the Antminer S19 Pro churns out up to 110 terahashes per second (TH/s) — that’s several orders of magnitude higher than what a browser script can deliver.Cloud mining, on the other hand, lets users rent mining power from remote farms. It’s more efficient and hands-off but also comes with subscription fees and mixed reputations. At least with browser mining, you’re only risking your own device and electricity bill.Did you know? In 2025, some cloud mining platforms have integrated artificial intelligence to optimize mining operations, enhancing efficiency and profitability for users without requiring direct hardware management.Environmental footprintWhile it consumes less power than an ASIC farm, browser mining still adds up. Thousands of users mining inefficiently on personal devices generate a surprisingly high cumulative power draw.That’s why most efforts to make crypto mining greener — like using renewable energy or optimizing ASIC efficiency — haven’t trickled down to the browser level. If you’re eco-conscious, browser mining isn’t the cleanest option out there.What’s next for browser crypto mining?Tech upgradesWebAssembly (Wasm) has boosted what browsers can do, including mining. It allows faster, more efficient script execution, meaning browsers can now run lightweight mining scripts without wrecking user experience.Platforms like CryptoTab have also improved their UX, integrating features like built-in VPNs and ad blockers. This is an effort to make mining feel more like a bonus and less like a burden.Some decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, such as Ore, are even experimenting with combining browser mining and decentralized finance. It’s the early days, but the potential is there to let users contribute computing power and earn rewards while interacting with decentralized applicatioins (DApps) — all within a browser tab.Market and regulationIn 2025, global crypto adoption has been growing, but so is regulatory scrutiny. In the US, the SEC is pushing for clearer guidance, which may eventually affect how browser-based mining tools are classified or taxed.Elsewhere, countries like Kuwait have cracked down on mining altogether, citing energy shortages. Local regulations will play a huge role in determining where and how browser crypto mining can survive.Alternative use casesMining isn’t the only game in town. Brave browser, for example, lets users earn Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) just by viewing ads, which can be used within the Brave ecosystem or exchanged. It’s not mining, technically, but it’s another way to earn crypto passively through browsing.In the DeFi world, there’s potential to connect browser mining with yield farming or liquidity mining. Imagine earning a trickle of tokens just by keeping your browser open and interacting with onchain applications. It’s early, but real experiments are underway.Here’s an example of how you can use BAT earned from viewing ads and channel them into DeFi for additional returns:You transfer your earned BAT to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap, a leading DeFi platform for liquidity mining.On Uniswap, you pair your BAT with another token — e.g., Ether (ETH) or a stablecoin like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — to provide liquidity to a BAT/ETH or BAT/USDT pool. This involves depositing equal values of both tokens into the pool, receiving LP (liquidity provider) tokens in return.You stake these LP tokens in Uniswap’s liquidity mining program (or a similar protocol like SushiSwap) to earn rewards, which may include a share of trading fees (typically 0.3% per trade) and potentially additional UNI (UNI) or other governance tokens as incentives.To maximize returns, you could take your LP tokens and stake them on another DeFi platform, like Yearn.finance, which algorithmically seeks the highest yield opportunities across protocols. For example, Yearn.finance might stake your Uniswap LP tokens in a pool offering 10%-20% APY, compounding your returns.Alternatively, you could use a yield aggregator like Yield Yak on Solana, which auto-compounds rewards to boost earnings.However, be aware that in liquidity mining, price fluctuations between paired tokens (e.g., BAT/ETH) can lead to losses compared to holding the tokens outright. Also, the value of earned tokens (BAT, UNI, etc.) and DeFi rewards can fluctuate (market volatility), impacting overall returns.Is browser-based crypto mining worth it?So, is browser mining dead in 2025? Not quite, but it’s no gold rush either.It’s a fringe activity, appealing to newcomers, tinkerers and anyone curious about crypto’s more obscure corners. With better tech and clearer ethics than in the Coinhive days, it’s no longer a threat — just a slow, modest way to dip your toes in.If your goal is to understand crypto without buying in, browser mining still has a role to play.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-browser-based-cryptocurrency-mining-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-08T13:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin DeFi sees surge in mining participation despite drop in TVL","Smart contract platform Rootstock, the home of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Bitcoin, saw a sharp increase in network security and mining engagement in the first quarter of 2025, even as activity cooled.Merged mining participation surged to an all-time high of 81%, up from 56.4% in Q4 2024, driven by the integration of major mining pools Foundry and SpiderPool, according to Messari’s first “State of Rootstock” report for 2025, shared with Cointelegraph.The heightened miner interest boosted Rootstock’s hash power to over 740 exahashes per second, surpassing the total Bitcoin network hashrate recorded in October 2024. As a result, the network is now considered to be in a “mature phase” of merged mining growth.The increased security coincided with a 60% reduction in transaction fees, improving user experience and positioning Rootstock more competitively within the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem.“As BTCFi continues to grow, Rootstock is well-positioned for broader adoption through core upgrades like a 60% reduction in transaction fees, alongside sustained investment in builder education and incentive programs,” Messari analyst Andrew Yang said.Rootstock overview for Q1 2025. Source: MessariRelated: Is this the end of Bitcoin DeFi?Rootstock’s DeFi TVL dropsDespite the mining milestone, Rootstock’s DeFi ecosystem experienced a decline in total value locked (TVL) during Q1 2025, with Bitcoin (BTC)-denominated TVL dropping 7.2% and US dollar-denominated TVL falling by 20% quarter-over-quarter to $179.9 million.Although TVL briefly peaked at $244.6 million in January during a Bitcoin price rally, it trended downward from March, reflecting broader market cooling.For perspective, Ethereum-based DeFi TVL also saw a sharp 27% decline in Q1, hit hard by macro uncertainty and the $1.4 billion Bybit exploit, according to a report by DappRadar.The stablecoin market on Rootstock also underwent notable changes. USDt (USDT) remained the leading stablecoin by value, holding $3.8 million and a 27.5% market share. However, its dominance fell significantly from 41.3% in Q4 2024.By the end of Q1, no single stablecoin commanded over 30% of Rootstock’s stablecoin market.Active addresses dropped by 26.5%, and new addresses plunged by 54.7%, although daily transactions rose slightly by 4.3%, reaching an average of 11,524 per day.Active addresses drop on Rootstock.
