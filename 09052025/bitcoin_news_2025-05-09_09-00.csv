2025-05-09T08:10:00.000Z,"Is Pi Network dead? What really went wrong behind the hype","What Pi Network promised              When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app?It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.Did you know? Pi Network utilizes the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), which aims for energy efficiency and decentralization, differing from Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work.                  What the Pi Network delivered              The roadmap was supposed to be gradual: start with mobile mining, then move toward a testnet, KYC rollout and, finally, full mainnet launch with real trading and utility. But that last step took a lot longer than anyone expected.After years in limbo, the Pi Network finally opened its mainnet to external trading in February 2025. That should’ve been a big win. But it didn’t go smoothly. For one, not all users were able to migrate their balances. Know Your Customer (KYC) verification became a bottleneck, and many were left wondering when — or if — they’d ever be able to access the tokens they’d mined for years.Then there was the price. When Pi first started trading on external platforms, the price spiked, hitting as high as $2.98 in late February. But the hype didn’t last. As early adopters started selling off their tokens and real-world use cases remained thin, the price slid hard. By early May 2025, it had dropped to around $0.58, wiping out more than 70% of its value.There’s also still no real utility. You can’t spend Pi on much (only in small, community-run markets and pilot programs). And while the team talks about building a full ecosystem of apps and services, it’s unclear how fast — or how seriously — that’s progressing.                  Why the crypto community grew skeptical              As the months turned into years, more and more red flags started popping up, and the community started asking hard questions.1. Still waiting on the mainnetPi launched in 2019, and for years, users kept hearing that the open mainnet was “just around the corner.” First there was the testnet. Then the “enclosed mainnet.” Then a roadmap update. The actual open network didn’t arrive until early 2025 — six years later. And by that time, a lot of early believers had started losing faith.2. All roads lead back to the core teamDespite the talk of decentralization, the reality is that the Pi Core Team has retained almost total control over the project. Every active mainnet node? Controlled by them. Most of the token supply? Still in their hands. That doesn’t sit well with crypto users who believe in distributed power and community-driven networks. Right now, Pi feels more like a private company than a decentralized protocol.3. Where’s the transparency?Another sticking point has been the lack of detail on how Pi actually works under the hood. The white paper is vague. There’s no clear breakdown of tokenomics, no timelines on when tokens unlock, no burn mechanics and no insight into supply control. Without that info, it’s hard for anyone to judge the health or future value of the project.4. Exchange listingsDespite years of hype, Pi still isn’t listed on major exchanges like Binance or Coinbase. It is tradable on some platforms like OKX and Bitget, but even there, things are shaky. Some users have reported trouble withdrawing their tokens, with exchanges blaming “traffic spikes” and other vague technical reasons. It all feels a bit fragile.For instance, one user on Bitget reported depositing 1,500 Pi tokens but found them inaccessible, with no clear timeline for resolution. On OKX, withdrawals were suspended for over 24 hours, with users asked to provide ID and email verification but given vague responses like “Your request will be completed within 24-48 hours.”By April 2025, users reported that MEXC, another exchange listing Pi, suspended Pi withdrawals, sparking concerns about liquidity and platform reliability. This was compounded by reports of large Pi transfers from MEXC, Gate.io and Bitget to OKX wallets, raising suspicions of coordinated price manipulation or exchange-level issues.5. Fake volume and fading hypeAt its peak in February 2025, Pi was trading at nearly $3 and generating billions in volume. Fast forward a few months, and that volume has dropped off a cliff — down to around $40 million. That kind of collapse raises serious questions: Was the demand real, or was it inflated by speculation, bots or internal market-making?6. Users trapped in a closed loopEven now, many users can’t actually use or withdraw their Pi tokens. Without access to real exchanges or spending options, they’re stuck in a kind of token limbo, watching a number go up in an app but with no way to convert that into anything useful.Did you know? While Pi Network claims over 70 million users, blockchain data indicates that only about 9.11 million wallets exist, with approximately 20,000 showing daily activity.                  Is Pi Network a scam or just a failed vision?              Not every crypto project that stumbles is a scam. Some are just ambitious ideas that don’t quite pan out. So, where does Pi Network fall?On the surface, Pi doesn’t fit the classic scam mold. There was no initial coin offering (ICO), no upfront investment required — just an app that lets you “mine” Pi by tapping your phone daily. That’s a low bar for entry, and it attracted millions.But dig a little deeper, and things get murkier. The whole system leans heavily on referrals, encouraging users to bring in more people to boost their mining rate. That kind of structure starts to resemble a multi-level marketing scheme more than a decentralized crypto project.Then there’s the monetization angle. The app is filled with ads, and users are required to complete KYC verification, handing over personal data. So, while you’re not paying money, you’re paying with your attention and information.Given these developments, critics such as Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, and Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, have publicly expressed skepticism regarding Pi Network’s legitimacy.Pi Network might not be a blatant fraud, but the combination of opaque operations, aggressive referral tactics and questionable monetization strategies certainly raises eyebrows.Did you know? Pi Network was officially launched on March 14, 2019 — Pi Day — symbolizing the mathematical constant π (3.14).                  Can Pi recover, or is it over?              Is there a path forward for Pi Network? Possibly, but it’s a steep climb.First, transparency is key. Open-sourcing the code would allow the community to verify what’s under the hood and build trust.Second, Pi needs real utility. Right now, holding Pi doesn’t offer much beyond the hope of future value. Integrating Pi into actual use cases — like payments or decentralized applications — would give the token purpose.Third, broader exchange listings are crucial. Currently, Pi is available on a limited number of exchanges, which hampers liquidity and price discovery. Major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase have yet to list Pi, citing concerns over transparency and regulatory compliance.Fourth, decentralization must be more than a buzzword. Currently, the Pi Core Team maintains significant control over the network, which contradicts the principles of decentralization. Implementing decentralized governance would distribute decision-making power and align with the ethos of blockchain technology.But even if all these boxes are checked, time is a factor. Since its mainnet launch in early 2025, Pi’s price has dropped significantly, and user engagement has waned. Rebuilding momentum is challenging.Without significant changes, the Pi Network risks fading into obscurity, remembered more for its unfulfilled promises than its achievements.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-pi-network-dead-what-really-went-wrong-behind-the-hype?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Source: Dune AnalyticsAnother factor is Solana’s tokenomics, which Sygnum said was “a comparable issue” to the criticism levelled at Ethereum over its mainnet’s stagnant transaction volumes due to it lowering the cost for its layer 2 networks.The company said Solana is leading Ethereum in market share for layer-1 fee generation, but “most of the fees are paid to validators and do not grow the value of the Solana token.”“In fact, when it comes to revenues, Ethereum still exceeds Solana 2- 2.5x,” Sygnum said.It argued that Solana’s tokenomics are “easier to modify” than Ethereum’s scaling strategy. Still, it said that Solana “does not appear inclined to drive more value to the token,” as its community shot down a proposal to cut the SOL’s inflation rate in March.Solana could gain with stable revenue focusSygnum noted that Solana, which some have hailed as an “Ethereum killer” that could challenge the network’s market share, could make some gains on the No. 2 blockchain.The company said Ethereum has the dominant market share in “use cases that are showing traction” with support from governments, regulators, and traditional finance — such as tokenization, stablecoins, and decentralized finance.However, it added that Solana had made progress in the amount of value locked on its decentralized finance protocols, and if it gains in “more stable revenue sources” such as tokenization and stablecoins, it could gain on Ethereum.Sygnum added that Solana still has a strong backing, even with the Ethereum Foundation reshuffling its priorities to the layer 1 and recognising “the need to adjust its go-to-market strategy.”However, that could give a sentiment tailwind to Ethereum as the blockchain’s “2-year-long underperformance vs Solana has been temporarily arrested” since the foundation’s pivot.Magazine: Ethereum is destroying the competition in the $16.1T TradFi tokenization race",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/solana-no-convincing-signs-besting-ethereum-memecoin-bias?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.Source: James Filan“This settlement, alongside the programmatic disassembly of the SEC’s crypto enforcement program, does a tremendous disservice to the investing public and undermines the court’s role in interpreting our securities laws,” she said.“In the meantime, the settlement joins a line of dismissals that collectively erode the credibility of our lawyers in court who are being asked to take legal positions today contrary to the ones taken just months ago.”Under the Trump administration, the SEC has slowly been walking back its hardline stance toward crypto firms forged under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s reign, dismissing a growing number of enforcement actions against crypto firms.At the same time, Crenshaw argues that if Judge Torres accepts the settlement, it would erase “the investor protections we already won” and leave a “regulatory vacuum,” until the crypto task force hammers out a regulatory framework.“The settlement is not in the best interests of the investors and markets that our agency is tasked with serving and protecting. It creates more questions than answers.”In August last year, a Judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in penalties after ruling the firm’s XRP (XRP) token was covered by securities laws only when sold to institutional investors.What’s next for the Ripple case? It’s not over yetWhile the SEC and Ripple have agreed to a settlement, it’s still not a done deal, according to ex-federal prosecutor James Filan, because there are several steps before the long-running legal saga can conclude.For a start, Judge Torres needs to provide an indicative ruling if she agrees to the settlement letter, Filan said in a May 8 analysis on X.Source: James FilanIf Torres provides an indicative ruling, the SEC and Ripple will ask the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for a limited remand back to Judge Torres, which, if granted, will result in another motion being filed for the agreed settlement, according to Filan.Related: Bitnomial drops SEC lawsuit ahead of XRP futures launch in the US“After the injunction is dissolved and the funds distributed, the SEC and Ripple will ask the Court of Appeals to dismiss the SEC’s appeal and Ripple’s cross-appeal.

2025-05-08T19:35:57.000Z,"Mashinsky’s 12-year sentence sets tone of enforcement in Trump era","The US federal court for the Southern District of New York has sentenced former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky to 12 years in prison for fraud. Mashinsky’s legal team sought a light sentence. They highlighted his spotless record before the Celsius incident, along with his military service and willingness to plead guilty. But US prosecutors were less inclined to leniency, suggesting on April 28 that the judge deliver a 20-year sentence for his actions.Betting markets predicted a light sentence ahead of the May 8 hearing. Polymarket showed only 11% odds for a 20-year sentence or higher.Source: PolymarketPresident Donald Trump began his second term with high-profile pardons of crypto executives, signalling that his administration may bring leniency to crypto fraudsters like Mashinsky. His sentencing today, however, suggests otherwise.Trump’s DOJ wants Mashinsky sentence to serve as a warningCrypto-related crimes have their limits, according to the current US Department of Justice. Jay Clayton, the Trump-nomianted US attorney leading the prosecution, said on April 28 that the suggested 20-year sentence serves as a “critical warning to other entrepreneurs, executives, and promoters in the cryptocurrency industry and in any future industry as-yet unconceived: that fraud will be punished severely, regardless of the technology or industry in which it occurs.”Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp quotes the prosecution’s argument that Mashinsky targeted retail investors. Source: Jameson LoppClayton argued that a strong sentence was warranted as the fraud targeted unsophisticated retail investors rather than institutional parties with protections and expertise. Mashinsky “preyed on ordinary individuals who relied on his promises of safety and financial security.” The Mashinsky defense team drew attention to Mashinsky’s character, highlighting his long career in business, devotion to family and service with the Israel Defense Forces. His lawyers also drew distinctions between Mashinsky’s case and that of Bankman-Fried, claiming, “There are no allegations — let alone any proof — that Alex misappropriated, embezzled or stole any customer assets or any Celsius money.”On May 5, Mashinsky’s legal team argued that these mitigating factors should warrant a sentence of no more than 366 days.“The government’s venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” his team said.Mashinsky’s lawyers called the suggested 20-year term a “death-in-prison sentence.”Mashinsky’s sentence follows high-profile Trump pardons for crypto execsTrump started his term with the pardon of Silk Road 2.0 founder Ross Ulbricht, whose acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) on his narcotics trading platform endeared him to the crypto community. The president also commuted the sentences of Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed, three BitMEX crypto exchange executives who pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act and failing to establish a proper Anti-Money Laundering program.Sam Mangel, a consultant to white-collar convicts who advised former Trump staffer Steve Bannon and Bankman-Fried, told Politico there has been a large spike in interest in presidential pardons. “Everybody that is in prison now is keenly aware of the environment, and it’s become a very hot topic within the low- and minimum-security inmate communities,” said Mangel.Related: US stablecoin bill loses democrats amid Trump corruption concernsHigh-profile crypto defendants seem to have taken notice, too. Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin advocate and libertarian activist, is facing federal tax evasion charges. In January, he released a video making an outright plea to Trump for a commutation. Ver claimed that he is the victim of lawfare and likened his persecution to Trump’s legal problems following the Jan. 6 scandal. Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former CEO of now-defunct exchange FTX, likened his court experience with Trump’s defamation lawsuit in an interview with The New York Sun on Feb. 18. He claimed his trial was politicized under the Biden administration and that he didn’t think there was “a very fair and balanced view or approach.” His parents also reportedly met with lawyers and people close to the Trump administration to explore the possibility of a presidential pardon. Trump’s commutation of the BitMEX executives has even led former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao to apply for clemency. On May 6, Zhao said that his lawyers had submitted an application and were awaiting a response. The current administration is still writing the rules of the road as regulators reshuffle personnel and priorities and new legal frameworks for crypto take shape. The picture is further muddled by Trump’s own crypto projects, which have raised concerns over corruption and conflicts of interest. Mashinsky’s sentence shows that, for the financial world, certain crimes will not go unpunished. Magazine: Adam Back says Bitcoin price cycle ’10x bigger’ but will still decisively break above $100K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/mashinksy-enforcement-sentence-court?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.March 2 Truth Social post announcing US crypto reserve.

The SEC has previously brought numerous charges against DEXs such as Uniswap for failing to register as securities exchanges. Firms should “not have to comply with inapt regulations, which, in many cases, were developed well before the technologies being tested existed and may be obviated by attributes of that technology,” Peirce said. Commissioner Peirce described the planned changes in a May 8 speech.

2025-05-08T17:00:00.000Z,"Are layer 2s good for Ethereum, or are they ‘extractive?’","Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees. “People in the Ethereum Foundation [the nonprofit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem] will tell you that, ‘Yes, we effed up by being too ivory tower.’ I have heard that multiple times,” said David Hoffman, an owner at Bankless, during a panel discussion at the Cornell Tech event in New York City on April 25. Hoffman, left, at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference. Source: Andrew SingerElsewhere, Hoffman has urged Ethereum to make a “strategic pivot,” noting that the crypto environment has changed in the last few years. Ethereum no longer has the “luxury of being a peace-time research project…. exploited by its competition.”L2s are reaping millions of dollars in transaction order fees (sometimes called sequencing fees), but none of these revenues are being passed on to Ethereum, according to James Beck, head of growth at ENS Labs and another speaker at the New York City conference. Beck told Cointelegraph:So, this cultural layer of podcasters and researchers are saying, ‘Well, the price of ETH has been dropping compared to these other tokens. What do we do to make Ethereum more powerful?’In short, Ethereum is a neutral verification layer, but the Ethereum mainnet is not being fairly compensated for the work that it is doing. Centralized for-profit L2s like Base, Optimism and Arbitrum are gathering the lucrative sequencing fees while enjoying the security and liveness guarantees of the Ethereum mainnet at relatively little economic cost.L2s soared after Dencun upgradeL2 rollups are a recent innovation; they only emerged in 2023. The idea was to reduce chain congestion and gas fees by moving transaction processing from the main blockchain (layer 1) to separate chains that sit atop the mainnet (L2s). But transaction processing is arguably the most profitable part of the revenue game, especially when users opt to pay priority fees to get their orders processed faster.Fee-sharing was rarely much of an issue before Ethereum’s March 2024 Dencun upgrade, which introduced blob transactions to help scale layer 2s. Blobs significantly reduced the cost for L2s to post data to Ethereum, allowing them to operate more profitably, CoinMetrics researcher analyst Tanay Ved told Cointelegraph this week. Since then, L2 user demand has soared, especially on Base, the L2 launched by Coinbase in August 2023 on the Ethereum mainnet. As Ved noted in an April 8 blog, Base has earned a total of ~$98 million in revenues from user-transaction fees (including base and priority fees), “while paying only ~$4.9M to the Ethereum base layer, resulting in a total estimated profit of $94M since the Dencun upgrade.” Ved added:This dynamic has led to many questioning whether Layer-2s are net positive for Ethereum, or whether they are ‘extractive.Base’s responseAsked about fees, a Base spokesperson told Cointelegraph, “Today, Base already pays Ethereum fees for every transaction on Base. All transactions are settled on Ethereum, and so far, Base has paid Ethereum more than $20 million in settlement fees since Base’s inception.” One can see these fees on Token Terminal under “cost of revenue,” the spokesperson added. “Overall, Base makes getting onchain more accessible with fast and cheap transactions and helps grow the Ethereum ecosystem by onboarding more users, builders, apps and assets, all of whom are transacting in ETH and driving demand,” said the spokesperson.Related: Institutions break up with Ethereum but keep ETH on the hookHowever, in many, if not most months, Base’s overall fees are roughly 10 times the amount paid to Ethereum for settling trades, according to examination of the referenced Base financial statement. In April, for instance, the most recent full month, Base reaped $3.7 million in fees, but only $305,000 was delivered to Ethereum as settlement fees — about 8% of total fees.Still, maybe things aren’t quite so dire. Even if fees are out of kilter now, the imbalance may not last, others caution. Ethereum hard forks like Pectra, which went live yesterday (May 7), and Fusaka, scheduled for late 2025, will increase blob throughput. “This means L2s will be able to post more blobs, potentially driving higher total blob fees to mainnet,” Ved told Cointelegraph. Ethereum is already consistently hitting the current blob target of three per block, as the chart below shows. “Pectra will raise this to six blobs per block — with a max of nine — creating room for increased fee capture as L2 activity scales,” added Ved.Average blobs per block and their total blob fees (USD) on Ethereum. Source: CoinMetricsAre “based rollups” the answer?Some Ethereum researchers, podcasters — and even L2s — have been leaning into “based rollups” as a more permanent way to fix the fee problem and provide better security in the bargain. Here, transaction ordering (i.e., sequencing) would be done on the mainnet, not on L2s.The sequencers used by Optimism, Arbitrum One, Base and others are more prone to attack or failure, given that they are centralized, with a single point of failure, some researchers say. Polygon’s Jarrod Ward writes:If a centralized sequencer goes down, the rollup effectively stops doing its job entirely. It stops handling transactions from users on the L2 and also stops sending batch data back to Ethereum.“Layer-2 sequencers have become dangerously centralized,” added Tom Ngo, executive lead at Metis — an Ethereum layer-2 blockchain. Last June’s $2.6-million hack of Ethereum layer-2 blockchain Linea drove home to Ngo and others the importance of decentralization and the perils of centralized sequencers. Related: ‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story’ is less about crypto and more about being humanSeveral based-rollup L2s have launched this past year. Taiko Alethia, the first and largest, went live in May 2024. A year later, it had $148.3 million in total value secured — ranking 14th on L2Beat’s list of L2s, though far behind leader Base’s $12.06 billion. Top Ethereum layer 2s ranked by total value secured. Source: L2BeatSpeedwise, Taiko was averaging a respectable 20.3 user operations per second (UOPS) on May 7, a far cry from Base’s 86.3 UOPS, but on par with Arbitrum One’s (21.6 UOPS) and significantly better than Optimism’s (10.3 UOPS).A tax on L2s?Another idea floated in the Ethereum community is imposing a sort of tax on L2s. But doing this could have some unintended consequences, according to Ved. It could make L2s less competitive. It also risks “leakage of activity to competing layer 1s outside the Ethereum ecosystem.” Activity that flows to Base today could flow instead to Solana or other L1s, Ved said.There could be philosophical issues, too, were Ethereum to lay a surcharge on its L2s. Ved noted:A tax could be seen as contrary to Ethereum’s ethos of decentralization, which would opt for market-driven forces rather than enforcing a tax. Generally speaking, the Ethereum Foundation seems to be prioritizing long-term growth over short-term revenue, Ved explained. Proposals like EIP-7762, though, which raises the minimum blob base fee to speed up price discovery during demand surges, could drive more fee income to Ethereum mainnet, having an effect like a tax. Social pressure?According to ENS Labs’ Beck, it may take some social pressure to get the leading centralized L2s to voluntarily give up their sequencing fees. Other L2s like Linea may need to step in and say to centralized L2s something along the lines of: “Look, you guys have these risks inherent in a more centralized design, and here’s the chance to bake [the order processing] into Ethereum, which is more decentralized.”Along these lines, ENS took part in a three-day workshop in the UK in January with leading researchers and developers from entities like Linea, Status, OpenZeppelin, Titan, Spire Labs and the Ethereum Foundation. The immediate task was how to create scalable, decentralized infrastructure for ENS Labs’ Namechain, but also to bring together various Ethereum ecosystem teams to collaboratively solve L2 interoperability challenges with based rollups. It’s not always easy to get things done in a flat (non-hierarchical), multi-voice entity like Ethereum, Beck acknowledges. “Ethereum is a decentralized ecosystem. You can’t get everyone on the same page all at once.” But a collaboration like the recent one that took place in the UK is a start. Cornell Tech conference panelist Hoffman expressed some confidence that Ethereum could pivot and “turn the layer 1 into a rollup” with processing speeds comparable to today’s L2s. As noted, Hoffman has criticized the Ethereum Foundation for being too insular and academic, but he sees signs that things may be changing now, writing recently:The appointment of co-executive directors Tomasz Stańczak and Hsiao-Wei Wang marks a new era of accountability, direction, and internal cohesion.“I’m feeling optimistic,” added Beck. “Ethereum still has the most assets locked for DeFi; the most stablecoins are on Ethereum. BlackRock has a fund that’s settling on Ethereum.” Put another way, Ethereum is still well-positioned to provide the infrastructure for the “network of networks” — i.e., the smoothly interacting network of multitudinous private and public blockchains that many hope will be the technology’s future.Magazine: 12 minutes of nail-biting tension when Ethereum’s Pectra fork goes live",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/layer-2s-good-for-ethereum-or-extractive?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-08T15:00:00.000Z,"User experience could be crypto’s superpower—or its kryptonite","Opinion by Jonathan Farnell, CEO of FreedxIt’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.Take complexity. A 2024 Chainalysis report pointed out that 43% of would-be crypto users shy away from the technical tangle of private keys and gas fees. Have you ever lost a seed phrase? You’re not alone. More than $200 billion in crypto has been lost forever because of it. That’s not just a statistic — it’s a gut punch for someone who thought they’d unlocked the future of finance. Streamlining this chaos could fling open the doors to 5 billion internet users, pushing crypto’s $2.91 trillion market cap, as reported by Cointelegraph, into the stratosphere — potentially reaching $4 trillion in the second quarter of 2025.From headaches to high fivesMany decentralized finance (DeFi) apps currently feel like a hacker’s playground — all data and API integrations, but nothing intuitive that speaks to an ordinary person. Simply swapping cryptic jargon for plain English would be a solid start. Consider swapping “gas fees” to “transaction costs.” Those 12-word seed phrases send users into panic mode, but a familiar gear icon for settings could put users’ minds at ease. Suddenly, managing a wallet isn’t a high-stakes game anymore. It’s just another tool.This isn’t about dazzling users with blockchain’s inner workings. Most people don’t care about the tech under the hood, just like they don’t ask whether their favorite app runs on AWS or Google Cloud. Blockchain isn’t a shiny new internet. It’s infrastructure — powerful, but invisible, when done right. Users want solutions — quick payments, secure savings, and easy access. Streamlined experiences could draw in everyday folks — retirees sending cash to grandkids, small business owners managing cash flow — expanding cryptocurrency’s reach. It’s about turning a daunting process into something approachable, paving the way for broader economic effect. Build confidence through clarityTrust is another sticking point. Transactions can feel uncertain, with phishing scams and tales of lost savings heightening unease. Vague error messages like “transaction failed” frustrate users, but specific feedback — “insufficient funds, please top up your balance” — offers reassurance. Guides on staying secure and pre-set options to avoid errors can make the system feel reliable, not reckless. When technology fades into the background, confidence takes center stage.Design quality shapes perceptions, too. Unpolished interfaces raise doubts about credibility, especially for those accustomed to refined digital tools. Clean, professional layouts signal trustworthiness, while clear benefits — faster payments and control over data — make the case compelling. This shift could reposition cryptocurrency as a practical alternative, not a gamble. It’s not about buzzwords like “trustlessness” or “censorship resistance.” Most users don’t lose sleep over those ideals. They care about quality, ease, and value, not the blockchain badge.Adoption depends on usabilityCryptocurrency could reshape how people trade, save, and connect — growing from 617 million users to billions. Success hinges on accessibility. Platforms that prioritize straightforward design already see more engagement and trust, driving market potential into the trillions, rivaling traditional finance. Poor usability, though, risks leaving this vision unrealized. The promise of self-custody or transparency won’t lure the masses if the experience feels like a chore.Recent: Stop making crypto complexChallenges like regulation and old habits persist, but confusing experiences remain the most significant barrier, keeping everyday users at arm’s length. Blockchain’s promise is real, yet its breakthrough relies on design that feels human and dependable. People don’t adopt tools because they’re built on cutting-edge tech. They adopt tools because they solve real problems — cheaply, simply, and reliably. Cryptocurrency stands ready to expand — it needs to meet people where they are, not where the tech wants them to be.Focus on benefits, not features, and the market could soar. Consider a freelancer who is paid instantly across borders or a parent gifting digital cash without a hitch. That’s what hooks users — not the mechanics of account abstraction or zero-knowledge proofs. Platforms that nail this could turn crypto into a daily staple, boosting adoption and market value. Exchanges leading the charge with intuitive design already prove it: Usability drives growth. Cryptocurrency’s future isn’t about preaching blockchain’s brilliance — it’s about making it so seamless no one even notices it’s there.Opinion by Jonathan Farnell, CEO of Freedx.

The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. “As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.Related: Bitcoin mining — Institutions boost investments amid favorable US climateHut 8 is scaling up operationsGenoot said the financial results follow large-scale investments by Hut 8, including upgrading the firm’s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) fleet and launching the majority-owned subsidiary of Hut 8, American Bitcoin.American Bitcoin was announced at the end of March, with several members of the US President Donald Trump’s family as partners. According to the announcement, the new venture “aims to become the world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve.”Early April reports also revealed that American Bitcoin has plans to raise additional capital, including through an initial public offering. In today’s quarterly earnings announcement, Genoot stated:“The streamlined capital allocation framework made possible by the American Bitcoin launch reinforces our ability to scale lower-cost-of-capital businesses such as high-performance computing.“Related: Browser-based crypto mining in 2025: Still viable or virtually dead?Future expansion plansTalking about future plans, Hut 8’s CEO noted that the company is pushing ahead with its plans for 2025. Those include the energization of the Vega data center, the initial sitework at the River Bend data center and the development of the firm’s utility-scale power portfolio. Genoot added:“We believe these initiatives will further accelerate our ability to generate resilient near-term cash flows while building toward enduring leadership across next-generation digital infrastructure markets.”Hut 8 stock is trading at $12.66 after seeing a 2.2% increase on the trading day on the Nasdaq.

2025-05-08T13:30:00.000Z,"Beyond digital gold, Bitcoin’s next chapter is about to be unlocked — Dan Held","Bitcoin (BTC) has long been branded as “digital gold,” a store of value for believers in scarcity, decentralization and self-sovereignty. As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.Political shiftsWith US President Donald Trump openly backing Bitcoin — and reportedly owning it himself — Held said he sees a regulatory and reputational change. “We have the most open administration toward Bitcoin in the United States,” he said. “It kind of feels weird... Normally in the press, Bitcoin mining is destroying the environment. It’s being used by money launderers… And instead, you've got the president encouraging Bitcoin.”Held traced Bitcoin’s unlikely rise through moments of adversity, from China’s mining crackdowns to the Biden administration’s strict approach to crypto banking. Yet despite those challenges, roughly 25% of Americans now own Bitcoin, he said.DeFi on BitcoinWhat comes next may push the asset into a new phase. Held and Jenkinson are proponents of building decentralized finance (DeFi) tools on top of Bitcoin, functionalities traditionally associated with blockchains like Ethereum or Solana.“If we could bring [DeFi] back to Bitcoin, then Bitcoin could utilize not just spot speculation... but these other speculative games then would allow bitcoin to grow even faster.” That includes borrowing, lending, and staking, all mechanisms that allow users to interact with Bitcoin beyond simple holding or trading.Related: How crypto payments can become the new ‘tap-and-go’ — Pulsar co-founderJenkinson echoed the potential, highlighting a shift in attitude: “If you can use [Bitcoin] and bring DeFi to it, you’re basically allowing people to use digital gold as the underlying asset... It’s a very hard thing to do, because most hardcore Bitcoin maximalists don’t want people to give up their Bitcoin for something else.”That tension between so-called “Bitcoin puritans” and more moderate voices is not new, Held noted. He recounted the 2017 Bitcoin Cash fork, describing it as “a civil war... brother against brother.” But unlike that contentious split, today’s evolution is happening without rewriting Bitcoin’s base rules. “No one’s proposing to change the rules of Bitcoin,” Held said. “This is innovation built on top.”To hear the full conversation on The Clear Crypto Podcast,  listen to the full episode on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-08T13:15:00.000Z,"Browser-based crypto mining in 2025: Still viable or virtually dead?","Key takeawaysAfter the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy lifting.The idea blew up in the late 2010s with tools like Coinhive, which let website owners mine Monero (XMR) using JavaScript. At first, it seemed like a clever alternative to ads; visitors donated a bit of unused CPU power, and websites earned crypto. But then came cryptojacking. Sites began running these scripts without user permission, draining resources and slowing down devices. In 2019, Coinhive shut down, citing shrinking returns and mounting scrutiny.Now, in 2025, browser crypto mining is making a low-key comeback. New tools, new rules and a fresh generation of crypto users are reviving the concept. But is it worth it or just a relic of crypto’s scrappier past?Let’s break down where things stand today.Did you know? In 2018, Coinhive was responsible for approximately 1.18% of all Monero blocks mined.What’s the status of browser-based crypto mining in 2025?Active platformsThe biggest name in browser crypto mining today is CryptoTab Browser. It’s a Chromium-based browser with a built-in mining feature that lets users passively earn Bitcoin (BTC). It also offers tools like Cloud Boost to multiply earnings and a mining pool for better efficiency.Meanwhile, mobile-first platforms like Pi Network and YouHolder cater to users who want to mine via smartphones — or at least simulate the process while collecting rewards. These platforms blur the line between real mining and gamified engagement, but they’ve drawn millions of users, especially in emerging markets.Supported coinsMonero is still popular for browser mining; its RandomX algorithm is CPU-optimized and ASIC-resistant, which means regular computers can handle it. CryptoTab, meanwhile, focuses on Bitcoin, though it uses a form of pooled hash power to make it viable through a browser interface, though its efficiency and profitability are often debated due to Bitcoin’s high mining difficulty and reliance on specialized hardware.Who is mining crypto via browsers?The browser mining audience today is surprisingly broad:Casual users: People who like the idea of passive income without much commitment.Newcomers to crypto: Those testing the waters without risking capital.Crypto-curious users: Folks who want to earn something on the side while they browse.Browser mining won’t make you rich — let’s be clear. But it does lower the barrier to entry, especially for users in lower-income regions or without access to advanced hardware.Did you know? Some browser-based mining scripts have been designed to continue operating even after a user closes the browser tab by opening hidden windows that persist in the background.Is browser mining profitable in 2025?Short answer: not really. It’s more about novelty or experimentation than making serious money.Mining in a browser might get you a few cents’ worth of crypto per day, but only if you leave your computer running non-stop. And that leads to two problems: electricity costs and hardware stress. Over time, those costs can far outweigh the value of the crypto you earn.For example, in the US, the average residential electricity rate is about $0.15 per kilowatt-hour. Leaving a mid-range laptop mining all day could consume roughly 0.1–0.2 kWh per hour — that’s over $10 per month in electricity for maybe a dollar or two in mined crypto. And you’re putting constant load on your CPU.Compared to other methodsBrowser mining can’t hold a candle to GPU or ASIC setups. A modern ASIC miner like the Antminer S19 Pro churns out up to 110 terahashes per second (TH/s) — that’s several orders of magnitude higher than what a browser script can deliver.Cloud mining, on the other hand, lets users rent mining power from remote farms. It’s more efficient and hands-off but also comes with subscription fees and mixed reputations. At least with browser mining, you’re only risking your own device and electricity bill.Did you know? In 2025, some cloud mining platforms have integrated artificial intelligence to optimize mining operations, enhancing efficiency and profitability for users without requiring direct hardware management.Environmental footprintWhile it consumes less power than an ASIC farm, browser mining still adds up. Thousands of users mining inefficiently on personal devices generate a surprisingly high cumulative power draw.That’s why most efforts to make crypto mining greener — like using renewable energy or optimizing ASIC efficiency — haven’t trickled down to the browser level. If you’re eco-conscious, browser mining isn’t the cleanest option out there.What’s next for browser crypto mining?Tech upgradesWebAssembly (Wasm) has boosted what browsers can do, including mining. It allows faster, more efficient script execution, meaning browsers can now run lightweight mining scripts without wrecking user experience.Platforms like CryptoTab have also improved their UX, integrating features like built-in VPNs and ad blockers. This is an effort to make mining feel more like a bonus and less like a burden.Some decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, such as Ore, are even experimenting with combining browser mining and decentralized finance. It’s the early days, but the potential is there to let users contribute computing power and earn rewards while interacting with decentralized applicatioins (DApps) — all within a browser tab.Market and regulationIn 2025, global crypto adoption has been growing, but so is regulatory scrutiny. In the US, the SEC is pushing for clearer guidance, which may eventually affect how browser-based mining tools are classified or taxed.Elsewhere, countries like Kuwait have cracked down on mining altogether, citing energy shortages. Local regulations will play a huge role in determining where and how browser crypto mining can survive.Alternative use casesMining isn’t the only game in town. Brave browser, for example, lets users earn Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) just by viewing ads, which can be used within the Brave ecosystem or exchanged. It’s not mining, technically, but it’s another way to earn crypto passively through browsing.In the DeFi world, there’s potential to connect browser mining with yield farming or liquidity mining. Imagine earning a trickle of tokens just by keeping your browser open and interacting with onchain applications. It’s early, but real experiments are underway.Here’s an example of how you can use BAT earned from viewing ads and channel them into DeFi for additional returns:You transfer your earned BAT to a decentralized exchange (DEX) like Uniswap, a leading DeFi platform for liquidity mining.On Uniswap, you pair your BAT with another token — e.g., Ether (ETH) or a stablecoin like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — to provide liquidity to a BAT/ETH or BAT/USDT pool. This involves depositing equal values of both tokens into the pool, receiving LP (liquidity provider) tokens in return.You stake these LP tokens in Uniswap’s liquidity mining program (or a similar protocol like SushiSwap) to earn rewards, which may include a share of trading fees (typically 0.3% per trade) and potentially additional UNI (UNI) or other governance tokens as incentives.To maximize returns, you could take your LP tokens and stake them on another DeFi platform, like Yearn.finance, which algorithmically seeks the highest yield opportunities across protocols. For example, Yearn.finance might stake your Uniswap LP tokens in a pool offering 10%-20% APY, compounding your returns.Alternatively, you could use a yield aggregator like Yield Yak on Solana, which auto-compounds rewards to boost earnings.However, be aware that in liquidity mining, price fluctuations between paired tokens (e.g., BAT/ETH) can lead to losses compared to holding the tokens outright. Also, the value of earned tokens (BAT, UNI, etc.) and DeFi rewards can fluctuate (market volatility), impacting overall returns.Is browser-based crypto mining worth it?So, is browser mining dead in 2025? Not quite, but it’s no gold rush either.It’s a fringe activity, appealing to newcomers, tinkerers and anyone curious about crypto’s more obscure corners. With better tech and clearer ethics than in the Coinhive days, it’s no longer a threat — just a slow, modest way to dip your toes in.If your goal is to understand crypto without buying in, browser mining still has a role to play.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-browser-based-cryptocurrency-mining-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The update is designed to improve user onboarding by offering interactive guidance and simplifying asset management across blockchains.The AI agent, named Mia (short for Movement in Action), is powered by Near.AI — an open-source AI model platform with crosschain capabilities. Integrated into the Sweat wallet, Mia helps users to bridge, swap and manage their crypto rewards without needing deep crypto knowledge..Sweat is rolling out support for Base, Ethereum, Arbitrum and BNB Chain. Within the app, users can now bridge assets and swap native tokens across networks, with the option to pay gas fees in Sweat (SWEAT) tokens.Sweat co-founder Oleg Fomenko told Cointelegraph: “We’ve shifted to championing the Movement Economy — an expansive, multichain ecosystem where movement is not only rewarded but also unlocks access to financial tools, health experiences and self-sovereign identity.”Mia in Sweat wallet Source: swe.atRelated: Near’s crosschain AI Assistant will soon book flights and order takeout for youPersonalized AI agents aim for a simpler interfaceMove-to-Earn is an emerging model that rewards users for physical activity by combining movement with technology. Apps like StepN, Plena and Sweat are now exploring ways to integrate AI to enhance their platforms. StepN, for example, employs AI to improve anti-cheating mechanisms, while Sweat focuses on using AI to streamline the user experience and enable multichain decentralized finance (DeFi) functionality.Sweat uses the move-to-earn model, rewarding users for every 1,000 steps taken. Users can exchange their token rewards for products, donate them, or convert them into a currency of their choice.Fomenko told Cointelegraph that Mia is more like “a helpful friend” than a technical dashboard. It focuses on “guiding users through tracking how steps convert into Sweat tokens, earning staking rewards, or performing onchain actions like swapping or bridging tokens.”According to Sweat, the wallet currently has 20 million users and over 19 million tokenholders. Mia will also personalize in-app recommendations based on each user’s behavior and preferences, including surfacing relevant offers, setting reminders, or explaining new wallet features.Privacy and security remain prioritiesAs AI-driven tools become more integrated with crypto wallets, concerns around data privacy and misuse have grown. Fomenko told Cointelegraph that the risks are addressed through “a combination of GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation]-compliant data handling practices, secure anonymization protocols and frequent external audits”.“By aligning with the highest privacy standards and prioritizing user sovereignty, Sweat ensures that AI serves as a helpful, secure, and trustworthy assistant in the Web3 journey,” Fomenko added.However, as AI agents scale, the risk of AI-driven phishing attacks increases, with bots sending personalized messages that closely mimic legitimate communications. To address these concerns, Fomenko said, “Mia operates transparently, providing clear, explainable prompts where users remain in control — they can accept, reject, or override suggestions at any time.”Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/sweat-wallet-launches-ai-agent-mia-crosschain-defi?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-08T12:00:00.000Z,"What is VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE) and how does it work?","What is ​VanEck's Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE)              VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE) exposes investors to companies driving blockchain adoption across multiple industries. The fund is scheduled to begin trading on May 14, 2025, following its inception on May 13, 2025.As the global economy shifts to a digital core, NODE offers active equity investment in real-world companies shaping that future. This ETF is actively managed, meaning a portfolio manager and not just an algorithm, selects the included stocks.The ETF may allocate up to 25% of its assets to crypto-linked exchange-traded products (ETPs) via a Cayman Islands subsidiary, providing indirect exposure to digital assets while adhering to US tax regulations. With a management fee of 0.69%, $NODE offers a diversified approach to participating in the evolving digital asset economy without direct cryptocurrency investments.                  How VanEck’s $NODE ETF builds its portfolio              VanEck’s $NODE ETF is designed to expose investors to companies at the forefront of blockchain and digital asset innovation. The ETF plans to hold between 30 and 60 stocks selected from over 130 publicly traded enterprises integral to the digital asset ecosystem.These stocks may span across the following sectors:Data centers: Infrastructure hubs that deliver the computational power necessary for blockchain networks. Cryptocurrency exchanges: These platforms, like Coinbase, facilitate the trading and exchange of digital assets.Miners: Organizations that verify Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. Crypto-holding companies: Publicly listed businesses that include Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as part of their treasury.Traditional financial institutions: Established banks and financial service providers incorporating blockchain solutions into their offerings.Consumer and gaming enterprises: Enterprises adopting blockchain technology in consumer applications and gaming platforms.Asset managers: Professionals and firms developing and overseeing investment vehicles tied to digital asset markets.Energy infrastructure providers: Businesses offering energy solutions tailored to support blockchain and crypto mining operations.Semiconductor and hardware firms: Companies such as Nvidia that design and manufacture chips and specialized mining equipment.To further diversify its portfolio, $NODE may allocate up to 25% of its assets to cryptocurrency ETPs, providing indirect exposure to digital assets. This allocation is managed through a Cayman Islands subsidiary, allowing the ETF to navigate US tax regulations effectively. VanEck employs a rigorous selection process for its holdings, combining fundamental analysis, market trend assessment, strategic positioning and valuation metrics to identify companies leading the digital transformation. According to a Jan. 15 filing with US regulators regarding the proposed ETF, at least 80% of its investments could be allocated to \""digital transformation companies\"" and digital asset instruments.Did you know? Crypto ETFs let you invest in digital assets like Bitcoin or blockchain stocks without setting up a crypto wallet. They are traded on traditional exchanges and offer regulated exposure to crypto markets, making them accessible to mainstream investors and institutions.                  How VanEck’s $NODE ETF uses blockchain and Bitcoin cycle metrics to optimize investment              VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE) offers a unique approach to blockchain investment. It focuses on companies leveraging blockchain for real-world applications, rather than tracking the price of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH). Each company in the $NODE portfolio has either blockchain central to its business model or future strategy. VanEck evaluates firms based on their tangible progress and innovation. Companies in the ETF’s portfolio may include sectors like fintech, supply chain, gaming and digital identity.To manage market volatility, VanEck utilizes Bitcoin cycle indicators — metrics based on historical BTC price patterns — to adjust the ETF’s risk exposure dynamically. This approach helps optimize performance by aligning the portfolio with broader market sentiment and crypto-economic cycles.By investing in $NODE, investors gain exposure to the expanding influence of blockchain beyond speculative assets. This helps investors capture the long-term growth potential of real-world blockchain integration across industries. The ETF reflects a forward-looking strategy reflecting how blockchain transforms the global economy.Did you know? Canada launched the world’s first spot Bitcoin ETF – Purpose Bitcoin ETF (BTCC) – in February 2021. It beat the US to market and sparked a wave of regulated crypto investment products globally.                  Difference between $NODE and general equity ETFs              VanEck’s $NODE ETF stands apart from general equity ETFs in strategy and focus. Unlike broad-market funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100, $NODE invests exclusively in companies adopting and building blockchain technology.While general equity ETFs typically use passive strategies, $NODE is actively managed. VanEck’s fund managers handpick portfolio companies based on their real-world contributions to the blockchain economy. A management fee supports this hands-on approach, allowing the ETF to stay aligned with the fast-changing blockchain landscape.$NODE does not hold Bitcoin or Ether. Instead, it uses Bitcoin cycle signals — like regular “halving” events that cut new supply and long-term price trends — to decide when to take more or less risk in its investments. This helps VanEck adjust the fund as the crypto market changes, which can affect how much money flows into blockchain projects, how many people start using them and overall market sentiment.By focusing on blockchain’s real-world business use rather than cryptocurrency speculation, $NODE offers investors a way to participate in the digital transformation of industries worldwide. It’s a future-facing alternative to general equity ETF models.The following table illustrates the difference between $NODE and general equity ETFs:                  How to buy $NODE              To buy VanEck’s Onchain Economy ETF ($NODE), investors need a brokerage account that provides them access to the Cboe BZX Exchange, where the ETF is listed. Once you have set up and funded the account, search for the ticker symbol “NODE.” Review the ETF’s details, including its management fee and investment strategy, before placing a buy order. $NODE trades during regular market hours like any standard stock or ETF. As with any investment, you should understand the fund’s objectives, holdings and risks beforehand to ensure it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.Did you know? In January 2024, the US SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity. This marked a significant regulatory milestone and fueled billions in inflows within weeks.                  $NODE: Institutional interest and key risks amid regulatory shifts              VanEck’s launch of the $NODE ETF comes amid rising institutional interest in crypto-linked investments and a more supportive regulatory backdrop. Still, the fund carries unique risks tied to the volatile crypto ecosystem.The launch aligns with positive regulatory developments, such as the proposed US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and potential stablecoin legislation, signaling stronger institutional engagement. $NODE aims to capture surging demand for crypto-equity exposure. A March 2025 survey showed that 68% of financial advisers now seek such options for their clients.Macro trends are also favorable: Bitcoin’s market dominance rose to 62.2% in Q1 2025, driven by institutional preference for regulated vehicles. Public companies collectively added 100,000 BTC to their treasuries, underscoring corporate confidence in Bitcoin. VanEck’s bullish outlook targets – $180,000 BTC and $520 Solana (SOL) by year-end — further reflect sector momentum.However, $NODE is not immune to crypto-sector risks. While it doesn’t hold cryptocurrencies directly, its portfolio is still exposed to market volatility, Bitcoin price swings and potential tech stock corrections. Regulatory setbacks may also affect the broader blockchain industry. Additionally, its derivatives strategy, managed through a Cayman subsidiary, introduces counterparty and liquidity risks.Investors should weigh these factors carefully, balancing the fund’s compliance-driven structure and VanEck’s asset management reputation against these sector-specific vulnerabilities.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-vanecks-onchain-economy-etf-node-and-how-does-it-work?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

This results in the advantages of account abstraction being accessible without creating new dedicated onchain addresses, rendering the transition of existing addresses possible.Another wallet that launched new features was Trust Wallet, allowing users to pay gas (transaction fees) in tokens such as stablecoins instead of Ether (ETH). The new wallets are also programmable and still ensure self-custody.Source: Trust WalletRelated: AI and account abstraction keys to mass Web3 adoption: X Spaces recap with Plena FinanceAmbire’s take on the updateAccording to an Ambire announcement shared with Cointelegraph, key features users can now enjoy without switching accounts include a crosschain by default architecture, with one dashboard showing balances on all chains. One wallet can be used across all blockchains, gas fees are abstracted and the system uses a decentralized finance (DeFi) aggregator Li.Fi for its swap and bridging needs.The company also promises transaction simulation across all supported chains, scam application detection and minimal token approvals. This statement follows some developers raising concerns that EIP-7702 provided a new avenue for phishing campaigns to empty entire wallets at once.Ambire also claimed that it does not rely on third-party services, allowing for better privacy features and higher reliability (no third party whose outage will result in a wallet outage). The firm also said that the new accounts are more accessible to AI agents:“Account programmability enables AI agents to act upon your account in the future to enhance your portfolio yield, save your DeFi positions, claim airdrops automatically and more.”Georgiev claimed that Ambire’s offering is the first on the market since Trust Wallet announced that it will be “live soon.” Ambire’s updated system was deployed minutes after the update during a live X conference.Related: How smart accounts and account abstraction can unlock Ethereum’s full utilityTrust Wallet’s new systemsTrust Wallet’s announcement describes the upgrade as the biggest since Ethereum’s full transition to proof-of-stake in the “merge” event.

The new wallet will also support sponsored transactions where third parties can cover gas fees to onboard new users and automated actions such as subscriptions, dollar-cost averaging and more.All those features will become available to existing users without re-creating new accounts with new seed phrases.

2025-05-08T08:01:00.000Z,"Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC? Here’s what you need to know","Is your gaming PC capable of mining crypto?              As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC?The short answer: Yes, but it won’t be worth it. The long answer: Understanding Bitcoin miningMining is the process that adds new BTC to circulation. More importantly, it’s how the Bitcoin network stays secure and functions without a central authority. Every time someone sends or receives Bitcoin, miners verify and record that transaction.This is all powered by proof-of-work (PoW), a consensus mechanism where miners race to encode transactions in a format that is acceptable to the network. It’s essentially just a massive guessing game, where miners try different inputs until one generates a hash with enough leading zeroes to meet the network’s current difficulty target.For example, a valid Bitcoin block might start with something like 00000000000000000000956e9ff76455.... The first miner to hit that valid hash wins the reward: currently 3.125 BTC, plus transaction fees.The issue is, to generate that many leading zeroes in 2025, you’re looking at around 10³¹ hash attempts on average to produce a valid hash.As you can imagine, that takes a lot of power.Did you know? The energy used to mine a single Bitcoin block today could power an average US household for over 10 years. That’s the cost of making sure the network stays decentralized and tamper-proof.                  From CPUs to ASICs: How mining hardware evolved              It didn’t use to be this hard to mine Bitcoin. As more miners joined the network and the total computing power surged, the protocol automatically ramped up the difficulty. That’s by design. Bitcoin adjusts to keep block times steady at around 10 minutes, no matter how much horsepower is thrown at it.Back in 2009, Bitcoin mining for beginners meant using a regular laptop CPU. Then came the rise of GPUs — graphics cards originally built for gaming — which dramatically improved mining performance.But then came ASICs, application-specific integrated circuits, designed solely to mine Bitcoin. These machines are vastly more powerful and energy-efficient than any GPU. By 2015, they had effectively taken over the mining scene.Fast forward to 2025: ASICs still reign supreme. If you’re wondering about the best setup for mining Bitcoin on PC, know that ASIC vs. GPU mining isn’t a fair fight anymore. That doesn’t mean your gaming rig is useless, but it does mean you’ll want to consider alternative strategies.Did you know? After Sept. 30, 2025, 4GB GPUs will no longer work due to DAG size limits.                   Gaming PCs vs. ASIC miners              Bitcoin mining with a gaming PC, even with a high-end GPU like the RTX 4090, is inefficient and unlikely to be profitable due to low performance, high energy costs and hardware wear-and-tear compared to ASIC miners.Performance: Can your GPU keep up?Let’s say you’re using an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 — top of the line. Sounds heavy-duty, right?Not for Bitcoin GPU mining.That card might do well on other algorithms like Ethash (used in Ethereum Classic), but when it comes to Bitcoin’s SHA-256, it barely scratches the surface. Even the mighty RTX 4090 gets crushed by ASICs. A high-end ASIC like the Antminer S21 Pro pumps out 200 terahashes per second (TH/s) — that’s trillions of hashes per second, compared to maybe a few hundred megahashes per second from a GPU. That’s a millionfold difference.Efficiency: The electricity bill tells the real storyLet’s talk about power. A GPU like the 4090 pulls around 450 watts. But the hashing performance it delivers is minuscule compared to the watts consumed. ASICs, by contrast, draw more power (e.g., 3,500 watts) but deliver far better output — roughly 17.5 joules per terahash.In short, even if you’re mining Bitcoin on a gaming PC 24/7, the energy cost per dollar earned is painful. Is Bitcoin mining profitable with a gaming PC? Not really. Especially when you factor in cooling, hardware strain and your local energy prices.Economics: Does it make any sense?Even with low electricity rates, the ROI on mining Bitcoin from home with a gaming computer is near zero — if not outright negative. Solo mining? Forget it. The chances of hitting a block are microscopic. Pool mining? Your contribution is so small compared to ASIC farms that the payouts will be negligible.And then there’s the wear and tear. GPUs weren’t designed to run at full capacity around the clock. Long-term mining can shorten their lifespan and may void warranties.Did you know? WhatToMine is a useful site that shows what coins are most profitable to mine with your exact setup. Just plug in your GPU, and it does the rest.                  Alternative cryptocurrencies for gaming PCs              If Bitcoin mining on PC feels like bringing a Nerf gun to a tank fight, don’t lose hope. There are still coins designed to be mined with GPUs in 2025 — and some even reward users fairly for it.Let’s take a look at such cryptocurrencies:Ethereum Classic (ETC): GPU-friendly legacy chainStill using the Ethash algorithm, Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a solid option for GPU miners. Blocks are mined every 13 seconds with a 3.2 ETC reward. Ravencoin (RVN): Built for the peopleRavencoin uses KAWPOW, an algorithm specifically designed to resist ASIC domination. It’s friendly to GPU miners and offers quick one-minute blocks with 2,500 Ravencoin (RVN) rewards. Mining altcoins with GPU setups is still very viable here.Monero (XMR): Privacy-first and CPU/GPU accessibleMonero relies on the RandomX algorithm, making it accessible to both CPU and GPU miners. You won’t get rich, but it’s a way to earn passively, especially if you’ve got cheap electricity and want passive income from mining.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/can-you-mine-bitcoin-with-a-gaming-pc?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

It contained crypto-related information that could help blockchain analysts trace the group’s illicit financial flows.  Ransomware is a type of malware used by malicious actors. It locks its target’s files or computer systems, making them inaccessible. The attackers typically demand a ransom payment, often in digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), in exchange for a decryption key to unlock the files.LockBit is one of the most notorious crypto ransomware groups. In February 2024, 10 countries launched a joint operation to disrupt the group, saying that the organization had caused billions in damages to key infrastructure. Source: ReyXBFNo Bitcoin private keys leakedWhile almost 60,000 Bitcoin wallets were leaked, no private keys were included. One X user shared a conversation with a LockBit operator, confirming the breach. However, the LockBit person said no private keys or data were lost. Despite this, analysts at Bleeping Computer said the database contained 20 tables, including a “builds” table. This included individual ransomware builds created by the organization’s affiliates. The data also identified some of the target companies for the builds. In addition, the leaked database also included a “chats” table. This table contained over 4,400 negotiation messages between victims and the ransomware organization. Related: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: ChainalysisLockBit hack tied to Everest ransomware breachIt’s unclear who was behind the breach and how they got into LockBit’s operations, but Bleeping Computer analysts said the message used in the Everest ransomware site breach matched the one used in LockBit. The analysts suggested that there may be a link between the two incidents. The breach highlighted the role that crypto plays in the ransomware economy. Each victim is usually assigned an address to pay their ransom, allowing the affiliates to monitor payments while attempting to obscure ties to their main wallets. The exposure of the addresses allows law enforcement and blockchain investigators to track patterns and potentially link past ransom payments to known wallets. Magazine: Adam Back says Bitcoin price cycle ’10x bigger’ but will still decisively break above $100K",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/lockbit-ransomware-breach-bitcoin-addresses-leaked?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-07T21:54:09.000Z,"Robinhood plans blockchain for US asset trading in Europe — Report","Brokerage fintech Robinhood is reportedly developing a blockchain network that will enable retail investors in Europe to trade US securities.According to a May 7 Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, the move seeks to expand the company's local presence by offering trading of tokenized securities, such as stocks. Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.Tokenizing securities instead of providing direct exposure can offer several advantages: reduced costs by eliminating traditional financial infrastructure, enhanced accessibility, faster settlement times, and quicker transactions. More brokerages and investment firms are exploring asset tokenization.Robinhood has been preparing to enter the European market. In April 2025, it acquired a brokerage license in Lithuania that allows the firm to offer investment services throughout the European Union. Robinhood has also inked a deal in 2024 to purchase crypto exchange Bitstamp.“You can sit down in front of some software, create a coin and have it be trading in 5 minutes [...] That’s a scary thing,” Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said in a recent interview. “It’s also an incredibly powerful thing if you juxtapose it with how cumbersome the IPO process is.”Robinhood shares rose 2.7% on the Nasdaq on May 7, according to Google Finance.

2025-05-07T21:30:00.000Z,"Falling DXY part of US financial system’s ‘long-term transition’ — Will Bitcoin continue to shine?","What to know:Lyn Alden says a weaker dollar is necessary for the US to stabilize its financial system.Bitcoin and gold are well-positioned to benefit from de-dollarization.Sovereign wealth funds and various nations are already increasing their Bitcoin exposure as the dollar’s global dominance starts to wane.The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug. After all, in times of deep restructuring, isn’t some dollar weakness to be expected?The trouble is, this might not be a temporary dip. The dollar’s slide could reflect a deeper, long-term reconfiguration of both the US economy and the global monetary order. In a May 4 newsletter, independent market analyst Lyn Alden made a compelling case: not only is a weaker dollar likely, but it may be necessary. According to Alden, a controlled retreat from dollar hegemony might be one of the few paths left to stabilize an increasingly fragile system. And if the US relinquishes its role at the center of the monetary universe, the world will need alternatives. Neutral assets like gold and Bitcoin could be well-positioned to take on a more central role.The US and the dollar are in a “long-term transition”Fractional reserve banking, the system that fiat money relies on, creates money through lending. Each time a bank issues a loan, it expands the supply of broad money, without necessarily creating enough base money to cover the loan principal and its interest. This means that the current financial system relies on continual credit expansion and refinancing to remain solvent.Today, the US economy holds around $102 trillion in public and private dollar-denominated debt, with another $18 trillion owed by borrowers outside the US And that’s not even counting derivatives, which would push the total much higher. Yet only $5.8 trillion in base money actually exists.“It’s like a game of musical chairs with more than 20 kids for every chair,” Alden writes. “And the music can’t stop for long.”The US plays a special role in this system. It imports more than it exports, while surplus countries funnel their dollar earnings back into American stocks, bonds, real estate, and private equity. For the $18 trillion in dollar liabilities held abroad, non-US entities hold roughly $61 trillion in US dollar assets. But when dollar liquidity tightens — when the music stops — foreign holders often have to sell those assets to service their debts, which, in turn, threatens US financial stability.This happened in March 2020, when parts of the Treasury market froze during the peak panic stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Fed stepped in, quickly opening emergency swap lines with foreign central banks and printing trillions in base money to re-float the system. That solved the liquidity issue but unleashed inflation, hitting lower-income Americans the hardest.Combined with decades of industrial decline and widening social gaps, this situation eventually created the political mandate for Donald Trump and his protectionist agenda. However, the tariff shock is unlikely to be successful, Alden argues. The current system implies that the US must run structural trade deficits to provide the global economy with enough dollars to keep the greenback’s dominance. The only way of rebalancing trade flows is through a weak dollar and a step back from monetary hegemony.As Alden puts it,“I view the United States and indeed the global financial system as likely beginning a very long-term transition.”The Bitcoin to DXY relationshipBitcoin (BTC) and DXY are inversely correlated. When the dollar strengthens, risk-on assets like BTC lose some of their appeal to investors. When the dollar weakens, BTC becomes more attractive not just as a speculative play, but as an alternative currency. In a system where fiat must effectively lose value over time to function, Bitcoin’s fixed supply and monetary neutrality offer a compelling hedge.Overlaying BTC and DXY charts reveals that major divergences between the two often align with Bitcoin trend reversals. In April 2018 and March 2022, such divergences signaled bear markets, while November 2020 marked the start of a bullish rally. In the 2023-2026 cycle, BTC caught up with the DXY in early 2024, and the two moved largely in sync until recently. A clear divergence began at the beginning of April 2025, with the DXY dropping below 100 for the first time in two years. If past patterns are any guide, this could signal the start of a new BTC rally. And if the US moves to strategically weaken the dollar in the long term, the impact could extend well beyond Bitcoin’s usual cyclical price action.DXY vs BTC/USD 1-day.

While short-term tactics may differ, longer-term strategies point to neutral, high-quality reserve assets — especially those that stand to benefit structurally from de-dollarization.Gold fits this bill. So does Bitcoin.Several sovereign entities are already stockpiling Bitcoin. El Salvador and Bhutan are directly buying and mining BTC. Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co. and the US state of Wisconsin’s pension fund have exposure via spot BTC ETFs. A dozen US states hold equity in Michael Saylor’s Strategy, as well as over 13,000 companies and institutions. Even Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, has Bitcoin exposure through its holdings of Strategy, Mara Holdings, Coinbase, and Riot.With the dollar retreating from the global financial arena, space will open for other currencies. There are more and more examples of international trade deals settled in yuan, dirham, or other national currencies. Reuters reports that cross-border yuan payments surged to a record in March. The euro is also on the rise, gaining 10% against the dollar since February. This is all the more impressive taking into account that the European Central Bank has been continuously cutting interest rates, which now stand at just 2.5%, far below the Fed’s 4.5%.The much-debated \""de-dollarization\"" is no longer hypothetical. It’s unfolding in real time. As nations and companies search for stable, neutral alternatives to settle trade and store value, Bitcoin’s borderless and politically neutral nature positions it as a serious contender. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The former CEO, as well as SafeMoon creator Kyle Nagy and former chief technology officer Thomas Smith, were charged in 2023 for having allegedly “diverted and misappropriated millions of dollars’ worth” of the platform’s SFM token.According to reporting from the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) on May 6, Karony implied that Nagy, who reportedly fled to Russia after authorities filed charges, was responsible for some of the alleged fraud at SafeMoon. On the first day of the trial, after jury selection, Smith reportedly appeared as a witness for the prosecution with a SafeMoon victim.The trial, expected to run until May 26, has arguably received less media attention and scrutiny than other crypto cases, such as the 2023 trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and the sentencing of former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao. Karony pleaded not guilty to charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy, and has been free on a $3 million bond since February 2024.Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Many high-profile individuals from the crypto industry who faced criminal charges did not publicly comment on social media until the conclusion of their cases, likely on the advice of counsel.

It has a market capitalization of nearly $85 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.Meanwhile, asset manager VanEck proposed on May 5 the first BNB ETF in the United States.

As of May 7, BNB Chain ranks fourth among layer-1 blockchain networks by TVL, the data shows. According to Standard Chartered, BNB Chain’s “use cases remain almost entirely on decentralised exchanges [DEXs], lending protocols, and liquid staking. This makes it a much more concentrated and ‘old-fashioned’ smart contract platform than rivals,” it said in a May research note reviewed by Cointelegraph.“While this caps upside potential, it also provides a degree of stability,” according to the asset manager. PancakeSwap is among BNB Chain’s largest DEXs, with roughly $1.5 billion in TVL, according to DefiLlama.USD1 on BNB Chain vs. Ethereum.
