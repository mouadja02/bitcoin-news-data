2025-06-15T10:00:41,"Bitcoin Holds Firm Above Previous ATH – Momentum Builds Despite Global Unease","Bitcoin has been navigating a turbulent environment over the past few days, as escalating geopolitical tensions continue to drive market uncertainty. On Friday at dawn, Israel launched a military strike against Iran, triggering immediate retaliations that have since kept global financial markets on edge. The conflict, coupled with broader macroeconomic instability, has intensified volatility and stalled bullish momentum across major risk assets. Despite the pressure, Bitcoin remains resilient. After briefly tagging the $112,000 all-time high last week, BTC has since retraced but is still trading above a crucial support zone. According to a recent technical analysis shared by top analyst Jelle, Bitcoin’s previous all-time high level is still holding as support, offering a key psychological and structural anchor for bulls. This price zone is critical to maintain in order to preserve the larger uptrend structure and potentially prepare for another attempt at price discovery. Investors now turn their attention to macro catalysts such as oil prices, bond yields, and central bank policy expectations, which continue to influence liquidity flows across markets. For Bitcoin, holding current levels may serve as a foundation for a stronger move once external pressures ease and market conditions stabilize. Bitcoin Consolidates Near Highs Amid Global, Macroeconomic Headwinds Bitcoin has entered a consolidation phase following a powerful move from the $74,000 level to its all-time high of $112,000. This sharp rally, which unfolded over a matter of weeks, has now paused as traders and institutional investors assess the growing complexity of the macro environment. From surging US Treasury yields and sticky inflation to escalating geopolitical tensions—most notably the Israel-Iran conflict—the current backdrop presents significant headwinds for risk assets like Bitcoin. Yet, despite this turbulence, Bitcoin has shown notable strength by holding above critical support levels. According to Jelle , Bitcoin’s previous all-time high is still acting as strong support, which could serve as a launchpad for further upside. Jelle noted that BTC closed the previous daily candle solidly, even as global markets were rattled by fresh waves of uncertainty. His conclusion was clear: “Bitcoin wants higher.” Indeed, while the short-term picture is clouded by caution, many remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s next move. Some forecasts suggest BTC could break above its $112K high within the coming weeks, especially if macro conditions—like easing yields or diplomatic progress in the Middle East—offer relief to investors. The next few weeks will be pivotal. A clean break above the ATH could ignite a new phase of price discovery, while a failure to hold current support may trigger deeper pullbacks. For now, consolidation above $100K keeps the bullish structure intact. BTC Price Analysis: Weekly Structure Shows Strength Bitcoin’s weekly chart reflects a phase of consolidation just below the $112,000 all-time high, following a sharp rally from sub-$75K levels. After multiple tests of the $109,300 resistance zone, BTC continues to hold above the previous ATH range, with current support around $103,600 holding firm for now. This behavior signals that bulls remain in control despite recent geopolitical and macroeconomic stress. The Bollinger Bands are tightening after a period of expansion, often a signal of upcoming volatility. The price action remains comfortably above the midline of the bands and all key moving averages (50, 100, and 200-week SMA), indicating sustained bullish momentum over the medium term. What stands out is the resilience of BTC in the face of global headwinds. Even with increased volatility due to the Israel-Iran conflict and sticky US inflation fears, Bitcoin’s weekly closes remain constructive. As long as BTC continues to print higher lows and defend the $103,600–$105,000 support zone, the path toward a breakout into price discovery remains valid. A clean weekly close above $109,300 would be a significant bullish trigger, potentially targeting the $120K–$125K zone in the near term. Until then, consolidation within this range remains the dominant structure.

2025-06-15T10:00:00,"What is XRP? Investors Ask as Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the Ultimate Bitcoin Replacement","XRP once held the promise of revolutionizing global payments. Fast, cheap, and bank-friendly—it was pitched as the future of cross-border finance. But years of regulatory battles, stagnant token utility, and centralized control have left many investors wondering: Is this still the future, or just another chapter in crypto history? As attention shifts, a bold new name is rising with far more than promises. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just aiming to improve the blockchain—it’s redefining what decentralized money can do. With blazing speed, mobile-first mining, and a full ecosystem that empowers users instead of institutions, BTC-S is positioning itself not just as a Bitcoin alternative, but the upgrade Bitcoin never had. XRP Had Potential—But the Space Moved On XRP deserves credit for challenging the banking sector and pioneering real-time settlement. But with Ripple entangled in legal skirmishes and token utility tied closely to corporate control, cracks have shown. Decentralization remains a concern. And for users seeking freedom, speed, and income, not just transaction rails, XRP now feels like a limited play. Investors are beginning to shift their gaze to a project that’s not just faster or cheaper, but fundamentally more empowering. Bitcoin Solaris: Designed to Replace, Not Just Compete BTC-S was built from the ground up to combine what Bitcoin started with what modern tech makes possible. It features a hybrid consensus model—Proof-of-Work (PoW) for core chain security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability. Together, they deliver unmatched performance. Key highlights include: Base Layer PoW using SHA-256 (Bitcoin-compatible) with 5-minute block times Solaris Layer DPoS with 21 rotating validators every 24 hours and 15-second blocks Cross-layer integration where validator data is secured on-chain through PoW anchoring Smart contracts in Rust, enabling DeFi, tokenization, and secure automation Optional privacy via Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) It gets even better with throughput: the Solaris Layer pushes up to 100,000 transactions per second, finalizing in just 2 seconds, while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. This isn’t theoretical—it’s audited and tested. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have verified the code, and early influencers like Ben Crypto are already spotlighting BTC-S as one of the most promising chains of the year. Mobile Mining with Real Rewards Unlike XRP, which can’t be earned directly through network participation, BTC-S opens the doors to daily income through mining—without expensive hardware. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine using: Smartphones (Android and iOS) Laptops and desktops ASICs and GPUs (for power users) With adaptive mining algorithms, in-app wallets, and energy-optimized performance, it’s truly accessible. Just tap, and you’re earning. Want to estimate your earning potential? The BTC-S mining calculator helps you visualize your daily impact. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Liquid Staking That Doesn’t Lock You In Beyond mining, Bitcoin Solaris also introduces a breakthrough in staking. With liquid staking , users can earn rewards without locking away their tokens. How it works: Staked BTC-S becomes sBTC-S (1:1 ratio) sBTC-S remains fully liquid, tradable, and DeFi-compatible You earn rewards while retaining full control It enhances decentralization, validator rotation, and network health It’s integrated right into the Solaris Nova App, with no complex setup required, making staking easy, flexible, and profitable for everyone. A Roadmap That’s Actually Being Followed Many coins brag about roadmaps. BTC-S is executing one. Its forward-looking roadmap spans: Mainnet Launch (Q3 2026) with full support for smart contracts and governance Mining Power Marketplace and cross-chain tools by Q4 2026 Quantum-resistant upgrades and layer-2 scaling in 2027 Enterprise-grade integrations with AI and IoT in late 2027 It’s a roadmap backed by action, not just whitepaper buzzwords. Every phase is designed to increase adoption, unlock real-world use, and build sustainable value. The Presale Is Moving Fast—and It’s Not Just Hype We’re currently in Phase 7 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale, with over 11,000 users already onboard and more than $4.5M raised. Current price: $7 Next phase: $8 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 9% With only around 7 weeks left before the July 31, 2025 launch, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most dynamic presales in crypto history. The growth is organic, driven by real use, not marketing gimmicks. If you’re watching from the sidelines, Bitcoin Solaris is your window into the future. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin? Or Something Better? XRP may have started as a disruptor. But Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as a revolution. With mobile mining, powerful staking, lightning-fast scalability, and a clear roadmap, BTC-S isn’t just an upgrade to Bitcoin—it’s what Bitcoin would be if it were built today.

According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, anonymous people familiar with the matter say that some of the world’s largest retailers are considering issuing their very own dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US in an effort to save billions of dollars in transaction fees. Such a move would mark a major shift away from the traditional finance system, which includes the nation’s largest banks and credit providers. Other firms that are reportedly exploring the potential use of stablecoins include Expedia Group and unnamed airline companies. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to other assets – such as the dollar, precious metals, or other crypto assets – and are typically backed on a one-to-one basis. Stablecoins have been gaining traction recently due to their low transaction fees and faster payment processing times. The firms’ decisions may ultimately depend on the fate of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill still making its way through Congress and yet to pass either chamber. The GENIUS Act, introduced earlier this year, aims to establish a regulatory framework for alternative payment systems, opening the door for new players to compete with giants like Visa and MasterCard. The sources say that Amazon’s stablecoin exploration has mostly revolved around creating one for online purchases, while Walmart has lobbied to change the GENIUS Act to introduce more competition in the credit-card sector. The firms are also considering how to use existing stablecoins if they decide not to create their own.

Saylor stated that the United States should not miss this change, saying, “It is in the interest of the United States to have as much Bitcoin as possible before other countries realize this transformation.” According to Saylor, the BTC network will form the basis of future capital flows as a decentralized financial infrastructure, so it is strategically important for countries, especially the US, to invest in Bitcoin early.

Saylor has run an aggressive BTC acquisition strategy under MicroStrategy over the last five years. The company currently holds approximately 582,000 BTC, with a current value of over $63 billion.

Most larger-cap alts are slightly in the red, including HYPE, which has dumped by 5%, while PI is up by a similar percentage. BTC Stopped at $106K The primary cryptocurrency was riding high at the beginning of the previous business week as it pumped above $110,000 on several occasions by Wednesday. However, each attempt was met with an immediate rejection, and the last one pushed BTC south to under $106,000. Although the bulls managed to recover some ground on Thursday and pushed bitcoin to $108,400, the quickly escalating tension in the Middle East resulted in an immediate price drop that drove the asset south to under $103,000. Although the attacks continued in the following 48 hours, including a few retaliations by Iran, BTC’s price recovered some ground and even jumped above $106,000 hours ago. However, US President Trump weighed in on the matter once again at that point and threatened Iran with “the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces” if Tehran decides to retaliate against the US in some form. Bitcoin slipped once again, but it’s still hovering above $105,000 . Its market cap remains below $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.7% on CG. BTCUSD.

Key Takeaways: Trump disclosed over $600 million in 2024 earnings, much of it from crypto ventures. His total asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, with significant income from NFTs, token sales, and real estate. The revelation raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest during his presidency. The filing , made public Friday, outlines the president’s sprawling business portfolio, including significant gains from digital assets and meme coin projects. While the exact timeframe isn’t specified, the report appears to cover income through the end of December 2024. Trump Assets Top $1.6 Billion, Earnings Surge Trump’s estimated asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, according to a Reuters analysis . Notably, a large portion of his 2024 windfall came from crypto-related endeavors, including over $320 million in estimated fees from the meme coin $TRUMP, and more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm. The disclosure also shows Trump received $57.35 million from token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture. The report sheds light on the growing entanglement between Trump’s business interests and the U.S. crypto industry. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As per Donald Trump financial disclosure, he made $57M from #Crypto in 2024, Nearly $600M in Total Income.

While exact valuations are unclear, revenue from branded merchandise and licensing deals continue to flow in. Among them, $2.8 million from Trump Watches, $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances, and over $1 million from his NFT trading cards. In the physical world, Trump’s Florida golf resorts brought in $217.7 million, led by the Trump National Doral, which earned over $110 million. Additional income came from real estate projects in India, Dubai, and Vietnam, with licensing and development fees totaling over $30 million. The filing also included $12 million in passive income through investments in Blue Owl Capital and U.S. bond funds. Despite previously claiming to have distanced himself from day-to-day management, the disclosure confirms Trump remains deeply tied to the financial performance of his vast network of businesses, including crypto. SEC Approves Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-Linked Registration As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes. While the approval gives TMTG flexibility to raise capital, the firm says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base.

According to Laffont, despite Bitcoin’s 13% increase so far in 2025, its volatility has decreased significantly compared to previous years. BTC’s sharp price swings have caused Coatue to avoid investing in the past. But that’s changing now. “The cost of entry into Bitcoin may be decreasing. If beta is decreasing, that would be really interesting,” Laffont said, noting that Bitcoin’s beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, has decreased over time. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs by giants like BlackRock is a clear indication that BTC is maturing, according to Laffont. He also recalled that Bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value in 2022, but this decline was more striking compared to the fluctuations experienced, for example, after Trump's tariff announcement in April 2025. “Bitcoin is down only 5%, while Nasdaq is down more than 6% between April 2nd and April 10th. This shows that Bitcoin is now becoming a more resilient asset to risk events in the market,” he said. Additionally, the rate at which coins held in Bitcoin wallets for at least a month are being sold out has dropped significantly, suggesting that investors are moving away from short-term speculation and starting to view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Pointing out that Bitcoin’s share in total global wealth is still very low (0.4%) at around $2 trillion, Laffont said that this rate will inevitably increase over time: “If people continue to believe that Bitcoin is valuable, then that asset will become more valuable over time, which means it should become more central in portfolios.” Despite this, Laffont warned investors that Bitcoin’s weight in the portfolio should not be exaggerated: “Even if you think Bitcoin is going to be important, don’t put a large portion of your portfolio into it. A small but long-term position can make you less stressed and more profitable.” Related News: List of Today's Top 15 Trending Altcoins Published Laffont, who admitted that Coatue had previously missed the Bitcoin opportunity, attributes this mostly to their inability to think simply. According to Laffont, in the investment world, it is usually more profitable to focus on assets that people believe are valuable, rather than complex models: “For something to be valuable, everyone has to believe it is valuable. It was that simple, and we missed it.” Technology-focused hedge fund Coatue has invested in cryptocurrency and technology companies such as Dune Analytics, Bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave. CoreWeave also has a partnership with Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Dividing his investors into three, Laffont said that there are those who leave crypto completely to themselves, those who question why Bitcoin was entered late, and cautious investors who want to stay away from crypto. However, he stated that this cautious audience is decreasing a little more every year: “This group of abstainers is disappearing. They are becoming smaller and smaller every year.” *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Gundlach says recent behavior in the stock market, the dollar and the Treasury market appears “strange” to him, hinting at deeper concerns that are unsettling investors in US assets. According to Gundlach, investors are beginning to sniff out the looming risks tied to the US government’s unsustainable fiscal trajectory. “In the last 15 years, there has been a number of corrections on the S&P 500, and in every single one of them, when the S&P goes down by more than 10%, the trade-weighted dollar index goes up. This time, the dollar went down when the S&P 500 went down by almost 20%. That’s strange, things are behaving differently. Usually when the Fed starts cutting interest rates, rates across the yield curve go down. The 10-year Treasury almost always goes up [in price] immediately following the first Fed rate cut, and then it keeps rallying for a while. This time, the 10-year yield went up, and the yield curve is steepening. So I think what we have is recognition that the interest expense for the United States is untenable – if we continue running a $2.1 trillion budget deficit and we continue to have sticky interest rates.” The Bond King zeroes in on foreign investors, noting that they hold tens of trillions of dollars in US assets. Gundlach says it is now within the realm of possibility for the investor cohort to start exiting US markets. “There’s a net investment position; foreigners were investing more in the US than the US was investing outside the country to the tune of $3 trillion. That was about 15 or 17 years ago. It’s now over $25 trillion is the net investment position, and the dollar is falling. It’s not inconceivable that some of that $25 trillion that came in not even two decades could go out.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-15T06:19:34,"Owning One Bitcoin Is the New American Dream, Says Bitwise Portfolio Manager","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC is holding firm above $105,000 after recovering from a sharp downturn triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel’s strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin’s trend remains intact. Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin’s appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals. According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they’re focused on becoming ""wholecoiners"" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of ""retiring your bloodline."" Park added that bitcoin’s global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to ""opt out"" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty. As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded between $104,480.15 and $105,696.12, closing near $105,590, up 0.15%, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Support was reinforced in the $104,400–$104,500 zone, with high-volume accumulation during the 16:00–20:00 GMT window. A bullish reversal followed at 21:00, driving BTC above $105,000 on strong volumeIntraday breakout occurred at 02:01, with price jumping from $105,486 to $105,550 on elevated activity. Consolidation above $105,470 suggests further upside potential toward $106,000, pending sustained demand.

2025-06-15T05:24:24,"Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next? Experts Split","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again testing the nerves of traders worldwide, hovering just above $105,000 today as forecasts split the crypto community in half. Will the king cryptocurrency explode to $175,000 this cycle, or nosedive to under $80,000 if fear grips the market? The $175K Dream On the bullish side, pseudonymous chart-watcher Egrag Crypto supercharged hopium this week, predicting a huge breakout in the next few months. According to the analyst, BTC’s historical cycle data suggests the asset is primed for a 102% surge, which would catapult it to $175,000 from its current levels. “The average of three major pumps this cycle is 102%, hitting $175K!” they tweeted, pointing to eerily similar patterns in previous bull markets. The way Bitcoin shrugged off the effects of recent geopolitical upheavals has only bolstered Egrag’s bullish case. After Israel struck multiple Iranian nuclear and military assets, the cryptocurrency cratered, going from a daily high near $108,500 to just under $103,000, before clawing its way back to around $105,000 today. Other optimists, like DeFiTracer, also highlighted similar war-driven dips in April and October 2024, when each was followed by 48% and 74% explosions upward. “Don’t let whales and news manipulate you,” he wrote on X, suggesting June’s 4% dip is merely fuel for the next bump upward. The Bear Trap However, not everyone is buying the hype just yet. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez has tempered the euphoria, warning that the market could be on the brink of a sharp correction if key levels don’t hold. He backed his pessimism, pointing to whales offloading nearly 30,000 BTC in the past week as well as a weakening support floor around the hundred grand level. If this floor gives way, Martinez predicts a drop to as low as $78,500. His sentiment was echoed by crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who noted that BTC just failed to hold above $106,000, triggering a liquidity cascade southwards. “Two options,” he warned: A sub-$100,000 buying opportunity or a fresh rally if prices hold at around $102,500. Market observer Axel Adler Jr. also weighed in , drawing attention to BTC’s OBV (On-Balance Volume), which is still stuck in the red near $100,000. According to him, it means that any bullish momentum could be paper-thin. The post Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next?

2025-06-15T04:45:10,"Crypto price predictions: Pi Network, Monero, and Fartcoin","The crypto market was mixed on Sunday as investors focused on the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. Bitcoin was stuck above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens dropped to $3.28 trillion. This article explores the top crypto forecasts of coins like Pi Network (PI), Monero (XMR), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Pi Network price prediction Pi coin price chart | Source: TradingView Pi coin has come under pressure in the past few weeks as it plunged to $0.3945 on Friday, down from last month’s high of $1.6567. The token has stabilized a bit and moved to over $0.60 today, a 50% surge. Technicals point to more Pi Network gains as it has formed a triple-bottom pattern at around $0.60. A triple-bottom is made up of three distinct bottoms and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $1.6567. The token is attempting to move above the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Oscillators like the MACD and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Pi Network token price will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $1, which is about 61% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.3945 will invalidate the bullish Pi Network forecast. Monero price forecast XMR price chart | Source: TradingView Monero, the biggest privacy-focused coin, has crashed in the past two weeks, erasing some of the gains made earlier this year. The initial gains happened as demand for privacy tokens soared. XMR token retreated from a high of $420 to $315 today as investors booked profits. Monero has moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also remains slightly above the 50-day and 100-day EMA. Most importantly, it has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $301.05. A double-bottom pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, Monero token will likely bounce back as long as it remains above the double-bottom pattern at $301. Such a move will see it rise and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $353, which is about 12% above the current level. A drop below the support at $301 will invalidate the bullish Monero price forecast. Fartcoin price forecast Fartcoin chart | Source: TradingView Fartcoin, a top meme coin on the Solana network , has been one of the most actively traded tokens this year. Its recent surge saw it peak at $1.6520 in May. It then pulled back and reached a low of $0.8715, its lowest point on June 5, and then bounced back to the current $1.20. Fartcoin token remains above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated and moved to the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the Fartcoin price will likely resume the uptrend, and potentially retest the psychological point at $1.50. A drop below the support at $0.8715 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-15T04:00:28,"Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support – Eyes On $97K If It Breaks","Bitcoin is trading just above the critical $104K level after enduring multiple days of selling pressure triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The recent attacks between Israel and Iran have injected fresh volatility across financial markets, but BTC has shown notable resilience. Currently down about 5% from its all-time high of $112K, Bitcoin continues to trade within a broader consolidation range as macroeconomic uncertainty persists. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week – Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? Despite the geopolitical instability and rising bond yields, Bitcoin’s structure remains bullish, with bulls defending key support zones. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the $104,124 level is a crucial threshold to watch. He highlights that this level aligns with a strong cluster of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) based on the Realized Price Distribution metric. This suggests a heavy concentration of buyers who acquired BTC at or near this range, potentially reinforcing it as a solid support base. Holding above this level could mark a turning point, paving the way for another push toward price discovery. However, a breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction toward lower demand levels. For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s reaction to this key level as global risks continue to evolve. Bitcoin Holds The Line Above $100K Amid Geopolitical Risks Bitcoin is showing notable resilience amid global turmoil, holding above the $100K mark despite rising uncertainty linked to escalating Middle East tensions. As the market heads into Monday, investors are bracing for potentially volatile sessions, depending on further developments between Israel and Iran. A sharp rise in oil prices could add additional macro pressure, making the start of the week a decisive moment for risk assets. BTC continues to trade within a consolidation range after falling 5% from its all-time high of $112K. Analysts widely agree that Bitcoin is in a transitional phase—either preparing for an explosive breakout into price discovery or setting the stage for a deeper retracement. Many believe that a confirmed breakout above $112K could trigger the next major leg higher, marking the beginning of a new expansion cycle for the entire crypto market. However, caution remains critical at current levels. Martinez pointed to key on-chain data from the UTXO Realized Price Distribution, identifying $104,124 as a pivotal support zone. This price level is where a large volume of BTC last moved, suggesting strong buyer interest. If BTC holds this level, it could form a solid base for continuation. But if it breaks down, the next area of interest lies around $97,405—potentially sparking broader fear across the market. In the coming days, Bitcoin’s response to geopolitical news and macroeconomic signals, particularly oil price movements and bond yield reactions, will be crucial. For now, the bulls remain in control, but the path forward demands close attention and calculated positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds $2,500 Support – History Signals $4,000 As Potential Target BTC Price Analysis: Bulls Defend Key Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,502, showing signs of strength after defending the crucial $103,600 support level. This price zone has acted as a consistent floor over the past week and continues to be a key pivot for short-term market structure. After a steep drop from the $112K high, BTC bounced off this support with a strong wick on high volume, signaling buyer interest and a potential short-term bottom. The chart shows that Bitcoin is consolidating between $103,600 and $109,300, with the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs converging just above the current price, indicating a decision point is near. A clear break above $106,800 could trigger momentum to test $109,300 again, while a failure to hold above $104,500 would expose BTC to downside risk.

Hoskinson replied with a wide-scope plan that is not limited to RLUSD. His comments followed a user’s inquiry about whether the Ripple-backed stablecoin RealUSD (RLUSD) would be available on Cardano. He mentioned that a full “ XRP package ” is on the way, with plans for XRP DeFi integration, support for Lace wallet, “glacier drops,’ and ongoing talks about RealUSD. He did not make a fine point about timing, but his reply confirmed that high-level discussions were taking place. Cardano gears up for XRP integration with RLUSD As soon as RLUSD was mentioned, the cryptocurrency community went into overdrive, with many hoping for information on when they could access the stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain . However, Hoskinson’s reply suggests that RLUSD is part of the bigger plan, which involves all the other Ripple-related assets. One term that emerged with greater prominence was “glacier drops.” While not commonly used in the space, the term refers to a controlled and staggered release of tokens or features — analogous to a focused airdrop effort pegged to product milestones. Lace wallet support is also on the agenda. As Cardano’s official wallet was built emphasizing user experience, Lace’s integration with XRP would streamline access for users looking to manage Ripple-based assets within the Cardano ecosystem. Equally significant is the mention of DeFi. Historically, XRP has had a limited role in decentralized finance. Its integration into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure could unlock new use cases — such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision — potentially attracting more users and developers to the platform. While no final decisions have been made public, Hoskinson’s remarks shed more light on Cardano’s dedication to interoperability, interest in stablecoin adoption, and interest in growing their presence in the DeFi space. Through the integration of RLUSD, XRP DeFi utilities, advanced wallet features, and token drops, Cardano is gearing up to vie for its share of the competitive blockchain ecosystem. If it works, this could be important for Cardano in expanding its ecosystem and offering itself a bit more than it is to an even larger crypto market. Hoskinson proposes strategic investments to grow Cardano’s treasury Hoskinson recently shared insight into what the Cardano community should expect regarding the ecosystem’s decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). He gave the update in an 18-minute-long podcast on X to ecosystem members. According to Hoskinson, the team is considering several approaches to improving and growing the Cardano SWF. He maintained that the goal is to use the fund’s resources to benefit the ecosystem. Hoskinson explained that the decentralized Cardano SWF is similar in principle to how countries like Norway invest national wealth into assets for future benefits. He proposed investing a small portion of the Cardano treasury in different assets. “Could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it to a blend of a collection of stablecoins … and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin/DeFi?” he asked. The plan aims to mitigate risk, create long-term yield, and reinvest the money into buying back ADA. This sets up Cardano’s Sovereign Wealth Fund to grow the ecosystem and, consequently, the value of ADA as time goes on. Cardano could make relatively easy returns without significantly eating into its core reserves by dedicating a portion of the treasury to Bitcoin and similar assets. When used to acquire ADA, these profits may increase demand and sustain the market price. Charles Hoskinson describes an economic model designed to be self-sustaining for the Cardano community.

2025-06-15T01:00:10,"Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions","The recent escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran has added a new wave of anxiety in the global markets, causing investors to adopt a more cautious stance towards investing. At the same time, Bitcoin’s technical chart is sending mixed signals that could lead to a breakout in either direction. After a failed attempt to reclaim $110,000 earlier this week, the price has now slipped below the 21-day moving average, but still above support at the 50-day moving average. This confluence of moving averages, coupled with a clearly defined trendline resistance, has brought Bitcoin into a tightening price structure of a descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Descending Triangle With Tightening Range And Bearish Pressure According to a crypto analyst on X, Bitcoin is forming a descending triangle pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, technical analysis rules state that the descending triangle pattern setup is typically associated with bearish breakdowns. The chart image accompanying the post shows repeated rejection from a downward-sloping trendline that began when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The second rejection was a lower high around $110,000 earlier this week. On the other hand, the base of the triangle has remained constant with a support zone around $102,000. The analyst noted that the 21-day moving average (21MA), shown in blue, is exerting downward pressure, acting as resistance, while the 50-day moving average (50MA), in green, is acting as a temporary support floor. As price action continues to narrow within this triangle move, the market is on the projection for a decisive move in any direction. Whether it breaks above the resistance or falls through the support will likely dictate the next major trend. However, if the descending triangle pattern continues to play out with lower highs and steady support, the breakout will lean more towards a downside breakout. Israel-Iran Tensions May Push Breakout Or Breakdown The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran could be the spark that forces Bitcoin out of its current range. Notably, a wave of liquidations hit the crypto market on Friday as reports of an Israeli airstrike on Iran made the news. During periods of geopolitical instability like this, Bitcoin often trades in unpredictable ways. There are two possible outcomes for the leading cryptocurrency from here. It could act as a haven, or it could be sold off for liquidity. If the fear in traditional markets continues to increase, Bitcoin could break below the $102,000 support in the coming trading sessions, confirming the descending triangle’s bearish implications. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details However, if bullish momentum returns, a break above the descending trendline could invalidate the bearish pattern and open the door for a retest of the $110,800 all-time high region. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,990.

2025-06-15T01:00:05,"Unstaked Rockets Past $9.7M in Presale, Dominating Headlines as Bittensor Slips and Aptos Surges","Traders now demand speed, smart automation, and value. Bittensor (TAO) dipped to about $399, forming a strong buy area. Aptos (APT) saw a whopping $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume, ranking it among the top two globally. But Unstaked takes the lead. It backs real AI tools, not empty promises. The presale price of Unstaked (UNSD) sits at $0.01139 in Stage 20. With a $5+ forecast, 3000x gains look plausible. Over $9.7 million has been raised, and about 1.1 billion coins sold. After launch, live AI agents will transition fully to on-chain and operational status. Bittensor’s Sub‑$400 Dip Sparks Buy Alert Bittensor (TAO) currently trades around $399 following an 8% drop this week and 5% over two weeks. This underperformance contrasts with broader market gains. Analyst Michael van de Poppe labels this zone a strong buy. He notes capitulation from weak holders and increased interest from stronger hands. A rounding bottom pattern is emerging, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. TAO remains the top‑ranked AI coin. If momentum returns, targets could range from $425 to $433, and even $700 to $800. For those tracking smart AI coins, Bittensor appears to offer a solid accumulation opportunity. Aptos Surges With $1.6B Stablecoin Activity Aptos (APT) shows impressive growth across its ecosystem. Bridging brought in over $30 million in BTC via OKX’s xBTC in one week. Stablecoin volume reached $1.6 billion, led by USDT, USDC, and USDe. Echo Protocol secured $275 million in TVL. Thala Labs contributed $850 million in DeFi volume. Transaction growth ranks Aptos among the global top two. The chain added 39 ambassadors, distributed $3.4 million in rewards and hosted a major NFT mint. It also expanded tools like Kana Learn, gaming features, naming services, plus real‑world activations such as UNTOLD Festival. With rising activity and user adoption, Aptos is gaining serious momentum. Unstaked’s On‑Chain AI Agents Drive Real Value Unstaked delivers working AI systems that users can deploy immediately after launch. These AI agents act autonomously and run on platforms like X and Telegram. They automate outreach, manage communities, and engage 24/7. Every action is verifiable with proof‑of‑activity on‑chain. No coding is needed. This means creators and crypto teams get powerful automation without hiring staff. These agents are cheaper than an intern and more scalable. They are exactly what crypto promised, but seldom delivered. The presale price is $0.01139 in Stage 20. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, the project already shows momentum. These figures are not hype. They reflect actual buyers’ interest backed by real tech. Most importantly, these AI agents will go live after launch. That means users can deploy them immediately to earn on‑chain rewards. They can customize agent behavior to fit specific goals or communities. Once live, agents will interact, learn, and earn autonomously. That level of real‑world use cements value. A project becomes strong when its product is live and working. Unstaked meets that test. Featuring coinized AI tools, seamless deployment, and on‑chain verification, Unstaked offers clear utility. With a future price target of $5+, the potential return over the $0.01139 presale price is striking. Real use cases, strong funding, and live agents after launch mark Unstaked as a utility‑driven leader. It stands apart from speculative coins by delivering actual functionality tied to actual value. Unstaked may well be the best performing crypto today by real‑world impact and math Final Verdict Bittensor’s drop under $400 may signal a buying setup toward $700+. Aptos is thriving with $30 million BTC inflow, $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume and top global transaction growth. Both projects have strong traction. But Unstaked operates differently. It builds coinized AI agents that automate outreach, grow communities and run on‑chain with proof. Priced at $0.01139 (Stage 20), with over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, it ties real use to real value. Live AI agents post‑launch will cement its utility. This makes Unstaked the standout play rather than just hype.

2025-06-15T00:26:42,"Raoul Pal Says Global Liquidity Influences Bitcoin Price","Macro investor Raoul Pal recently pointed out that global liquidity levels more influence the Bitcoin (BTC) price than by political events. In a post on X , Paul shared an analysis showing that changes in global liquidity determine the coin’s movement. He noted that despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin’s price has not reacted much. Raoul Pal Says Liquidity Moves BTC, Not News Raoul Pal shared a chart showing that 89% of Bitcoin’s price moves over the past three years match changes in the global M2 money supply, which measures the amount of money in global circulation. He says this link has held steady through wars, elections, and interest rate changes. The chart suggests that when more money flows into the global economy, Bitcoin tends to rise. When money is tight, Bitcoin often falls. This analysis is poised to give investors a clearer view of Bitcoin’s long-term trend . Pal argues that while short-term events like oil prices or political news can cause small swings, they do not mainly influence the asset’s price. In his view, Bitcoin mostly follows global liquidity, not headlines. Middle East Conflict and Oil Prices Fail to Impact BTC Recent reports revealed that Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s energy infrastructure, including attacks on the South Pars gas field. The incident led to a fire outbreak and raised fears of possible disruptions to the global energy supply. As a result, oil prices jumped, with analysts at Alva reporting that oil futures rose by more than 7% in just a few hours. Additionally, the Kobeissi Letter reported that traders expect further price increases in the oil market by Monday. Some experts also warned about risks to key shipping routes if the situation worsens. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price moved only 0.02%. This minor change supports Pal’s view that such events, unless they impact the global money supply, do not have a lasting effect on BTC’s direction. Bitcoin Holds Ground Amid Market Instability Bitcoin’s climb toward a new high was cut short after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran, causing panic across global markets. BTC fell 2.8%, dropping from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. This sharp decline brought it near the key $100,000 level and triggered widespread liquidations. It has since recovered slightly to around $104,787, down just 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains steady and shows resilience amid global uncertainty.
