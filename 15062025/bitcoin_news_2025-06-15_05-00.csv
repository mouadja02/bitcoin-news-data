2025-06-15T02:30:05,"SEC, Ripple Approach Court Again Over $125 Million Escrow Fund – Details","Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have once again approached the US courts seeking an alteration to the structure of a $125 million escrow fund set aside for settlements. Notably, the five-year-long legal battle between both entities has significantly de-escalated over the past three months in line with other crypto-friendly developments of the Donald Trump administration. However, both parties face a major task in convincing the court of the need to alter an initial injunction in its final judgement. Related Reading: The Curse Of Ethereum: First-Ever ETH Treasury Company Suffers Sharo 73% Crash – Details Ripple-SEC Drama Continues In 2020, the SEC charged Ripple in court, accusing the latter of selling over $1.3 billion in unregistered securities (XRP) sales . In July 2023, a judge ruled the secondary sales of XRP do not qualify as securities transactions, representing a major partial victory for the crypto market. However, the final judgement issued in August 2024 included an injunction that ordered Ripple to pay a $125 million penalty fee in violation of section 5 of the Securities Act 1993. Notably, the specified $125 million was soon placed in an escrow account pending the conclusion of the case, which was swiftly followed by notices of appeals by both parties. However, the briefs of both appeals were placed on hold on April 16, 2025, following a report of an agreement-in-principle between both parties. Ripple, SEC Try Motion Again In what appears to be part of the agreement between the SEC and Ripple , both parties approached the court on May 8 seeking a modification to the structure of the $125 injunction fee against the blockchain company on the basis of “exceptional circumstances”. The joint motion proposed that only $50 million is paid to the SEC as a penalty, while the remainder is returned to Ripple. However, the court rejected this motion on May 16 due to no explanation on how these “exceptional circumstances” warrant a modification. In another joint motion filed on June 12, both parties delicately state these “exceptional circumstances,” which include the fact that the proposed agreement does not alter the initial summary judgment from the court. Furthermore, the motion also highlights the requested relief favors both parties in the case as well as the public interest and introduces a settlement capable of permanently finalizing this case. In addition, this proposed change would prevent the progress of the appeal briefs and save court resources. Finally, both the SEC and Ripple reiterate that granting the injunction structure modification and thereby terminating the case aligns with the SEC’s current policy of dismissing certain crypto cases by joint stipulation.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-ripple-approach-court-over-125-million-escrow/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|escrow funds|injunction|joint motion|Judge Analisa Torres|ripple|SEC",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T01:00:10,"Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions","The recent escalation in tensions between Israel and Iran has added a new wave of anxiety in the global markets, causing investors to adopt a more cautious stance towards investing. At the same time, Bitcoin’s technical chart is sending mixed signals that could lead to a breakout in either direction. After a failed attempt to reclaim $110,000 earlier this week, the price has now slipped below the 21-day moving average, but still above support at the 50-day moving average. This confluence of moving averages, coupled with a clearly defined trendline resistance, has brought Bitcoin into a tightening price structure of a descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Descending Triangle With Tightening Range And Bearish Pressure According to a crypto analyst on X, Bitcoin is forming a descending triangle pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, technical analysis rules state that the descending triangle pattern setup is typically associated with bearish breakdowns. The chart image accompanying the post shows repeated rejection from a downward-sloping trendline that began when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The second rejection was a lower high around $110,000 earlier this week. On the other hand, the base of the triangle has remained constant with a support zone around $102,000. The analyst noted that the 21-day moving average (21MA), shown in blue, is exerting downward pressure, acting as resistance, while the 50-day moving average (50MA), in green, is acting as a temporary support floor. As price action continues to narrow within this triangle move, the market is on the projection for a decisive move in any direction. Whether it breaks above the resistance or falls through the support will likely dictate the next major trend. However, if the descending triangle pattern continues to play out with lower highs and steady support, the breakout will lean more towards a downside breakout. Israel-Iran Tensions May Push Breakout Or Breakdown The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran could be the spark that forces Bitcoin out of its current range. Notably, a wave of liquidations hit the crypto market on Friday as reports of an Israeli airstrike on Iran made the news. During periods of geopolitical instability like this, Bitcoin often trades in unpredictable ways. There are two possible outcomes for the leading cryptocurrency from here. It could act as a haven, or it could be sold off for liquidity. If the fear in traditional markets continues to increase, Bitcoin could break below the $102,000 support in the coming trading sessions, confirming the descending triangle’s bearish implications. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details However, if bullish momentum returns, a break above the descending trendline could invalidate the bearish pattern and open the door for a retest of the $110,800 all-time high region.

2025-06-15T01:00:05,"Unstaked Rockets Past $9.7M in Presale, Dominating Headlines as Bittensor Slips and Aptos Surges","Traders now demand speed, smart automation, and value. Bittensor (TAO) dipped to about $399, forming a strong buy area. Aptos (APT) saw a whopping $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume, ranking it among the top two globally. But Unstaked takes the lead. It backs real AI tools, not empty promises. The presale price of Unstaked (UNSD) sits at $0.01139 in Stage 20. With a $5+ forecast, 3000x gains look plausible. Over $9.7 million has been raised, and about 1.1 billion coins sold. After launch, live AI agents will transition fully to on-chain and operational status. Bittensor’s Sub‑$400 Dip Sparks Buy Alert Bittensor (TAO) currently trades around $399 following an 8% drop this week and 5% over two weeks. This underperformance contrasts with broader market gains. Analyst Michael van de Poppe labels this zone a strong buy. He notes capitulation from weak holders and increased interest from stronger hands. A rounding bottom pattern is emerging, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. TAO remains the top‑ranked AI coin. If momentum returns, targets could range from $425 to $433, and even $700 to $800. For those tracking smart AI coins, Bittensor appears to offer a solid accumulation opportunity. Aptos Surges With $1.6B Stablecoin Activity Aptos (APT) shows impressive growth across its ecosystem. Bridging brought in over $30 million in BTC via OKX’s xBTC in one week. Stablecoin volume reached $1.6 billion, led by USDT, USDC, and USDe. Echo Protocol secured $275 million in TVL. Thala Labs contributed $850 million in DeFi volume. Transaction growth ranks Aptos among the global top two. The chain added 39 ambassadors, distributed $3.4 million in rewards and hosted a major NFT mint. It also expanded tools like Kana Learn, gaming features, naming services, plus real‑world activations such as UNTOLD Festival. With rising activity and user adoption, Aptos is gaining serious momentum. Unstaked’s On‑Chain AI Agents Drive Real Value Unstaked delivers working AI systems that users can deploy immediately after launch. These AI agents act autonomously and run on platforms like X and Telegram. They automate outreach, manage communities, and engage 24/7. Every action is verifiable with proof‑of‑activity on‑chain. No coding is needed. This means creators and crypto teams get powerful automation without hiring staff. These agents are cheaper than an intern and more scalable. They are exactly what crypto promised, but seldom delivered. The presale price is $0.01139 in Stage 20. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, the project already shows momentum. These figures are not hype. They reflect actual buyers’ interest backed by real tech. Most importantly, these AI agents will go live after launch. That means users can deploy them immediately to earn on‑chain rewards. They can customize agent behavior to fit specific goals or communities. Once live, agents will interact, learn, and earn autonomously. That level of real‑world use cements value. A project becomes strong when its product is live and working. Unstaked meets that test. Featuring coinized AI tools, seamless deployment, and on‑chain verification, Unstaked offers clear utility. With a future price target of $5+, the potential return over the $0.01139 presale price is striking. Real use cases, strong funding, and live agents after launch mark Unstaked as a utility‑driven leader. It stands apart from speculative coins by delivering actual functionality tied to actual value. Unstaked may well be the best performing crypto today by real‑world impact and math Final Verdict Bittensor’s drop under $400 may signal a buying setup toward $700+. Aptos is thriving with $30 million BTC inflow, $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume and top global transaction growth. Both projects have strong traction. But Unstaked operates differently. It builds coinized AI agents that automate outreach, grow communities and run on‑chain with proof. Priced at $0.01139 (Stage 20), with over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, it ties real use to real value. Live AI agents post‑launch will cement its utility. This makes Unstaked the standout play rather than just hype.

2025-06-15T00:26:42,"Raoul Pal Says Global Liquidity Influences Bitcoin Price","Macro investor Raoul Pal recently pointed out that global liquidity levels more influence the Bitcoin (BTC) price than by political events. In a post on X , Paul shared an analysis showing that changes in global liquidity determine the coin’s movement. He noted that despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin’s price has not reacted much. Raoul Pal Says Liquidity Moves BTC, Not News Raoul Pal shared a chart showing that 89% of Bitcoin’s price moves over the past three years match changes in the global M2 money supply, which measures the amount of money in global circulation. He says this link has held steady through wars, elections, and interest rate changes. The chart suggests that when more money flows into the global economy, Bitcoin tends to rise. When money is tight, Bitcoin often falls. This analysis is poised to give investors a clearer view of Bitcoin’s long-term trend . Pal argues that while short-term events like oil prices or political news can cause small swings, they do not mainly influence the asset’s price. In his view, Bitcoin mostly follows global liquidity, not headlines. Middle East Conflict and Oil Prices Fail to Impact BTC Recent reports revealed that Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s energy infrastructure, including attacks on the South Pars gas field. The incident led to a fire outbreak and raised fears of possible disruptions to the global energy supply. As a result, oil prices jumped, with analysts at Alva reporting that oil futures rose by more than 7% in just a few hours. Additionally, the Kobeissi Letter reported that traders expect further price increases in the oil market by Monday. Some experts also warned about risks to key shipping routes if the situation worsens. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price moved only 0.02%. This minor change supports Pal’s view that such events, unless they impact the global money supply, do not have a lasting effect on BTC’s direction. Bitcoin Holds Ground Amid Market Instability Bitcoin’s climb toward a new high was cut short after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran, causing panic across global markets. BTC fell 2.8%, dropping from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. This sharp decline brought it near the key $100,000 level and triggered widespread liquidations. It has since recovered slightly to around $104,787, down just 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains steady and shows resilience amid global uncertainty.

The form also reveals he holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the project, giving him direct voting power over its direction. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Trump’s Token Windfall According to the disclosure, Trump’s income line reads “$57,437,927.” It doesn’t say if he sold tokens, earned staking rewards, or used another method. But the number is huge. It hints that he either cashed out part of his stake or that an internal valuation put the tokens’ worth very high. Massive Fundraising Rounds Based on reports from March, World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first token sale. A second round pulled in $250 million. That brings total fundraising to roughly $550 million. The project kicked off in September 2024. It aims to offer DeFi services and dollar-pegged stablecoins as an alternative to banks. Big Investors Join In Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024. He got 2 billion WLFI tokens at an early price of $0.015 each. Web3Port added $10 million in January 2025, and Oddiyana Ventures also came on board. They didn’t say how much that fund put in. These bids suggest major players believe the project can grow. Ethics Questions Loom Based on the ethics filing, Trump still has roles in related holding companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. But income from those is small or zero. The form carries his certification that everything is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” It will be reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details The disclosure also notes his past digital ventures. He previously reported earnings from NFT projects such as Trump Digital Trading Cards. This time, no new NFT income shows up. Instead, all the focus is on World Liberty Financial. That venture now stands as the biggest piece of his crypto footprint. Critics will point to potential conflicts of interest. A sitting president profiting from tokens that grant voting power in a financial project raises eyebrows. Supporters might argue it’s just savvy investing. Either way, the numbers are out in the open now. And the public can see that Donald Trump made a hefty gain from a startup he helped launch—and that he still holds sway over its future.

2025-06-14T20:30:43,"Bitcoin May Hit $78,500 If This Critical Support Fails – Details","Bitcoin (BTC) prices crashed by almost 5% in the past 48 hours, with growing global tensions following an Israeli airstrike on Iran on June 12. As financial markets reacted to this news, Bitcoin prices dipped to below $103,000 before experiencing a modest rebound to climb into the $105,000 price band. Notably, top market analyst Ali Martinez has observed that the premier cryptocurrency must maintain a particular support line to avoid a major correction based on the active trading channel. $100,000 Support Key To Bitcoin Bull Challenge In an X post on June 13, Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price movement. The expert reveals that BTC has stylishly maintained a range-bound movement since 2024 amidst major price surges and extended market corrections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $105K as Binance Net Taker Volume Turns Deep Red Over the last six months, Martinez’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has largely traded between $78,500 and $110,000, establishing multiple vital support and resistance levels within this corridor. During this period, the maiden cryptocurrency has famously retested the upper boundary five times while bouncing off the lower boundary four times. Following Bitcoin’s most recent crash and the propensity for higher market volatility, especially with the potential of a full-scale war in the Middle East, Martinez warns it is critical for Bitcoin bulls to maintain a price point above the $100,000 level, which represents the next major support level in the market. The analyst explains that in line with price behavior within a set trading channel, a decisive close below the $100,000 price point strongly increases the chances for a price return to the lower boundary at $78,500. This situation presents a potential 25% price devaluation for current BTC holdings. On the other hand, maintaining price action above $100,000 keeps bullish momentum intact and raises the probability of a retest of the $110,000 resistance zone, perhaps with the hope of a decisive price breakout beyond the trading channel. However, a breakdown below $100,000 would not necessarily trigger an immediate correction to $78,500. Notably, Martinez’s analysis reveals that support levels at $92,000 and $86,000 could provide Bitcoin bulls with ample opportunity to reassert market control. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105,194 following a 1.79% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 37.04%, indicating a boost in market transactions and general trading activity. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin remains the crypto market leader with an impressive 62.75% dominance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern?

2025-06-14T20:20:31,"Philippe Laffont said Bitcoin is becoming a core portfolio asset as its volatility drops","Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, told attendees at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in New York City on Thursday that Bitcoin is becoming a serious part of traditional portfolios as its once-wild volatility continues to drop. The hedge fund boss said he believes the asset is moving from speculative territory into something more foundational, with price behavior starting to look closer to legacy markets. Laffont explained that Coatue had initially avoided bitcoin because of how unstable it used to be. But now, the math is changing. “It’s intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into bitcoin is shrinking,” he said. “If the beta shrinks, that would be very interesting.” The term beta is used to compare an asset’s volatility to the broader market. Institutions buy in as behavior of holders changes Laffont pointed out that Bitcoin has climbed almost 13% so far in 2025. That’s not what stood out to him, though. What mattered more was how price movements now feel more controlled than in previous years. In 2022, bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33%. It was one of those years that kept Coatue on the sidelines. Fast forward to April 2025, after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs, and the picture looked very different. From April 2 to April 10, bitcoin dropped about 5%, while the Nasdaq fell over 6%. That’s the kind of performance that signals a maturing asset. He said this improvement in behavior wasn’t just about price. It’s about the people holding it. Laffont noted that there’s been a sharp decline in the number of bitcoin wallets that sell their entire holdings after just one month. “That’s come down a lot,” he said . Instead of trading in and out, more holders are staying in for the long run. That’s a critical change in market dynamics, especially when it comes to institutional comfort. Another sign of that change? Big names are getting involved. Laffont mentioned BlackRock, saying the firm played a leading role in bringing bitcoin ETFs to the market. That kind of participation wasn’t possible until recently. Now that the biggest asset managers are getting behind it, more institutions are following. Laffont believes this is pushing bitcoin toward becoming a necessary part of portfolios. He said the asset only represents about $2 trillion out of the world’s $500 trillion in total wealth. That’s still a tiny share. But if people keep valuing it, he argued, it “has to become more central.” The growth potential, by his measure, is still huge. Laffont admits missing the early wave and tells others not to overdo it Coatue hasn’t stayed completely out of crypto. Laffont said the firm has investments in both private and public companies in the space, including Dune Analytics, Hut 8, and CoreWeave. CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure firm, works with bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Still, Laffont made it clear he regrets not going deeper into bitcoin itself. “Every night, I wake up at about three in the morning and I go, ‘What an idiot. Why didn’t I invest more in bitcoin?’” he said. He blamed his delay on overthinking. Laffont said he used to focus too much on complex theories and debates about use cases. But the core truth was simple: value grows when people believe in it. “As long as other people think it’s valuable, it gets more valuable over time – and that’s what we missed,” he said. Now, he said he tells investors to consider putting “one or two or 3% or 4%” of their assets into bitcoin as a way to protect themselves from inflation. He also described how his clients fall into three groups. There are the ones who trust him and don’t ask questions. Then there are the ones who confront him with “Why did you miss one of the biggest trends in the world?” And finally, there are the cautious ones who are still uncomfortable with anything crypto-related. “That,” Laffont said, “is the dying population.” He said those people are getting fewer every year. Even as Laffont has warmed up to bitcoin , he still warned people not to make it the center of their portfolios. “For those of you that think bitcoin is going to be important, my recommendation is never make it such a big portion of your portfolio that it becomes the driving factor of the portfolio,” he said. His advice is to keep it small and steady. “You’re going to make way more money by having a smaller position that you can keep for 10 years than the big one that worries you all the time.”",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/laffont-bitcoin-turning-into-a-core-asset/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare

According to Swissblock, Bitcoin is “stalling below $110,000” and the upward trend is now under pressure as a broad trading range appears to form between the resistance level and a price of $100,000. “Consolidation may last, but one thing’s clear: No breakout without strong fundamentals.” Source: Swissblock/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,447 at time of writing, around 7% below the all-time high of just under $112,000 reached last month. Earlier in the week, Swissblock had warned that a failure by Bitcoin to break out amid a lack of fresh investor flows could lead to a double-top. A double-top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern formed when the price of an asset forms two consecutive peaks, an indication that there’s a strong resistance level that the price is unable to pierce through. Source: Swissblock/X According to Bitcoin Vector, a joint report by Swissblock and on-chain analyst Willy Woo, BTC liquidity has been trending lower for the past couple of days, an indication of falling volume levels, a declining number of transactions and reduced activity. But Bitcoin Vector says a further correction is unlikely. “Here’s the interesting part: network growth remains stable, participants are not leaving the market.

2025-06-14T19:47:21,"ADA Hovers Around $0.62 as New Enterprise Product Launch Offsets Whale-Driven Pressure","Cardano's ADA ADA was down 1.71% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.6229 as of June 14. The asset briefly slipped to $0.6176 before stabilizing, holding its footing despite a sharp wave of selling from large holders. According to recent market data, whales have offloaded over 270 million ADA —worth roughly $170 million — in a move that has added significant pressure to the token’s price action during a week marked by geopolitical volatility. Yet, amid the sell-off, the Cardano Foundation unveiled a new product aimed at enterprise adoption. On Thursday, the organization launched Originate , a blockchain-based solution for verifying product origin and authenticity. Designed to help businesses streamline compliance and protect against counterfeits, Originate allows companies to digitize and track critical product data on-chain, enabling instant verification by consumers and regulators. On its website, the Foundation emphasized that Originate is built to strengthen brand trust in industries where supply chain transparency is critical. By positioning itself as a tool for regulatory compliance and consumer assurance, the product may help bolster Cardano’s reputation in enterprise circles —especially at a time when investors are searching for real-world use cases beyond DeFi and staking. The announcement comes just days after ADA was added to the Nasdaq Crypto Index , joining Bitcoin and Ethereum. While short-term sentiment remains fragile due to whale behavior and broader risk-off macro trends, Cardano’s expanding institutional profile could provide longer-term support. Technical Analysis Highlights ADA ranged between $0.6176 and $0.6428, closing near $0.6229, a 1.71% daily loss. Resistance remains strong near $0.642–$0.645, while price broke below support at $0.636. Heaviest volume spikes occurred after 18:00 GMT as price dipped below $0.62, triggering brief sell-off followed by consolidation. Trend remains bearish with lower highs forming throughout the day, and rejection at $0.635.

However, this dream hit a major stumbling block after geopolitical tensions quickly escalated in the late hours of Thursday, June 13. It didn’t take much time for Israel’s airstrike against Iran to impact the global financial markets, with crypto prices succumbing to a fresh wave of downward pressure. Specifically, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost about 6% of its value in the past 24 hours. Is Capital Flowing Out Of ETH Into BTC? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha shared fresh insights into the wave of volatility that recently hit the cryptocurrency market. The crypto pundit noted that Ethereum and Bitcoin were particularly impacted by the recent global happenings. Related Reading: A Rare Bitcoin Signal Is Flashing: Could the Bull Run Just Be Getting Started? Firstly, Taha noted the decline in the Ethereum Open Interest (OI) on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the ETH OI metric experienced a significant 19% dip in the past 24 hours, coinciding with a decrease in price. The Open Interest indicator estimates the total amount of money flowing into derivatives of a specific cryptocurrency at any given time. A falling OI value is often considered a bearish signal, as it suggests a decline in investor confidence and positive sentiment. According to Taha, this latest abrupt decline in the Ethereum Open Interest points to a wave of panic-induced selling, with investors instinctively exiting their long positions. “Traders likely rushed to close their long positions, either manually in fear of deeper losses or automatically via forced liquidations as stop-loss triggers were hit,” the analyst said. Taha drew a parallel relationship between the falling Ethereum Open Interest and the flow of Bitcoin out of Coinbase, the largest centralized exchange in the United States. CryptoQuant data shows a significant withdrawal of 7,000 BTC from the trading platform in the past day. According to Taha, this substantial exchange outflow of Bitcoin, coinciding precisely with the Ethereum OI decline, suggests fresh buying and that large investors may be strategically repositioning for accumulation. This trend might not be particularly positive for ETH, as it shows that capital might be rotating back into the premier cryptocurrency. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,546, reflecting an almost 4% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-14T19:00:04,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Jumps as Over 537M SHIB Set Ablaze","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most well-known memecoins, has significantly increased its burn rate over the past 24 hours. More than 537 million worth of SHIB coins have been taken out of circulation. This caused the burn rate to jump by 3,484%, a massive increase from the day before. This turn of events has made the SHIB community more hopeful for the token’s future. This came after the SHIB ecosystem improved its decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. Massive Token Burn Fuels Shiba Inu Price Jump Burning coins usually helps reduce the total supply, making the remaining coins more valuable. Following this large burn, SHIB’s price increased by 4.12%, trading at $0.000012, and its total market value crossed $7.2 billion. This price bounce came shortly after SHIB dropped by 10% earlier in the week. This drop was caused mainly by a bigger dip in the crypto market, which reacted to rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Furthermore, Shibburn tracking platform shows that the recent increase in SHIB’s burn rate continues a trend seen earlier this week. In a notable move, one wallet alone burned over 500 million SHIB in the past 12 hours. The Shiba Inu community has used token burning to help support long-term value. As SHIB’s price went up, its future open interest rose by over 4%, reaching $141.85 million. According to Coinglass data, traders are showing more confidence in SHIB’s short-term performance. A rise in open interest usually means more trading activity and a stronger belief in the token’s direction. This geopolitical tension also shook the entire crypto market. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) dropped 2.8% after the incident , falling from $106,042 to $103,053. However, the flagship crypto seems to be back on a bullish path. According to CoinMarketCap data, it is trading at $105,092 at the time of writing, up 0.27% in the past 24 hours. SHIB Whale Activity Drops Despite Price Uptick Even though the token burn and price rise are good signs, data shows that large-scale SHIB holders are pulling back . In the past 24 hours, large transaction volume has dropped 65%. Wallets with at least $100,000 worth of SHIB have seen a significant slowdown in activity. This points to weakening interest among big investors, possibly due to recent market uncertainty. On June 6, the enormous transaction volume hit 17.63 trillion SHIB. However, this has dropped to just 948.59 billion SHIB, showing that many big investors are pulling away. Experts say if larger investors continue to reduce their holdings, it may put downward pressure on the SHIB price. Still, if the burn rate remains high and market confidence improves, SHIB could regain strength.

2025-06-14T19:00:02,"Billionaire Investor Ray Dalio Outlines Meme Stock Trading Strategy, Says Investors Are Not Paying Enough Attention to the ‘Most Important Thing’","Billionaire hedge fund legend Ray Dalio thinks investors aren’t paying attention to obvious factors in meme stock trading. Dalio says in a new post on X that there’s always a “current most popular meme” that everyone believes in but is bound to lose its status. “These memes typically are due to a mix of extrapolating what happened before and emotional considerations. Also, most investors typically don’t take into consideration market pricing. In other words, they tend to identify what has been a great investment (e.g., a strongly performing company) as great, and they don’t pay enough attention to its pricing, even though its pricing (whether it is cheap or expensive) is the most important thing.” Dalio says this behavior sets the stage for potential market missteps, especially in the current economic climate. At this time, it is typical for almost everyone to be looking to make money by buying assets that they believe will go up (rather than betting on them going down), and they quite often use leverage.” Dalio’s meme trading advice follows dire warnings he’s recently issued about the US economy. Earlier this month, Dalio argued in an interview on PBS that the government needs to lower its budget deficit as a percentage of GDP from 7% to 3%. “It has to be done with three things, and it has to be spread out among these three things, because any one of those three things would be too painful. Those three things are tax revenue, spending cuts and interest rates. Although Congress and the president in the process does not deal directly with the third of those, right now a trillion dollars – half of our deficit – is interest payments, and not only do we have a trillion dollar interest payment, in the next year, we have nine trillion dollars of debt maturing that has to be either rolled over or sold… So there’s what I call my 3%, three-part solution, which was very similar to 1991-1998. It was cut by 5% of GDP, the budget deficit, in those years was cut by 5% of GDP by spreading it around. So those are the three things that are needed.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-14T18:45:30,"NBA Legend Shaquille O’Neal To Settle FTX Endorsement Lawsuit for $1,800,000","New court filings show that NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal will settle a lawsuit related to the endorsement of defunct crypto exchange FTX for $1.8 million. According to recent court documents, the retired superstar is settling a lawsuit where he’s accused of promoting FTX, which went bankrupt in 2022 after its chief executive, Sam Bankman-Fried, was found to be mishandling billions of dollars worth of customer funds as well as defrauding investors. “This proposed settlement… results from the tremendous efforts of the parties, with negotiations informed by previous mediations and settlement agreements which were reached in this action. Defendant O’Neal has agreed to provide $1,800,000 in monetary relief in exchange for reaching this early settlement, which amount will be paid within 30 days after the effective date of the settlement.” However, the agreement between the parties is still pending approval from the court. O’Neal and other marquee celebrities – such as fellow NBA superstar Stephen Curry, NFL quarterbacks Tom Brady and Trevor Lawrence, MLB pitcher Shohei Ohtani, Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary, and supermodel Gisele Bündchen – were all accused of failing to perform due diligence before promoting FTX in a class action lawsuit filed in 2022. O’Neal, who received $750,000 to endorse the crypto exchange, first agreed to a settlement in April, though the amount at the time was undisclosed. Bankman-Fried was found guilty of his crimes in 2023 and was sentenced to 25 years behind bars in 2024.

2025-06-14T18:41:17,"Bitcoin’s Stability Tested Following Trump’s ‘Very Alarming’ Remarks on Middle East Tension","Reports have emerged about a hours-long phone conversation between the heads of state of the US and Russia, where topics ranged from the growing tension in the Middle East to Donald Trump’s birthday. According to some publications, the POTUS described the Israel-Iran situation as “very alarming,” as there’s no closure in sight. BREAKING: President Trump tells Putin that the situation in the Middle East is “very alarming.” — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) June 14, 2025 Recall the events that transpired between the two nations located in the Middle East as Israel hit Iran first on Friday morning, killing over 70 people in the process, including high-end generals and nuclear scientists. Iran responded last night, but the damage was significantly less. Although Trump previously expressed hope that Iran could be closer to signing a nuclear deal now, he and Putin were reportedly concerned about the recent escalation, as the conflict is nowhere near a resolution. Nevertheless, both still “did not rule out a return to negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program,” reported the Moscow Times, citing a statement from the Kremlin. Israel’s attack against Iran earlier this week had an immediate and profound impact on the cryptocurrency market, with BTC slumping from a Thursday peak of $108,500 to under $103,000 on Friday morning. Iran’s response failed to influence the market in a similar manner, but BTC is back in the red after Trump’s most recent remarks. Some analysts warned that the largest cryptocurrency could plunge below $80,000 if the sell-off intensifies and it fails to maintain the $100,000 support. BTCUSD.

Responding to a user’s question regarding token plans for MetaMask, Lubin announced that the company is developing short- and medium-term strategic plans and that the first token distribution will take place on the LINEA network. He noted that future protocols are designed to work in synergy with each other. A few days ago, ConsenSys shared the news of a significant acquisition with the public.

2025-06-14T18:17:03,"Analyst sets Bitcoin’s next buying opportunity after BTC ‘started to cascade south’","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has entered a volatile phase, and according to cryptocurrency analyst Michaël van de Poppe, this could soon present a new buying opportunity. His outlook follows recent losses that dragged the broader market lower, triggered by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. After failing to hold above $106,000, Bitcoin began what Poppe described as a “cascade south,” slicing through liquidity zones and prompting a wave of sell-offs, he noted in a June 14 X post. A brief bounce followed, but the recovery was quickly rejected at the same $106,000 level, now acting as firm resistance. The leading digital currency had regained bullish momentum earlier, only to lose it after a liquidity sweep and sharp rejection at a local high. Now, the $101,500 to $102,500 range could serve as either a launchpad for recovery or a setup for further downside. To this end, Poppe noted that a fresh rally could take shape if Bitcoin holds above $102,500 and consolidates. But if selling pressure intensifies, he sees the $98,000 to $99,000 zone as a strong candidate for a high-probability long entry. $BTC has a very similar picture. We couldn't hold above $106K and then we started to cascade south taking all the liquidity. Bounce upwards, instant rejection at that crucial level. Two options; – Sub $100K buy opportunity if this continues to fall. – Price holds around… pic.twitter.com/dOCjnBBtOP — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 14, 2025 At the same time, Bitcoin’s volume profile supports this view, highlighting heavy selling after the failed breakout. A lower support zone could also be a trap for late short positions, offering an ideal re-entry point for bullish traders. Key Bitcoin price levels to watch In a separate June 14 analysis, RLinda noted that Bitcoin is consolidating within a broad range between $100,600 and $110,400. The Middle East geopolitical tension spike briefly disrupted its bullish structure, pushing the price down to $102,500 before a sharp recovery. That rebound reinforced support at $102,500, with $106,200 now a key resistance level. Despite market uncertainty, Bitcoin continues to hold above critical support. According to the analyst, short-term trading strategies remain viable if the cryptocurrency stays within the $100,600 to $102,500 range. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Therefore, a breakout above $106,200 could open the door to $108,200 or even $110,400. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $104,600, down 0.4% on the day and nearly 4% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The revelation came through a detailed financial disclosure filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which was viewed by the Financial Times. The 200-page report identifies World Liberty Financial as one of Trump’s most significant sources of income, with the president holding 15.75 billion governance tokens. Rather than purchasing the tokens, Trump received them as part of promotional activities related to the platform. Token Holdings Raise Conflict-of-Interest Concerns The report also details Trump’s transactions with other crypto-related companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC, although these companies reported minimal income. While swearing that the filing’s contents are “true, complete, and correct,” ethical concerns have been raised by critics. Trump removed David Huitema, head of the Office of Government Ethics, from office earlier this year, which raised further controversy over his crypto dealings. The SEC, now chaired by Trump appointee Paul Atkins, has eased enforcement actions against crypto firms — a move some say directly benefits Trump’s online venture. World Liberty Financial: $1B Raised, A-List Backers World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance platform, conducted a token offering last year that raised $1 billion through the sale of 21 billion tokens. Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff was a “promoter” for the project, 2024 SEC filings show. Criticisms from both sides of the aisle have been raised over whether Trump’s ongoing profit from crypto investments presents a conflict of interest, especially when creating policy impacting the industry. DRW Investments Shores Up Trump’s Digital Dreams Major financial backing has come from DRW Investments, led by Chicago trader Don Wilson. DRW invested $100 million in Trump Media just weeks after its affiliate Cumberland received SEC enforcement relief from the new administration. This support enables Trump Media’s plans to raise $2.5 billion for a bitcoin treasury strategy and the launch of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).

According to Glassnode , XRP’s 30-day percentage change in realized cap—a metric that measures the total value of coins moved at their last price—has jumped +4.2%. Solana has only seen +1% growth over the same period. $XRP is pulling ahead again. Its 30D % change in Realized Cap just hit +4.2%, outpacing $SOL modest +1%. Capital is rotating faster into #XRP , hinting at stronger short-term conviction: https://t.co/cOSVts1PMm pic.twitter.com/W0eub7oGTe — glassnode (@glassnode) June 13, 2025 This divergence means capital is rotating into XRP faster than Solana, implying short-term accumulation by traders who are positioning for a breakout. Realized cap is especially useful during times of uncertainty, as it shows wealth that has actually moved on-chain rather than speculative market value. A higher realized cap growth often correlates with more network activity and investor confidence. For context: XRP 30D Realized Cap: +4.2% SOL 30D Realized Cap: +1% The big jump in XRP’s realized capital could be seen as a sign of shifting sentiment among retail and institutional traders alike, possibly ahead of regulatory clarity or broader crypto market momentum. XRP Technical Analysis Says Be Cautious Despite the on-chain strength, XRP’s chart is still cautionary. It’s trading at $2.13, down 0.70% in the last 24 hours and stuck below a descending trendline that has rejected every bullish attempt since early June. XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Price action failed to reclaim the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart (now at $2.19), and XRP has printed a lower high. Red-bodied candles with rejection wicks at $2.18 show continued resistance. The MACD has a slight bullish crossover, but the histogram is fading, so not much momentum for now. Key Technical Levels: Resistance: $2.18, $2.22 Support: $2.09, $2.0474, $2.0042 EMA Barrier: 50-EMA at $2.19 XRP price prediction remains bearish unless XRP breaks above the descending trendline and confirms strength above $2.22; traders may continue to see downside pressure. XRP Trade Setups to Watch As XRP consolidates under resistance, traders have clearly defined levels to monitor for both bullish and bearish strategies. Short Trade Idea: Entry: Rejection near $2.18 Stop: Above $2.22 Targets: $2.0936, $2.0474 Long Trade Setup: Entry: Breakout and close above $2.22 Stop: Below $2.18 Targets: $2.27, $2.3365 For now, the fundamentals suggest investor interest is heating up, but price must follow through with a clean breakout to confirm the next leg higher. Until then, XRP remains at a technical crossroads.
