2025-06-15T05:24:24,"Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next? Experts Split","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again testing the nerves of traders worldwide, hovering just above $105,000 today as forecasts split the crypto community in half. Will the king cryptocurrency explode to $175,000 this cycle, or nosedive to under $80,000 if fear grips the market? The $175K Dream On the bullish side, pseudonymous chart-watcher Egrag Crypto supercharged hopium this week, predicting a huge breakout in the next few months. According to the analyst, BTC’s historical cycle data suggests the asset is primed for a 102% surge, which would catapult it to $175,000 from its current levels. “The average of three major pumps this cycle is 102%, hitting $175K!” they tweeted, pointing to eerily similar patterns in previous bull markets. The way Bitcoin shrugged off the effects of recent geopolitical upheavals has only bolstered Egrag’s bullish case. After Israel struck multiple Iranian nuclear and military assets, the cryptocurrency cratered, going from a daily high near $108,500 to just under $103,000, before clawing its way back to around $105,000 today. Other optimists, like DeFiTracer, also highlighted similar war-driven dips in April and October 2024, when each was followed by 48% and 74% explosions upward. “Don’t let whales and news manipulate you,” he wrote on X, suggesting June’s 4% dip is merely fuel for the next bump upward. The Bear Trap However, not everyone is buying the hype just yet. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez has tempered the euphoria, warning that the market could be on the brink of a sharp correction if key levels don’t hold. He backed his pessimism, pointing to whales offloading nearly 30,000 BTC in the past week as well as a weakening support floor around the hundred grand level. If this floor gives way, Martinez predicts a drop to as low as $78,500. His sentiment was echoed by crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who noted that BTC just failed to hold above $106,000, triggering a liquidity cascade southwards. “Two options,” he warned: A sub-$100,000 buying opportunity or a fresh rally if prices hold at around $102,500. Market observer Axel Adler Jr. also weighed in , drawing attention to BTC’s OBV (On-Balance Volume), which is still stuck in the red near $100,000. According to him, it means that any bullish momentum could be paper-thin. The post Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next?

2025-06-15T04:45:10,"Crypto price predictions: Pi Network, Monero, and Fartcoin","The crypto market was mixed on Sunday as investors focused on the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. Bitcoin was stuck above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens dropped to $3.28 trillion. This article explores the top crypto forecasts of coins like Pi Network (PI), Monero (XMR), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Pi Network price prediction Pi coin price chart | Source: TradingView Pi coin has come under pressure in the past few weeks as it plunged to $0.3945 on Friday, down from last month’s high of $1.6567. The token has stabilized a bit and moved to over $0.60 today, a 50% surge. Technicals point to more Pi Network gains as it has formed a triple-bottom pattern at around $0.60. A triple-bottom is made up of three distinct bottoms and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $1.6567. The token is attempting to move above the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Oscillators like the MACD and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Pi Network token price will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $1, which is about 61% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.3945 will invalidate the bullish Pi Network forecast. Monero price forecast XMR price chart | Source: TradingView Monero, the biggest privacy-focused coin, has crashed in the past two weeks, erasing some of the gains made earlier this year. The initial gains happened as demand for privacy tokens soared. XMR token retreated from a high of $420 to $315 today as investors booked profits. Monero has moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also remains slightly above the 50-day and 100-day EMA. Most importantly, it has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $301.05. A double-bottom pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, Monero token will likely bounce back as long as it remains above the double-bottom pattern at $301. Such a move will see it rise and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $353, which is about 12% above the current level. A drop below the support at $301 will invalidate the bullish Monero price forecast. Fartcoin price forecast Fartcoin chart | Source: TradingView Fartcoin, a top meme coin on the Solana network , has been one of the most actively traded tokens this year. Its recent surge saw it peak at $1.6520 in May. It then pulled back and reached a low of $0.8715, its lowest point on June 5, and then bounced back to the current $1.20. Fartcoin token remains above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated and moved to the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the Fartcoin price will likely resume the uptrend, and potentially retest the psychological point at $1.50. A drop below the support at $0.8715 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-15T04:00:59,"Analyst Drops Bearish Bombshell: Bitcoin To $93,500, Ethereum To $2,100, XRP To $1.6","Bitcoin has continued to hover around the $105,000 price level for the past 24 hours, a level which it has respected for most of the past seven days. Ethereum, on the other hand, is trying to hold above $2,500, while XRP is also holding its ground above $2.10 within the past 24 hours. Some analysts still expect a resumption of bullish momentum once the current range breaks to the upside, but others have taken a more cautious or outright pessimistic stance. One of such bearish outlooks in recent days came from crypto commentator Warren MUPPET, who shared a forecast of a strong downside correction for Bitcoin and other large cryptocurrencies. Analyst Predicts Crash Scenario For Major Cryptos The broader crypto market appears to be stuck in a consolidation range, with the Fear & Greed Index currently reading 52, which is a neutral sentiment that could easily swing in either direction. According to crypto analyst Warren MUPPET on the social media platform X, this swing will be to the downside. Particularly, the crypto commentator recently posted a blunt list of projected price levels that sent waves through some crypto traders. The post, with no charts or technical context, had simply highlighted the price targets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Fartcoin, and Hype. Despite the lack of technical and and fundamental analysis explanation, the message was clear that a sharp correction could be on the horizon. According to the analyst, Bitcoin will crash from its current price levels to $93,500, Ethereum will crash to $2,100, Fartcoin will crash to $0.68, XRP will crash to $1.6, and Hype will crash to $28. In one of the comments to the original post, the crypto commentator also predicted the possibility of Solana crashing to $85. These numbers might seem extreme to some, but they are not far-fetched. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP all crahsed to these price levels just two months ago in April. This gives some credibility to the warning and if sentiment turns negative, a drop to these prices may not be out of the picture. Prolonged Consolidation Could Lead To Price Crash Previous price action data suggests that bearish phases often come up swiftly after prolonged consolidation in high zones. If that plays out again, Bitcoin slipping below $100,000 could quickly escalate into a wider marlet price crash. Also, with Ethereum and XRP also consolidating around their respective resistance levels, the chances of a synchronized following Bitcoin crash below $100,000 can’t be ruled out. Therefore, the bullish/bearish outlook all depends on if Bitcoin can hold above $100,000. If sentiment weakens in the coming days, the analyst’s projections may no longer seem like an exaggeration. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,096, Ethereum is trading at $2,540, XRP is trading at $2.16, while Hype is trading at $42.

Hoskinson replied with a wide-scope plan that is not limited to RLUSD. His comments followed a user’s inquiry about whether the Ripple-backed stablecoin RealUSD (RLUSD) would be available on Cardano. He mentioned that a full “ XRP package ” is on the way, with plans for XRP DeFi integration, support for Lace wallet, “glacier drops,’ and ongoing talks about RealUSD. He did not make a fine point about timing, but his reply confirmed that high-level discussions were taking place. Cardano gears up for XRP integration with RLUSD As soon as RLUSD was mentioned, the cryptocurrency community went into overdrive, with many hoping for information on when they could access the stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain . However, Hoskinson’s reply suggests that RLUSD is part of the bigger plan, which involves all the other Ripple-related assets. One term that emerged with greater prominence was “glacier drops.” While not commonly used in the space, the term refers to a controlled and staggered release of tokens or features — analogous to a focused airdrop effort pegged to product milestones. Lace wallet support is also on the agenda. As Cardano’s official wallet was built emphasizing user experience, Lace’s integration with XRP would streamline access for users looking to manage Ripple-based assets within the Cardano ecosystem. Equally significant is the mention of DeFi. Historically, XRP has had a limited role in decentralized finance. Its integration into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure could unlock new use cases — such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision — potentially attracting more users and developers to the platform. While no final decisions have been made public, Hoskinson’s remarks shed more light on Cardano’s dedication to interoperability, interest in stablecoin adoption, and interest in growing their presence in the DeFi space. Through the integration of RLUSD, XRP DeFi utilities, advanced wallet features, and token drops, Cardano is gearing up to vie for its share of the competitive blockchain ecosystem. If it works, this could be important for Cardano in expanding its ecosystem and offering itself a bit more than it is to an even larger crypto market. Hoskinson proposes strategic investments to grow Cardano’s treasury Hoskinson recently shared insight into what the Cardano community should expect regarding the ecosystem’s decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). He gave the update in an 18-minute-long podcast on X to ecosystem members. According to Hoskinson, the team is considering several approaches to improving and growing the Cardano SWF. He maintained that the goal is to use the fund’s resources to benefit the ecosystem. Hoskinson explained that the decentralized Cardano SWF is similar in principle to how countries like Norway invest national wealth into assets for future benefits. He proposed investing a small portion of the Cardano treasury in different assets. “Could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it to a blend of a collection of stablecoins … and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin/DeFi?” he asked. The plan aims to mitigate risk, create long-term yield, and reinvest the money into buying back ADA. This sets up Cardano’s Sovereign Wealth Fund to grow the ecosystem and, consequently, the value of ADA as time goes on. Cardano could make relatively easy returns without significantly eating into its core reserves by dedicating a portion of the treasury to Bitcoin and similar assets. When used to acquire ADA, these profits may increase demand and sustain the market price. Charles Hoskinson describes an economic model designed to be self-sustaining for the Cardano community.

At the same time, Bitcoin’s technical chart is sending mixed signals that could lead to a breakout in either direction. After a failed attempt to reclaim $110,000 earlier this week, the price has now slipped below the 21-day moving average, but still above support at the 50-day moving average. This confluence of moving averages, coupled with a clearly defined trendline resistance, has brought Bitcoin into a tightening price structure of a descending triangle pattern. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Descending Triangle With Tightening Range And Bearish Pressure According to a crypto analyst on X, Bitcoin is forming a descending triangle pattern on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. Interestingly, technical analysis rules state that the descending triangle pattern setup is typically associated with bearish breakdowns. The chart image accompanying the post shows repeated rejection from a downward-sloping trendline that began when Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $111,814 on May 22. The second rejection was a lower high around $110,000 earlier this week. On the other hand, the base of the triangle has remained constant with a support zone around $102,000. The analyst noted that the 21-day moving average (21MA), shown in blue, is exerting downward pressure, acting as resistance, while the 50-day moving average (50MA), in green, is acting as a temporary support floor. As price action continues to narrow within this triangle move, the market is on the projection for a decisive move in any direction. Whether it breaks above the resistance or falls through the support will likely dictate the next major trend. However, if the descending triangle pattern continues to play out with lower highs and steady support, the breakout will lean more towards a downside breakout. Israel-Iran Tensions May Push Breakout Or Breakdown The ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran could be the spark that forces Bitcoin out of its current range. Notably, a wave of liquidations hit the crypto market on Friday as reports of an Israeli airstrike on Iran made the news. During periods of geopolitical instability like this, Bitcoin often trades in unpredictable ways. There are two possible outcomes for the leading cryptocurrency from here. It could act as a haven, or it could be sold off for liquidity. If the fear in traditional markets continues to increase, Bitcoin could break below the $102,000 support in the coming trading sessions, confirming the descending triangle’s bearish implications.

Bittensor (TAO) dipped to about $399, forming a strong buy area. Aptos (APT) saw a whopping $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume, ranking it among the top two globally. But Unstaked takes the lead. It backs real AI tools, not empty promises. The presale price of Unstaked (UNSD) sits at $0.01139 in Stage 20. With a $5+ forecast, 3000x gains look plausible. Over $9.7 million has been raised, and about 1.1 billion coins sold. After launch, live AI agents will transition fully to on-chain and operational status. Bittensor’s Sub‑$400 Dip Sparks Buy Alert Bittensor (TAO) currently trades around $399 following an 8% drop this week and 5% over two weeks. This underperformance contrasts with broader market gains. Analyst Michael van de Poppe labels this zone a strong buy. He notes capitulation from weak holders and increased interest from stronger hands. A rounding bottom pattern is emerging, hinting at a possible bullish reversal. TAO remains the top‑ranked AI coin. If momentum returns, targets could range from $425 to $433, and even $700 to $800. For those tracking smart AI coins, Bittensor appears to offer a solid accumulation opportunity. Aptos Surges With $1.6B Stablecoin Activity Aptos (APT) shows impressive growth across its ecosystem. Bridging brought in over $30 million in BTC via OKX’s xBTC in one week. Stablecoin volume reached $1.6 billion, led by USDT, USDC, and USDe. Echo Protocol secured $275 million in TVL. Thala Labs contributed $850 million in DeFi volume. Transaction growth ranks Aptos among the global top two. The chain added 39 ambassadors, distributed $3.4 million in rewards and hosted a major NFT mint. It also expanded tools like Kana Learn, gaming features, naming services, plus real‑world activations such as UNTOLD Festival. With rising activity and user adoption, Aptos is gaining serious momentum. Unstaked’s On‑Chain AI Agents Drive Real Value Unstaked delivers working AI systems that users can deploy immediately after launch. These AI agents act autonomously and run on platforms like X and Telegram. They automate outreach, manage communities, and engage 24/7. Every action is verifiable with proof‑of‑activity on‑chain. No coding is needed. This means creators and crypto teams get powerful automation without hiring staff. These agents are cheaper than an intern and more scalable. They are exactly what crypto promised, but seldom delivered. The presale price is $0.01139 in Stage 20. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, the project already shows momentum. These figures are not hype. They reflect actual buyers’ interest backed by real tech. Most importantly, these AI agents will go live after launch. That means users can deploy them immediately to earn on‑chain rewards. They can customize agent behavior to fit specific goals or communities. Once live, agents will interact, learn, and earn autonomously. That level of real‑world use cements value. A project becomes strong when its product is live and working. Unstaked meets that test. Featuring coinized AI tools, seamless deployment, and on‑chain verification, Unstaked offers clear utility. With a future price target of $5+, the potential return over the $0.01139 presale price is striking. Real use cases, strong funding, and live agents after launch mark Unstaked as a utility‑driven leader. It stands apart from speculative coins by delivering actual functionality tied to actual value. Unstaked may well be the best performing crypto today by real‑world impact and math Final Verdict Bittensor’s drop under $400 may signal a buying setup toward $700+. Aptos is thriving with $30 million BTC inflow, $1.6 billion in stablecoin volume and top global transaction growth. Both projects have strong traction. But Unstaked operates differently. It builds coinized AI agents that automate outreach, grow communities and run on‑chain with proof. Priced at $0.01139 (Stage 20), with over $9.7 million raised and more than 1.1 billion coins sold, it ties real use to real value. Live AI agents post‑launch will cement its utility. This makes Unstaked the standout play rather than just hype.

2025-06-15T00:26:42,"Raoul Pal Says Global Liquidity Influences Bitcoin Price","Macro investor Raoul Pal recently pointed out that global liquidity levels more influence the Bitcoin (BTC) price than by political events. In a post on X , Paul shared an analysis showing that changes in global liquidity determine the coin’s movement. He noted that despite rising tensions between Israel and Iran, Bitcoin’s price has not reacted much. Raoul Pal Says Liquidity Moves BTC, Not News Raoul Pal shared a chart showing that 89% of Bitcoin’s price moves over the past three years match changes in the global M2 money supply, which measures the amount of money in global circulation. He says this link has held steady through wars, elections, and interest rate changes. The chart suggests that when more money flows into the global economy, Bitcoin tends to rise. When money is tight, Bitcoin often falls. This analysis is poised to give investors a clearer view of Bitcoin’s long-term trend . Pal argues that while short-term events like oil prices or political news can cause small swings, they do not mainly influence the asset’s price. In his view, Bitcoin mostly follows global liquidity, not headlines. Middle East Conflict and Oil Prices Fail to Impact BTC Recent reports revealed that Israel carried out strikes on Iran’s energy infrastructure, including attacks on the South Pars gas field. The incident led to a fire outbreak and raised fears of possible disruptions to the global energy supply. As a result, oil prices jumped, with analysts at Alva reporting that oil futures rose by more than 7% in just a few hours. Additionally, the Kobeissi Letter reported that traders expect further price increases in the oil market by Monday. Some experts also warned about risks to key shipping routes if the situation worsens. Despite these developments, Bitcoin’s price moved only 0.02%. This minor change supports Pal’s view that such events, unless they impact the global money supply, do not have a lasting effect on BTC’s direction. Bitcoin Holds Ground Amid Market Instability Bitcoin’s climb toward a new high was cut short after reports of Israeli airstrikes on Tehran, causing panic across global markets. BTC fell 2.8%, dropping from $106,042 to a low of $103,053. This sharp decline brought it near the key $100,000 level and triggered widespread liquidations. It has since recovered slightly to around $104,787, down just 0.34% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. Despite the volatility, Bitcoin remains steady and shows resilience amid global uncertainty.

2025-06-14T22:00:09,"$57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection","In a financial disclosure filed June 13 with the US Office of Government Ethics, US President Donald Trump reported earning $57.4 million from World Liberty Financial—a crypto venture he launched alongside his sons, Donald Jr. and Eric. The form also reveals he holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the project, giving him direct voting power over its direction. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Trump’s Token Windfall According to the disclosure, Trump’s income line reads “$57,437,927.” It doesn’t say if he sold tokens, earned staking rewards, or used another method. But the number is huge. It hints that he either cashed out part of his stake or that an internal valuation put the tokens’ worth very high. Massive Fundraising Rounds Based on reports from March, World Liberty Financial raised $200 million in its first token sale. A second round pulled in $250 million. That brings total fundraising to roughly $550 million. The project kicked off in September 2024. It aims to offer DeFi services and dollar-pegged stablecoins as an alternative to banks. Big Investors Join In Tron founder Justin Sun invested $30 million in November 2024. He got 2 billion WLFI tokens at an early price of $0.015 each. Web3Port added $10 million in January 2025, and Oddiyana Ventures also came on board. They didn’t say how much that fund put in. These bids suggest major players believe the project can grow. Ethics Questions Loom Based on the ethics filing, Trump still has roles in related holding companies like CIC Digital LLC and CIC Ventures LLC. But income from those is small or zero. The form carries his certification that everything is “true, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge.” It will be reviewed by the Office of Government Ethics. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details The disclosure also notes his past digital ventures. He previously reported earnings from NFT projects such as Trump Digital Trading Cards. This time, no new NFT income shows up. Instead, all the focus is on World Liberty Financial. That venture now stands as the biggest piece of his crypto footprint. Critics will point to potential conflicts of interest. A sitting president profiting from tokens that grant voting power in a financial project raises eyebrows. Supporters might argue it’s just savvy investing. Either way, the numbers are out in the open now. And the public can see that Donald Trump made a hefty gain from a startup he helped launch—and that he still holds sway over its future.

2025-06-14T20:30:43,"Bitcoin May Hit $78,500 If This Critical Support Fails – Details","Bitcoin (BTC) prices crashed by almost 5% in the past 48 hours, with growing global tensions following an Israeli airstrike on Iran on June 12. As financial markets reacted to this news, Bitcoin prices dipped to below $103,000 before experiencing a modest rebound to climb into the $105,000 price band. Notably, top market analyst Ali Martinez has observed that the premier cryptocurrency must maintain a particular support line to avoid a major correction based on the active trading channel. $100,000 Support Key To Bitcoin Bull Challenge In an X post on June 13, Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price movement. The expert reveals that BTC has stylishly maintained a range-bound movement since 2024 amidst major price surges and extended market corrections. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drops Below $105K as Binance Net Taker Volume Turns Deep Red Over the last six months, Martinez’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has largely traded between $78,500 and $110,000, establishing multiple vital support and resistance levels within this corridor. During this period, the maiden cryptocurrency has famously retested the upper boundary five times while bouncing off the lower boundary four times. Following Bitcoin’s most recent crash and the propensity for higher market volatility, especially with the potential of a full-scale war in the Middle East, Martinez warns it is critical for Bitcoin bulls to maintain a price point above the $100,000 level, which represents the next major support level in the market. The analyst explains that in line with price behavior within a set trading channel, a decisive close below the $100,000 price point strongly increases the chances for a price return to the lower boundary at $78,500. This situation presents a potential 25% price devaluation for current BTC holdings. On the other hand, maintaining price action above $100,000 keeps bullish momentum intact and raises the probability of a retest of the $110,000 resistance zone, perhaps with the hope of a decisive price breakout beyond the trading channel. However, a breakdown below $100,000 would not necessarily trigger an immediate correction to $78,500. Notably, Martinez’s analysis reveals that support levels at $92,000 and $86,000 could provide Bitcoin bulls with ample opportunity to reassert market control. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $105,194 following a 1.79% decline in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 37.04%, indicating a boost in market transactions and general trading activity. With a market cap of $2.07 trillion, Bitcoin remains the crypto market leader with an impressive 62.75% dominance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following ABCD Pattern?

2025-06-14T20:20:31,"Philippe Laffont said Bitcoin is becoming a core portfolio asset as its volatility drops","Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, told attendees at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in New York City on Thursday that Bitcoin is becoming a serious part of traditional portfolios as its once-wild volatility continues to drop. The hedge fund boss said he believes the asset is moving from speculative territory into something more foundational, with price behavior starting to look closer to legacy markets. Laffont explained that Coatue had initially avoided bitcoin because of how unstable it used to be. But now, the math is changing. “It’s intriguing to me that maybe … the cost of getting into bitcoin is shrinking,” he said. “If the beta shrinks, that would be very interesting.” The term beta is used to compare an asset’s volatility to the broader market. Institutions buy in as behavior of holders changes Laffont pointed out that Bitcoin has climbed almost 13% so far in 2025. That’s not what stood out to him, though. What mattered more was how price movements now feel more controlled than in previous years. In 2022, bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 33%. It was one of those years that kept Coatue on the sidelines. Fast forward to April 2025, after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs, and the picture looked very different. From April 2 to April 10, bitcoin dropped about 5%, while the Nasdaq fell over 6%. That’s the kind of performance that signals a maturing asset. He said this improvement in behavior wasn’t just about price. It’s about the people holding it. Laffont noted that there’s been a sharp decline in the number of bitcoin wallets that sell their entire holdings after just one month. “That’s come down a lot,” he said . Instead of trading in and out, more holders are staying in for the long run. That’s a critical change in market dynamics, especially when it comes to institutional comfort. Another sign of that change? Big names are getting involved. Laffont mentioned BlackRock, saying the firm played a leading role in bringing bitcoin ETFs to the market. That kind of participation wasn’t possible until recently. Now that the biggest asset managers are getting behind it, more institutions are following. Laffont believes this is pushing bitcoin toward becoming a necessary part of portfolios. He said the asset only represents about $2 trillion out of the world’s $500 trillion in total wealth. That’s still a tiny share. But if people keep valuing it, he argued, it “has to become more central.” The growth potential, by his measure, is still huge. Laffont admits missing the early wave and tells others not to overdo it Coatue hasn’t stayed completely out of crypto. Laffont said the firm has investments in both private and public companies in the space, including Dune Analytics, Hut 8, and CoreWeave. CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure firm, works with bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Still, Laffont made it clear he regrets not going deeper into bitcoin itself. “Every night, I wake up at about three in the morning and I go, ‘What an idiot. Why didn’t I invest more in bitcoin?’” he said. He blamed his delay on overthinking. Laffont said he used to focus too much on complex theories and debates about use cases. But the core truth was simple: value grows when people believe in it. “As long as other people think it’s valuable, it gets more valuable over time – and that’s what we missed,” he said. Now, he said he tells investors to consider putting “one or two or 3% or 4%” of their assets into bitcoin as a way to protect themselves from inflation. He also described how his clients fall into three groups. There are the ones who trust him and don’t ask questions. Then there are the ones who confront him with “Why did you miss one of the biggest trends in the world?” And finally, there are the cautious ones who are still uncomfortable with anything crypto-related. “That,” Laffont said, “is the dying population.” He said those people are getting fewer every year. Even as Laffont has warmed up to bitcoin , he still warned people not to make it the center of their portfolios. “For those of you that think bitcoin is going to be important, my recommendation is never make it such a big portion of your portfolio that it becomes the driving factor of the portfolio,” he said. His advice is to keep it small and steady. “You’re going to make way more money by having a smaller position that you can keep for 10 years than the big one that worries you all the time.”",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/laffont-bitcoin-turning-into-a-core-asset/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","",cryptocompare

According to Swissblock, Bitcoin is “stalling below $110,000” and the upward trend is now under pressure as a broad trading range appears to form between the resistance level and a price of $100,000. “Consolidation may last, but one thing’s clear: No breakout without strong fundamentals.” Source: Swissblock/X Bitcoin is trading at $104,447 at time of writing, around 7% below the all-time high of just under $112,000 reached last month. Earlier in the week, Swissblock had warned that a failure by Bitcoin to break out amid a lack of fresh investor flows could lead to a double-top. A double-top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern formed when the price of an asset forms two consecutive peaks, an indication that there’s a strong resistance level that the price is unable to pierce through. Source: Swissblock/X According to Bitcoin Vector, a joint report by Swissblock and on-chain analyst Willy Woo, BTC liquidity has been trending lower for the past couple of days, an indication of falling volume levels, a declining number of transactions and reduced activity. But Bitcoin Vector says a further correction is unlikely. “Here’s the interesting part: network growth remains stable, participants are not leaving the market. This aligns with a key point from Bitcoin Vector: profit-taking remains low, meaning selling pressure is limited.” Source: Bitcoin Vector/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-14T19:47:21,"ADA Hovers Around $0.62 as New Enterprise Product Launch Offsets Whale-Driven Pressure","Cardano's ADA ADA was down 1.71% over the past 24 hours, trading at $0.6229 as of June 14. The asset briefly slipped to $0.6176 before stabilizing, holding its footing despite a sharp wave of selling from large holders. According to recent market data, whales have offloaded over 270 million ADA —worth roughly $170 million — in a move that has added significant pressure to the token’s price action during a week marked by geopolitical volatility. Yet, amid the sell-off, the Cardano Foundation unveiled a new product aimed at enterprise adoption. On Thursday, the organization launched Originate , a blockchain-based solution for verifying product origin and authenticity. Designed to help businesses streamline compliance and protect against counterfeits, Originate allows companies to digitize and track critical product data on-chain, enabling instant verification by consumers and regulators. On its website, the Foundation emphasized that Originate is built to strengthen brand trust in industries where supply chain transparency is critical. By positioning itself as a tool for regulatory compliance and consumer assurance, the product may help bolster Cardano’s reputation in enterprise circles —especially at a time when investors are searching for real-world use cases beyond DeFi and staking. The announcement comes just days after ADA was added to the Nasdaq Crypto Index , joining Bitcoin and Ethereum. While short-term sentiment remains fragile due to whale behavior and broader risk-off macro trends, Cardano’s expanding institutional profile could provide longer-term support. Technical Analysis Highlights ADA ranged between $0.6176 and $0.6428, closing near $0.6229, a 1.71% daily loss. Resistance remains strong near $0.642–$0.645, while price broke below support at $0.636. Heaviest volume spikes occurred after 18:00 GMT as price dipped below $0.62, triggering brief sell-off followed by consolidation. Trend remains bearish with lower highs forming throughout the day, and rejection at $0.635.

2025-06-14T19:00:37,"Investors Are Fleeing Ethereum, On‑Chain Numbers Reveal","With investor demand seemingly on the rise, the Ethereum price looked set to cross the psychological $3,000 level over the past week. However, this dream hit a major stumbling block after geopolitical tensions quickly escalated in the late hours of Thursday, June 13. It didn’t take much time for Israel’s airstrike against Iran to impact the global financial markets, with crypto prices succumbing to a fresh wave of downward pressure. Specifically, Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has lost about 6% of its value in the past 24 hours. Is Capital Flowing Out Of ETH Into BTC? In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Amr Taha shared fresh insights into the wave of volatility that recently hit the cryptocurrency market. The crypto pundit noted that Ethereum and Bitcoin were particularly impacted by the recent global happenings. Related Reading: A Rare Bitcoin Signal Is Flashing: Could the Bull Run Just Be Getting Started? Firstly, Taha noted the decline in the Ethereum Open Interest (OI) on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the ETH OI metric experienced a significant 19% dip in the past 24 hours, coinciding with a decrease in price. The Open Interest indicator estimates the total amount of money flowing into derivatives of a specific cryptocurrency at any given time. A falling OI value is often considered a bearish signal, as it suggests a decline in investor confidence and positive sentiment. According to Taha, this latest abrupt decline in the Ethereum Open Interest points to a wave of panic-induced selling, with investors instinctively exiting their long positions. “Traders likely rushed to close their long positions, either manually in fear of deeper losses or automatically via forced liquidations as stop-loss triggers were hit,” the analyst said. Taha drew a parallel relationship between the falling Ethereum Open Interest and the flow of Bitcoin out of Coinbase, the largest centralized exchange in the United States. CryptoQuant data shows a significant withdrawal of 7,000 BTC from the trading platform in the past day. According to Taha, this substantial exchange outflow of Bitcoin, coinciding precisely with the Ethereum OI decline, suggests fresh buying and that large investors may be strategically repositioning for accumulation. This trend might not be particularly positive for ETH, as it shows that capital might be rotating back into the premier cryptocurrency. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,546, reflecting an almost 4% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-14T19:00:04,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Jumps as Over 537M SHIB Set Ablaze","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most well-known memecoins, has significantly increased its burn rate over the past 24 hours. More than 537 million worth of SHIB coins have been taken out of circulation. This caused the burn rate to jump by 3,484%, a massive increase from the day before. This turn of events has made the SHIB community more hopeful for the token’s future. This came after the SHIB ecosystem improved its decentralized finance (DeFi) toolkit. Massive Token Burn Fuels Shiba Inu Price Jump Burning coins usually helps reduce the total supply, making the remaining coins more valuable. Following this large burn, SHIB’s price increased by 4.12%, trading at $0.000012, and its total market value crossed $7.2 billion. This price bounce came shortly after SHIB dropped by 10% earlier in the week. This drop was caused mainly by a bigger dip in the crypto market, which reacted to rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Furthermore, Shibburn tracking platform shows that the recent increase in SHIB’s burn rate continues a trend seen earlier this week. In a notable move, one wallet alone burned over 500 million SHIB in the past 12 hours. The Shiba Inu community has used token burning to help support long-term value. As SHIB’s price went up, its future open interest rose by over 4%, reaching $141.85 million. According to Coinglass data, traders are showing more confidence in SHIB’s short-term performance. A rise in open interest usually means more trading activity and a stronger belief in the token’s direction. This geopolitical tension also shook the entire crypto market. Bitcoin’s price (BTC) dropped 2.8% after the incident , falling from $106,042 to $103,053. However, the flagship crypto seems to be back on a bullish path. According to CoinMarketCap data, it is trading at $105,092 at the time of writing, up 0.27% in the past 24 hours. SHIB Whale Activity Drops Despite Price Uptick Even though the token burn and price rise are good signs, data shows that large-scale SHIB holders are pulling back . In the past 24 hours, large transaction volume has dropped 65%. Wallets with at least $100,000 worth of SHIB have seen a significant slowdown in activity. This points to weakening interest among big investors, possibly due to recent market uncertainty. On June 6, the enormous transaction volume hit 17.63 trillion SHIB. However, this has dropped to just 948.59 billion SHIB, showing that many big investors are pulling away. Experts say if larger investors continue to reduce their holdings, it may put downward pressure on the SHIB price. Still, if the burn rate remains high and market confidence improves, SHIB could regain strength.
