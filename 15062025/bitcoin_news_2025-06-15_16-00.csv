2025-06-15T13:28:10,"Experts predict when quantum computers will break Bitcoin’s encryption","Recent advances in quantum computing have reignited concerns about the security of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Most notably, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) plans to launch the world’s first fault-tolerant quantum computer, IBM Quantum Starling, by 2029, a major leap from today’s error-prone machines. As these developments unfold, experts are debating when quantum technology might break Bitcoin’s cryptographic defenses, specifically, its elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and SHA-256 hashing, which secure wallets and transactions. In this context, Finbold has gathered expert insights on when quantum computing could threaten Bitcoin. Craig Gidney In May 2025, Google quantum researcher Craig Gidney warned that the timeline might be shorter than expected. His findings revealed that breaking RSA encryption may require 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. While Bitcoin doesn’t use RSA, it does rely on ECC, which, like RSA, can be broken by Shor’s algorithm. Although Gidney didn’t directly mention Bitcoin, his research targeted encryption methods that underpin crypto wallets and, in some cases, transactions. He suggested a potential threat window between 2030 and 2035, depending on advancements in error correction. “I estimate that a 2048-bit RSA integer could be factored in under a week by a quantum computer with fewer than one million noisy qubits,” Gidney wrote. Adam Black In contrast, Adam Back, an early Bitcoin adopter and CEO of Blockstream, remains more cautious. In April 2025, he argued that quantum computers likely won’t pose a serious threat for at least two decades. Still, he acknowledged that future breakthroughs could force holders to migrate their coins to quantum-resistant addresses, including possibly Satoshi Nakamoto’s untouched stash, which could reveal whether the mysterious founder is still alive. David Carvalho Meanwhile, in a June 2025 opinion published by Cointelegraph , David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol, issued a more urgent warning. He claimed that quantum computers could crack Bitcoin within five years unless it quickly upgrades its cryptography. Carvalho specifically pointed to the emergence of technologies like Microsoft’s Majorana chip as a sign that powerful quantum systems are already on the horizon. According to him, about 30% of Bitcoin is currently stored in vulnerable addresses, and a single breach could shatter the trust built over the network’s 16-year history. “A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late,” he said. Chamath Palihapitiya Similarly, back in December 2024, as reported by Finbold, billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya cautioned that Bitcoin’s SHA-256 encryption might be broken within two to five years due to the pace of quantum progress. His warning came after Google unveiled its 105-qubit Willow chip, which was viewed as a significant milestone. He estimated that around 8,000 such chips could potentially break Bitcoin’s encryption. While scaling to that level remains a major hurdle, Palihapitiya urged blockchain developers to start reworking hashing algorithms now. Ultimately, the quantum threat to Bitcoin hinges on creating fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits, a milestone that’s still years away.

2025-06-15T13:20:45,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Holds Above $105,000 Despite Selling Pressure","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a second consecutive day, with the price down 0.52% as it struggles to stay above $105,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $104,951. BTC lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $110,355 thanks to macroeconomic factors and escalating geopolitical tensions after Israel struck key targets in Iran. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Could Become A Challenge Roxom Global CEO Borja Martel Seward has warned that when the Bitcoin bull market ends, a bearish phase could cause several Bitcoin treasury companies to struggle. Bitcoin has charted its own course despite growing macroeconomic uncertainties impacting the traditional and crypto markets. According to Seward, Bitcoin operates to its own “beating drum rhythm,” operating as an independent and contrarian asset in an economy dealing with cooling Fed rate cut expectations, quantitative tightening, US Treasury General Account replenishment, and potential Bank of Japan rate hikes. “Bitcoin goes at its own pace, bitcoin is independent, bitcoin has its own cycles.” Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are experiencing a bull run, which Seward believes could continue for a few months. Several other proponents of the asset, including Tim Draper, echoed the sentiment, asserting that Bitcoin could surge to new highs by the end of 2025. However, Seward cautioned against Bitcoin and crypto, stating, “Eventually, the bull market will finish. We will enter into a more bearish phase. This euphoria, this mania will dissipate. Some companies will go underwater, and the market structure will reset.” The warning comes amid a growing trend of public and private companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. The trend was pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . According to Seward, these companies' adoption of Bitcoin presents a unique dynamic for upcoming market shifts. “We will have to see how what today right now is a blessing regarding the bitcoin treasury companies turns out to play once the bear market hits, and we’ll see if treasury companies start selling or not.” Top Indicators Hint At $230,000 Peak CoinGlass has urged investors to “hold 100%” at current prices even as the asset reported record price levels and 30% gains in Q2. While Bitcoin may be consolidating after reaching record highs, a list of classic on-chain indicators is showing no signs of market exhaustion. CoinGlass’ “bull market peak” selection contains 30 potential selling triggers that aim to highlight long-term Bitcoin price tops. According to CoinGlass, none of the indicators are flashing a top signal. Popular trader Cas Abbe posted on X, stating, “None of the 30 major top indicators on Coinglass have triggered yet. Not Pi Cycle, Not MVRV, Not even RSI. According To these models $BTC will be $135K to $230K this cycle. This ain’t the top.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) lost momentum this week after crossing $110,000 on Monday. While it stalled after reaching this level, market watchers were hopeful of a push higher as bullish sentiment persisted. However, a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions saw markets plunge, with BTC dropping to $105,828 on Thursday and falling to a low of $102,832 on Friday as bearish sentiment took hold. According to analysts, BTC has encountered downside volatility after it failed to stay above the crucial $106,000 level. Analyst Michael van de Poppe flagged the $106,000 level as vital for maintaining upward momentum. According to van de Poppe, BTC’s latest rally was rejected after testing $106,000, with the price falling back between the $104,000-$105,000 region. If BTC dips below $105,000 again, it could drop to $100,000 by the end of June, mimicking a similar rejection that saw the price drop sharply to $100,000. BTC registered a sharp drop on Monday (June 2), falling to a low of $103,768. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,092. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Source: TradingView BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Sellers took control on Wednesday as buyers lost momentum. As a result, BTC fell 1.42% and settled at $108,687. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price plunged nearly 3% and settled at $105,828. BTC fell to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106. Price action was back in the red on Saturday, with BTC down nearly 1%, trading at $105,482. The current session sees the price marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control.

2025-06-15T13:16:47,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Approaches Key Inflection Point – What’s Next?","Bitcoin trades at $105,296, with a 24-hour volume of $35 billion and a market capitalization of $2.09 trillion. This stability persists despite bearish headlines about retail giants launching stablecoins, such as Amazon and Walmart, as well as banks like JPMorgan, which could divert attention from BTC. Meanwhile, institutional Ethereum plays, such as SharpLink’s $463 million buy-in, signal growing crypto interest, even if short-term momentum leans toward contenders like ETH. Retailers’ Stablecoin Push Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring their stablecoins, digital tokens pegged to the U.S. dollar. The move aims to reduce transaction fees, expedite payments, and circumvent conventional banking networks. Congress’s proposed GENIUS Act could streamline regulation, enhancing the appeal. Other large firms, including U.S. airlines and Expedia, are also evaluating the integration of stablecoins. JUST IN: Walmart and Amazon are reportedly mulling plans to issue their own US dollar-backed stablecoins for customers. Amazon reported $638 billion worth of annual revenue in 2024.

This influx from retail and financial giants signals growing mainstream acceptance, although it may divert short-term attention away from Bitcoin’s performance. SharpLink’s ETH Mega Buy SharpLink Gaming has secured its place as the largest publicly traded Ethereum (ETH) holder by purchasing 176,271 ETH, equivalent to approximately $463 million, through a combination of Nasdaq equity and private placement funding. The average acquisition price was roughly $2,626 per token. Notably, more than 95% of these holdings are staked, generating yield and thereby reinforcing network security. CEO Rob Phythian called it a “landmark moment” in institutional adoption, echoed by co-founder Joseph Lubin.

Geo‑Tension Sparks Market Ripples Escalating Iran‑Israel tensions have significantly impacted crypto markets. Bitcoin plummeted from around $ 110,000 to as low as $102,513 before experiencing a modest recovery to $105,000. Over $446 million in BTC long positions were liquidated in a single day. Ethereum and XRP also stumbled near key support areas. Why Did Bitcoin Dip as Gold Surged Amid Israel-Iran Tensions? ► https://t.co/qOgkORaiao https://t.co/qOgkORaiao — Decrypt (@DecryptMedia) June 13, 2025 Despite the “digital gold” narrative, Bitcoin trailed volatile tech equities, while gold prices jumped due to demand for safer assets. ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum slowed, reflecting waning investor confidence amid global fear. Though headline risk keeps Bitcoin under $105K, sustained institutional buying could prevent a drop beneath $100K. Bitcoin Technical Setup and Price Structure On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin has formed a rising trendline off early-June lows near $102,817, printing higher lows that suggest durable support. Trading between the 23.6% Fib retracement at $104,643 and 38.2% Fib at $105,772, BTC finds itself sandwiched under the 50‑EMA at $105,940. A Doji candle near the lower boundary signals market indecision. Momentum indicators add nuance: the MACD line is converging with its signal, and the histogram is shrinking from negative territory—both signs of cautious bullish sentiment. Absence of bearish patterns like “Three Black Crows” and presence of a spinning top candle point to consolidation rather than capitulation. Risk Zones and Bitcoin Trade Strategy Here’s a potential Bitcoin price prediction you can follow: Bullish Entry : Watch for a breakout above $105,772 and the 50‑EMA. Stop‑loss : Place it below today’s swing low near $104,500. Targets : $106,685 (50% Fib) $107,598 (61.8% Fib) Alternatively: Bearish Strategy : If Bitcoin drops below $104,600 (trendline + 23.6% Fib), it could revisit $102,817 support. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

2025-06-15T13:14:00,"Russia Paid Teenage Spies in Bitcoin, Blockchain Forensics Reveal","Russian intelligence agencies are increasingly relying on Bitcoin to fund covert operations across Europe, including the recruitment of teenagers as spies. Key Takeaways: Russian intelligence is using Bitcoin to fund covert operations, including the recruitment of teenage spies. Blockchain forensics traced espionage payments to wallets linked to the FSB, showing structured laundering patterns. This case is part of a broader trend, with crypto also used to finance propaganda and sabotage across Europe. A Reuters investigation , conducted with blockchain forensics firms Global Ledger and Recoveris, has revealed how the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) used crypto to finance espionage. One case involved Canadian national Laken Pavan, who was just 17 when he was recruited by the FSB after traveling to Donetsk to join pro-Russian forces. Teen Spy Case Reveals Russia’s Use of Coercion and Crypto Payments After several days in detention, Pavan was coerced into spying for Russia and assigned a handler known as Slon, Russian for “elephant.” His instructions included traveling across Europe to collect intelligence, with payments sent in Bitcoin. After receiving just over $500 in BTC while in Copenhagen, Pavan fled to Poland, where he turned himself in on May 22, 2024. He was later sentenced to 20 months in prison by Polish authorities. The payment Pavan received was traced to two intermediary wallets by blockchain analysts, which had received significant funds from a larger wallet created in June 2022. That wallet has since processed more than $600 million in Bitcoin, including transactions routed through Garantex, a sanctioned Russian crypto exchange. JUST IN: Russia's central bank showcases #Bitcoin as the most profitable investment over the past year pic.twitter.com/y9MB4vyGAD — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 15, 2025 Global Ledger’s analysis found that the wallets linked to Pavan’s payments operated exclusively during Moscow business hours, pointing to a highly structured laundering network. “Transactions from wallets linked to the FSB followed a structured laundering pattern, involving fund splitting, mixing with larger sums, and routing through unconnected deposit wallets,” Global Ledger said in its report. The case is not isolated. According to Marcin Zarakowski, CEO of Recoveris, Russian intelligence has used Bitcoin to fund multiple covert operations. “This method has been uncovered on multiple occasions,” he said, citing a 2023 case involving young Belarusians and Ukrainians who were paid in crypto by the GRU to install surveillance devices and spread propaganda in Poland. Some were even paid in BTC to commit acts of arson. 161 Bitcoin Wallets Tied to Russia’s FSB Show Patterned Activity Recoveris has also identified a network of 161 Bitcoin addresses linked to the FSB, with hundreds of transactions occurring within 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Moscow time. Russia’s reliance on crypto extends to mercenary funding in Donbas and payments to European politicians for disseminating pro-Kremlin narratives. As reported, Russia is exploring ways to use cryptocurrencies to settle grain export payments, as the country looks to bypass Western sanctions and modernize its trade infrastructure. More recently, Russia’s central bank announced that it is allowing qualified investors limited access to crypto-linked financial products. Under the new guidance, banks and financial firms can offer derivatives and securities tied to cryptocurrency prices, though these products must be non-deliverable and settled in fiat.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation movement between $105,000 – $106,000 following slight, after prices crashed to below $103,000 on Friday. Meanwhile, prominent analytics company Glassnode has shared some valuable insight into the Bitcoin market dissecting the growth of the current bull cycle so far. Bitcoin Demand Matches Maturation Rate In an X post on June 14, Glassnode draws comparisons of Bitcoin price growth in the present market cycle to previous ones. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection Notably, the crypto market cycle is a recurring four-year period marked by consecutive phases of accumulation, a bull market, distribution and a bear market. In the last two cycles i.e 2015-2018 and 2018-2022, Bitcoin achieved price gains of 1076% and 1007%, respectively, significantly multiplying its market cap. For the current cycle from 2022 till date, Bitcoin’s prices have now grown by 656%. While this figure is far off previous cycles, Glassnode reports that it’s a commendable achievement considering the premier cryptocurrency’s maturation in the past four years marked by an exposure to institutional investors and a $2 trillion valuation. Generally, assets are expected to produce little exponential growth with continued price growth. This can be seen with gold only achieving an estimated 192% growth over the past 10 years. Therefore, Glassnode notes that Bitcoin’s 6x market gain since 2022 is highly positive development that reflects a sustainable market demand even as the asset’s market cap grows. Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $105,540 following a slight 0.20% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 35.39% representing significant fall in market participation. Interestingly, reputable analytics firm Sentora reports the Bitcoin network weekly fees fell by 3.31% following recent negative political events coupled with an already uncertain market sentiment. Meanwhile, exchange inflows also grew by $2.4 billion indicating a significant amount of investors are looking to distribute their holdings while the premier cryptocurrency struggles to re-establish a bullish price direction.

2025-06-15T12:32:39,"Best Altcoins to Replace Visa and Mastercard After $60B Stock Slump","Visa and Mastercard just took a hit, and the world is starting to notice. While Wall Street sees it as a dip worth buying, many see it as a wake-up call. The payment giants that once ruled every checkout lane are no longer untouchable. In an economy where every fee adds up, merchants and consumers alike are starting to ask: why are we still paying these middlemen to move our money? As TradFi starts to wobble, new crypto projects are stepping into the spotlight with bold, fee-free solutions. Let’s take a look at some of the best altcoins leading the charge away from plastic. Credit Cards Are Getting Crowded Out Visa and Mastercard just lost a combined $60B in market value after reports surfaced that major global merchants are actively looking for ways to bypass traditional credit card networks. Large retailers are frustrated by rising processing fees and are now exploring alternative payment systems that don’t rely on the same outdated rails. This shift isn’t coming out of nowhere. It reflects years of mounting pressure. Businesses have long been fed up with paying 2–3% per transaction, only to deal with delays, chargebacks, and rigid systems. Meanwhile, consumers are embracing faster, cheaper options like crypto and stablecoins. What used to be a niche is now looking more like a mainstream movement. Visa and Mastercard still dominate today, but their grip is loosening. The future of payments is being rebuilt right now, and it’s not running on plastic. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Fueling a Payments Revolution Visa and Mastercard’s $60B slump shows just how vulnerable traditional payment systems have become – and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is stepping in to build something better. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the utility powerhouse behind one of the most ambitious payment ecosystems in crypto. With over $13.3M raised in crypto presale and a current price of just $0.025185, $BEST is more than just hype. It’s laying the rails for a new financial future. What makes it stand out? For starters, buyers of $BEST unlock real utility: reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects and higher staking rewards. Best Wallet is also disrupting the wallet space with features like ‘Upcoming Tokens,’ a built-in presale discovery tool that lets users explore and join promising new projects directly within the app. It’s secure, scam-proof, and designed to make presale participation fast and frustration-free. Thanks to Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP security tech, you stay protected while enjoying cutting-edge tools. With 70K+ followers and fast-growing adoption, $BEST could be on track to hit $0.072 by 2025 , with even bigger upside beyond. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Kill the Middleman for Good If Visa is the landlord of legacy finance, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the wrecking crew. SUBBD Token powers the first AI-driven, decentralized creator platform built to cut out the middlemen and hand the power back to influencers and fans. Right now, you can buy $SUBBD for $0.055675. With $662K already raised, it’s an under-the-radar gem with serious upside. At its core, $SUBBD lets creators monetize directly – no YouTube cuts, no Patreon gatekeeping. Fans can tip, subscribe, and interact with their favorite influencers in real time, using instant, low-fee crypto payments. The platform supports both crypto and fiat, making it accessible across borders. But what really sets $SUBBD apart is its AI agent . Creators get a personal AI assistant to handle scheduling, content editing, and fan engagement. Meanwhile, users can generate AI-enhanced content, including approved avatars and short-form videos tied to top influencers. With over 250M followers across its ecosystem and unique staking perks, $SUBBD isn’t just another token – it’s a full-blown Web3 content revolution. This is the kind of platform Visa wishes it could bill. 3. Smog Token ($SMOG) – Meme-Powered Utility with Bite Meet Smog Token ($SMOG) – not your average meme coin . Built on Solana (with a bridged Ethereum version), it’s roaring into the scene with a sweet current price around $0.008913 and a juicy 42% APY for staking. Think of it as a dragon-themed adventure where holding and engaging actually pays off.

2025-06-15T12:25:18,"Vietnam passes crypto assets regulation in new digital tech law","Vietnam’s National Assembly has passed the Law on the Digital Technology Industry, a comprehensive legal framework that will formally bring digital assets under strict regulatory control. Passed on June 14 and set to come into force on January 1, 2026, the law is considered a landmark in promoting digital innovation in the nation. Vietnam enacts standalone digital tech law Local publications reported that under the new law, digital assets will be classified into two large groups: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both use encryption and digital technology to authenticate and transfer. However, they also specifically remove securities, digital fiat, and other financial instruments from the definition. It is now up to Vietnam’s government to specify, for example, what kind of business is allowed and what kind of scrutiny will apply to the use and transferability of such assets. The law requires cybersecurity processes and anti-money laundering (AML) actions to comply with the global requirements issued by the law. It must be in sync with international best practices. This move is possibly in response to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) including Vietnam on its “gray list” in 2023 for increased scrutiny. In addition to regulating crypto, the laws symbolize Vietnam’s larger aspiration to take its place as a regional digital technology center . It would offer sweeping incentives to companies in areas like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. Those perks include tax breaks, friendly land-use policies, and research and development investments—especially for chip design companies and AI data centers. Push for digital literacy and investor protection intensifies The law also aims for a digitally literate workforce. Provincial governments have been tasked with developing education and training plans, and national curricula will be reformed to include digital technology skills. “With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry,” the Vietnamese government said. In the meantime, Vietnam still grapples with crypto scams. Vietnamese authorities have recently arrested key figures behind a nationwide cryptocurrency scam that defrauded tens of thousands of investors out of nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (approximately $400 million). According to local reporting, the fraud ring operated under the guise of a fake virtual currency exchange called MTC (Matrix Chain). The Dong Nai Provincial Police led the months-long investigation with support from the Ministry of Public Security and other regional forces. After nearly 200 days of surveillance and evidence collection, officers arrested the group’s ringleader, Nguyen Quoc Hung, and four accomplices during coordinated raids across multiple provinces. Police also rounded up four suspects earlier this year, accused of coming up with BitMiner, a bogus cryptocurrency mining company that pretended to be based in Dubai. More than 200 people lost more than 4 billion Vietnamese dong (about $157,300) in a scheme that sold fraudulent mining packages and educational content. In December 2024, Hanoi City Police foiled a large-scale crypto scam that defrauded around 100 businesses and 400 individuals of 30 billion Vietnamese dong (approximately $1.17 million). Authorities intervened just in time to stop an additional 300 people from falling victim. Operating under Million Smiles, the company promoted an in-house cryptocurrency, QFS, or Quantum Financial System, using deceptive advertising that linked it to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims. Vietnam’s new laws help fill the legal void around cryptocurrencies and signal the country’s willingness to be a global leader in the next era of global technology.

The company stated that altcoin dominance has reached historical support levels and warned that high volatility could be on the way in the coming days. Alphractal made the following statement in its statement: “Something big is about to happen in altcoins! Altcoin Dominance has reached historical support levels. We are on the verge of a wave of volatility in the coming days. Whether Bitcoin rises or falls, many altcoins are likely to outperform BTC in the coming months, so it is critical to be prepared.” Related News: Giant Whale Shorted These 16 Altcoins, Made Huge Profits Focusing on two important metrics in its analysis, Alphractal argued that these were the harbingers of serious rallies in the altcoin market in the past. Altcoin Dominance (excluding Stablecoins): It was stated that this metric found strong support at the 25% level and this level is often tested before major altcoin rallies. Altcoin Dominance (excluding ETH and Stablecoins): It was stated that this indicator has a critical support area around 18%. Falling below this level has historically triggered periods when altcoins gained significant market share against Bitcoin. The company noted that the levels in question do not directly guarantee an “altcoin season,” but that such technical signals have appeared before major market moves in the past. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-15T12:16:30,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Explained","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has stayed mostly quiet this weekend, showing no big moves in either direction. The market is still moving sideways, with prices stuck within a narrow range. While there’s been a little bit of downward pressure, it hasn’t been enough to trigger any big changes. Some experts have wondered if Bitcoin’s current pattern might turn into a triangle, but there’s no clear sign of that happening. Triangles are rare patterns in the market, and it’s too early to say if this will develop into one. Bearish Update: For now, the focus remains on a correction phase that began after Bitcoin’s May high. The price has been pulling back since then, and it’s expected to possibly head lower before finding strong support. The key areas to watch are around $99,200 to $92,800. There’s even a chance it could dip as low as $81,340, which is considered an important support level. If Bitcoin breaks below that, it could signal the end of the bull market. Bullish Update: On the other hand, if Bitcoin holds above this zone, the long-term outlook remains positive. Once this correction ends, Bitcoin could target a move towards $130,000, and if market conditions improve, it might even rally higher, possibly up to $190,000. Looking at shorter timeframes, the price is currently holding above minor support levels. Over the weekend, it’s been expected that Bitcoin might see a small bounce or move sideways before heading lower again. A break above $108,822 could mean the market is turning more bullish in the short term, but for now, there’s no clear sign of that happening. In summary, Bitcoin is still in a correction phase with no confirmed breakdown or breakout. As long as it stays above key support levels, the larger uptrend remains intact.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bullish-and-bearish-scenarios-explained/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Major announcements included Cardano’s Cardinal protocol for Bitcoin DeFi, XRP Ledger’s upcoming EVM sidechain, and Coinbase’s Bitcoin rewards card. Meanwhile, regulators delayed ETF decisions and the Senate advanced stablecoin legislation. Bitcoin Amid major strikes by Israel across Iran, the Bitcoin price fell almost $6,000 through Thursday and into Friday. A comprehensive bounce is now underway, with experts wondering if the recovery will continue. DeFi Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, has officially introduced Cardinal , a new protocol designed to bring Bitcoin into decentralized finance (DeFi) through a trustless, cross-chain solution. Technology XRP Ledger is set to launch an Ethereum-compatible EVM sidechain in Q2 2025, aiming to integrate Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications into its ecosystem while onboarding new contributors and enhancing DeFi functionalities. Business Coinbase has partnered with American Express to launch the Coinbase One Card , offering up to 4% Bitcoin rewards on purchases and expanded crypto benefits as part of its growing payment ecosystem GameStop has announced a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, signaling a deepening commitment to its Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. US authorities have charged crypto entrepreneur Iurii Gugnin with operating a $500 million money laundering scheme through his crypto companies, helping sanctioned Russian banks and entities bypass international financial restrictions. Web3 Web3 at present only bestows its rewards on the bravest adventurers who dare to expose themselves to all of its fanfare and bluster. With a good UI and user experience, Web3 can transform its highly functional dApps into an experience that’s not only fun, but also extremely worthwhile for its users. These five crypto exchanges have successfully weathered the storm and managed to retain the trust of their customers over the course of the past decade. Pudgy Penguins has partnered with *My Neighbor Alice*, granting holders of Pudgys and their spin-offs land access in MNA’s new interoperable archipelago. For over two decades, cloud giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have dominated global digital infrastructure, but their market concentration raises concerns over outages, censorship, and data privacy risks. The crypto market is maturing beyond meme hype and speculation, and the industry has firmly left the ICO mania of 2017–18 behind. Community alignment, sustainable tokenomics, and real utility, which tokens like Mosaic Galaxy's Kodexa embody, are becoming the benchmarks. The recently launched crypto exchange KuCoin EU Exchange GmbH, based in Vienna, Austria, has announced two new C-Suite level executives to its stacked team of professionals - Christian Derler and Tamara Rubey, who will share their experience in banking, finance, and legal matters to bolster the expansion of the crypto exchange across Europe.

But Nguyen says answering that phone call led him to lose $500,000 – the entirety of his life’s work. “I lost maybe $500,000… I may be homeless now.” The con artists who masterminded the scam convinced Nguyen that his identity was being used to commit various crimes overseas, like money laundering, and in order to clear his name, the soon-to-be-retired man supposedly had to wire over his money to another bank. The criminals, who are yet to be identified, used an encrypted messaging app called Viber to send wire transfer details, along with fake government documents to make it seem more legitimate. After losing everything, Nguyen’s daughter, Kathy, is now supporting him, and says she is in the process of selling her house to make ends meet. Says Kathy, “Watch out for your family. Your mom, dad, grandma, grandpas. Just let them know that something like this could happen, and just be careful.” The Nguyens have filed a report with the FBI, but at time of writing, the scammers are at large.

As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.16, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, it has slipped by 2.3%, continuing a mild downtrend. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, overall sentiment around XRP remains bearish . However, there is some sense of optimism from a technical standpoint. The token’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) is at $2.30, offering short-term support, while the 200-day SMA, at $1.88, signals potential for longer-term bullish momentum. Meanwhile, XRP’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 44.38, still in neutral territory, pointing to a balanced market with room to move either way. ChatGPT predicts XRP price Looking ahead, OpenAI’s ChatGPT projected that XRP will likely trade between $2.08 and $2.32 by July 1, with $2.22 identified as the most probable mid-range target. This prediction is based on technical indicators, momentum analysis, and overall market conditions. The model noted that XRP’s recent breach of the psychological $2 level has established a key support zone, which could act as a base for future gains. On the other hand, resistance appears between $2.30 and $2.35, with support holding near the $2.05 to $2.10 range. XRP AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT A limiting factor, however, is the current absence of major catalysts. Without headline developments, such as an ETF approval or a major partnership announcement from Ripple, any sharp price movements appear unlikely in the short term. ChatGPT pointed out that broader market dynamics could still play a role. For example, a stable or rising Bitcoin ( BTC ) price could offer enough tailwind to push XRP toward the upper end of its projected range. Grok predicts XRP price Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok model took a more bullish stance, forecasting a trading range between $2.25 and $2.40 by July 1. It cited an ascending channel pattern and potential positive momentum from Ripple’s ecosystem as key drivers. Still, Grok also flagged resistance around $2.50 as a likely cap on near-term gains. Both AI models seem to agree that a major XRP breakout is unlikely over the next couple of weeks. A gradual climb toward the low-to-mid $2.30s appears within reach, provided market conditions remain steady.

2025-06-15T10:39:05,"Neo Pepe ($NEOP) Leaves Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) in the Dust With Blazing Presale Speed","Neo Pepe ($NEOP) has become the most exciting and premium crypto launch of the year, starting a feeding frenzy that leaves Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) dazed and confused in its aftermath. Where BPEP was once the status of a moving meme-fueled presale, it has now been overtaken by Neo Pepe in the speed and structure department and is left in the dust by Neo Pepe's relentless presale campaign. Merely encountering two meme coins is not the mark of a meme coin shift; it is, rather, an orderly advance toward a serious fundraising goal that, as far as anyone can see, looks pretty good. Neo Pepe is the most powerful presale to participate in. That's the shift. Unlike NEOP, which responds with the same urgency and scalability, BPEP has largely fallen short of these marks. It launched with promise but, in the absence of a pricing model that's even somewhat cogent and a long-term roadmap that's articulated well enough for even the most optimistic observer to understand it, BPEP has left many investors wondering whether it has any staying power. Presale Speed So Brutal It’s Forcing BPEP Devs to Rethink Everything Neo Pepe doesn’t just launch faster. It operates with a velocity built into its core mechanics. The project’s hourly token unlocking mechanism following launch ensures smooth market integration without volatility spikes. In contrast, Bitcoin Pepe’s unlock structure remains vague and delayed, lacking the kind of investor-friendly mechanics that are rapidly becoming standard. Each transaction made on the Neo Pepe network pays a fee: a 2.5% slice of every trade that goes directly and immediately to Uniswap liquidity pools. But here's the real innovation: the liquidity provider (LP) tokens that those trades generate are not kept to be manipulated at some later time (Neutrino dollars hanging out in an actual wallet address, for instance) but are burned instead. That means liquidity can't be manipulated, and it can't be taken away once it's been put there. To a certain extent, that's what makes the Neo Pepe network safe for investors. This Isn’t a Battle. It’s a Displacement. While BPEP continues to rely on the inertia of meme nostalgia, Neo Pepe is capitalizing on a full-blown economic engine. In less than a month, it has outpaced BPEP across nearly every measurable category: Presale Growth: Neo Pepe has reached multiple milestones at accelerating speed. BPEP remains trapped in early-stage drag. Liquidity Confidence: Investors trust Neo Pepe’s irreversible liquidity mechanics. BPEP’s LP model raises persistent doubts. Transparency and Trust: Real-time tracking and Chainlink-indexed pricing are standard with Neo Pepe. BPEP’s metrics are harder to verify. Engaged Community: Neo Pepe’s DAO structure has turned holders into participants. BPEP’s supporters are left as spectators. This is not just a rivalry in price charts. This is a philosophical divergence in what memecoins are meant to be in 2025. Neo Pepe is signaling a maturity BPEP has yet to exhibit. $NEOP Gives Voters Real Power — BPEP Offers None Neo Pepe isn’t just fast—it’s fair. Its decentralized governance model gives the entire community decision-making power over crucial project developments. All proposals must meet a one-million-token threshold, followed by a mandatory 1-day delay, 7-day voting period, and 2-day timelock execution. Compare this to Bitcoin Pepe. BPEP maintains a centralized core team, with governance yet to be properly delegated to holders. Even in a memecoin narrative, today’s investors expect more than vibes. They expect verifiable control. Neo Pepe delivers that with an on-chain DAO built on OpenZeppelin standards, where treasury management and token decisions are executed transparently by the community. This distinction alone marks Neo Pepe as the clear evolution of meme crypto. BPEP’s lack of real governance is a legacy feature that places it in a different, less competitive category. While BPEP Recycles Hype, $NEOP Engineers Demand Neo Pepe is constructed for more than mere excitement—it’s built for functioning well. Its presale tokenomics are meticulously planned to create continuous momentum. Neo Pepe has a 16-step pricing structure commencing at $0.05 in Stage 0 and reaching $0.16 by Stage 15, aimed at pulling in a total of $50 million. After the launch, token unlocking happens at a speed that lifts any immediate sell pressure, going a good way toward making the market what traders like to call ""integral."" Market integrity is always everyone's friend. And it gets better. Every transaction pumps 2.5% of the value into liquidity, which is good for market health, with tokens that do this right away being burned. None of this structure is offered by BPEP. It initiated with a distribution of tokens that were assigned a basic price, and it has remained mostly clear yet mostly vague in regards to what the BPEP developers will do with the funds obtained from the token sale. No clear buy back and burn plan. No answer given to the burning question: ""Will tokens be freely available in the coming months?"" BPEP stalls engagement. Blazing Advantages Neo Pepe Holds Over BPEP Neo Pepe dominates the comparison with a suite of investor-first mechanics that BPEP does not match: Auto-Liquidity Burning: 2.5% per transaction, instantly applied to LP and burned forever. Hourly Unlock Schedule: Ensures predictable post-launch market conditions. DAO Governance: Proposals, voting, and treasury controls all community-managed. Presale Urgency: Each of the 16 stages has a capped allocation and escalating prices. Immutable Smart Contracts: Built with OpenZeppelin to ensure transparency and prevent future tampering. It’s these features that have placed Neo Pepe on every hot token presale watchlist this year, with its superiority over BPEP becoming more evident with each passing stage. By contrast, Bitcoin Pepe features: Unclear token release timelines. Static token price. Minimal liquidity safeguards. Centralized project control. Lack of structural accountability. Even the most casual investor will see which project is designed to last. No Hidden Wallets. No Insider Bags. Just Pure Transparency. The community-centered and fair token distribution of Neo Pepe. Ours is a presale; you can purchase a token. To you, the last half of this text will be exposed—rightly, as we are proud to be clear. Those who presold received 45% of the token's lifetime; for us to market this thing, we needed to be funded. Risks have been taken. For that reason, 25% of our funds have gone and will go to marketing. And while I can hardly make a commendable case for what constitutes ""risk"" in marketing (that I can do by coding, obviously), the upshot is that 10% of tokens have gone to funding development. In much the same way, ecosystem incentives also require visibility and justification—hence the 10% life tokens allotted to that purpose. Markets Aren’t Subtle — And They’re All Pointing to $NEOP By every metric that matters in 2025, Neo Pepe is accelerating beyond Bitcoin Pepe. Investors are now migrating to crypto investment gems that promise both community control and economic foresight. BPEP, while nostalgic, lacks the core mechanics to compete in today’s fast-moving DeFi terrain. The Memetrix movement behind Neo Pepe isn’t simply symbolic. It’s strategic. And as every presale stage sells out with increasing velocity, the distance between Neo Pepe and BPEP is growing into a chasm. Those looking to bet on meme culture with real utility and structure are already staking their claim in the years hottest crypto opportunity now . There is no second round in this contest. BPEP may have nostalgia. Neo Pepe has the roadmap, the engine, and the crowd. It isn’t just leading the race—it’s redefining how it’s run.

2025-06-15T10:00:23,"Bitcoin Investors Remain Calm Despite Israel-Iran Conflict Escalation","The price of Bitcoin has managed to stay afloat over the past few days despite the growing conflict in the Middle East and the ensuing bearish pressure. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $105,000 level, with its value down by merely 0.8% in the past week. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price might not be down for too long, as investors seem unbothered by the rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Below is what the BTC investors have been up to since the military action started in the past week. BTC Investors Still Holding On To Their Assets: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, CryptoMe revealed that the Bitcoin market has remained relatively quiet despite the ongoing geopolitical events. The relevant indicators here are the Bitcoin exchange netflow and Open Interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke To start, CryptoMe analyzed the BTC Exchange Netflow, which measures the difference between Bitcoin sent to and withdrawn from centralized exchanges. Typically, this metric helps to gauge the selling pressure on a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Given that one of the services offered by exchanges is selling, exchange inflows are often considered a bearish signal for the Bitcoin price. However, CryptoMe noted that there has been no significant change in Netflow, meaning that investors are not looking to offload their assets. The on-chain analyst also highlighted the Open Interest on centralized exchanges, which estimates the amount of capital flowing into a cryptocurrency at every given time. CryptoMe attributed the reduced Open Interest to the liquidated long positions following the price correction. The crypto pundit added: But when we look at the bigger picture, Open Interest still looks strong, and investors are still keeping their positions open FOR NOW despite all the WAR news. Furthermore, CryptoMe mentioned the Bitcoin Open Interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutions and speculators trade. The analyst noted that while some positions were closed and the Open Interest dropped after the event, there has still not been any significant exit movement on the CME. Ultimately, the absence of major movements into centralized exchanges suggests that the investors are not in panic mode yet. While most positions on Bitcoin derivatives are still open at the moment, there is no telling what will happen if the war tension escalates further. Hence, investors might want to approach the market with caution over the next few days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,760, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-15T10:00:00,"What is XRP? Investors Ask as Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the Ultimate Bitcoin Replacement","XRP once held the promise of revolutionizing global payments. Fast, cheap, and bank-friendly—it was pitched as the future of cross-border finance. But years of regulatory battles, stagnant token utility, and centralized control have left many investors wondering: Is this still the future, or just another chapter in crypto history? As attention shifts, a bold new name is rising with far more than promises. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just aiming to improve the blockchain—it’s redefining what decentralized money can do. With blazing speed, mobile-first mining, and a full ecosystem that empowers users instead of institutions, BTC-S is positioning itself not just as a Bitcoin alternative, but the upgrade Bitcoin never had. XRP Had Potential—But the Space Moved On XRP deserves credit for challenging the banking sector and pioneering real-time settlement. But with Ripple entangled in legal skirmishes and token utility tied closely to corporate control, cracks have shown. Decentralization remains a concern. And for users seeking freedom, speed, and income, not just transaction rails, XRP now feels like a limited play. Investors are beginning to shift their gaze to a project that’s not just faster or cheaper, but fundamentally more empowering. Bitcoin Solaris: Designed to Replace, Not Just Compete BTC-S was built from the ground up to combine what Bitcoin started with what modern tech makes possible. It features a hybrid consensus model—Proof-of-Work (PoW) for core chain security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability. Together, they deliver unmatched performance. Key highlights include: Base Layer PoW using SHA-256 (Bitcoin-compatible) with 5-minute block times Solaris Layer DPoS with 21 rotating validators every 24 hours and 15-second blocks Cross-layer integration where validator data is secured on-chain through PoW anchoring Smart contracts in Rust, enabling DeFi, tokenization, and secure automation Optional privacy via Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) It gets even better with throughput: the Solaris Layer pushes up to 100,000 transactions per second, finalizing in just 2 seconds, while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. This isn’t theoretical—it’s audited and tested. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have verified the code, and early influencers like Ben Crypto are already spotlighting BTC-S as one of the most promising chains of the year. Mobile Mining with Real Rewards Unlike XRP, which can’t be earned directly through network participation, BTC-S opens the doors to daily income through mining—without expensive hardware. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine using: Smartphones (Android and iOS) Laptops and desktops ASICs and GPUs (for power users) With adaptive mining algorithms, in-app wallets, and energy-optimized performance, it’s truly accessible. Just tap, and you’re earning. Want to estimate your earning potential? The BTC-S mining calculator helps you visualize your daily impact. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Liquid Staking That Doesn’t Lock You In Beyond mining, Bitcoin Solaris also introduces a breakthrough in staking. With liquid staking , users can earn rewards without locking away their tokens. How it works: Staked BTC-S becomes sBTC-S (1:1 ratio) sBTC-S remains fully liquid, tradable, and DeFi-compatible You earn rewards while retaining full control It enhances decentralization, validator rotation, and network health It’s integrated right into the Solaris Nova App, with no complex setup required, making staking easy, flexible, and profitable for everyone. A Roadmap That’s Actually Being Followed Many coins brag about roadmaps. BTC-S is executing one. Its forward-looking roadmap spans: Mainnet Launch (Q3 2026) with full support for smart contracts and governance Mining Power Marketplace and cross-chain tools by Q4 2026 Quantum-resistant upgrades and layer-2 scaling in 2027 Enterprise-grade integrations with AI and IoT in late 2027 It’s a roadmap backed by action, not just whitepaper buzzwords. Every phase is designed to increase adoption, unlock real-world use, and build sustainable value. The Presale Is Moving Fast—and It’s Not Just Hype We’re currently in Phase 7 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale, with over 11,000 users already onboard and more than $4.5M raised. Current price: $7 Next phase: $8 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 9% With only around 7 weeks left before the July 31, 2025 launch, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most dynamic presales in crypto history. The growth is organic, driven by real use, not marketing gimmicks. If you’re watching from the sidelines, Bitcoin Solaris is your window into the future. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin? Or Something Better? XRP may have started as a disruptor. But Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as a revolution. With mobile mining, powerful staking, lightning-fast scalability, and a clear roadmap, BTC-S isn’t just an upgrade to Bitcoin—it’s what Bitcoin would be if it were built today.

2025-06-15T09:15:54,"Walmart, Amazon and Other Multinational Giants Considering Issuing Stablecoins: Report","Walmart, Amazon, and other massive global companies are reportedly looking into the benefits of having their own stablecoins. According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, anonymous people familiar with the matter say that some of the world’s largest retailers are considering issuing their very own dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US in an effort to save billions of dollars in transaction fees. Such a move would mark a major shift away from the traditional finance system, which includes the nation’s largest banks and credit providers. Other firms that are reportedly exploring the potential use of stablecoins include Expedia Group and unnamed airline companies. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to other assets – such as the dollar, precious metals, or other crypto assets – and are typically backed on a one-to-one basis. Stablecoins have been gaining traction recently due to their low transaction fees and faster payment processing times. The firms’ decisions may ultimately depend on the fate of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill still making its way through Congress and yet to pass either chamber. The GENIUS Act, introduced earlier this year, aims to establish a regulatory framework for alternative payment systems, opening the door for new players to compete with giants like Visa and MasterCard. The sources say that Amazon’s stablecoin exploration has mostly revolved around creating one for online purchases, while Walmart has lobbied to change the GENIUS Act to introduce more competition in the credit-card sector. The firms are also considering how to use existing stablecoins if they decide not to create their own.

Saylor stated that the United States should not miss this change, saying, “It is in the interest of the United States to have as much Bitcoin as possible before other countries realize this transformation.” According to Saylor, the BTC network will form the basis of future capital flows as a decentralized financial infrastructure, so it is strategically important for countries, especially the US, to invest in Bitcoin early.

Saylor has run an aggressive BTC acquisition strategy under MicroStrategy over the last five years. The company currently holds approximately 582,000 BTC, with a current value of over $63 billion. Speaking to CNBC last week, Saylor said that the claims that quantum computers pose a threat to Bitcoin are not true and are merely marketing tactics for alternative projects. “I’m not worried about that,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Most larger-cap alts are slightly in the red, including HYPE, which has dumped by 5%, while PI is up by a similar percentage. BTC Stopped at $106K The primary cryptocurrency was riding high at the beginning of the previous business week as it pumped above $110,000 on several occasions by Wednesday. However, each attempt was met with an immediate rejection, and the last one pushed BTC south to under $106,000. Although the bulls managed to recover some ground on Thursday and pushed bitcoin to $108,400, the quickly escalating tension in the Middle East resulted in an immediate price drop that drove the asset south to under $103,000. Although the attacks continued in the following 48 hours, including a few retaliations by Iran, BTC’s price recovered some ground and even jumped above $106,000 hours ago. However, US President Trump weighed in on the matter once again at that point and threatened Iran with “the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces” if Tehran decides to retaliate against the US in some form. Bitcoin slipped once again, but it’s still hovering above $105,000 . Its market cap remains below $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.7% on CG. BTCUSD.

Ethereum is still above $2,500 after a minor decline, and similar price drops of around 1% are evident from DOGE, BNB, LINK, XRP, and SOL.

Key Takeaways: Trump disclosed over $600 million in 2024 earnings, much of it from crypto ventures. His total asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, with significant income from NFTs, token sales, and real estate. The revelation raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest during his presidency. The filing , made public Friday, outlines the president’s sprawling business portfolio, including significant gains from digital assets and meme coin projects. While the exact timeframe isn’t specified, the report appears to cover income through the end of December 2024. Trump Assets Top $1.6 Billion, Earnings Surge Trump’s estimated asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, according to a Reuters analysis . Notably, a large portion of his 2024 windfall came from crypto-related endeavors, including over $320 million in estimated fees from the meme coin $TRUMP, and more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm. The disclosure also shows Trump received $57.35 million from token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture. The report sheds light on the growing entanglement between Trump’s business interests and the U.S. crypto industry. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As per Donald Trump financial disclosure, he made $57M from #Crypto in 2024, Nearly $600M in Total Income. It's mainly from World Liberty Financial, a #DeFi project where he holds $15.7B governance tokens. pic.twitter.com/PdEgyYHW32 — Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) June 14, 2025 Trump Media & Technology Group, parent company of Truth Social, also remains a core asset. While exact valuations are unclear, revenue from branded merchandise and licensing deals continue to flow in. Among them, $2.8 million from Trump Watches, $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances, and over $1 million from his NFT trading cards. In the physical world, Trump’s Florida golf resorts brought in $217.7 million, led by the Trump National Doral, which earned over $110 million. Additional income came from real estate projects in India, Dubai, and Vietnam, with licensing and development fees totaling over $30 million. The filing also included $12 million in passive income through investments in Blue Owl Capital and U.S. bond funds. Despite previously claiming to have distanced himself from day-to-day management, the disclosure confirms Trump remains deeply tied to the financial performance of his vast network of businesses, including crypto. SEC Approves Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-Linked Registration As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes. While the approval gives TMTG flexibility to raise capital, the firm says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base.
