In a statement , the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Iowa says that 63-year-old Margo Ann Williams laundered $800,000 of proceeds from a scheme that was carried out between December 2022 and July 2023. According to evidence presented at the trial, the email accounts of the five victims – a Cedar Rapids church, two businesses, a non-profit and an individual – were hacked while they were in the process of making large wire and automatic clearinghouse (ACH) transfers. The victims received spoofed emails containing instructions to change the routing information for the wire and ACH transfers. Believing that the emails were from legitimate and trusted sources, the victims instructed their banks to wire the funds according to the supposed new payment instructions. The funds were rerouted to bank accounts that Williams controlled. She subsequently relocated the funds to other bank accounts under her control before transferring the money to two crypto exchanges and another person in Florida. The banks discovered William’s fraudulent activities and closed her accounts, but she kept opening new ones at other banks in an effort to keep the scheme alive. She earned approximately $25,000 from the operation and spent the funds on many personal purchases, including an Apple watch and a luxury bag. Williams, who claimed that she perpetrated the scheme at the direction of a famous British actor with whom she became romantically involved, was sentenced to four years in prison. She’s also ordered to pay $594,037 in restitution to her victims and must also serve a three-year term of supervised release following her imprisonment.

2025-06-15T18:30:33,"Owning One Bitcoin Now Seen as the New American Dream","Bitcoin is quickly becoming a major goal for younger investors in the United States. Crypto market activity is holding firm despite rising geopolitical tensions. Notably, the price of Bitcoin currently stands above $105,000. It is showing resilience in the face of recent volatility caused by conflict in the Middle East. New Priorities for the Next Generation In a major development, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes owning one bitcoin is fast becoming the modern version of the American Dream. As reported by Coindesk, speaking on the Unchained podcast, Park explained that younger investors are moving away from traditional goals like home ownership. Instead, many are focused on owning a full bitcoin. According to him, they see it as a mark of financial freedom. According to Park, some even view it as a way to create lasting wealth across generations, calling it “retiring your bloodline. The emotional value attached to being a wholecoiner now goes beyond personal gain. It is also about securing a family legacy in a world where financial systems often feel unstable. It is worth noting that this view is not limited to individual investors. Leading asset management firms and major technology companies have also been favouring Bitcoin over traditional financial assets. For example, Strategy bought 1,045 BTC for $110.2 million between June 2 and 8 at an average price of $105,426. This brings its total holdings to 582,000 BTC, worth over $62 billion. Bitcoin Holds Steady After Geopolitical Jolt Bitcoin rebounded after a sharp drop below $104,000 triggered by Israel’s strike on Iran. Despite the shock, the leading cryptocurrency recovered quickly and is trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the last 24 hours. Analysts highlight the $104,000 to $105,000 range as a strong support zone, based on high-volume buying during the dip. Technical data showed the price moving between $104,480 and $105,696 before closing near its current level. However, a notable breakout followed recently with Bitcoin jumping from $105,486 to $105,550. This rebound suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin . Still overall market sentiment remains cautious. Traders are watching for a push toward the $106,000 mark, depending on continued buying strength. More Than an Asset — A Global Identity In the same podcast, Park also stressed that bitcoin’s global and neutral nature is part of its growing appeal. For many, it is not just a hedge or an investment. It is a statement of independence from centralised systems. As bitcoin remains above $105,000, its role in shaping financial identity continues to grow, especially among younger investors searching for stability and control. Still, Japanese tech company Remixpoint has recently expanded its Bitcoin treasury with a massive purchase of BTC. The firm recently added 56.87 BTC to its holdings, spending about ¥887 million, equivalent to about $6 million.

2025-06-15T18:30:00,"Quantum Countdown: How Bitcoin’s 15-year shield faces its biggest threat yet","The Bitcoin network has been safe and stable for 15 years. However, elliptic curve cryptography, or ECC, was created in 1985 to protect Bitcoin, and concerns about its soon-to-be obsolescence intensify each year. The emerging technology of quantum computers challenges the network’s security. Crypto.news discussed the future of Bitcoin in the post-quantum era with Kapil Dhiman, the CEO of Quranium, a Layer 1 blockchain protocol optimized for post-quantum security, AI integration, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. How did you realize that quantum computers are a threat, and when did you start dedicating most of your time to finding a solution? Dhiman : During my consulting days at PwC, I began to see a recurring blind spot: quantum computing. While most of the industry was focused on scaling and interoperability, few seriously considered the existential threat that quantum computers pose to current cryptographic infrastructure, including blockchain. Early on, I realized that this wasn’t just a theoretical risk sitting decades away. The pace of advancement, especially with quantum advantage edging closer, meant that we needed to act now, not after the breach. By late 2023, it was clear to me that the digital world as we know it, from DeFi to identity systems, could be compromised without quantum-proof infrastructure. In early 2024, I joined forces with Zeeshan and Yaduvendra to co-found Quranium , a new Layer 1 built from the ground up to be quantum-secure, AI-native, and ready to protect the next era of the internet. Since then, this mission has been my whole focus. We’re not just building a blockchain. We’re building the digital shield for everything that’s coming next. What exactly is a Q-Day? How much time do we have? Dhiman : Q-Day is the term we use for the moment quantum computers become powerful enough to break widely used cryptographic systems, including RSA, ECC, and the algorithms securing most blockchains and online banking today. But unlike Y2K, it won’t be a neatly marked day on the calendar. It could happen quietly; a breakthrough in a lab, or worse, behind closed doors in the hands of adversaries. We might only realise it’s happened after the damage is done. That’s what makes it so dangerous: there’s no global countdown clock ticking toward Q-Day. So how much time do we have? That’s the unknown. Some estimates suggest by 2030. But even before the hardware arrives, the threat is real, thanks to “store now, decrypt later” (SNDL) strategies. Encrypted data is already being harvested today, just waiting for quantum power to catch up. The consequences could be enormous. Take Bitcoin: it’s acutely vulnerable. As I mentioned recently in WIRED , the only viable fix would be a hard fork, requiring 51% consensus across the network and a coordinated migration of funds. If quantum capability lands before that happens, Bitcoin could collapse overnight. It’s a ticking time bomb. You might also like: Exclusive: Crypto exchange ZBX aims to defeat ‘Q-Day’ with Naoris tech People who read about the crypto sector every day, usually associate the threat of quantum computing with cracking their wallets. But this threat stretches to other sectors as well. If the problem is ignored, can we see the banking system getting critically damaged? Or lots of personal data from messengers and social media platforms freely floating online? AI-backed systems going crazy and stuff like that? What is the worst scenario? Dhiman : You’re absolutely right. Most people in crypto worry about quantum cracking their wallets, but the threat goes far beyond that. If we ignore this problem, we’re not just discussing financial loss. We’re talking about the foundations of digital trust breaking down. Think about the systems that run our world today: banking, healthcare, messaging apps, cloud platforms, and AI services. They all rely on cryptographic systems that were never designed to withstand a quantum-capable adversary. If quantum computers can break widely used encryption like RSA or ECC, then yes, banks could be compromised, personal messages could be exposed, and deep systems like national IDs or military comms could be intercepted. It wouldn’t be just about money anymore. It would be about identity, privacy, and sovereignty. Worst-case scenario? Imagine an AI system trained on poisoned data or manipulated in real-time. Imagine diplomatic secrets leaked from old encrypted emails. Or financial systems manipulated quietly because the attacker had access for months before anyone even noticed. At the end of the day, this isn’t a tech issue; it’s a civilization-level trust issue. Given the possible implications, it seems that regulators worldwide should react to the emergence of quantum computing. Will the distribution of these computers be somewhat controlled? If this technology is that explosive, will it be as hard to obtain as nuclear weapons? Are regulators around the world working on it? Dhiman : That’s a great and very important question, and one that regulators are only just starting to grapple with. Quantum computing may not have the explosive visuals of nuclear weapons, but its impact could be just as far-reaching, especially in the digital realm. We’re talking about breaking encryption, compromising national security systems, and even destabilizing the trust models that underpin global finance and communications. Right now, quantum systems are expensive, centralized, and limited to a few governments, labs, and major tech players. So yes – there’s still some natural control around access. But that’s not going to last forever. We’ve seen it before with AI and other frontier tech. Once the tools get smaller, cheaper, and more available, the risk multiplies. That said, we’re starting to see regulatory moves. The U.S. has already imposed export controls on quantum technologies, and the EU, Switzerland, and other countries are following suit. There’s no global treaty yet, but there’s a growing awareness that this tech can’t remain ungoverned. Will access be as tightly controlled as nuclear weapons? Probably not. But we are moving toward what I’d call a managed chokehold; restrictions on exports, funding, and cloud-based access to quantum infrastructure. Think of it as governments trying to slow the spread while they play catch-up. That’s why readiness matters. Regulators can try to contain the technology, but it’s already out of the lab. The only real defense is upgrading our infrastructure. That’s the future we’re building toward at Quranium: quantum-secure by design, so we’re not waiting for the world to act; we’re already ahead of it. You told the Korea IT Times that opposing the quantum threat is about technology and global collaboration. Do you see this collaboration happening, and are you optimistic? Dhiman : Yes, I did say that, and I stand by it more than ever. Fighting the quantum threat isn’t just about rolling out better cryptography. It’s about aligning global priorities. Because let’s be honest, a quantum attack doesn’t respect borders. If someone breaks encryption in one part of the world, the ripple effects can go global in seconds. I’ve had the chance to speak with people across different regions, in Switzerland, the UAE, the U.S, South East Asia, and what gives me optimism is that there’s a real shift happening. Governments are investing in quantum readiness. Enterprises, especially in finance and identity, are starting to ask the right questions. We’re seeing more cross-border partnerships and collaborations form and Quranium is part of that conversation. We’ve co-hosted sessions like The Quantum Threat: Future-Proofing Finance in Singapore with PwC, and partnered with innovators globally to move this forward. South Korea is a great example. Their National Strategic Plan for Quantum Science and Technology initiative is entirely centered on international collaboration, not just to develop the tech, but to build a secure ecosystem around it. Their 2023 joint statement with the U.S. also laid out a clear plan for working together on quantum science and cybersecurity. When you pair that with efforts from the EU, India, and strategic bodies like the World Economic Forum and CSIS, you see a fragmented but growing fabric of collaboration. So am I optimistic? Yes, but cautiously. The momentum is there. The conversations are happening. But this can’t be a wait-and-watch moment. Quantum is moving fast and we need to move faster. If we get this right, we don’t just neutralize the threat, we unlock entirely new opportunities for secure, intelligent infrastructure on a global scale. Recently, BlackRock warned its customers about Bitcoin’s vulnerability associated with quantum computing. That was probably the first instance when a high-profile company voiced the problem. Do you see big players doing anything else about the quantum threat on top of raising awareness? What big companies on top of BlackRock and Google were discussing the problem? Dhiman : Yes, BlackRock’s statement marked a turning point. For a traditional asset manager of that scale to publicly warn about quantum threats, it sent a strong signal. It’s no longer just cryptographers or blockchain startups talking about this. The alarm bells are starting to ring in boardrooms. Beyond BlackRock, we’ve seen activity from companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. They’re not just developing quantum hardware, they’re investing in post-quantum security standards. Cloud providers, for example, are piloting quantum-safe protocols for enterprise clients. JPMorgan, Visa, and other financial giants are also researching how to future-proof sensitive systems. That said, there’s still a disconnect. Many efforts are siloed, focused more on innovation and research than on coordinated defense or industry-wide migration. Outside of BlackRock, we haven’t yet seen a collective commitment to adopt quantum-resistant systems. Especially in decentralized ecosystems like Bitcoin, where coordination is difficult, real change will take time. Have you had discussions with big influencers and what’s your opinion on their awareness and readiness to step in? Do influencers outside of the crypto community ring the alarm? Dhiman : As for influencers, awareness is rising in crypto circles. Accounts like Coin Bureau are helping to amplify the message and encourage community discussions around protocols like QRAMP (Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol). Outside crypto, though engagement is still scattered. Some commentators like tech commentator Chamath Palihapitiya mention quantum here and there, often reacting to headlines like Google’s progress, but there’s no deep push yet for systemic change. That’s why Quranium is leaning in, not only by building infrastructure ready for the quantum era, but by keeping the conversation going across industries and communities. The more we raise awareness now, the more time we buy to ensure the transition is smooth, secure, and inclusive. I’ve seen a survey by Quranium. It reveals that people holding crypto are well aware of the problem and they want to protect their funds but most of them have no idea how to do it. Can you describe transitioning from vulnerable wallets to quantum-proof wallets from the user’s perspective? What can be already done? Dhiman : That stat you mentioned, “78% willing to switch for quantum-safe security”, really jumped out at us too. It’s clear: the community wants protection, but most people don’t know how to get there. And that’s not their fault. The current wallet ecosystem just hasn’t given users any clear path forward. From a user’s perspective, transitioning to a quantum-secure wallet shouldn’t be complicated. At Quranium, we built QSafe with that in mind. It feels like any other modern wallet: easy to set up a familiar interface, but under the hood, it uses post-quantum cryptography by default. That means your keys, backups, and transactions are secured with algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks, like SPHINCS+ and ML-KEM. Users can already take action. With QSafe, for example, the process is simple: Create a wallet, secure your recovery phrase, activate post-quantum settings (built-in by default), and move assets over from your existing wallet. There is no need to wait for a protocol upgrade or a hard fork. For those still using vulnerable wallets, the first step is awareness, understanding what protects your assets, and whether your current provider is even thinking about the quantum threat. Unfortunately, the survey showed that most aren’t. What we’re seeing is a shift. People are moving toward using their wallets like banks. But unlike banks, we don’t get to rely on regulators or insurance to back us up. It’s self-custody, which means the responsibility is higher, but so is the need for better tools. The dormant bitcoins question. Who will be in charge of unlocking the stuck bitcoins? Will they end up being grabbed by quantum raiders? Dhiman : This is one of the most uncomfortable truths about the quantum threat and one that very few people want to discuss. Dormant bitcoins, especially those sitting in old wallets with exposed public keys and no movement for years, are essentially low-hanging fruit for quantum computers. If Q-Day arrives before a hard fork or a protocol-wide upgrade, those coins can be stolen without any chance of recovery. So who’s in charge of unlocking them? Technically, no one. These wallets don’t have active guardians or access controls beyond their cryptography. If that cryptography breaks and quantum computers can derive private keys from public ones, those funds are as good as gone. That includes Satoshi’s wallets, which hold about $100 billion worth of BTC. In that scenario, it won’t be “unlocking,” it’ll be looting. Quantum raiders, whether state-backed or rogue actors, could sweep those wallets. And the worst part? You won’t even know it happened until the coins start moving. The chain won’t raise any red flags because from its point of view, the attacker has a valid private key. Unless Bitcoin undergoes a hard fork to adopt post-quantum cryptography in time, which is a monumental task requiring global coordination, there’s no central authority to protect those dormant coins. That’s why we keep saying: the clock is ticking. Security by consensus is powerful, but when facing something like quantum, it has to be fast too. Will quantum computers serve to improve the security of the crypto sector or benefit it the other way? If so, what are the possible use cases? Dhiman : Quantum computing is a double-edged sword for the crypto sector. On one hand, it’s the single biggest threat to the cryptographic foundations most blockchains rely on, especially those using RSA and elliptic curve signatures, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Algorithms like Shor’s can break these within hours once we hit the 2,000–4,000 logical qubit mark, and based on current trajectories, that could happen by the early 2030s. But that’s just one side of the story. Quantum tech could also strengthen the crypto space if we’re prepared. Take quantum random number generation (QRNG): it creates truly unpredictable keys, which could reduce wallet-level vulnerabilities. JPMorgan and Quantinuum have already shown how this works in finance, and crypto could follow. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is another example. It’s being tested in places like China for ultra-secure communication over long distances. If applied to crypto exchanges or high-value wallets, QKD could add a layer of defense that current systems lack. Beyond security, quantum computing could optimize how smart contracts are written, tested, and patched, especially in DeFi, where vulnerabilities can cause cascading failures. It could also supercharge fraud detection systems, giving AI tools the boost they need to analyze transactions and flag suspicious behavior in real time. So yes, quantum could benefit crypto but only if we get ahead of the threat first. If we delay the transition to post-quantum cryptography, then all these benefits won’t matter because we’ll be too busy dealing with the fallout. It’s a race: proactive adoption turns quantum into an ally. Waiting too long turns it into a wrecking ball.

2025-06-15T18:30:00,"Bitcoin Price Forecast: Will Institutional Demand Push BTC to a New ATH This Week as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Catches Fire?","Bitcoin (BTC) is on the brink of rewriting history. But while BTC dominates headlines, it’s a little-known altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , that’s sending the biggest shockwaves through crypto communities. Priced at just $0.03, MUTM is quickly emerging as the top token of summer 2025, with early buyers chasing what analysts are calling a potential of getting to $2. Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 12,000 investors have bought the token along with a total raise of $10.6 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is launched at $0.06. As traders search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 or what to buy before June ends, Mutuum Finance is becoming the breakout story of the season. Bitcoin Eyes New Highs Backed by Institutional Momentum Bitcoin remains steady, trading around $107,803, with intraday highs near $110,277 and lows around $107,491. Institutional demand is driving the narrative, large inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury purchases continue to support BTC’s bullish outlook. Technical indicators suggest Bitcoin is carving out a bullish breakout, with its recent bull flag formation and a golden cross between the 50- and 200-day moving averages pointing toward a potential retest of its May peak near $112,000. Analysts from firms such as Bitwise and Bernstein have issued conservative 2025 targets of $200,000, citing macroeconomic tailwinds like easing inflation and further ETF expansion. Mutuum Finance Presale Explodes Past $10.6M Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum in presale. Phase 5 of the presale is surging as investors rush to grab tokens at just $0.03 before the next price hike, and with good reason.

2025-06-15T18:06:02,"Bitcoin Bull vs. Neo Pepe Protocol—Where Will Smart Investors Go?","The post Bitcoin Bull vs. Neo Pepe Protocol—Where Will Smart Investors Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is a constantly evolving battleground where seasoned investors must differentiate between short-lived excitement and enduring, visionary projects. As investor interest continues to surge, two crypto presales have come into sharp focus: Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) and Neo Pepe Protocol ($NEOP) . Each offers distinctive paths forward, representing fundamentally different approaches to investing, decentralization, and long-term market engagement. Discerning investors need to carefully evaluate the underlying strengths, governance frameworks, liquidity structures, and symbolic messaging of each project to identify which offers the most robust potential. Symbolic Power and Narrative Appeal—Traditional Optimism vs. Revolutionary Vision Bitcoin Bull presents a straightforward narrative of traditional market optimism, leveraging bullish sentiments deeply rooted in Bitcoin’s historic performance. This simplicity and familiarity resonate with investors seeking secure, predictable associations, banking on Bitcoin’s proven market appeal and emotional resonance. Conversely, Neo Pepe Protocol boldly positions itself as a Revolutionary Crypto project through its distinctive narrative, the Memetrix. It emphasizes decentralization, rebellion against systemic financial oppression, and rejection of market saturation. Investors in Neo Pepe are not merely participating financially but are part of a significant cultural and economic movement. This visionary symbolism attracts those seeking impactful change alongside substantial financial returns. Presale Dynamics and Liquidity Strategies—Balancing Urgency with Stability Presale structures significantly influence investor decisions. Bitcoin Bull’s traditional, predictable approach offers minimal urgency, potentially limiting initial momentum and growth. Neo Pepe Protocol, however, employs a meticulously structured presale designed to amplify investor engagement and urgency: 16-Stage Escalation : Incrementally increasing token prices from $0.05 to $0.16, incentivizing swift investor action. Hourly Token Unlocking Post-Launch : Gradual token releases maintain sustained market engagement and prevent oversaturation. Additionally, Neo Pepe’s sophisticated auto-liquidity mechanism directly addresses volatility and enhances stability: Auto-Liquidity Generation : Every transaction contributes a 2.5% boost to liquidity pools. LP Token Burn : Immediate burning of liquidity provider tokens permanently locks liquidity, significantly stabilizing the asset. These combined presale dynamics and liquidity measures position Neo Pepe as a safer, yet aggressively growth-oriented investment opportunity, appealing especially to those prioritizing risk mitigation. Decentralized Governance—Investor Empowerment and Transparency Robust governance structures foster investor confidence and project integrity. Bitcoin Bull’s governance model remains opaque, potentially limiting investor insight and influence. Neo Pepe Protocol, in contrast, offers a comprehensive, transparent decentralized governance model designed explicitly to empower investors: Delegated Voting Power : Investors actively influence decisions through token delegation. Transparent Treasury Management : Community-driven oversight eliminates misuse concerns, ensuring funds are appropriately allocated. Mandatory Timelock for Decisions : Deliberate decision-making periods reinforce accountability and investor trust. This governance approach distinctly positions Neo Pepe as a compelling choice for investors demanding transparency, active participation, and collective stewardship. Comparative Market Context and Investor Outlook Amid a competitive presale environment featuring projects like Solaxy (SOLX), Antix (ANTIX), and Catslap (SLAP), Neo Pepe’s meticulous attention to liquidity, presale strategy, and governance transparency significantly differentiates it. This careful consideration distinctly surpasses Bitcoin Bull’s more conventional narrative and simpler tokenomics. For seasoned crypto investors, Neo Pepe Protocol clearly stands out by blending visionary symbolism, strategic presale momentum, innovative liquidity management, and transparent governance. These compelling elements not only minimize typical early-stage risks but also maximize long-term project viability and investor confidence. Conclusion—Why Neo Pepe Emerges as the Superior Investment Choice Ultimately, comparing Bitcoin Bull and Neo Pepe Protocol highlights stark contrasts in narrative depth, liquidity strategies, presale dynamics, and governance transparency. Bitcoin Bull’s straightforward, familiar approach provides initial comfort but lacks essential sophistication and investor empowerment crucial for sustained success.

Both billionaires are asserting that Bitcoin has the capacity to become the reserve currency of the world. Speaking at this year’s State of Crypto Summit, the Coinbase head highlighted the struggle faced by different governments in their attempt to contain deficit spending. He shares his optimistic outlook for Bitcoin as an alternative currency capable of containing the rise in deficit spending, adding that mass adoption is underway. The crypto billionaire further expressed confidence in this series of events, adding that it could position Bitcoin as a universal reserve currency. “Democracies around the world are really struggling to get their deficit spending under control. I guess my crazy little idea is that I think Bitcoin is going to provide an important check and balance on deficit spending, and if it gets out of control too much, people will flee to it in times of uncertainty, and it could actually end up that Bitcoin is the new reserve currency of the world.” He asserted . Paul Graham, who reacted to Brian Armstrong’s statement, explained that the driving force behind his decision to purchase Bitcoin in its early days was tied to the possibility that it would eventually become a global store of value. “When I first bought some (or at least talked to you about buying some) in 2013, that was the reason: as insurance against it becoming the world’s reserve currency.” He wrote . When asked if his Bitcoin holdings were still intact, he responded in affirmation: “I assume so,” he wrote in a follow-up post. At report time, Bitcoin is valued at $105,566 per coin.

2025-06-15T17:30:13,"Vietnam Says Yes To Crypto In Bold Legal Shift – Details","Vietnam’s National Assembly gave its stamp of approval to a new digital tech law on June 14. It brings crypto assets under formal rules for the first time. It also sets out a wider push into AI, semiconductors and more. Government Classifies Digital Assets According to local media outlets, the law groups digital holdings into two buckets: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both must use encryption or other digital tech to move or confirm transactions. Neither group covers securities, digital fiat money or any other financial tools. Lawmakers have until January 1, 2026 to spell out who can issue, trade or hold these tokens—and what rules they must follow. Regulatory Rules And Safeguards Based on reports , the law demands new anti‑money laundering and cybersecurity steps that match global norms. Vietnam has sat on the FATF gray list since 2023, and officials clearly want to close that chapter. Agencies will draw up detailed checks on transactions and platforms before the law takes effect. Ambitious Tech Incentives The legislation goes well beyond crypto . It offers tax breaks, cheaper land leases and R&D grants for companies in AI, chip design and data‑center builds. Regional governments must back training programs for engineers and tech workers. Schools will add digital skills into their courses, too. It’s all part of a bigger bid to rival hubs like Singapore, Seoul and Shenzhen. Past Crypto Scams Motivate Action Lawmakers haven’t forgotten the frauds that hit the market in 2024 and 2025. In February 2025, police rounded up four people behind BitMiner, a fake mining site that took more than 4 billion VND (about $157,300) from over 200 victims. And back in December 2024, Hanoi cops stopped a scheme called Million Smiles before it drew in 300 would‑be investors. That scam had already stolen 30 billion VND (around $1.17 million) from roughly 100 businesses and 400 individuals by selling a bogus “Quantum Financial System” token. The new law is a clear signal that Vietnam wants to shape its own tech destiny. By January 1, 2026, companies and users will face fresh rules—and fresh chances. If regulators stick to the plan, real projects should find a welcome home. But if the rollout gets slow or half‑hearted, gray‑list worries and more scams could follow. For now, the countdown is on.

Hoskinson is confident that converting millions of ADA tokens to Bitcoin and other stablecoins could accomplish this. More precisely, the Cardano boss told viewers on a recent YouTube live stream that setting aside $100 million worth of ADA tokens from its treasury and converting them to Bitcoin and selected stablecoins could strengthen Cardano’s DeFi network. As he is quoted as saying; “What I’d like to see is could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury and convert it to a blend of a collection of stable coins and incumbent in Cardano, so USDM, USDA, as well as ADA-backed stablecoin synthetics like IUSD, and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin DeFi.” He asserts that the goal is to increase the DeFi to stablecoin ratios, bringing them into line with those of other DeFi ecosystems. Hoskinson targets a 33% to 40% ratio between stablecoin issuance and total locked value (TLV) on the network. Hoskinson further explained that with millions of ADA transfers being recorded daily, a significant transfer of funds might have little to no impact on the price of the ADA token as liquidity could still be enhanced with over-the-counter trades, among other things. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of ADA change hands on a daily basis, and the markets are deep enough that it could absorb within 30 to 90 days using TWAPs, OTCs, and other mechanisms, a hundred million dollar sale without moving the ADA price in any significant fashion.” He stated. At report time, ADA is valued at $0.6 per token. With altcoins collectively taking a hit, ADA has also not been spared. While 30-day losses have crossed 20%, over 4.35% has been sustained in losses over the last 7 days.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-shares-master-plan-to-usher-in-massive-liquidation-for-cardano/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano",cryptocompare

Yet, beyond the headlines, a quieter surge is unfolding inside the DeFi sector. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol currently in its presale phase, is making waves with soaring participation numbers, aggressive volume growth, and unmatched investor momentum. With over $10.55 million already raised and more than 12,000 holders onboarded, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most in-demand tokens of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building for function, not just FOMO Unlike speculative assets driven only by hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with strong DeFi fundamentals. The protocol will allow users to lend and borrow a variety of crypto assets using two mechanisms: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will deposit assets like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Avalanche (AVAX), or Solana (SOL) into shared liquidity pools. In the P2P model, users will be able to negotiate lending terms directly, bypassing automated rates to set custom deals. This will be especially useful for trading in tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB)—assets not usually supported on major platforms. At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward users who provide liquidity through non-custodial smart contracts. When users deposit assets, they will receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens will represent both the initial deposit and the interest earned, growing in value as borrowing activity increases. Unlike staking systems that rely on inflationary rewards, interest on Mutuum will come from actual borrower demand—ensuring more sustainable returns. Users aiming for passive income can stake their mtTokens in a safety module to receive dividend distributions in the form of MUTM tokens. These dividends will be funded by the protocol’s revenue, primarily from borrower interest. To maintain upward demand pressure on the token price, the protocol will use part of its earnings to buy MUTM on the open market and distribute it to stakers. While the crypto world watches Bitcoin (BTC)’s dominance climb with renewed excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly outpacing most of the market in volume and holder count. The presale’s strong engagement reflects growing investor confidence in protocols with real utility, especially those that are still undervalued ahead of major exchange listings. With a fixed total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens and a listing price expected to open at $0.06, many believe the current $0.03 presale rate presents an entry opportunity with high upside. With the ongoing $100K giveaway , this early-stage advantage is becoming rare in a market where many altcoins have already priced in future expectations. The stablecoin advantage and layered ecosystem growth One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s most important innovations is its upcoming decentralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized or fiat-backed options, this stablecoin will be minted directly from overcollateralized on-chain assets already held in the protocol. This system will increase transparency and maintain algorithmic supply adjustments, allowing users to borrow against stable value without relying on external reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already achieved key milestones in its first phase. These include executing the presale, launching marketing campaigns, listing on crypto tracking platforms, and initiating a smart contract audit by CertiK. As the roadmap progresses into development-focused phases, the team will deliver key infrastructure: smart contracts, frontend dApps, and full backend integration. Phase 3 will include testnet beta testing and a functional demo version. Once this is complete, the project will move into Phase 4, where the live platform will go public. The MUTM token will be listed on major exchanges, and investors will be able to claim and use their tokens in the working platform. At that stage, the dividend mechanisms, smart contract lending, and user dashboard will become fully operational—solidifying MUTM as a functional asset rather than just a speculative token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers use, not just hype As Bitcoin (BTC) climbs toward new peaks, investor attention naturally gravitates toward established names. But history shows that once top-tier coins reach all-time highs, smart money begins rotating into newer protocols offering real utility and stronger upside. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself: not as a hype machine, but as a working product with yield, utility, and growth potential. Its passive income structure, overcollateralized borrowing system, and smart contract-driven ecosystem offer clear financial pathways for both cautious and active participants. The upcoming stablecoin and expanding cross-chain features will only deepen its market relevance, while token buybacks and dividend mechanisms will support long-term value for users. While Bitcoin (BTC) holders are celebrating the $112K milestone, those who joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.03 are watching their early-stage investment move toward real-world application, token appreciation, and income-generating possibilities. As the protocol prepares for its official launch, one thing is clear—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not waiting for permission to lead the next wave of DeFi.

According to a new report from the New York Post, records released by the Office of Government Ethics show that Trump’s stake in WLFI raked in just over $57.3 million for him, one of his largest sources of income in the past year. WLFI, which was launched last year, was co-founded by Trump’s three sons – Donald Jr., Eric and Barron – and others as a response to what they say is the growing politicization of the banking system. Previously, Donald Trump Jr. said that his family was debanked after getting into politics and described the banking system as a “pyramid scheme.” “There was a time… where I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone [and] I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked.” The disclosure reports that Trump’s personal crypto wallet is valued at between $1,000,001 and $5 million while listing millions of dollars worth of royalty payments he received for selling items with his name and likeness. Some of the President’s noteworthy liabilities include $100 million worth of mortgage loans for various properties, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of lawsuits and tens of thousands of dollars worth of credit card bills.

Amid this clash, the crypto market is also affected, as Bitcoin and altcoins are witnessing selling pressure. However, Ravencoin’s trend is still bullish, and it is coming down to its key levels from where it can bounce again. Let’s find the key levels in detail in this Ravencoin price prediction. Table of Contents What is Ravencoin? Ravencoin price prediction Ravencoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook Ravencoin price prediction 2025 Ravencoin price prediction 2030 Since its launch, Ravencoin ( RVN ) has reached an all-time high of $0.27391, followed by a 1363% price drop. At the time of writing, it is currently trading at $0.0196, which represents a 45% drop from $0.03573, which was seen 5 months ago in December 2024.. RVN 1 week chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss RVN price prediction by giving you its short-term and long-term price forecasts and exploring whether this token can continue its bullish run. You might also like: What Is Ravencoin (RVN) and Is It a Legit Cryptocurrency? What is Ravencoin? The goal of Ravencoin, a digital peer-to-peer (P2P) network, is to deploy a use case-specific blockchain that is intended to effectively manage a single function: the transfer of assets between parties. Built on a fork of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) code, Ravencoin was first announced on October 31, 2017, and on January 3, 2018, it released binaries for mining. This was known as a fair launch because there was no premine, initial coin offering, or masternodes. Its name was inspired by the Game of Thrones television series. Ravencoin, which is a fork of the BTC code, has four major features: a mining algorithm (KAWPOW, formerly X16R and X16RV2 respectively) designed to lessen the centralization of mining brought on by ASIC hardware; a modified issuance schedule (with a block reward of 5,000 RVN); a block time reduction to one minute; and a coin supply cap of 21 billion, which is a thousand times greater than BTC. Ravencoin seeks to address the issue of blockchain trade and asset transfers. In the past, an asset produced on the BTC blockchain could unintentionally be destroyed when the coins used to create it were traded. Token assets on the Ravenchain can only be issued by burning RVN coins, which are intended to function as internal currency within the network. A stake of a project, such as equities and securities, airline miles, an hour’s pay, or real-world custodial items like gold or actual euros, can all be represented by the assets. Now let’s discuss RVN price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Ravencoin price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the RVN token? Let’s dive into the RVN price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Ravencoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Ravencoin price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to drop by -0.85% and reach $0.01973 by July 13, 2025. As of June. 13th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the RVN price outlook has turned slightly bullish, with 14 technical analysis indicators showing bullish signals, 4 indicating bearish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Ravencoin price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the RVN token’s price could fluctuate between $0.0170 and $0.0418, and may likely hold a yearly average of $0.0358. CoinCodex projects that the RVN token can trade in the price channel of $0.019725 and $0.021148 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in RVN or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Ravencoin price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Ravencoin crypto price prediction for 2030, RVN’s price could vary between $0.02421 and $0.026785. DigitalCoinPrice expects that RVN’s price could climb to $0.0904 and $0.10 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the RVN price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the RVN token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including RVN. A great way for RVN to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the RVN token.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including RVN , please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Additionally, it is worth noting that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market can change rapidly, and a token that was once considered a future investment may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the RVN token. Will Ravencoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is challenging to predict the exact value of the RVN token, it is essential to watch for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Ravencoin price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low RVN can go.

Investors are keen to know if this dump will be retraced, considering that many altcoins are bouncing, due to the recent surge in price of Bitcoin. Let’s find that out in detail in this Mask Network price prediction. Table of Contents What is Mask Network? Mask Network price prediction Mask Network coin price prediction: short-term outlook Mask Network price prediction 2025 Mask Network price prediction 2030 Since its launch, Mask Network ( MASK ) has seen an all-time high of $97.92, followed by a -5867.2% drop in price. At the time of writing, it is now trading at $1.39, which is around a 70% decrease from its price of $4.7352, which was recorded four months ago in December 2024.

Mask Network is a protocol that enables users to transmit encrypted communications via Facebook and Twitter. In essence, it serves as a link between a decentralized network operating on top of the Internet. When Mask Network was first introduced in July 2019, its primary application was to enable users of Facebook and Twitter to encrypt posts on these social media sites. Subsequently, HashKey and Hash Global co-led a $2 million investment round in November 2020, while Digital Currency Group and Fundamental Labs participated in a subsequent $3 million funding round in February 2021. Mask Network now allows Gitcoin grant campaigns to be funded straight from Twitter. It also intends to provide decentralized storage and peer-to-peer payments. Known as a decentralized Applet (DApplet) ecosystem, it is a decentralized portal that enables users to use DApps such as cryptocurrency payments, decentralized finance, decentralized storage, e-commerce (digital goods/NFTs), and decentralized organizations (DAOs) on top of pre-existing social networks without migrating. Now let’s discuss MASK price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Mask Network price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the MASK token? Let’s dive into the MASK price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Mask Network coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Mask Network price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 41.61% and reach $2.36 by July 10, 2025.. As of June 10th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the MASK price outlook has shifted slightly bearish, with 17 technical analysis indicators displaying bearish signals, 11 indicating bullish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Mask Network price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the MASK token’s price could fluctuate between $1.47 and $3.61, and may likely hold a yearly average of $2.83. CoinCodex projects that the MASK token can trade in the price channel of $1.636636 and $1.636636 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in MASK or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Mask Network price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Mask Network crypto price prediction for 2030, MASK’s price could vary between $3.58 and $4.57. DigitalCoinPrice expects that MASK’s price could climb to $4.84 or $5.99 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the MASK price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the MASK token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including MASK. A great way for MASK to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the MASK token. You might also like: Decentralized social network Mask Network restructures MaskDAO ecosystem Is Mask Network a good investment? Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including MASK, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the MASK token. Will Mask Network go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the MASK token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Mask Network price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low MASK can go. Should I invest in Mask Network? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Mask Network price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the MASK token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-06-15T16:13:42,"Kaspa Early Investors Now Flocking to Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Don’t Miss Bitcoin’s Second Coming","The post Kaspa Early Investors Now Flocking to Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Don’t Miss Bitcoin’s Second Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Kaspa was once the darling of proof-of-work maximalists. Its DAG-based structure and high-speed execution brought serious gains to those who believed early. But now, many of those same investors are pivoting fast. The destination? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a radically engineered blockchain designed not just for speed or security, but for unlocking real wealth for the everyday person. For many, it’s not just another altcoin—it’s Bitcoin’s second coming. Kaspa Had Its Run—But the Momentum Has Shifted There’s no denying Kaspa’s early promise. With block times measured in seconds and an innovative take on consensus, it drew praise from technologists and traders alike. But despite its brilliance, it’s facing limitations. Kaspa lacks a layered architecture, has no native staking, and remains too niche for widespread adoption. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is proving irresistible to those who profited from Kaspa’s rise and are now seeking the next transformative leap. With stronger architecture, a mobile-first strategy, and an entirely different approach to community growth, BTC-S is emerging as the smarter play. Bitcoin Solaris: Where Power Meets Purpose At the core of Bitcoin Solaris lies a dual-consensus model. Its Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work to maintain the Bitcoin ethos—decentralization, fairness, and security. But layered on top is the Solaris Layer, a Delegated Proof-of-Stake system that delivers 100,000 TPS and 2-second finality. Together, they form a blockchain that is: Scalable beyond legacy limits Energy-efficient, consuming 99.95% less than Bitcoin Fully ready for smart contracts and real-world utility The upcoming Solaris Nova App takes this even further, allowing users to mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones, without any need for expensive rigs or technical setup. (You can preview the rewards using this mining calculator ). Liquid Staking Built for Real Users Bitcoin Solaris goes beyond passive holding with its liquid staking system. Once staked, BTC-S tokens become sBTC-S, a fully tradable version that can still earn rewards while remaining usable in DeFi. Rewards + Liquidity in one Compatible with DeFi protocols Strengthens the network through participation Managed easily through the Solaris Nova App Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Referrals That Reward Both Sides Unlike most projects that only reward one party, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double rewards referral program . When someone joins through a referral, both the inviter and the new buyer receive 5% in BTC-S tokens automatically. Growing Buzz from Influencers and Analysts The buzz surrounding Bitcoin Solaris is impossible to ignore. A comprehensive review by 2Bit Crypto dives into why so many believe BTC-S is the only serious challenger to Bitcoin’s original mission. Meanwhile, Ben Crypto highlights its unique technical strengths and how mobile mining could redefine mass adoption. It’s not just a trend, it’s a migration. From Telegram groups to X threads, crypto enthusiasts are calling it a fresh start for people priced out of traditional mining or slow chains. Presale Demand Hits New Heights Bitcoin Solaris is now in phase 7 of its presale, with the price currently at $7 and climbing soon to $8. The launch is locked for July 31, with a $20 token price target—a potential 187% return for today’s buyers. Over 11,500+ users already joined $4.5M+ raised, gaining momentum by the day Only weeks left before the presale ends Recognized as one of the shortest and most aggressive launches in 2025 This is where Bitcoin Solaris truly shines . It’s not just about tech, it’s about access. It’s about giving everyday people a fair shot before the whales even wake up. The Final Word: Why This Matters Now Bitcoin Solaris isn’t here to replace Bitcoin. It’s here to complement it with better tools, more access, and faster pathways to growth. It carries the spirit of early Bitcoin but upgrades the infrastructure to serve today’s reality. No massive rigs, no centralized mining pools, only speed, fairness, and utility in your hands. Kaspa was a brilliant chapter. But the next chapter is already being written, and BTC-S is on the cover.

2025-06-15T16:11:59,"From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP eyes $10 as Bitcoin targets $200k, but rising memecoin LILPEPE may outshine Ripple in 2025’s bullish crypto market. Ripple is in the news again as the cryptocurrency market readies itself for a potential growth spurt. Analysts are predicting Bitcoin to surge to $200,000, which in turn would allow XRP to reach $10. They attribute this to a potent combination of positive technical indicators, institutional demand, and favorable regulations. But XRP is gaining ground. While Little Pepe, a memecoin, is gaining prominence, it is also becoming a significant player in the market. Powered by meme magic and battle-hardened blockchain engineering, LILPEPE is a breakout penny crypto that has the potential to surpass even XRP’s stellar projections in 2025. Here’s why investing in LILPEPE could be a lucrative opportunity during this meme-fueled bull market. You might also like: XRP price nears big move as RLUSD flirts with $500m milestone BTC at $200,000? XRP’s path to $10 looks real The conditions are favorable for Bitcoin to make a significant surge towards $200,000. With over $126 billion now locked into spot Bitcoin ETFs and exchange balances dwindling, the case for BTC’s 83% rise from $109K is becoming increasingly compelling. Altcoin surges historically follow a breakout to these levels, and XRP sits at the front of that wave. XRP has outperformed BTC by a massive 343% over the last 12 months. Analysts, based on projections of the XRP/BTC ratio, anticipate clear targets at $4.35 and $5, with a potential peak at $10. Add Ripple’s ongoing legal wins and increasing institutional usage as a payment solution, and there is a fundamentally strong asset with explosive potential. The meme kingdom: Why LILPEPE will shine brighter than XRP While XRP has institutional respect, LILPEPE commands the culture. The memecoin revolution has minted millionaires from mere memes. Launched on June 10, 2025, LILPEPE is revolutionizing the industry with a Layer 2 chain designed explicitly for memes, offering speed, affordability, security, and legendary status. Imagine a memecoin that doesn’t just exist on Ethereum but out-memes Ethereum itself. LILPEPE is the world’s first Layer 2 dedicated entirely to memes, with sniper-bot protection, zero tax, and a Launchpad (“Pump Pad”) tailored to launch viral meme projects straight to the moon. Why LILPEPE could dominate in 2025: Zero Tax, No Bots: Built-in sniper bot resistance ensures fair launches. Fast Finality: Transactions confirm faster than Elon tweets. Presale Still Live: Stage 1 ongoing; over $447,000 already raised at $0.001 per token. Tokenomics Made for Mooning: 100b total supply, with 26.5B allocated for presale. That’s your low-entry opportunity. CEX Listings: Plans confirmed for two top-tier exchange listings post-launch, strategically targeting the world’s biggest exchange. Buy LILPEPE with ETH or USDT via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Tokens are claimable after the presale ends; just connect a wallet and flex the memecoins. Not just another frog: The rise of the meme empire From the swamps of Solidity and the jungles of JavaScript, a small yet powerful hero emerged — Little Pepe. LILPEPE isn’t some recycled Pepe wannabe. He is the inheritor of the meme throne. With a narrative that blends web3 storytelling and community power, LILPEPE is giving rug-pulled frogs and boring Layer 2s something to cry about. Penny crypto, gigabrain potential At a token price of $0.001, LILPEPE represents the pinnacle of early adoption. This isn’t just a token floating in a pond. This is a frog equipped with a jetpack, equipped with meme magic, and backed by a community eager to take action. According to early ape whispers, if XRP outperforms Bitcoin’s rise by 10x, LILPEPE could increase 150x to 180x. And the price charts are still in infancy — this is pre-launch, pre-pump, pre-FOMO. Why settle for a 10x when the frog army is eyeing triple digits? Conclusion: All hail the meme king of 2025 Bitcoin at $200k? XRP at $10? It’s all within reach. While institutions are catching up with XRP, the most astute investors are already investing in LILPEPE, the only memecoin that boasts its Layer 2, sniper-free launches, zero tax, and a roadmap as comprehensive as a PEPE meme folder. Many projects have been started. Rug pulls, legs, and gas have burned many investors’ gains. But the present is a moment. Little Pepe is now available — small in name, powerful in meme. The presale is currently underway, with tokens soaring faster than the fervor on cryptocurrency Twitter. Don’t remain indifferent as LILPEPE transforms into the most legendary meme coin of 2025. Invest in LILPEPE today and allow the frog to lead towards a prosperous future. Let the Golden Meme Age begin. To learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website , Telegram , and X .

2025-06-15T16:10:54,"Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager Philippe Laffont Claims Bitcoin has a Good Beta Value for Portfolios","Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, attended Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in New York City and said that Bitcoin was becoming more attractive to institutional investors because its volatility has decreased. Laffont argued that crypto’s beta values have decreased, making digital assets like Bitcoin a key component of a modern-day portfolio. Philippe Laffont manages a tech-focused hedge fund and is interested in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced dramatic swings over time, turning off investors from buying the digital asset. Laffont was one of those investors who stayed away from Bitcoin due to its volatility. Bitcoin has surged through 2025 but has reduced its volatility over time. Laffont argues that Bitcoin has less volatility than it did years ago and may become even more attractive to future investors. Bitcoin has changed its market dynamics over time. Laffont pointed out that Bitcoin dropped 60% during 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite only dropped 33%. Conversely, Bitcoin only fell 5% in 2025 when President Trump introduced tariffs, while Nasdaq dropped 6%. The hedge fund manager believes this signifies Bitcoin’s growing maturity. Laffont also believes institutional investors drive down volatility by making informed decisions about adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Bitcoin trades above $100k and fluctuates moderately given its high price bracket. Laffont, an experienced hedge fund manager, said that Bitcoin was once considered a speculative asset, but was now becoming more foundational, and could start to look more like a legacy market. Laffont avoided Bitcoin in the past due to how unstable it was. But now, according to Laffont, the math is changing, and the cost of getting into Bitcoin is decreasing. Laffont surmised that if the beta value of Bitcoin continues to go down, then the crypto market will become even more interesting. A beta value compares the volatility of an asset to the broader market. Coatue Management has invested in various crypto businesses, including Dune Analytics and Hut 8. Coatue specialises in technology investments, which fits the market of cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence. However, Laffont avoided crypto for some time due to issues with its underlying pricing structure. Laffont claims that he wakes up at 3 AM every night and bemoans what an ‘idiot’ he had been for not getting into crypto earlier. He asks himself over and over again why he didn’t invest more in crypto. During Laffont’s time as a hedge fund manager, he gained experience. He learned that simple ideas are much better than complicated ones regarding investment decisions. He admits that his team deliberated for years over use cases for Bitcoin and failed to see its simplistic value right before them. Laffont analysed the dynamics of Bitcoin and noticed that traders were holding their tokens for more extended periods, specifically concerning the number of traders holding tokens over one month. According to Laffont, the rate of traders selling Bitcoin after just one month has been dramatically reduced. Traders are making fewer in-and-out transactions, and are contemplating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Traders, therefore, are treating Bitcoin more like an investment and less like a speculative asset. According to Laffont, this behavior change is changing the portfolio dynamics of digital assets. Laffont also noticed that big names were getting involved in cryptocurrencies, which was another key sign that the market was changing. He saw that BlackRock was getting involved in Bitcoin and was even playing a pivotal role in introducing crypto ETFs to the investment community. Laffont reasoned that more big names were bound to get involved after a few announced their interest in Bitcoin.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/billionaire-hedge-fund-manager-philippe-laffont-claims-bitcoin-has-a-good-beta-value-for-portfolios/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T16:05:20,"Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire Predicts Stablecoins Will Have An “iPhone Moment” Very Soon","Jeremy Allaire, Circle CEO, commented that he felt stablecoins were on the verge of having a breakout moment reminiscent of the 2007 iPhone launch. Allaire said the community is not quite experiencing an iPhone moment regarding using stablecoins. He said we’ll know when we’ve reached that moment when developers universally recognise the value of programmable dollars. Circle is the issuer of the widely used stablecoin USDC. Allaire believes that stablecoins are on the verge of being widely recognised worldwide. Allaire responded to a post by Sam Broner, partner at a16z Crypto, who stated that stablecoins improve competition and enable companies to build low-cost financial applications. Broner further commented that stablecoins allow anyone to program money, which leads to better access to economic applications. Sam Broner, partner at a16z Crypto, stated that fixed and marginal costs of creating a financial startup are now significantly cheaper due to the accessibility of stablecoins. Broner argued that stablecoins enable better competition in the FinTech market, lower product prices, and benefit the community overall. These comments by Broner and Allaire come as Walmart and Amazon plan to release their dollar-backed stablecoins . E-commerce giant Shopify announced it will integrate Circle’s USDC stablecoin by the end of 2025. There seems to be a lot of momentum gearing up behind stablecoin adoption. Allaire believes the hype is significant and indicates further progress in using stablecoins. Circle was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, jumping 165% in price due to traders buying the newfound stocks. There is a keen interest in crypto and AI companies on the stock market, adding to the speculative value of crypto stocks. Circle CEO Allaire believes the excitement has just begun and will culminate in an iPhone-like event. Stablecoins have been building momentum lately due to their practical use as a remittance medium. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by market capitalisation, announced on June 8 that they had no plans to create a public listing in the foreseeable future. Tether issues the stablecoin USDT and dominates the market. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, said that the company will remain a private entity and will not follow suit with Circle’s IPO. As Allaire puts it, an “iPhone moment” could be just around the corner due to the amount of competition heating up around stablecoin use. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act may contribute to the breakout moment that Allaire envisions. Stablecoins are digital currencies often pegged to a real-world asset such as US dollars. Due to their underlying algorithm, stablecoins are very fast to transact and can be programmed for various purposes. Conversely, due to their high volatility, traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are cumbersome to transact across borders. Stablecoins were invented to overcome Bitcoin’s limitations and attract institutional investors to the world of digital assets. The latter goal has been very successful if the current hype about stablecoins is anything to go by. There was much uncertainty surrounding using stablecoins due to the conflicting regulatory reports in America. At one stage, it was thought that stablecoins would be regulated as securities, which would have put a lot of unnecessary pressure on stablecoin issuers. The regulatory environment has changed significantly since then, and stablecoins could be on the verge of experiencing a golden age. Conversely, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are issued by governments instead of private companies. The benefit of stablecoins is that they can be used easily by companies such as Amazon and Walmart. Circle, meanwhile, has released its stablecoin USDC on the XRP ecosystem , furthering the reach of the pegged US dollar and stablecoins in general. The move extends USDC across Ripple’s ISO accredited business services, boosting USDC’s legitimacy in the crypto market. Developers will benefit from this integration because they can utilise the stablecoin without engaging in complex bridging operations. The integration of stablecoins into major blockchain networks such as Ripple is a sign that stablecoins are on the verge of having an iPhone moment.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/circle-ceo-jeremy-allaire-predicts-stablecoins-will-have-an-iphone-moment-very-soon/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|USDT|USDC","Cryptocurrency|News|Circle|Stablecoins|USDC",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T15:58:18,"Ripple CEO Says XRP is the Next Bitcoin. Here’s What this Means to XRP Price","In a recent broadcast from Bloomberg Live in Singapore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reignited optimism in the XRP community by suggesting that XRP could be the “next Bitcoin.” The statement, captured in a video clip shared by crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, has stirred renewed debate about XRP’s long-term potential, particularly its ability to rival Bitcoin in relevance, adoption, and price growth. Garlinghouse’s remarks come at a pivotal time, as Ripple continues to expand its global footprint in cross-border payments and institutional partnerships . His confident tone during the interview signals Ripple’s renewed push to solidify XRP’s role as a foundational asset for global financial infrastructure. Just a reminder that you are the lucky one holding the next #Bitcoin called #XRP ! $10,000 pic.twitter.com/UXj2WvxtMM — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Regulatory Advantage What sets XRP apart from many other digital assets is its regulatory positioning. Garlinghouse noted that “from the get-go, XRP has worked with regulators and regulated institutions like banks.” This emphasis on compliance is not new, but in the current climate, where regulatory uncertainty continues to cloud much of the crypto industry, it becomes increasingly crucial. Unlike Bitcoin, which was born out of a libertarian ethos of decentralization and minimal oversight, XRP has always aimed to complement the existing financial system rather than disrupt it. Ripple’s enterprise-grade payment solutions are being built in partnership with financial institutions, not in rebellion against them. This orientation toward working with regulators may help XRP scale in a manner that’s palatable to governments and banks, critical stakeholders in the trillion-dollar global payments market. The Bitcoin Comparison The Ripple CEO did not shy away from directly addressing the comparison with Bitcoin. When asked whether XRP could be the next Bitcoin, Garlinghouse responded, “If we work with the system to solve this problem, and we can solve the problem at scale —a problem measured in trillions of dollars—it is a lot of opportunity to create value in XRP.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This isn’t merely hyperbole. Ripple has long argued that global liquidity inefficiencies—especially in cross-border payments—represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. XRP, as an on-chain liquidity solution, is central to Ripple’s vision for solving this. If it can indeed scale and offer settlement speeds and cost efficiencies far beyond traditional systems like SWIFT or correspondent banking networks, then the comparison to Bitcoin becomes less about ideology and more about market value. What This Means for XRP Price The speculative implications of Garlinghouse’s comments have not gone unnoticed. JackTheRippler, in sharing the clip, boldly declared: “Just a reminder that you are the lucky one holding the next Bitcoin called XRP! $10,000.” While such a price target may sound sensational to many, it underscores the long-held belief among XRP proponents that the asset remains grossly undervalued in light of its potential use cases. If XRP succeeds in becoming the liquidity layer for international payments, backed by institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and global utility, then a significant price appreciation could follow. The idea is not necessarily that XRP would copy Bitcoin’s trajectory point for point, but that it could experience a similar exponential rise driven by mainstream acceptance and institutional integration.

2025-06-15T15:24:00,"BTC stalls near $108K resistance again, yet MUTM’s momentum is turning heads","As Bitcoin (BTC) struggles once again to break through the $108,000 resistance level, investors and traders are increasingly turning their attention to projects that offer real utility and tangible returns within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Among these emerging contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves by combining innovative technology with real-yield lending models designed to reward users and active participants alike. While Bitcoin (BTC)’s price action remains uncertain, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily gaining traction thanks to its unique lending options, a growing community, and a solid roadmap that promises significant developments in the near future. Understanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its dual lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized protocol designed to facilitate lending and borrowing across a broad range of digital assets. What sets Mutuum apart is its dual approach to lending: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to deposit assets such as ETH, SOL, BTC, BNB, or AVAX into liquidity pools where they earn interest that adjusts dynamically based on borrower demand. The P2P model takes this one step further by allowing lenders to offer direct loans to other users with fully customizable terms. This option opens the door to lending assets typically unsupported by centralized platforms, such as popular memecoins Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). By enabling direct negotiations and flexible rates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides lenders with enhanced earning potential and borrowers with access to more diverse funding sources. One of the key technical advantages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) boasts is its Layer-2 integration, which promises faster and more cost-effective transactions. Layer-2 solutions address major pain points in the DeFi world, such as network congestion and high fees, by processing transactions off the main blockchain while maintaining security. This architecture will allow Mutuum users to enjoy a seamless and efficient experience, positioning the protocol ahead of many competitors struggling with slow or expensive networks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a fully decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin backed entirely by on-chain assets held within its protocol. This approach diverges from traditional stablecoins that rely on fiat reserves or centralized backing. The stablecoin will be minted algorithmically based on collateral deposited into the system, ensuring transparency and stability. By redirecting interest payments from loans into the protocol treasury, this stablecoin mechanism will further solidify Mutuum’s financial foundation and expand utility options for MUTM users. How MUTM holders benefit beyond price appreciation The native token of the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has a total supply capped at 4 billion tokens. With over 12,000 holders and $10.55 million raised during Phase 5 of its presale at a current price of $0.03 per token, MUTM represents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking both capital appreciation and passive income. The token serves as a vehicle for earning dividends generated from protocol revenues. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to use a portion of its profits to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This continuous buyback and redistribution cycle strengthens liquidity, incentivizes long-term holding, and applies upward demand pressure on MUTM. By staking mtTokens—tokenized representations of user deposits that accrue interest—participants gain eligibility for these passive income rewards while maintaining liquidity and flexibility. Security remains paramount in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has demonstrated commitment by completing a comprehensive CertiK audit. The manual review and static analysis process resulted in a Token Scan Score of 80.00, with the audit timeline initiated on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025. This rigorous assessment provides users with confidence in the protocol’s smart contracts and operational integrity—an important consideration for any investor or user seeking to engage with a trustworthy DeFi platform. Roadmap promises beta launch and continued growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made significant progress in its roadmap, successfully completing major elements of Phase 1, including the presale, marketing campaigns, and giveaway commencement. The team is actively working on core smart contract development, front-end and back-end infrastructure, and is preparing for the beta launch. By the time the token becomes live on exchanges, users will have access to test the beta version of the platform to explore its lending and borrowing capabilities firsthand. Alongside this, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway further stimulates community engagement and broadens awareness, encouraging more participants to discover the platform’s unique features and earn rewards early. Conclusion: a clear alternative to stalled crypto giants As the crypto market watches Bitcoin (BTC) hesitate near its resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly building the foundation for sustained growth through practical use cases and community rewards. For investors seeking more than price swings—those wanting to earn passive income through a transparent and secure protocol—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a smart choice. With a solid roadmap leading to a beta platform launch, an active presale community, Layer-2 speed and cost advantages, and a comprehensive dividend model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token. It is a functional DeFi ecosystem that rewards users and active participants alike, making it a top contender to watch closely in 2025 and beyond.

2025-06-15T15:23:08,"XRP Price Prediction: Down 2.6% This Week – Is a Reversal Brewing for XRP?","XRP declined by 2.6% this week, even as optimism over a potential settlement between Ripple and the SEC grows. Currently trading near $2.17 with a 24‑hour volume of $1.77 billion, XRP is up 0.35% today. Despite hopes for a resolution that might slash penalties and lift regulatory pressure, broader market weakness and profit-taking have kept traders cautious. Settlement Talks: Promise Meets Pushback A proposed deal would reduce Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million while dissolving the injunction. That spurred early excitement. However, Judge Analisa Torres raised doubts, asking both parties to justify why her earlier ruling should be overturned. NEW: The @SECGov and @Ripple have jointly requested a Manhattan District court to dissolve the injunction in their ongoing case and release the $125 million civil penalty held in escrow. They’re proposing that $50 million be paid to the SEC, with the remaining funds returned… pic.twitter.com/UopQuQNG5q — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 12, 2025 According to attorney John Deaton, she demands “exceptional circumstances” before signing off. While Deaton believes there’s a 70% chance the settlement will gain approval, that uncertainty has kept XRP bulls on edge. Until the judge delivers a clear verdict, legal ambiguity is acting as a dampener, encouraging profit-taking and keeping traders on the sidelines. XRP Supported Amid Market Headwinds and Technical Standstill Despite the legal backdrop, broader crypto indices are weak. Regulatory worries and mixed sentiment have outweighed XRP’s long-term potential. Technically, the token seems to be in a consolidation phase: A descending trendline defies rallies at around $2.28–$2.29 XRP stays under the 50-period EMA near $2.20 Support is forming between $2.10 and $2.14, suggesting underlying buyer interest XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is gradually turning mixed-to-bullish. The MACD histogram is advancing toward neutral, and recent spinning–top candles highlight indecision rather than decisive downward action. Notably, XRP hasn’t produced bearish formations like the “Three Black Crows,” which suggests sellers are not firmly in control. This sets the stage for a potential breakout if buyers gain conviction. XRP Trade Plan Here’s a short-term XRP price prediction : Bullish Trigger: Look for a 4‑hour candle closing above $2.20 and the downward trendline Targets: First at $2.285, then extended to $2.338 Stop-loss: Just below the recent swing low near $2.145 Bearish Option: A drop below $2.145 could open the door to a $2.086 test Final Take XRP’s modest slide this week reflects the tug-of-war between doubt and opportunity. While settlement chatter fuels optimism, technical indicators remain range-bound. The catalyst could come from a decisive move above the 50‑EMA and $2.20, potentially paving the way for a rally to $2.29–$2.34. Conversely, a breakdown below $2.145 would likely lead to a retest of $2.09. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With XRP trading near $2.17, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

2025-06-15T15:02:36,"Stakeholders express concern over Brazil's new tax rule","All crypto investors in Brazil now have to pay tax on their profits after the government removed the tax exemption for small crypto holders. With the move, crypto holders must now pay a flat 17.5% rate on their monthly profits. The resolution is part of Provisional Measure 1303 from the country’s Ministry of Finance as part of the government’s effort to raise revenue. Before its implementation, investors who sold up to 35,000 Brazilian Real ($6,300) digital assets within a month did not have to pay tax. In contrast, those who sold above got taxed progressively, varying between 15% and 22.5%. However, the new flat rate of 17.5% means that everyone will pay the same amount regardless of the value of their transactions. This represents a positive development for largeholders, while smallholders may have to deal with the tax burden. Interestingly, crypto was not the only one affected by the new rule. Fixed-income securities were also affected as the government has imposed a 5% tax on the previously tax-free financial products. The tax on betting revenue also increased from 12% to 18%. Under the rule, taxation assessment will be done quarterly instead of monthly, as is currently the case with investors able to offset losses from the previous five quarters. Concerns from stakeholders about the impact of new tax rules Meanwhile, the new tax regime has attracted concerns from crypto stakeholders, many of whom believe that it could force many investors to opt for exchanges and brokers that do not have headquarters in the country so they can avoid the tax burden. According to Brazil-based crypto news outlet Portal do Bitcoin, crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin questioned the reasoning behind the new rule in a public statement, noting that policymakers failed to engage with industry stakeholders before announcing the rules. It said: “The decisions were made hastily, without dialogue with the sector and without technical basis, even generating doubts about its legality.” The exchange further noted that the rules would make the Brazilian crypto sector less competitive. Thus, it is expected that the country’s legislature, the National Congress, will still review the rules, and the government will engage industry participants. Unsurprisingly, other crypto organizations also seem to agree with this. Advocacy groups such as the Brazilian Association of Cryptoeconomics and The Brazilian Association of Fintechs agree that the decision is a setback for the country’s crypto sector. They noted that the rules would likely make investors opt for offshore and non-compliant platforms or alternative financial products exempt from the tax. Such moves may not just weaken the market but could also expose investors to more risks. Interestingly, the crypto bank Bitybank said that the rule contradicts the consultative efforts of the Brazilian Central Bank. Even more of a concern is the complexity of this new rule for the crypto sector because it would affect most investors. According to Boost Research CEO Andre Franco, many investors would be confused because of the changes as they may not know how to calculate their taxes. Brazil lawmaker file decree to annul the Provisional Measure Unsurprisingly, some pro-crypto legislators have started opposing the bill. One such lawmaker, Deputy Gustavo Gayer, has already filed a legislative decree to annul the new rules, according to local media reports . Gayer claimed the Provisional Measure exceeds the powers of the Executive and contravenes the country’s tax system because there was no approval from the legislature. He also noted that taxes on crypto assets create legal uncertainty at a time when the sector is awaiting government regulation. He said: “The imposition of taxes on crypto assets and the creation of new tax obligations without due legislative discussion, without a broad technical debate and without the participation of the affected parties, compromises the predictability and transparency of the tax system.” Meanwhile, the Chamber of Deputies has reportedly warned that Provisional Measure 1303 will not be approved until a substantial change shows the Executive is more committed to cutting expenses.

2025-06-15T15:00:00,"Litecoin price forms bullish flag as LTC ETF odds jumps","Litecoin has pulled back in the past month, erasing its gains after bottoming in April. Litecoin ( LTC ) was trading at $85.98 on Sunday, down by almost 20% from its highest point in May. This pullback has mirrored that of other altcoins like Cardano ( ADA ) and Chainlink ( LINK ). Litecoin has pulled back despite data showing that the odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a LTC ETF have jumped to 76%. The probability that the agency will approve the ETF is high because it is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Its main difference from Bitcoin is its supply limit of 84 million coins, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. You might also like: Bitcoin price eyes multi-year breakout as ETF inflows hit $1.3 billion Therefore, since the SEC has already approved Bitcoin ETFs, there is a good chance it will do the same for Litecoin. An LTC ETF approval would be good for the coin since it would likely lead to more inflows from American investors. Another potential catalyst for LTC price is that whales have continued accumulating it. Santiment data shows that the accounts holding between 100,000 and 1 million tokens have increased their holdings from 25.8 million on April 15 to 27.8 million today. Further data shows that Litecoin’s social dominance has pointed upwards in the past few days, a sign that it is attracting attention from social media users. It rose to 0.734% from 0.512%. LTC whales and social dominance | Source: Santiment Litecoin price technical analysis LTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the LTC price dropped to $63.30 in April and then bounced back to $106.72 as the crypto market rally happened. Recently, however, it has pulled back and moved below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. Falling below that level is a sign that bears have prevailed. Litecoin price has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern comprises of a vertical line, which in this case starts at $63.29 and ends at $106.72. It is now forming the flag section in the form of a descending channel. Therefore, Litecoin price will likely rebound, and initially target the resistance at $106.7, which is up by 25% from the current level. A climb above that resistance will point to more gains, potentially to $140, the highest swing in January and February this year.

2025-06-15T14:51:00,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Solana ETF Approvals Predicted To Be Closer Than Ever","Exchange-traded fund headlines have always injected fresh electricity into the crypto market. Every new filing hints at deeper capital and a stronger seal of legitimacy than retail enthusiasm alone can provide. The latest catalyst is Solana. On 13 June, the Securities and Exchange Commission quietly asked a cluster of heavyweight issuers to submit refreshed S1 documents for proposed spot Solana funds, a move many analysts interpret as an informal green light to keep the process moving. When the same regulator that only recently waved Bitcoin products through begins reviewing another chain, it shows that digital assets are no longer a single-coin story. Hope for a broader institutional embrace has returned just as prices struggle under geopolitical stress. Solana’s ETF Moment Could Set the Altcoin Market on Fire Within a short window, some of the largest names in asset management delivered updated filings for spot Solana ETFs. Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and even Canary all appeared on the list. These aren’t speculative newcomers. These are firms with decades of institutional reach now attempting to wrap Solana into something Wall Street can trade with a click. More importantly, this round of filings includes a serious feature: staking. That opens up the possibility of Solana ETFs not only tracking price but also generating native yield. UPDATE: Multiple stories broke the news earlier this week that the SEC had reached out to issuers requesting them to submit updated documents for their Solana ETFs & to include staking. As of 5 PM EST we have 6 of the 7 hopeful Solana ETF issuers that have submitted those S-1's pic.twitter.com/WqPI2jf2CW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 It’s a striking change in tone. Until recently, the assumption was that altcoin-based ETFs were still years away. Now it feels like the floodgates could open, and Solana is first in line. The impact of that is not limited to just SOL. Whenever fresh institutional money enters a major chain, the effects bleed into everything that operates in its orbit: meme tokens, infrastructure projects, and DeFi applications. Add to that the growing chatter around companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring stablecoins for real-world utility. These aren’t just theoretical discussions. Blockchain is being scouted for high-volume commercial use, and if that materializes, Solana stands as one of the top contenders to support it. The network is fast, relatively low-cost, and already trending among developers. All of this builds a perfect backdrop. Solana’s possible ETF approval might not just lift one asset. It might ignite the next rotation. And if that happens, the smartest bets may be on what moves next, not just what moves first. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Altcoins Worth Checking Out Solaxy Solaxy is a layer two ledger created to relieve pressure on both Solana and Ethereum. Validators collect thousands of user interactions, compress them into a single proof, and post that proof to whichever base chain the sender prefers. Fees drop to almost nothing and finality settles in roughly one second. Developers keep the familiar Solana programming model, so migrations involve only a change of endpoint instead of a full rewrite. A portion of every network fee moves to a burn address, reducing supply as volume grows. Proposed Solana exchange-traded funds could send unprecedented traffic through the chain, and stress tests show that Solaxy absorbs those bursts without raising costs. Large desks can route trades through Solaxy, rebalance across chains, and settle on their chosen ledger while retaining the trust guarantees of each base network. It's now clear... NOTHING can slow $SOLX down. 🛸🪐49M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/uEFZXiROcQ — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 13, 2025 Having raised close to a whopping $50 million, SOLX, the native token of the project, is likely to go live across multiple exchanges very soon. The same mechanism lets consumer apps confirm in-game asset changes instantly yet still anchor ownership on a public ledger. With a live validator set, auditable throughput, and a supply curve that tightens whenever volume rises, Solaxy offers a direct line to any institutional wave that follows the first Solana fund approval. Snorter Snorter operates inside Telegram, the same chat windows traders already use each day. The bot monitors new liquidity pools on Solana, checks bytecode against a risk engine that screens for honeypots, and fires orders if the token passes. The entire cycle finishes in about a second, so users often enter before price trackers even list the pair. Preferences live locally, and keys never leave the owner’s wallet. Experienced scouts can publish playbooks for followers who mirror trades automatically, paying a portion of realised profit to the strategist. That fee flows to token stakers who keep servers online and fund recurring audits, creating an ecosystem where every role earns something. The project’s theme itself is exciting too, since it features an aardvark which, as the name suggests, sorts and finds out gems and opportunities for investors to make more profits. A creative use of design elements like this is often what intrigues and attracts attention, something that the developers have managed to understand and apply strategically. A Solana ETF wave would draw more builders and traders, and Snorter is prepared for that surge. It already aggregates pool data from Orca and Raydium, with Ethereum and Base support scheduled next month. A recent audit financed by the Solana Foundation cleared critical issues, giving newcomers confidence that orders route safely. For anyone who wants speed and security in the same interface, Snorter turns Telegram into a launchpad instead of a chat room. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper delivers the speed of the Solana Virtual Machine to the world’s oldest blockchain without surrendering Bitcoin’s security principles. The process begins when a user deposits native bitcoin into a monitored address. A relay contract written for Solana’s runtime then checks the incoming block headers and transaction proofs. Once verification passes, an equal amount of wrapped bitcoin appears on the Bitcoin Hyper network, ready for transfers that confirm almost immediately. Activity on this layer two does not remain in isolation. Transactions batch into concise proofs, and every cycle a summary of network state returns to Bitcoin’s first layer, anchoring the ledger in familiar proof-of-work territory. Withdrawals simply reverse the path. A request on the faster rail instructs the canonical bridge to unlock the original coins, so custody never leaves the user’s control. The native token forms the system’s economic engine. Guardians who watch for double spend collect it as payment, liquidity providers earn it for keeping channels full, and stakers receive a share of network fees while also voting on upgrades. Current distribution allocates 30% to ongoing development, 25% to a treasury for expansion, and the remainder across marketing, exchange listings, and community rewards. An audit by Coinsult has already cleared the codebase, easing common concerns around new infrastructure. The project has been recommended as a top token worthy of consideration by leading crypto-based publication websites and creators like Cilinix Crypto , among others. Roughly $1.2 million has entered the current presale stage already and is likely to fill soon before the next price advance. That early traction arrives at a moment when spot Solana funds are inching toward approval. If institutional traders gain regulated access to Solana, they will also seek rapid pathways between bitcoin pairs. Bitcoin Hyper provides that route today, marrying the liquidity of the flagship asset with a settlement speed that aligns with modern markets. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token powers a multi-chain crypto wallet built for users who need both simplicity and serious control. It connects to over sixty networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and even lesser-known EVM chains, with balances, NFTs, and positions all visible in one unified dashboard. The design feels more like a banking super app than a traditional wallet, yet everything remains fully self-custodial. You hold the keys, and the interface never cuts corners on privacy. The utility of the token runs throughout the experience. It governs staking tiers, unlocks early access to high-interest pools, and secures the smart contract modules that power everything from swaps to analytics. One of its most unique features is the Upcoming Tokens tab, which is an in-app portal that curates trending presales and early launches before they go mainstream. This section is already becoming a magnet for both retail and influencers looking for signal over noise. Where this wallet starts to stand apart is its positioning around the incoming ETF wave. If institutional interest widens the crypto funnel, retail users will demand a platform that simplifies everything without limiting what they can do. Best Wallet is designed to be that bridge. Its layered security uses social recovery, local encryption, and smart contract backup options, all working quietly in the background. The project recently earned a spotlight in the New York Post, which profiled it as a rare case of a wallet that balances intuitive design with advanced functionality. That kind of mainstream attention often arrives late in a cycle. This time, it may have landed right on cue. Conclusion Institutional doors do not swing open often, yet every sign now points to a wider entryway for crypto. The request for Solana fund prospectuses hints at a future where regulated products track more than one flagship asset. Each new filing raises the odds that deep capital will pour across the broader market, rewarding networks that prove they can handle real volume under pressure. Investors who position early could benefit from the momentum that usually follows a landmark approval, while those who wait may find themselves paying a premium for the same exposure. Projects mentioned above may be worth checking out, alongside similar altcoins which may hold 10x potential or more in the coming weeks or months.

2025-06-15T14:48:11,"Bitcoin-Backed Loans Unlock Real Estate Market for Crypto-Rich Investors","Bitcoin-Backed Loans Open Door for Property Purchasers Increasingly, Bitcoin holders are leveraging crypto-backed loans to purchase property—without losing a single satoshi or paying capital gains tax. “It’s becoming more mainstream by the day,” declared Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of cryptocurrency lender Ledn. “Early adopters, entrepreneurs, high-net-worth crypto investors who don’t necessarily qualify for traditional lending—this is how they’re gaining access to property.” How It Works: No Sale, No Tax Bitcoin-backed lending allows clients to borrow against their BTC holdings—typically a 50% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio—and be paid back in fiat or stablecoins. Since lending is not considered taxable in most jurisdictions, clients get access to liquidity while still being subject to potential gains in the price of BTC. “Borrowing against your Bitcoin as collateral does not usually trigger capital gains tax because you are not selling your Bitcoin,” Di Bartolomeo said. Quick Funding, Flexible Terms Funding of the loan is fast, with a minimum of just 9.6 hours using Ledn. The loans are used by borrowers either as a deposit or to purchase property outright. There are no monthly repayments; interest accumulates over time and borrowers are free to repay at any time without incurring a penalty—if the LTV is limited below 60%. If Bitcoin increases in value, one can withdraw excess collateral. But if BTC declines and the LTV reaches 80%, the lender auto-liquidates sufficient BTC to repay the loan, keeping the transaction safe while letting the borrower retain the property. No Credit Check, Only Bitcoin Unlike conventional lenders, crypto lenders such as Ledn do not perform credit checks. Having 2:1 collateral provides lenders with assurance, particularly as Bitcoin is traded 24/7 and provides extensive liquidity. “Bitcoin is the world’s cleanest collateral,” Di Bartolomeo stated. During Q1 2025, Ledn disbursed more than $300 million worth of retail loans and is projected to reach more than $1 billion by the end of the year. In 2024 alone, customers allegedly withdrew more than 1,000 BTC as excess collateral due to increasing prices—far exceeding what they paid in interest. They prefer this method in order to acquire hard assets such as property without selling their top-performing investment. “They want to invest in a new property without selling their Bitcoin,” Di Bartolomeo said. Demand Surges Among High-Net-Worth Crypto Owners Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca also testified in May that BTC holders are becoming more and more at ease with taking advantage of crypto as collateral. Xapo began lending against BTC with a maximum $1 million USD loan in March.

In 2025, this method is not just about investment returns; it's also about simplicity and inclusivity, drawing in a broad audience ranging from novices to seasoned investors. Understanding Cloud Mining Cloud mining involves renting computing power from data centers located remotely, thus obviating the need for personal mining hardware.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 670,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin treasury companies will be the source of tremendous selling pressure in the next bear market. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows that private and public companies across the globe hold 1,112,904 BTC worth more than $117.445 billion at time of writing. Says DonAlt, “Bitcoin treasury companies… will be the reason for the next bear market being as violent as prior bear markets, and no one can convince me otherwise. Good Ponzi while they’re going though so keep going.” According to DonAlt, the next Bitcoin bear market could be as devastating as the one witnessed in 2018 when BTC collapsed from $20,000 to $3,000. “Whatever the top ends up being, 70-80% down from that would be my guess.” While DonAlt sees a crippling Bitcoin bear market once BTC tops out this cycle, he remains bullish on the crypto king for now. In a new strategy session, he says that a Bitcoin move below a key support level could trigger an over 11% correction from current levels. “If we set a new low below $101,000, I could easily see us wipe towards $95,000 if not $90,000 pretty quickly.” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,438.

2025-06-15T14:30:19,"Bitcoin Golden Cross Incoming, But Tensions Threaten Breakout","Bitcoin is still trying to regain short-term bullish momentum, as shown by its price action in the past 24 hours. After briefly slipping below $104,500, the cryptocurrency bounced back to trade above $106,000, and technical analysis now shows a technical formation that could cause the start of a more extended rally. Interestingly, as seen in the daily Ichimoku chart shared by analyst Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin is currently on the verge of confirming a golden cross, which is a bullish signal, within the coming days. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details Ichimoku Cloud Builds Case For Bullish Breakout Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted the recent daily price close above the Tenkan line as a strong technical signal for Bitcoin. The Tenkan, also known as the conversion line, is an intriguing indicator for short-term trend strength in Ichimoku analysis. According to the analyst, the current setup on Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the conditions aligning for a golden cross where the shorter-term average overtakes the longer-term one, which is a potential long-term bullish shift. This crossover, if confirmed, would be one of the most reliable trend-reversal patterns in technical trading. Right now, Bitcoin’s price action is consolidating around $105,000. However, if this golden cross does play out well, Bitcoin could attempt another run toward the key resistance level around $111,600. However, current geopolitical instability, especially the rising tensions in the Middle East, could disrupt this technical picture at any moment and cause a reassessment of the bullish outlook. Image From X: Titan of Crypto Support And Whale Activity Clash With Bullish Setup Despite the bullish technical backdrop, other market signals are flashing warnings for Bitcoin. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez identified $104,124 as an important support level for Bitcoin. This price point is not just arbitrary, as it represents a heavy concentration of UTXO realized prices. Many investors bought in at that level, and if Bitcoin falls below it, the next likely destination could be $97,405. The URPD chart confirms that the safety net between $104,000 and $97,000 is somewhat thin. This means that once $104,000 is breached to the downside, a swift and steep correction could follow due to the lack of strong buying interest in that gap. Image From X: Ali_charts Further complicating the picture is the behavior of large Bitcoin holders. On-chain data shows that some of the biggest whales, addresses holding over 1,000 BTC, have started reducing their holdings in recent days. This decline in whale wallet count initially began shortly after Bitcoin reached its new all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. The reduction in whale count resumed again after Bitcoin was rejected at the $110,000 region early last week. Image From X: Ali_charts Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection As such, whale addresses holding over 1,000 BTC have fallen from a recent peak of 2,114 to a recent reading of 2,094 addresses.

2025-06-15T14:28:42,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Investor Snaps Up $127 Million in ETH – Contrarian Play?","Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,540, buoyed by a dramatic $127 million whale purchase of 48,825 ETH at an average price of nearly $2,605. This savvy move, especially during a recent dip triggered by geopolitical unrest and options expiry, reveals long-term confidence from large-scale buyers. Notably, this whale previously netted $30 million in Ethereum profits, suggesting a data-driven strategy. Crypto markets took a hit after escalating tensions in the Middle East rattled risk assets. ETH fell nearly 0.75% in 24 hours, reaching $2,524, as over 242,000 ETH in Deribit options expired, contributing to increased volatility. The put-call ratio stood at 1.20, with maximum pain around $2,700, indicating a bearish position bias. However, the whale purchase serves as a counterweight, supporting sentiment and offering a confidence boost amid uncertainty. Ethereum Technical Setup: Tight Range Between EMAs Ethereum’s price prediction remains neutral as the cryptocurrency consolidates in a critical price range between its 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level ($2,518) and the descending 50-period exponential moving average (EMA) ($2,580) on the 2-hour chart. The appearance of a Doji candle near the Fibonacci line highlights short-term indecision. While ETH broke through a rising wedge, prompting a sell-off, momentum indicators are quietly shifting. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD lines are converging toward a bullish crossover RSI is low, near 29, hinting at oversold conditions No multiple-candle bearish patterns like “Three Black Crows” Although ETH traded below its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs, there is growing potential for a bounce if it can reclaim the $2,550–$2,580 range. Failure to do so could drag prices toward $2,440 and possibly $2,300, but renewed buying momentum might unlock higher targets. Ethereum Trade Plan: Balance Risk and Reward For those new to trading, here’s a simple and straightforward trade setup based on current chart activity and whale behavior: Bullish Scenario (Buy-the-Dip): Entry : Close above 38.2% Fib at ~$2,568 and 50-EMA Stop-loss : Just below today’s low (~$2,500) Targets : $2,607 (50% Fib), then $2,647 (61.8% Fib) Bearish Scenario (Breakdown Play): Entry : Close below trendline and $2,518 Stop-loss : Above $2,540 Target : $2,440, with downside risk toward $2,300 This balanced plan positions you for upside precision and downside protection. Final Take: Ethereum sits at a pivotal point, technical indicators suggest a pause after recent losses, but whale buying hints at sustained interest. A breakout above approximately $2,580 could pave the way for prices to reach $2,650–$2,700. Conversely, failure to hold current support might lead to pressure dropping to $2,440. Watch those zones closely and manage risk accordingly. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Ethereum trading near $2,547, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.
