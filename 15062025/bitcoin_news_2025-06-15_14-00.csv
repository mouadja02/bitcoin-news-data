2025-06-15T11:50:56,"Crypto Weekly Roundup: Israel-Iran Conflict Rocks BTC, Trump Media BTC Treasury On The Way, & More","This week, Bitcoin tumbled amid Israel-Iran tensions while markets braced for Trump Media’s Bitcoin treasury move. Major announcements included Cardano’s Cardinal protocol for Bitcoin DeFi, XRP Ledger’s upcoming EVM sidechain, and Coinbase’s Bitcoin rewards card. Meanwhile, regulators delayed ETF decisions and the Senate advanced stablecoin legislation. Bitcoin Amid major strikes by Israel across Iran, the Bitcoin price fell almost $6,000 through Thursday and into Friday. A comprehensive bounce is now underway, with experts wondering if the recovery will continue. DeFi Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, has officially introduced Cardinal , a new protocol designed to bring Bitcoin into decentralized finance (DeFi) through a trustless, cross-chain solution. Technology XRP Ledger is set to launch an Ethereum-compatible EVM sidechain in Q2 2025, aiming to integrate Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications into its ecosystem while onboarding new contributors and enhancing DeFi functionalities. Business Coinbase has partnered with American Express to launch the Coinbase One Card , offering up to 4% Bitcoin rewards on purchases and expanded crypto benefits as part of its growing payment ecosystem GameStop has announced a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, signaling a deepening commitment to its Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy. US authorities have charged crypto entrepreneur Iurii Gugnin with operating a $500 million money laundering scheme through his crypto companies, helping sanctioned Russian banks and entities bypass international financial restrictions. Web3 Web3 at present only bestows its rewards on the bravest adventurers who dare to expose themselves to all of its fanfare and bluster. With a good UI and user experience, Web3 can transform its highly functional dApps into an experience that’s not only fun, but also extremely worthwhile for its users. These five crypto exchanges have successfully weathered the storm and managed to retain the trust of their customers over the course of the past decade. Pudgy Penguins has partnered with *My Neighbor Alice*, granting holders of Pudgys and their spin-offs land access in MNA’s new interoperable archipelago. For over two decades, cloud giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have dominated global digital infrastructure, but their market concentration raises concerns over outages, censorship, and data privacy risks. The crypto market is maturing beyond meme hype and speculation, and the industry has firmly left the ICO mania of 2017–18 behind. Community alignment, sustainable tokenomics, and real utility, which tokens like Mosaic Galaxy's Kodexa embody, are becoming the benchmarks. The recently launched crypto exchange KuCoin EU Exchange GmbH, based in Vienna, Austria, has announced two new C-Suite level executives to its stacked team of professionals - Christian Derler and Tamara Rubey, who will share their experience in banking, finance, and legal matters to bolster the expansion of the crypto exchange across Europe. Security A false announcement claiming Paraguay had adopted Bitcoin as legal tender was posted from President Santiago Peña’s hacked X account, prompting swift clarification from the government and raising concerns over digital platform vulnerabilities. Regulation The Trump Media and Technology Group has announced that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has declared effective the company’s registration for its Bitcoin treasury deal . The SEC has postponed decisions on ETF proposals for Polkadot, Hedera, Avalanche, and Dogecoin, citing the need for further evaluation and public feedback. The U.S. Senate advanced the GENIUS Act , a bipartisan bill to regulate stablecoins, toward a final vote next week, with Trump’s backing and divided Democratic support.

But Nguyen says answering that phone call led him to lose $500,000 – the entirety of his life’s work. “I lost maybe $500,000… I may be homeless now.” The con artists who masterminded the scam convinced Nguyen that his identity was being used to commit various crimes overseas, like money laundering, and in order to clear his name, the soon-to-be-retired man supposedly had to wire over his money to another bank. The criminals, who are yet to be identified, used an encrypted messaging app called Viber to send wire transfer details, along with fake government documents to make it seem more legitimate. After losing everything, Nguyen’s daughter, Kathy, is now supporting him, and says she is in the process of selling her house to make ends meet. Says Kathy, “Watch out for your family. Your mom, dad, grandma, grandpas. Just let them know that something like this could happen, and just be careful.” The Nguyens have filed a report with the FBI, but at time of writing, the scammers are at large.

As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.16, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, it has slipped by 2.3%, continuing a mild downtrend. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, overall sentiment around XRP remains bearish . However, there is some sense of optimism from a technical standpoint. The token’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) is at $2.30, offering short-term support, while the 200-day SMA, at $1.88, signals potential for longer-term bullish momentum. Meanwhile, XRP’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 44.38, still in neutral territory, pointing to a balanced market with room to move either way. ChatGPT predicts XRP price Looking ahead, OpenAI’s ChatGPT projected that XRP will likely trade between $2.08 and $2.32 by July 1, with $2.22 identified as the most probable mid-range target. This prediction is based on technical indicators, momentum analysis, and overall market conditions. The model noted that XRP’s recent breach of the psychological $2 level has established a key support zone, which could act as a base for future gains. On the other hand, resistance appears between $2.30 and $2.35, with support holding near the $2.05 to $2.10 range. XRP AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT A limiting factor, however, is the current absence of major catalysts. Without headline developments, such as an ETF approval or a major partnership announcement from Ripple, any sharp price movements appear unlikely in the short term. ChatGPT pointed out that broader market dynamics could still play a role. For example, a stable or rising Bitcoin ( BTC ) price could offer enough tailwind to push XRP toward the upper end of its projected range. Grok predicts XRP price Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok model took a more bullish stance, forecasting a trading range between $2.25 and $2.40 by July 1. It cited an ascending channel pattern and potential positive momentum from Ripple’s ecosystem as key drivers. Still, Grok also flagged resistance around $2.50 as a likely cap on near-term gains. Both AI models seem to agree that a major XRP breakout is unlikely over the next couple of weeks. A gradual climb toward the low-to-mid $2.30s appears within reach, provided market conditions remain steady.

2025-06-15T10:00:23,"Bitcoin Investors Remain Calm Despite Israel-Iran Conflict Escalation","The price of Bitcoin has managed to stay afloat over the past few days despite the growing conflict in the Middle East and the ensuing bearish pressure. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $105,000 level, with its value down by merely 0.8% in the past week. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price might not be down for too long, as investors seem unbothered by the rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Below is what the BTC investors have been up to since the military action started in the past week. BTC Investors Still Holding On To Their Assets: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, CryptoMe revealed that the Bitcoin market has remained relatively quiet despite the ongoing geopolitical events. The relevant indicators here are the Bitcoin exchange netflow and Open Interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke To start, CryptoMe analyzed the BTC Exchange Netflow, which measures the difference between Bitcoin sent to and withdrawn from centralized exchanges. Typically, this metric helps to gauge the selling pressure on a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Given that one of the services offered by exchanges is selling, exchange inflows are often considered a bearish signal for the Bitcoin price. However, CryptoMe noted that there has been no significant change in Netflow, meaning that investors are not looking to offload their assets. The on-chain analyst also highlighted the Open Interest on centralized exchanges, which estimates the amount of capital flowing into a cryptocurrency at every given time. CryptoMe attributed the reduced Open Interest to the liquidated long positions following the price correction. The crypto pundit added: But when we look at the bigger picture, Open Interest still looks strong, and investors are still keeping their positions open FOR NOW despite all the WAR news. Furthermore, CryptoMe mentioned the Bitcoin Open Interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutions and speculators trade. The analyst noted that while some positions were closed and the Open Interest dropped after the event, there has still not been any significant exit movement on the CME. Ultimately, the absence of major movements into centralized exchanges suggests that the investors are not in panic mode yet. While most positions on Bitcoin derivatives are still open at the moment, there is no telling what will happen if the war tension escalates further. Hence, investors might want to approach the market with caution over the next few days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,760, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-15T10:00:00,"What is XRP? Investors Ask as Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the Ultimate Bitcoin Replacement","XRP once held the promise of revolutionizing global payments. Fast, cheap, and bank-friendly—it was pitched as the future of cross-border finance. But years of regulatory battles, stagnant token utility, and centralized control have left many investors wondering: Is this still the future, or just another chapter in crypto history? As attention shifts, a bold new name is rising with far more than promises. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just aiming to improve the blockchain—it’s redefining what decentralized money can do. With blazing speed, mobile-first mining, and a full ecosystem that empowers users instead of institutions, BTC-S is positioning itself not just as a Bitcoin alternative, but the upgrade Bitcoin never had. XRP Had Potential—But the Space Moved On XRP deserves credit for challenging the banking sector and pioneering real-time settlement. But with Ripple entangled in legal skirmishes and token utility tied closely to corporate control, cracks have shown. Decentralization remains a concern. And for users seeking freedom, speed, and income, not just transaction rails, XRP now feels like a limited play. Investors are beginning to shift their gaze to a project that’s not just faster or cheaper, but fundamentally more empowering. Bitcoin Solaris: Designed to Replace, Not Just Compete BTC-S was built from the ground up to combine what Bitcoin started with what modern tech makes possible. It features a hybrid consensus model—Proof-of-Work (PoW) for core chain security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability. Together, they deliver unmatched performance. Key highlights include: Base Layer PoW using SHA-256 (Bitcoin-compatible) with 5-minute block times Solaris Layer DPoS with 21 rotating validators every 24 hours and 15-second blocks Cross-layer integration where validator data is secured on-chain through PoW anchoring Smart contracts in Rust, enabling DeFi, tokenization, and secure automation Optional privacy via Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) It gets even better with throughput: the Solaris Layer pushes up to 100,000 transactions per second, finalizing in just 2 seconds, while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. This isn’t theoretical—it’s audited and tested. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have verified the code, and early influencers like Ben Crypto are already spotlighting BTC-S as one of the most promising chains of the year. Mobile Mining with Real Rewards Unlike XRP, which can’t be earned directly through network participation, BTC-S opens the doors to daily income through mining—without expensive hardware. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine using: Smartphones (Android and iOS) Laptops and desktops ASICs and GPUs (for power users) With adaptive mining algorithms, in-app wallets, and energy-optimized performance, it’s truly accessible. Just tap, and you’re earning. Want to estimate your earning potential? The BTC-S mining calculator helps you visualize your daily impact. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Liquid Staking That Doesn’t Lock You In Beyond mining, Bitcoin Solaris also introduces a breakthrough in staking. With liquid staking , users can earn rewards without locking away their tokens. How it works: Staked BTC-S becomes sBTC-S (1:1 ratio) sBTC-S remains fully liquid, tradable, and DeFi-compatible You earn rewards while retaining full control It enhances decentralization, validator rotation, and network health It’s integrated right into the Solaris Nova App, with no complex setup required, making staking easy, flexible, and profitable for everyone. A Roadmap That’s Actually Being Followed Many coins brag about roadmaps. BTC-S is executing one. Its forward-looking roadmap spans: Mainnet Launch (Q3 2026) with full support for smart contracts and governance Mining Power Marketplace and cross-chain tools by Q4 2026 Quantum-resistant upgrades and layer-2 scaling in 2027 Enterprise-grade integrations with AI and IoT in late 2027 It’s a roadmap backed by action, not just whitepaper buzzwords. Every phase is designed to increase adoption, unlock real-world use, and build sustainable value. The Presale Is Moving Fast—and It’s Not Just Hype We’re currently in Phase 7 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale, with over 11,000 users already onboard and more than $4.5M raised. Current price: $7 Next phase: $8 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 9% With only around 7 weeks left before the July 31, 2025 launch, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most dynamic presales in crypto history. The growth is organic, driven by real use, not marketing gimmicks. If you’re watching from the sidelines, Bitcoin Solaris is your window into the future. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin? Or Something Better? XRP may have started as a disruptor. But Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as a revolution. With mobile mining, powerful staking, lightning-fast scalability, and a clear roadmap, BTC-S isn’t just an upgrade to Bitcoin—it’s what Bitcoin would be if it were built today.

According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, anonymous people familiar with the matter say that some of the world’s largest retailers are considering issuing their very own dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US in an effort to save billions of dollars in transaction fees. Such a move would mark a major shift away from the traditional finance system, which includes the nation’s largest banks and credit providers. Other firms that are reportedly exploring the potential use of stablecoins include Expedia Group and unnamed airline companies. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to other assets – such as the dollar, precious metals, or other crypto assets – and are typically backed on a one-to-one basis. Stablecoins have been gaining traction recently due to their low transaction fees and faster payment processing times. The firms’ decisions may ultimately depend on the fate of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill still making its way through Congress and yet to pass either chamber. The GENIUS Act, introduced earlier this year, aims to establish a regulatory framework for alternative payment systems, opening the door for new players to compete with giants like Visa and MasterCard. The sources say that Amazon’s stablecoin exploration has mostly revolved around creating one for online purchases, while Walmart has lobbied to change the GENIUS Act to introduce more competition in the credit-card sector. The firms are also considering how to use existing stablecoins if they decide not to create their own.

Saylor stated that the United States should not miss this change, saying, “It is in the interest of the United States to have as much Bitcoin as possible before other countries realize this transformation.” According to Saylor, the BTC network will form the basis of future capital flows as a decentralized financial infrastructure, so it is strategically important for countries, especially the US, to invest in Bitcoin early.

2025-06-15T09:09:34,"BTC Rejected at $106K as Middle East Attacks Intensify and Trump Threatens Iran: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin’s price rose to over $106,000 hours ago, but the latest developments in the Middle East conflict, as well as Trump’s threats against Iran, pushed it south by over a grand. Most larger-cap alts are slightly in the red, including HYPE, which has dumped by 5%, while PI is up by a similar percentage. BTC Stopped at $106K The primary cryptocurrency was riding high at the beginning of the previous business week as it pumped above $110,000 on several occasions by Wednesday. However, each attempt was met with an immediate rejection, and the last one pushed BTC south to under $106,000. Although the bulls managed to recover some ground on Thursday and pushed bitcoin to $108,400, the quickly escalating tension in the Middle East resulted in an immediate price drop that drove the asset south to under $103,000. Although the attacks continued in the following 48 hours, including a few retaliations by Iran, BTC’s price recovered some ground and even jumped above $106,000 hours ago. However, US President Trump weighed in on the matter once again at that point and threatened Iran with “the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces” if Tehran decides to retaliate against the US in some form.

2025-06-15T08:57:22,"Whales Buy $495K Solaxy in Two Days: The Best Crypto Presale Ends in One Day","Solaxy ($SOLX) is turning heads – and wallets. In just the past 48 hours, crypto whales have scooped up nearly $500K worth of $SOLX tokens across more than ten big-ticket transactions. One whale dropped $113K just today, while others followed closely behind with $59K and $58K purchases yesterday. The project has already raised over $50M during its presale, and now it’s racing toward the finish line.With just one day left before the presale ends, investors are making their move. And fast. Why Are Whales Suddenly Flocking to Solaxy? The answer seems to lie in a mix of urgency and belief. The Solaxy ($SOLX) crypto presale officially ends Monday, giving buyers less than 24 hours to lock in $SOLX at $0.00176. That’s a steep discount compared to where it could be headed if this whale interest keeps snowballing. And this isn’t just a meme coin feeding frenzy (though we love a good meme coin moment). These are calculated, high-volume buys from wallets that don’t usually blink unless they see major potential. In a market where new crypto projects pop up like mushrooms after rain, Solaxy appears to be one of the rare ones getting real traction. So, What Is Solaxy? Solaxy ($SOLX) is the first-ever Layer 2 built on Solana, designed to fix the problems that have plagued the network – like congestion, failed transactions, and limited scalability – while turning up the dial on what Solana does best: speed and low fees. Its native token, $SOLX, is multichain and will be available on both Ethereum and Solana – the two most dominant and liquid blockchains in existence. That means $SOLX connects the dots between Ethereum’s enormous DeFi and tokenization markets and Solana’s efficiency. You get the best of both worlds: vast liquidity on one side and blazing speed with low fees on the other. This dual-chain power opens the door for an expanded user base and makes $SOLX a serious contender for long-term adoption. Solaxy is also a game-changer for meme coin traders. It democratizes access to sniper bots, giving retail users the tools that were once reserved for whales and insiders. That means faster entries, better exits, and more wins in a space where milliseconds matter. With top Layer 2 tokens already boasting billion-dollar market caps, Solaxy is stepping in not just to compete, but to take the lead as the first and most powerful Layer 2 on Solana. It’s more than a blockchain. It’s a bridge to the future of DeFi. Time’s Almost Up: Just One Day Left to Buy The clock is ticking. The Solaxy presale ends Monday, and there’s no second chance to buy at the current price of $0.00176. So far, the project has raised over $50M, and in the past two days alone, whales have poured in nearly $500K across multiple six-figure buys. That kind of action signals confidence, not hype. Now here’s where it gets exciting. According to current forecasts, $SOLX could reach $0.032 by the end of 2025. That’s a potential gain of 1,718% from today’s price. But the real kicker comes when you factor in staking. With an annual percentage yield of 82%, investors who stake their tokens stand to grow their holdings significantly before $SOLX even hits those predicted highs. Imagine you buy $SOLX for $1K today. At the current rate, they’d get about 568K tokens. Staking those tokens at 82% APY means they’d have over a million tokens in a year. If the price reaches the predicted $0.032 by the end of 2025, that investment could be worth more than $33K. Even if $SOLX only hits the low-end prediction of $0.0024, that’s still over $2,4K – more than double the original investment. That’s the beauty of staking combined with smart timing. And timing is everything, because there’s just one day left before this presale closes for good. The whales have already made their move. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, now’s the time to jump in. Your Last Chance to Catch the Wave The clock is ticking on Solaxy , and the whales aren’t waiting. If you’re hunting for the best altcoin opportunity before summer really heats up, $SOLX might be your last-minute ticket.

2025-06-15T08:22:44,"Trump’s Crypto Bet Pays Off: Over $600M Reported in 2024 Earnings","US President Donald Trump disclosed over $600 million in earnings from a mix of cryptocurrency ventures, real estate assets, and branded merchandise in a newly released financial disclosure for 2024. Key Takeaways: Trump disclosed over $600 million in 2024 earnings, much of it from crypto ventures. His total asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, with significant income from NFTs, token sales, and real estate. The revelation raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest during his presidency. The filing , made public Friday, outlines the president’s sprawling business portfolio, including significant gains from digital assets and meme coin projects. While the exact timeframe isn’t specified, the report appears to cover income through the end of December 2024. Trump Assets Top $1.6 Billion, Earnings Surge Trump’s estimated asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, according to a Reuters analysis . Notably, a large portion of his 2024 windfall came from crypto-related endeavors, including over $320 million in estimated fees from the meme coin $TRUMP, and more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm. The disclosure also shows Trump received $57.35 million from token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture. The report sheds light on the growing entanglement between Trump’s business interests and the U.S. crypto industry. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As per Donald Trump financial disclosure, he made $57M from #Crypto in 2024, Nearly $600M in Total Income. It's mainly from World Liberty Financial, a #DeFi project where he holds $15.7B governance tokens. pic.twitter.com/PdEgyYHW32 — Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) June 14, 2025 Trump Media & Technology Group, parent company of Truth Social, also remains a core asset. While exact valuations are unclear, revenue from branded merchandise and licensing deals continue to flow in. Among them, $2.8 million from Trump Watches, $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances, and over $1 million from his NFT trading cards. In the physical world, Trump’s Florida golf resorts brought in $217.7 million, led by the Trump National Doral, which earned over $110 million. Additional income came from real estate projects in India, Dubai, and Vietnam, with licensing and development fees totaling over $30 million. The filing also included $12 million in passive income through investments in Blue Owl Capital and U.S. bond funds. Despite previously claiming to have distanced himself from day-to-day management, the disclosure confirms Trump remains deeply tied to the financial performance of his vast network of businesses, including crypto. SEC Approves Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-Linked Registration As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes. While the approval gives TMTG flexibility to raise capital, the firm says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base.

2025-06-15T07:26:09,"Investment Management Company Founder Speaks About the Future of Bitcoin (BTC) – What to Expect?","Speaking at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in New York, Coatue Management founder Philippe Laffont said Bitcoin’s increasingly consistent volatility and institutional interest are making it a more central asset in investment portfolios. According to Laffont, despite Bitcoin’s 13% increase so far in 2025, its volatility has decreased significantly compared to previous years. BTC’s sharp price swings have caused Coatue to avoid investing in the past. But that’s changing now. “The cost of entry into Bitcoin may be decreasing. If beta is decreasing, that would be really interesting,” Laffont said, noting that Bitcoin’s beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, has decreased over time. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs by giants like BlackRock is a clear indication that BTC is maturing, according to Laffont. He also recalled that Bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value in 2022, but this decline was more striking compared to the fluctuations experienced, for example, after Trump's tariff announcement in April 2025. “Bitcoin is down only 5%, while Nasdaq is down more than 6% between April 2nd and April 10th. This shows that Bitcoin is now becoming a more resilient asset to risk events in the market,” he said. Additionally, the rate at which coins held in Bitcoin wallets for at least a month are being sold out has dropped significantly, suggesting that investors are moving away from short-term speculation and starting to view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Pointing out that Bitcoin’s share in total global wealth is still very low (0.4%) at around $2 trillion, Laffont said that this rate will inevitably increase over time: “If people continue to believe that Bitcoin is valuable, then that asset will become more valuable over time, which means it should become more central in portfolios.” Despite this, Laffont warned investors that Bitcoin’s weight in the portfolio should not be exaggerated: “Even if you think Bitcoin is going to be important, don’t put a large portion of your portfolio into it. A small but long-term position can make you less stressed and more profitable.” Related News: List of Today's Top 15 Trending Altcoins Published Laffont, who admitted that Coatue had previously missed the Bitcoin opportunity, attributes this mostly to their inability to think simply. According to Laffont, in the investment world, it is usually more profitable to focus on assets that people believe are valuable, rather than complex models: “For something to be valuable, everyone has to believe it is valuable. It was that simple, and we missed it.” Technology-focused hedge fund Coatue has invested in cryptocurrency and technology companies such as Dune Analytics, Bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave. CoreWeave also has a partnership with Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Dividing his investors into three, Laffont said that there are those who leave crypto completely to themselves, those who question why Bitcoin was entered late, and cautious investors who want to stay away from crypto. However, he stated that this cautious audience is decreasing a little more every year: “This group of abstainers is disappearing. They are becoming smaller and smaller every year.” *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Gundlach says recent behavior in the stock market, the dollar and the Treasury market appears “strange” to him, hinting at deeper concerns that are unsettling investors in US assets. According to Gundlach, investors are beginning to sniff out the looming risks tied to the US government’s unsustainable fiscal trajectory. “In the last 15 years, there has been a number of corrections on the S&P 500, and in every single one of them, when the S&P goes down by more than 10%, the trade-weighted dollar index goes up. This time, the dollar went down when the S&P 500 went down by almost 20%. That’s strange, things are behaving differently. Usually when the Fed starts cutting interest rates, rates across the yield curve go down. The 10-year Treasury almost always goes up [in price] immediately following the first Fed rate cut, and then it keeps rallying for a while. This time, the 10-year yield went up, and the yield curve is steepening. So I think what we have is recognition that the interest expense for the United States is untenable – if we continue running a $2.1 trillion budget deficit and we continue to have sticky interest rates.” The Bond King zeroes in on foreign investors, noting that they hold tens of trillions of dollars in US assets. Gundlach says it is now within the realm of possibility for the investor cohort to start exiting US markets. “There’s a net investment position; foreigners were investing more in the US than the US was investing outside the country to the tune of $3 trillion. That was about 15 or 17 years ago. It’s now over $25 trillion is the net investment position, and the dollar is falling. It’s not inconceivable that some of that $25 trillion that came in not even two decades could go out.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-15T06:19:34,"Owning One Bitcoin Is the New American Dream, Says Bitwise Portfolio Manager","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC is holding firm above $105,000 after recovering from a sharp downturn triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel’s strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin’s trend remains intact. Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin’s appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals. According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they’re focused on becoming ""wholecoiners"" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of ""retiring your bloodline."" Park added that bitcoin’s global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to ""opt out"" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty. As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded between $104,480.15 and $105,696.12, closing near $105,590, up 0.15%, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Support was reinforced in the $104,400–$104,500 zone, with high-volume accumulation during the 16:00–20:00 GMT window. A bullish reversal followed at 21:00, driving BTC above $105,000 on strong volumeIntraday breakout occurred at 02:01, with price jumping from $105,486 to $105,550 on elevated activity. Consolidation above $105,470 suggests further upside potential toward $106,000, pending sustained demand.

2025-06-15T05:24:24,"Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next? Experts Split","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again testing the nerves of traders worldwide, hovering just above $105,000 today as forecasts split the crypto community in half. Will the king cryptocurrency explode to $175,000 this cycle, or nosedive to under $80,000 if fear grips the market? The $175K Dream On the bullish side, pseudonymous chart-watcher Egrag Crypto supercharged hopium this week, predicting a huge breakout in the next few months. According to the analyst, BTC’s historical cycle data suggests the asset is primed for a 102% surge, which would catapult it to $175,000 from its current levels. “The average of three major pumps this cycle is 102%, hitting $175K!” they tweeted, pointing to eerily similar patterns in previous bull markets. The way Bitcoin shrugged off the effects of recent geopolitical upheavals has only bolstered Egrag’s bullish case. After Israel struck multiple Iranian nuclear and military assets, the cryptocurrency cratered, going from a daily high near $108,500 to just under $103,000, before clawing its way back to around $105,000 today. Other optimists, like DeFiTracer, also highlighted similar war-driven dips in April and October 2024, when each was followed by 48% and 74% explosions upward. “Don’t let whales and news manipulate you,” he wrote on X, suggesting June’s 4% dip is merely fuel for the next bump upward. The Bear Trap However, not everyone is buying the hype just yet. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez has tempered the euphoria, warning that the market could be on the brink of a sharp correction if key levels don’t hold. He backed his pessimism, pointing to whales offloading nearly 30,000 BTC in the past week as well as a weakening support floor around the hundred grand level. If this floor gives way, Martinez predicts a drop to as low as $78,500. His sentiment was echoed by crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who noted that BTC just failed to hold above $106,000, triggering a liquidity cascade southwards. “Two options,” he warned: A sub-$100,000 buying opportunity or a fresh rally if prices hold at around $102,500. Market observer Axel Adler Jr. also weighed in , drawing attention to BTC’s OBV (On-Balance Volume), which is still stuck in the red near $100,000. According to him, it means that any bullish momentum could be paper-thin. The post Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next?

2025-06-15T04:45:10,"Crypto price predictions: Pi Network, Monero, and Fartcoin","The crypto market was mixed on Sunday as investors focused on the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the ongoing crisis in the Middle East. Bitcoin was stuck above $105,000, while the market capitalization of all tokens dropped to $3.28 trillion. This article explores the top crypto forecasts of coins like Pi Network (PI), Monero (XMR), and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Pi Network price prediction Pi coin price chart | Source: TradingView Pi coin has come under pressure in the past few weeks as it plunged to $0.3945 on Friday, down from last month’s high of $1.6567. The token has stabilized a bit and moved to over $0.60 today, a 50% surge. Technicals point to more Pi Network gains as it has formed a triple-bottom pattern at around $0.60. A triple-bottom is made up of three distinct bottoms and a neckline, which, in this case, is at $1.6567. The token is attempting to move above the 50-period and 100-period Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Oscillators like the MACD and the Commodity Channel Index (CCI) have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Pi Network token price will likely keep rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $1, which is about 61% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.3945 will invalidate the bullish Pi Network forecast. Monero price forecast XMR price chart | Source: TradingView Monero, the biggest privacy-focused coin, has crashed in the past two weeks, erasing some of the gains made earlier this year. The initial gains happened as demand for privacy tokens soared. XMR token retreated from a high of $420 to $315 today as investors booked profits. Monero has moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It also remains slightly above the 50-day and 100-day EMA. Most importantly, it has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $301.05. A double-bottom pattern often leads to a strong bullish breakout. Therefore, Monero token will likely bounce back as long as it remains above the double-bottom pattern at $301. Such a move will see it rise and retest the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level at $353, which is about 12% above the current level. A drop below the support at $301 will invalidate the bullish Monero price forecast. Fartcoin price forecast Fartcoin chart | Source: TradingView Fartcoin, a top meme coin on the Solana network , has been one of the most actively traded tokens this year. Its recent surge saw it peak at $1.6520 in May. It then pulled back and reached a low of $0.8715, its lowest point on June 5, and then bounced back to the current $1.20. Fartcoin token remains above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level and the 50-day and 100-day EMAs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has retreated and moved to the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the Fartcoin price will likely resume the uptrend, and potentially retest the psychological point at $1.50. A drop below the support at $0.8715 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

2025-06-15T04:00:28,"Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support – Eyes On $97K If It Breaks","Bitcoin is trading just above the critical $104K level after enduring multiple days of selling pressure triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The recent attacks between Israel and Iran have injected fresh volatility across financial markets, but BTC has shown notable resilience. Currently down about 5% from its all-time high of $112K, Bitcoin continues to trade within a broader consolidation range as macroeconomic uncertainty persists. Related Reading: Whales Dump Over 270 Million Cardano In One Week – Bearish Signal Or Shakeout? Despite the geopolitical instability and rising bond yields, Bitcoin’s structure remains bullish, with bulls defending key support zones. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the $104,124 level is a crucial threshold to watch. He highlights that this level aligns with a strong cluster of Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) based on the Realized Price Distribution metric. This suggests a heavy concentration of buyers who acquired BTC at or near this range, potentially reinforcing it as a solid support base. Holding above this level could mark a turning point, paving the way for another push toward price discovery. However, a breakdown below this zone could trigger a deeper correction toward lower demand levels. For now, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s reaction to this key level as global risks continue to evolve. Bitcoin Holds The Line Above $100K Amid Geopolitical Risks Bitcoin is showing notable resilience amid global turmoil, holding above the $100K mark despite rising uncertainty linked to escalating Middle East tensions. As the market heads into Monday, investors are bracing for potentially volatile sessions, depending on further developments between Israel and Iran. A sharp rise in oil prices could add additional macro pressure, making the start of the week a decisive moment for risk assets. BTC continues to trade within a consolidation range after falling 5% from its all-time high of $112K. Analysts widely agree that Bitcoin is in a transitional phase—either preparing for an explosive breakout into price discovery or setting the stage for a deeper retracement. Many believe that a confirmed breakout above $112K could trigger the next major leg higher, marking the beginning of a new expansion cycle for the entire crypto market. However, caution remains critical at current levels. Martinez pointed to key on-chain data from the UTXO Realized Price Distribution, identifying $104,124 as a pivotal support zone. This price level is where a large volume of BTC last moved, suggesting strong buyer interest. If BTC holds this level, it could form a solid base for continuation. But if it breaks down, the next area of interest lies around $97,405—potentially sparking broader fear across the market. In the coming days, Bitcoin’s response to geopolitical news and macroeconomic signals, particularly oil price movements and bond yield reactions, will be crucial. For now, the bulls remain in control, but the path forward demands close attention and calculated positioning. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds $2,500 Support – History Signals $4,000 As Potential Target BTC Price Analysis: Bulls Defend Key Support Bitcoin is currently trading at $105,502, showing signs of strength after defending the crucial $103,600 support level. This price zone has acted as a consistent floor over the past week and continues to be a key pivot for short-term market structure. After a steep drop from the $112K high, BTC bounced off this support with a strong wick on high volume, signaling buyer interest and a potential short-term bottom. The chart shows that Bitcoin is consolidating between $103,600 and $109,300, with the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs converging just above the current price, indicating a decision point is near. A clear break above $106,800 could trigger momentum to test $109,300 again, while a failure to hold above $104,500 would expose BTC to downside risk.

Volume remains relatively muted compared to the spike during the June 13 drop, suggesting that most of the panic selling has cooled for now.

2025-06-15T03:07:38,"Cardano Founder teases full XRP integration package","Charles Hoskinson, the Cardano founder, released new information about the possible integration of XRP and its related features on the Cardano blockchain. Hoskinson replied with a wide-scope plan that is not limited to RLUSD. His comments followed a user’s inquiry about whether the Ripple-backed stablecoin RealUSD (RLUSD) would be available on Cardano. He mentioned that a full “ XRP package ” is on the way, with plans for XRP DeFi integration, support for Lace wallet, “glacier drops,’ and ongoing talks about RealUSD. He did not make a fine point about timing, but his reply confirmed that high-level discussions were taking place. Cardano gears up for XRP integration with RLUSD As soon as RLUSD was mentioned, the cryptocurrency community went into overdrive, with many hoping for information on when they could access the stablecoin on the Cardano blockchain . However, Hoskinson’s reply suggests that RLUSD is part of the bigger plan, which involves all the other Ripple-related assets. One term that emerged with greater prominence was “glacier drops.” While not commonly used in the space, the term refers to a controlled and staggered release of tokens or features — analogous to a focused airdrop effort pegged to product milestones. Lace wallet support is also on the agenda. As Cardano’s official wallet was built emphasizing user experience, Lace’s integration with XRP would streamline access for users looking to manage Ripple-based assets within the Cardano ecosystem. Equally significant is the mention of DeFi. Historically, XRP has had a limited role in decentralized finance. Its integration into Cardano’s smart contract infrastructure could unlock new use cases — such as lending, borrowing, and liquidity provision — potentially attracting more users and developers to the platform. While no final decisions have been made public, Hoskinson’s remarks shed more light on Cardano’s dedication to interoperability, interest in stablecoin adoption, and interest in growing their presence in the DeFi space. Through the integration of RLUSD, XRP DeFi utilities, advanced wallet features, and token drops, Cardano is gearing up to vie for its share of the competitive blockchain ecosystem. If it works, this could be important for Cardano in expanding its ecosystem and offering itself a bit more than it is to an even larger crypto market. Hoskinson proposes strategic investments to grow Cardano’s treasury Hoskinson recently shared insight into what the Cardano community should expect regarding the ecosystem’s decentralized Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). He gave the update in an 18-minute-long podcast on X to ecosystem members. According to Hoskinson, the team is considering several approaches to improving and growing the Cardano SWF. He maintained that the goal is to use the fund’s resources to benefit the ecosystem. Hoskinson explained that the decentralized Cardano SWF is similar in principle to how countries like Norway invest national wealth into assets for future benefits. He proposed investing a small portion of the Cardano treasury in different assets. “Could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury, convert it to a blend of a collection of stablecoins … and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin/DeFi?” he asked. The plan aims to mitigate risk, create long-term yield, and reinvest the money into buying back ADA. This sets up Cardano’s Sovereign Wealth Fund to grow the ecosystem and, consequently, the value of ADA as time goes on. Cardano could make relatively easy returns without significantly eating into its core reserves by dedicating a portion of the treasury to Bitcoin and similar assets. When used to acquire ADA, these profits may increase demand and sustain the market price. Charles Hoskinson describes an economic model designed to be self-sustaining for the Cardano community.
