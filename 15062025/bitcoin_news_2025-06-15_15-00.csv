2025-06-15T12:32:39,"Best Altcoins to Replace Visa and Mastercard After $60B Stock Slump","Visa and Mastercard just took a hit, and the world is starting to notice. While Wall Street sees it as a dip worth buying, many see it as a wake-up call. The payment giants that once ruled every checkout lane are no longer untouchable. In an economy where every fee adds up, merchants and consumers alike are starting to ask: why are we still paying these middlemen to move our money? As TradFi starts to wobble, new crypto projects are stepping into the spotlight with bold, fee-free solutions. Let’s take a look at some of the best altcoins leading the charge away from plastic. Credit Cards Are Getting Crowded Out Visa and Mastercard just lost a combined $60B in market value after reports surfaced that major global merchants are actively looking for ways to bypass traditional credit card networks. Large retailers are frustrated by rising processing fees and are now exploring alternative payment systems that don’t rely on the same outdated rails. This shift isn’t coming out of nowhere. It reflects years of mounting pressure. Businesses have long been fed up with paying 2–3% per transaction, only to deal with delays, chargebacks, and rigid systems. Meanwhile, consumers are embracing faster, cheaper options like crypto and stablecoins. What used to be a niche is now looking more like a mainstream movement. Visa and Mastercard still dominate today, but their grip is loosening. The future of payments is being rebuilt right now, and it’s not running on plastic. 1. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Fueling a Payments Revolution Visa and Mastercard’s $60B slump shows just how vulnerable traditional payment systems have become – and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is stepping in to build something better. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the utility powerhouse behind one of the most ambitious payment ecosystems in crypto. With over $13.3M raised in crypto presale and a current price of just $0.025185, $BEST is more than just hype. It’s laying the rails for a new financial future. What makes it stand out? For starters, buyers of $BEST unlock real utility: reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects and higher staking rewards. Best Wallet is also disrupting the wallet space with features like ‘Upcoming Tokens,’ a built-in presale discovery tool that lets users explore and join promising new projects directly within the app. It’s secure, scam-proof, and designed to make presale participation fast and frustration-free. Thanks to Fireblocks’ MPC-CMP security tech, you stay protected while enjoying cutting-edge tools. With 70K+ followers and fast-growing adoption, $BEST could be on track to hit $0.072 by 2025 , with even bigger upside beyond. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) – Kill the Middleman for Good If Visa is the landlord of legacy finance, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is the wrecking crew. SUBBD Token powers the first AI-driven, decentralized creator platform built to cut out the middlemen and hand the power back to influencers and fans. Right now, you can buy $SUBBD for $0.055675. With $662K already raised, it’s an under-the-radar gem with serious upside. At its core, $SUBBD lets creators monetize directly – no YouTube cuts, no Patreon gatekeeping. Fans can tip, subscribe, and interact with their favorite influencers in real time, using instant, low-fee crypto payments. The platform supports both crypto and fiat, making it accessible across borders. But what really sets $SUBBD apart is its AI agent . Creators get a personal AI assistant to handle scheduling, content editing, and fan engagement. Meanwhile, users can generate AI-enhanced content, including approved avatars and short-form videos tied to top influencers. With over 250M followers across its ecosystem and unique staking perks, $SUBBD isn’t just another token – it’s a full-blown Web3 content revolution. This is the kind of platform Visa wishes it could bill. 3. Smog Token ($SMOG) – Meme-Powered Utility with Bite Meet Smog Token ($SMOG) – not your average meme coin . Built on Solana (with a bridged Ethereum version), it’s roaring into the scene with a sweet current price around $0.008913 and a juicy 42% APY for staking. Think of it as a dragon-themed adventure where holding and engaging actually pays off. At its core, $SMOG gamifies crypto: buy and stake to earn airdrop points redeemable for future token drops in ‘The Dragon’s Court’ community. Daily quests, social media challenges, and chain actions fuel participation, and rewards. It’s not just fun, it’s effective. Over 110K token holders and millions of completed quests show the hype isn’t just smoke. With a total supply of 1.4B tokens and 35% earmarked for airdrops, incentives are baked deep into its DNA. Plus, Smog’s Solana-Ethereum bridge expands its reach while staking stays accessible to both ecosystems. If you’re plowing through TradFi tolls, Smog offers a cheeky detour – with gaming, yields, and community swagger wrapped in one. A New Era Beyond the Plastic Visa and Mastercard’s slump is a clear signal: TradFi is fading. Crypto projects like $BEST , $SUBBD , and $SMOG are already stepping up, offering lower fees, more freedom, and real rewards. The old system is cracking. It’s time to move on. As always, do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.

2025-06-15T12:25:18,"Vietnam passes crypto assets regulation in new digital tech law","Vietnam’s National Assembly has passed the Law on the Digital Technology Industry, a comprehensive legal framework that will formally bring digital assets under strict regulatory control. Passed on June 14 and set to come into force on January 1, 2026, the law is considered a landmark in promoting digital innovation in the nation. Vietnam enacts standalone digital tech law Local publications reported that under the new law, digital assets will be classified into two large groups: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both use encryption and digital technology to authenticate and transfer. However, they also specifically remove securities, digital fiat, and other financial instruments from the definition. It is now up to Vietnam’s government to specify, for example, what kind of business is allowed and what kind of scrutiny will apply to the use and transferability of such assets. The law requires cybersecurity processes and anti-money laundering (AML) actions to comply with the global requirements issued by the law. It must be in sync with international best practices. This move is possibly in response to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) including Vietnam on its “gray list” in 2023 for increased scrutiny. In addition to regulating crypto, the laws symbolize Vietnam’s larger aspiration to take its place as a regional digital technology center . It would offer sweeping incentives to companies in areas like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. Those perks include tax breaks, friendly land-use policies, and research and development investments—especially for chip design companies and AI data centers. Push for digital literacy and investor protection intensifies The law also aims for a digitally literate workforce. Provincial governments have been tasked with developing education and training plans, and national curricula will be reformed to include digital technology skills. “With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry,” the Vietnamese government said. In the meantime, Vietnam still grapples with crypto scams. Vietnamese authorities have recently arrested key figures behind a nationwide cryptocurrency scam that defrauded tens of thousands of investors out of nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (approximately $400 million). According to local reporting, the fraud ring operated under the guise of a fake virtual currency exchange called MTC (Matrix Chain). The Dong Nai Provincial Police led the months-long investigation with support from the Ministry of Public Security and other regional forces. After nearly 200 days of surveillance and evidence collection, officers arrested the group’s ringleader, Nguyen Quoc Hung, and four accomplices during coordinated raids across multiple provinces. Police also rounded up four suspects earlier this year, accused of coming up with BitMiner, a bogus cryptocurrency mining company that pretended to be based in Dubai. More than 200 people lost more than 4 billion Vietnamese dong (about $157,300) in a scheme that sold fraudulent mining packages and educational content. In December 2024, Hanoi City Police foiled a large-scale crypto scam that defrauded around 100 businesses and 400 individuals of 30 billion Vietnamese dong (approximately $1.17 million). Authorities intervened just in time to stop an additional 300 people from falling victim. Operating under Million Smiles, the company promoted an in-house cryptocurrency, QFS, or Quantum Financial System, using deceptive advertising that linked it to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims. Vietnam’s new laws help fill the legal void around cryptocurrencies and signal the country’s willingness to be a global leader in the next era of global technology.

The company stated that altcoin dominance has reached historical support levels and warned that high volatility could be on the way in the coming days. Alphractal made the following statement in its statement: “Something big is about to happen in altcoins! Altcoin Dominance has reached historical support levels. We are on the verge of a wave of volatility in the coming days. Whether Bitcoin rises or falls, many altcoins are likely to outperform BTC in the coming months, so it is critical to be prepared.” Related News: Giant Whale Shorted These 16 Altcoins, Made Huge Profits Focusing on two important metrics in its analysis, Alphractal argued that these were the harbingers of serious rallies in the altcoin market in the past. Altcoin Dominance (excluding Stablecoins): It was stated that this metric found strong support at the 25% level and this level is often tested before major altcoin rallies. Altcoin Dominance (excluding ETH and Stablecoins): It was stated that this indicator has a critical support area around 18%. Falling below this level has historically triggered periods when altcoins gained significant market share against Bitcoin. The company noted that the levels in question do not directly guarantee an “altcoin season,” but that such technical signals have appeared before major market moves in the past. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-15T12:16:30,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Explained","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has stayed mostly quiet this weekend, showing no big moves in either direction. The market is still moving sideways, with prices stuck within a narrow range. While there’s been a little bit of downward pressure, it hasn’t been enough to trigger any big changes. Some experts have wondered if Bitcoin’s current pattern might turn into a triangle, but there’s no clear sign of that happening. Triangles are rare patterns in the market, and it’s too early to say if this will develop into one. Bearish Update: For now, the focus remains on a correction phase that began after Bitcoin’s May high. The price has been pulling back since then, and it’s expected to possibly head lower before finding strong support. The key areas to watch are around $99,200 to $92,800. There’s even a chance it could dip as low as $81,340, which is considered an important support level. If Bitcoin breaks below that, it could signal the end of the bull market. Bullish Update: On the other hand, if Bitcoin holds above this zone, the long-term outlook remains positive. Once this correction ends, Bitcoin could target a move towards $130,000, and if market conditions improve, it might even rally higher, possibly up to $190,000. Looking at shorter timeframes, the price is currently holding above minor support levels. Over the weekend, it’s been expected that Bitcoin might see a small bounce or move sideways before heading lower again. A break above $108,822 could mean the market is turning more bullish in the short term, but for now, there’s no clear sign of that happening. In summary, Bitcoin is still in a correction phase with no confirmed breakdown or breakout. As long as it stays above key support levels, the larger uptrend remains intact.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bullish-and-bearish-scenarios-explained/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

Major announcements included Cardano’s Cardinal protocol for Bitcoin DeFi, XRP Ledger’s upcoming EVM sidechain, and Coinbase’s Bitcoin rewards card. Meanwhile, regulators delayed ETF decisions and the Senate advanced stablecoin legislation. Bitcoin Amid major strikes by Israel across Iran, the Bitcoin price fell almost $6,000 through Thursday and into Friday. A comprehensive bounce is now underway, with experts wondering if the recovery will continue. DeFi Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Cardano blockchain, has officially introduced Cardinal , a new protocol designed to bring Bitcoin into decentralized finance (DeFi) through a trustless, cross-chain solution. Technology XRP Ledger is set to launch an Ethereum-compatible EVM sidechain in Q2 2025, aiming to integrate Ethereum smart contracts and decentralized applications into its ecosystem while onboarding new contributors and enhancing DeFi functionalities. Business Coinbase has partnered with American Express to launch the Coinbase One Card , offering up to 4% Bitcoin rewards on purchases and expanded crypto benefits as part of its growing payment ecosystem GameStop has announced a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, signaling a deepening commitment to its Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy.

Community alignment, sustainable tokenomics, and real utility, which tokens like Mosaic Galaxy's Kodexa embody, are becoming the benchmarks.

But Nguyen says answering that phone call led him to lose $500,000 – the entirety of his life’s work. “I lost maybe $500,000… I may be homeless now.” The con artists who masterminded the scam convinced Nguyen that his identity was being used to commit various crimes overseas, like money laundering, and in order to clear his name, the soon-to-be-retired man supposedly had to wire over his money to another bank. The criminals, who are yet to be identified, used an encrypted messaging app called Viber to send wire transfer details, along with fake government documents to make it seem more legitimate. After losing everything, Nguyen’s daughter, Kathy, is now supporting him, and says she is in the process of selling her house to make ends meet. Says Kathy, “Watch out for your family. Your mom, dad, grandma, grandpas. Just let them know that something like this could happen, and just be careful.” The Nguyens have filed a report with the FBI, but at time of writing, the scammers are at large.

As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.16, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, it has slipped by 2.3%, continuing a mild downtrend. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Currently, overall sentiment around XRP remains bearish . However, there is some sense of optimism from a technical standpoint. The token’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) is at $2.30, offering short-term support, while the 200-day SMA, at $1.88, signals potential for longer-term bullish momentum. Meanwhile, XRP’s 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 44.38, still in neutral territory, pointing to a balanced market with room to move either way. ChatGPT predicts XRP price Looking ahead, OpenAI’s ChatGPT projected that XRP will likely trade between $2.08 and $2.32 by July 1, with $2.22 identified as the most probable mid-range target. This prediction is based on technical indicators, momentum analysis, and overall market conditions. The model noted that XRP’s recent breach of the psychological $2 level has established a key support zone, which could act as a base for future gains. On the other hand, resistance appears between $2.30 and $2.35, with support holding near the $2.05 to $2.10 range. XRP AI price prediction. Source: ChatGPT A limiting factor, however, is the current absence of major catalysts. Without headline developments, such as an ETF approval or a major partnership announcement from Ripple, any sharp price movements appear unlikely in the short term. ChatGPT pointed out that broader market dynamics could still play a role. For example, a stable or rising Bitcoin ( BTC ) price could offer enough tailwind to push XRP toward the upper end of its projected range. Grok predicts XRP price Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok model took a more bullish stance, forecasting a trading range between $2.25 and $2.40 by July 1. It cited an ascending channel pattern and potential positive momentum from Ripple’s ecosystem as key drivers. Still, Grok also flagged resistance around $2.50 as a likely cap on near-term gains. Both AI models seem to agree that a major XRP breakout is unlikely over the next couple of weeks. A gradual climb toward the low-to-mid $2.30s appears within reach, provided market conditions remain steady.

2025-06-15T10:39:05,"Neo Pepe ($NEOP) Leaves Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) in the Dust With Blazing Presale Speed","Neo Pepe ($NEOP) has become the most exciting and premium crypto launch of the year, starting a feeding frenzy that leaves Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) dazed and confused in its aftermath. Where BPEP was once the status of a moving meme-fueled presale, it has now been overtaken by Neo Pepe in the speed and structure department and is left in the dust by Neo Pepe's relentless presale campaign. Merely encountering two meme coins is not the mark of a meme coin shift; it is, rather, an orderly advance toward a serious fundraising goal that, as far as anyone can see, looks pretty good. Neo Pepe is the most powerful presale to participate in. That's the shift. Unlike NEOP, which responds with the same urgency and scalability, BPEP has largely fallen short of these marks. It launched with promise but, in the absence of a pricing model that's even somewhat cogent and a long-term roadmap that's articulated well enough for even the most optimistic observer to understand it, BPEP has left many investors wondering whether it has any staying power. Presale Speed So Brutal It’s Forcing BPEP Devs to Rethink Everything Neo Pepe doesn’t just launch faster. It operates with a velocity built into its core mechanics. The project’s hourly token unlocking mechanism following launch ensures smooth market integration without volatility spikes. In contrast, Bitcoin Pepe’s unlock structure remains vague and delayed, lacking the kind of investor-friendly mechanics that are rapidly becoming standard. Each transaction made on the Neo Pepe network pays a fee: a 2.5% slice of every trade that goes directly and immediately to Uniswap liquidity pools. But here's the real innovation: the liquidity provider (LP) tokens that those trades generate are not kept to be manipulated at some later time (Neutrino dollars hanging out in an actual wallet address, for instance) but are burned instead. That means liquidity can't be manipulated, and it can't be taken away once it's been put there. To a certain extent, that's what makes the Neo Pepe network safe for investors. This Isn’t a Battle. It’s a Displacement. While BPEP continues to rely on the inertia of meme nostalgia, Neo Pepe is capitalizing on a full-blown economic engine. In less than a month, it has outpaced BPEP across nearly every measurable category: Presale Growth: Neo Pepe has reached multiple milestones at accelerating speed. BPEP remains trapped in early-stage drag. Liquidity Confidence: Investors trust Neo Pepe’s irreversible liquidity mechanics. BPEP’s LP model raises persistent doubts. Transparency and Trust: Real-time tracking and Chainlink-indexed pricing are standard with Neo Pepe. BPEP’s metrics are harder to verify. Engaged Community: Neo Pepe’s DAO structure has turned holders into participants. BPEP’s supporters are left as spectators. This is not just a rivalry in price charts. This is a philosophical divergence in what memecoins are meant to be in 2025. Neo Pepe is signaling a maturity BPEP has yet to exhibit. $NEOP Gives Voters Real Power — BPEP Offers None Neo Pepe isn’t just fast—it’s fair. Its decentralized governance model gives the entire community decision-making power over crucial project developments. All proposals must meet a one-million-token threshold, followed by a mandatory 1-day delay, 7-day voting period, and 2-day timelock execution. Compare this to Bitcoin Pepe. BPEP maintains a centralized core team, with governance yet to be properly delegated to holders. Even in a memecoin narrative, today’s investors expect more than vibes. They expect verifiable control. Neo Pepe delivers that with an on-chain DAO built on OpenZeppelin standards, where treasury management and token decisions are executed transparently by the community. This distinction alone marks Neo Pepe as the clear evolution of meme crypto. BPEP’s lack of real governance is a legacy feature that places it in a different, less competitive category. While BPEP Recycles Hype, $NEOP Engineers Demand Neo Pepe is constructed for more than mere excitement—it’s built for functioning well. Its presale tokenomics are meticulously planned to create continuous momentum. Neo Pepe has a 16-step pricing structure commencing at $0.05 in Stage 0 and reaching $0.16 by Stage 15, aimed at pulling in a total of $50 million. After the launch, token unlocking happens at a speed that lifts any immediate sell pressure, going a good way toward making the market what traders like to call ""integral."" Market integrity is always everyone's friend. And it gets better. Every transaction pumps 2.5% of the value into liquidity, which is good for market health, with tokens that do this right away being burned. None of this structure is offered by BPEP. It initiated with a distribution of tokens that were assigned a basic price, and it has remained mostly clear yet mostly vague in regards to what the BPEP developers will do with the funds obtained from the token sale. No clear buy back and burn plan. No answer given to the burning question: ""Will tokens be freely available in the coming months?"" BPEP stalls engagement. Blazing Advantages Neo Pepe Holds Over BPEP Neo Pepe dominates the comparison with a suite of investor-first mechanics that BPEP does not match: Auto-Liquidity Burning: 2.5% per transaction, instantly applied to LP and burned forever. Hourly Unlock Schedule: Ensures predictable post-launch market conditions. DAO Governance: Proposals, voting, and treasury controls all community-managed. Presale Urgency: Each of the 16 stages has a capped allocation and escalating prices. Immutable Smart Contracts: Built with OpenZeppelin to ensure transparency and prevent future tampering. It’s these features that have placed Neo Pepe on every hot token presale watchlist this year, with its superiority over BPEP becoming more evident with each passing stage. By contrast, Bitcoin Pepe features: Unclear token release timelines. Static token price. Minimal liquidity safeguards. Centralized project control. Lack of structural accountability. Even the most casual investor will see which project is designed to last. No Hidden Wallets. No Insider Bags. Just Pure Transparency. The community-centered and fair token distribution of Neo Pepe. Ours is a presale; you can purchase a token. To you, the last half of this text will be exposed—rightly, as we are proud to be clear. Those who presold received 45% of the token's lifetime; for us to market this thing, we needed to be funded. Risks have been taken. For that reason, 25% of our funds have gone and will go to marketing. And while I can hardly make a commendable case for what constitutes ""risk"" in marketing (that I can do by coding, obviously), the upshot is that 10% of tokens have gone to funding development. In much the same way, ecosystem incentives also require visibility and justification—hence the 10% life tokens allotted to that purpose. Markets Aren’t Subtle — And They’re All Pointing to $NEOP By every metric that matters in 2025, Neo Pepe is accelerating beyond Bitcoin Pepe. Investors are now migrating to crypto investment gems that promise both community control and economic foresight. BPEP, while nostalgic, lacks the core mechanics to compete in today’s fast-moving DeFi terrain. The Memetrix movement behind Neo Pepe isn’t simply symbolic. It’s strategic. And as every presale stage sells out with increasing velocity, the distance between Neo Pepe and BPEP is growing into a chasm. Those looking to bet on meme culture with real utility and structure are already staking their claim in the years hottest crypto opportunity now . There is no second round in this contest. BPEP may have nostalgia. Neo Pepe has the roadmap, the engine, and the crowd. It isn’t just leading the race—it’s redefining how it’s run.

2025-06-15T10:00:23,"Bitcoin Investors Remain Calm Despite Israel-Iran Conflict Escalation","The price of Bitcoin has managed to stay afloat over the past few days despite the growing conflict in the Middle East and the ensuing bearish pressure. The premier cryptocurrency continues to hover around the $105,000 level, with its value down by merely 0.8% in the past week. According to the latest on-chain data, the Bitcoin price might not be down for too long, as investors seem unbothered by the rising tensions between Israel and Iran. Below is what the BTC investors have been up to since the military action started in the past week. BTC Investors Still Holding On To Their Assets: Analyst In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, a pseudonymous on-chain analyst, CryptoMe revealed that the Bitcoin market has remained relatively quiet despite the ongoing geopolitical events. The relevant indicators here are the Bitcoin exchange netflow and Open Interest. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Rally To $10,000 If This Major Resistance Is Broke To start, CryptoMe analyzed the BTC Exchange Netflow, which measures the difference between Bitcoin sent to and withdrawn from centralized exchanges. Typically, this metric helps to gauge the selling pressure on a particular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Given that one of the services offered by exchanges is selling, exchange inflows are often considered a bearish signal for the Bitcoin price. However, CryptoMe noted that there has been no significant change in Netflow, meaning that investors are not looking to offload their assets. The on-chain analyst also highlighted the Open Interest on centralized exchanges, which estimates the amount of capital flowing into a cryptocurrency at every given time. CryptoMe attributed the reduced Open Interest to the liquidated long positions following the price correction. The crypto pundit added: But when we look at the bigger picture, Open Interest still looks strong, and investors are still keeping their positions open FOR NOW despite all the WAR news. Furthermore, CryptoMe mentioned the Bitcoin Open Interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), where institutions and speculators trade. The analyst noted that while some positions were closed and the Open Interest dropped after the event, there has still not been any significant exit movement on the CME. Ultimately, the absence of major movements into centralized exchanges suggests that the investors are not in panic mode yet. While most positions on Bitcoin derivatives are still open at the moment, there is no telling what will happen if the war tension escalates further. Hence, investors might want to approach the market with caution over the next few days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,760, reflecting an almost 1% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-15T10:00:00,"What is XRP? Investors Ask as Bitcoin Solaris Emerges as the Ultimate Bitcoin Replacement","XRP once held the promise of revolutionizing global payments. Fast, cheap, and bank-friendly—it was pitched as the future of cross-border finance. But years of regulatory battles, stagnant token utility, and centralized control have left many investors wondering: Is this still the future, or just another chapter in crypto history? As attention shifts, a bold new name is rising with far more than promises. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) isn’t just aiming to improve the blockchain—it’s redefining what decentralized money can do. With blazing speed, mobile-first mining, and a full ecosystem that empowers users instead of institutions, BTC-S is positioning itself not just as a Bitcoin alternative, but the upgrade Bitcoin never had. XRP Had Potential—But the Space Moved On XRP deserves credit for challenging the banking sector and pioneering real-time settlement. But with Ripple entangled in legal skirmishes and token utility tied closely to corporate control, cracks have shown. Decentralization remains a concern. And for users seeking freedom, speed, and income, not just transaction rails, XRP now feels like a limited play. Investors are beginning to shift their gaze to a project that’s not just faster or cheaper, but fundamentally more empowering. Bitcoin Solaris: Designed to Replace, Not Just Compete BTC-S was built from the ground up to combine what Bitcoin started with what modern tech makes possible. It features a hybrid consensus model—Proof-of-Work (PoW) for core chain security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for scalability. Together, they deliver unmatched performance. Key highlights include: Base Layer PoW using SHA-256 (Bitcoin-compatible) with 5-minute block times Solaris Layer DPoS with 21 rotating validators every 24 hours and 15-second blocks Cross-layer integration where validator data is secured on-chain through PoW anchoring Smart contracts in Rust, enabling DeFi, tokenization, and secure automation Optional privacy via Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) It gets even better with throughput: the Solaris Layer pushes up to 100,000 transactions per second, finalizing in just 2 seconds, while consuming 99.95% less energy than traditional PoW chains. This isn’t theoretical—it’s audited and tested. Both Cyberscope and Freshcoins have verified the code, and early influencers like Ben Crypto are already spotlighting BTC-S as one of the most promising chains of the year. Mobile Mining with Real Rewards Unlike XRP, which can’t be earned directly through network participation, BTC-S opens the doors to daily income through mining—without expensive hardware. Through the exciting release of the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users will be able to mine using: Smartphones (Android and iOS) Laptops and desktops ASICs and GPUs (for power users) With adaptive mining algorithms, in-app wallets, and energy-optimized performance, it’s truly accessible. Just tap, and you’re earning. Want to estimate your earning potential? The BTC-S mining calculator helps you visualize your daily impact. A Blockchain Designed for You, Not Institutions—Discover BTC-S Liquid Staking That Doesn’t Lock You In Beyond mining, Bitcoin Solaris also introduces a breakthrough in staking. With liquid staking , users can earn rewards without locking away their tokens. How it works: Staked BTC-S becomes sBTC-S (1:1 ratio) sBTC-S remains fully liquid, tradable, and DeFi-compatible You earn rewards while retaining full control It enhances decentralization, validator rotation, and network health It’s integrated right into the Solaris Nova App, with no complex setup required, making staking easy, flexible, and profitable for everyone. A Roadmap That’s Actually Being Followed Many coins brag about roadmaps. BTC-S is executing one. Its forward-looking roadmap spans: Mainnet Launch (Q3 2026) with full support for smart contracts and governance Mining Power Marketplace and cross-chain tools by Q4 2026 Quantum-resistant upgrades and layer-2 scaling in 2027 Enterprise-grade integrations with AI and IoT in late 2027 It’s a roadmap backed by action, not just whitepaper buzzwords. Every phase is designed to increase adoption, unlock real-world use, and build sustainable value. The Presale Is Moving Fast—and It’s Not Just Hype We’re currently in Phase 7 of the Bitcoin Solaris presale, with over 11,000 users already onboard and more than $4.5M raised. Current price: $7 Next phase: $8 Launch price: $20 Bonus: 9% With only around 7 weeks left before the July 31, 2025 launch, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most dynamic presales in crypto history. The growth is organic, driven by real use, not marketing gimmicks. If you’re watching from the sidelines, Bitcoin Solaris is your window into the future. Final Verdict: The Next Bitcoin? Or Something Better? XRP may have started as a disruptor. But Bitcoin Solaris is emerging as a revolution. With mobile mining, powerful staking, lightning-fast scalability, and a clear roadmap, BTC-S isn’t just an upgrade to Bitcoin—it’s what Bitcoin would be if it were built today.

According to a new report by The Wall Street Journal, anonymous people familiar with the matter say that some of the world’s largest retailers are considering issuing their very own dollar-pegged crypto assets in the US in an effort to save billions of dollars in transaction fees. Such a move would mark a major shift away from the traditional finance system, which includes the nation’s largest banks and credit providers. Other firms that are reportedly exploring the potential use of stablecoins include Expedia Group and unnamed airline companies. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to other assets – such as the dollar, precious metals, or other crypto assets – and are typically backed on a one-to-one basis. Stablecoins have been gaining traction recently due to their low transaction fees and faster payment processing times. The firms’ decisions may ultimately depend on the fate of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill still making its way through Congress and yet to pass either chamber. The GENIUS Act, introduced earlier this year, aims to establish a regulatory framework for alternative payment systems, opening the door for new players to compete with giants like Visa and MasterCard. The sources say that Amazon’s stablecoin exploration has mostly revolved around creating one for online purchases, while Walmart has lobbied to change the GENIUS Act to introduce more competition in the credit-card sector. The firms are also considering how to use existing stablecoins if they decide not to create their own.

Saylor stated that the United States should not miss this change, saying, “It is in the interest of the United States to have as much Bitcoin as possible before other countries realize this transformation.” According to Saylor, the BTC network will form the basis of future capital flows as a decentralized financial infrastructure, so it is strategically important for countries, especially the US, to invest in Bitcoin early.

Most larger-cap alts are slightly in the red, including HYPE, which has dumped by 5%, while PI is up by a similar percentage. BTC Stopped at $106K The primary cryptocurrency was riding high at the beginning of the previous business week as it pumped above $110,000 on several occasions by Wednesday. However, each attempt was met with an immediate rejection, and the last one pushed BTC south to under $106,000. Although the bulls managed to recover some ground on Thursday and pushed bitcoin to $108,400, the quickly escalating tension in the Middle East resulted in an immediate price drop that drove the asset south to under $103,000. Although the attacks continued in the following 48 hours, including a few retaliations by Iran, BTC’s price recovered some ground and even jumped above $106,000 hours ago. However, US President Trump weighed in on the matter once again at that point and threatened Iran with “the full strength and might of the US Armed Forces” if Tehran decides to retaliate against the US in some form. Bitcoin slipped once again, but it’s still hovering above $105,000 . Its market cap remains below $2.1 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is at 61.7% on CG. BTCUSD.

2025-06-15T08:22:44,"Trump’s Crypto Bet Pays Off: Over $600M Reported in 2024 Earnings","US President Donald Trump disclosed over $600 million in earnings from a mix of cryptocurrency ventures, real estate assets, and branded merchandise in a newly released financial disclosure for 2024. Key Takeaways: Trump disclosed over $600 million in 2024 earnings, much of it from crypto ventures. His total asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, with significant income from NFTs, token sales, and real estate. The revelation raises concerns over potential conflicts of interest during his presidency. The filing , made public Friday, outlines the president’s sprawling business portfolio, including significant gains from digital assets and meme coin projects. While the exact timeframe isn’t specified, the report appears to cover income through the end of December 2024. Trump Assets Top $1.6 Billion, Earnings Surge Trump’s estimated asset base now exceeds $1.6 billion, according to a Reuters analysis . Notably, a large portion of his 2024 windfall came from crypto-related endeavors, including over $320 million in estimated fees from the meme coin $TRUMP, and more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance firm. The disclosure also shows Trump received $57.35 million from token sales and holds 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture. The report sheds light on the growing entanglement between Trump’s business interests and the U.S. crypto industry. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Critics have pointed out that some of his businesses have seen tailwinds from favorable policy decisions during his time in office. As per Donald Trump financial disclosure, he made $57M from #Crypto in 2024, Nearly $600M in Total Income. It's mainly from World Liberty Financial, a #DeFi project where he holds $15.7B governance tokens. pic.twitter.com/PdEgyYHW32 — Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) June 14, 2025 Trump Media & Technology Group, parent company of Truth Social, also remains a core asset. While exact valuations are unclear, revenue from branded merchandise and licensing deals continue to flow in. Among them, $2.8 million from Trump Watches, $2.5 million from Trump-branded sneakers and fragrances, and over $1 million from his NFT trading cards. In the physical world, Trump’s Florida golf resorts brought in $217.7 million, led by the Trump National Doral, which earned over $110 million. Additional income came from real estate projects in India, Dubai, and Vietnam, with licensing and development fees totaling over $30 million. The filing also included $12 million in passive income through investments in Blue Owl Capital and U.S. bond funds. Despite previously claiming to have distanced himself from day-to-day management, the disclosure confirms Trump remains deeply tied to the financial performance of his vast network of businesses, including crypto. SEC Approves Trump Media’s $2.3B Bitcoin-Linked Registration As reported, the SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement tied to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. The June 13 filing covers 85 million shares, including 29 million linked to convertible notes. While the approval gives TMTG flexibility to raise capital, the firm says it has no immediate plans to issue new securities. The SEC’s green light comes just weeks after TMTG confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to accumulate Bitcoin, following earlier denials. In that May 27 announcement, Nunes characterized Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” asserting that it would become a core part of the company’s asset base.

2025-06-15T07:26:09,"Investment Management Company Founder Speaks About the Future of Bitcoin (BTC) – What to Expect?","Speaking at Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in New York, Coatue Management founder Philippe Laffont said Bitcoin’s increasingly consistent volatility and institutional interest are making it a more central asset in investment portfolios. According to Laffont, despite Bitcoin’s 13% increase so far in 2025, its volatility has decreased significantly compared to previous years. BTC’s sharp price swings have caused Coatue to avoid investing in the past. But that’s changing now. “The cost of entry into Bitcoin may be decreasing. If beta is decreasing, that would be really interesting,” Laffont said, noting that Bitcoin’s beta, a measure of volatility relative to the market, has decreased over time. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs by giants like BlackRock is a clear indication that BTC is maturing, according to Laffont. He also recalled that Bitcoin lost more than 60% of its value in 2022, but this decline was more striking compared to the fluctuations experienced, for example, after Trump's tariff announcement in April 2025. “Bitcoin is down only 5%, while Nasdaq is down more than 6% between April 2nd and April 10th. This shows that Bitcoin is now becoming a more resilient asset to risk events in the market,” he said. Additionally, the rate at which coins held in Bitcoin wallets for at least a month are being sold out has dropped significantly, suggesting that investors are moving away from short-term speculation and starting to view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Pointing out that Bitcoin’s share in total global wealth is still very low (0.4%) at around $2 trillion, Laffont said that this rate will inevitably increase over time: “If people continue to believe that Bitcoin is valuable, then that asset will become more valuable over time, which means it should become more central in portfolios.” Despite this, Laffont warned investors that Bitcoin’s weight in the portfolio should not be exaggerated: “Even if you think Bitcoin is going to be important, don’t put a large portion of your portfolio into it. A small but long-term position can make you less stressed and more profitable.” Related News: List of Today's Top 15 Trending Altcoins Published Laffont, who admitted that Coatue had previously missed the Bitcoin opportunity, attributes this mostly to their inability to think simply. According to Laffont, in the investment world, it is usually more profitable to focus on assets that people believe are valuable, rather than complex models: “For something to be valuable, everyone has to believe it is valuable. It was that simple, and we missed it.” Technology-focused hedge fund Coatue has invested in cryptocurrency and technology companies such as Dune Analytics, Bitcoin miner Hut 8 and artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave. CoreWeave also has a partnership with Bitcoin miner Core Scientific. Dividing his investors into three, Laffont said that there are those who leave crypto completely to themselves, those who question why Bitcoin was entered late, and cautious investors who want to stay away from crypto. However, he stated that this cautious audience is decreasing a little more every year: “This group of abstainers is disappearing. They are becoming smaller and smaller every year.” *This is not investment advice.

In a new interview with Bloomberg, Gundlach says recent behavior in the stock market, the dollar and the Treasury market appears “strange” to him, hinting at deeper concerns that are unsettling investors in US assets. According to Gundlach, investors are beginning to sniff out the looming risks tied to the US government’s unsustainable fiscal trajectory. “In the last 15 years, there has been a number of corrections on the S&P 500, and in every single one of them, when the S&P goes down by more than 10%, the trade-weighted dollar index goes up. This time, the dollar went down when the S&P 500 went down by almost 20%. That’s strange, things are behaving differently. Usually when the Fed starts cutting interest rates, rates across the yield curve go down. The 10-year Treasury almost always goes up [in price] immediately following the first Fed rate cut, and then it keeps rallying for a while. This time, the 10-year yield went up, and the yield curve is steepening. So I think what we have is recognition that the interest expense for the United States is untenable – if we continue running a $2.1 trillion budget deficit and we continue to have sticky interest rates.” The Bond King zeroes in on foreign investors, noting that they hold tens of trillions of dollars in US assets. Gundlach says it is now within the realm of possibility for the investor cohort to start exiting US markets. “There’s a net investment position; foreigners were investing more in the US than the US was investing outside the country to the tune of $3 trillion. That was about 15 or 17 years ago. It’s now over $25 trillion is the net investment position, and the dollar is falling. It’s not inconceivable that some of that $25 trillion that came in not even two decades could go out.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-15T06:19:34,"Owning One Bitcoin Is the New American Dream, Says Bitwise Portfolio Manager","Bitcoin (BTC) BTC is holding firm above $105,000 after recovering from a sharp downturn triggered by escalating tensions in the Middle East. The leading cryptocurrency dropped below $104,000 following Israel’s strike on Iran, but quickly regained lost ground, now trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s swift rebound suggests underlying strength, with high-volume buying visible during the dip. Analysts point to the $104,000–$105,000 range as an important zone of support, as price action continues to grind upward. Sentiment remains cautious — reflected in a pullback in trader confidence — but structurally, bitcoin’s trend remains intact. Beyond near-term volatility, bitcoin continues to capture the imagination of a younger generation of investors. In a recent episode of the Unchained podcast, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, described how bitcoin’s appeal increasingly transcends traditional financial goals. According to Park, many younger people no longer aspire to own suburban homes or pursue the white-picket-fence ideal. Instead, they’re focused on becoming ""wholecoiners"" — those who own at least one full bitcoin — as a new form of prestige and long-term security. For some, the goal even extends beyond personal wealth to securing a financial legacy across generations, reflecting the popular meme of ""retiring your bloodline."" Park added that bitcoin’s global, apolitical nature is central to this shift. It offers a shared value system, allowing people worldwide to ""opt out"" of systems they no longer trust. That sentiment is fueling a cultural pivot: bitcoin is no longer just a hedge or speculative asset, but for many, it has become a social signal of financial independence and self-sovereignty. As BTC holds above $105K and macro catalysts loom, the contrast between short-term fear and long-term conviction has rarely been sharper. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded between $104,480.15 and $105,696.12, closing near $105,590, up 0.15%, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Support was reinforced in the $104,400–$104,500 zone, with high-volume accumulation during the 16:00–20:00 GMT window. A bullish reversal followed at 21:00, driving BTC above $105,000 on strong volumeIntraday breakout occurred at 02:01, with price jumping from $105,486 to $105,550 on elevated activity. Consolidation above $105,470 suggests further upside potential toward $106,000, pending sustained demand.

2025-06-15T05:24:24,"Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next? Experts Split","Bitcoin (BTC) is once again testing the nerves of traders worldwide, hovering just above $105,000 today as forecasts split the crypto community in half. Will the king cryptocurrency explode to $175,000 this cycle, or nosedive to under $80,000 if fear grips the market? The $175K Dream On the bullish side, pseudonymous chart-watcher Egrag Crypto supercharged hopium this week, predicting a huge breakout in the next few months. According to the analyst, BTC’s historical cycle data suggests the asset is primed for a 102% surge, which would catapult it to $175,000 from its current levels. “The average of three major pumps this cycle is 102%, hitting $175K!” they tweeted, pointing to eerily similar patterns in previous bull markets. The way Bitcoin shrugged off the effects of recent geopolitical upheavals has only bolstered Egrag’s bullish case. After Israel struck multiple Iranian nuclear and military assets, the cryptocurrency cratered, going from a daily high near $108,500 to just under $103,000, before clawing its way back to around $105,000 today. Other optimists, like DeFiTracer, also highlighted similar war-driven dips in April and October 2024, when each was followed by 48% and 74% explosions upward. “Don’t let whales and news manipulate you,” he wrote on X, suggesting June’s 4% dip is merely fuel for the next bump upward. The Bear Trap However, not everyone is buying the hype just yet. Seasoned analyst Ali Martinez has tempered the euphoria, warning that the market could be on the brink of a sharp correction if key levels don’t hold. He backed his pessimism, pointing to whales offloading nearly 30,000 BTC in the past week as well as a weakening support floor around the hundred grand level. If this floor gives way, Martinez predicts a drop to as low as $78,500. His sentiment was echoed by crypto strategist Michaël van de Poppe, who noted that BTC just failed to hold above $106,000, triggering a liquidity cascade southwards. “Two options,” he warned: A sub-$100,000 buying opportunity or a fresh rally if prices hold at around $102,500. Market observer Axel Adler Jr. also weighed in , drawing attention to BTC’s OBV (On-Balance Volume), which is still stuck in the red near $100,000. According to him, it means that any bullish momentum could be paper-thin. The post Bitcoin at $105K: Breakout or Breakdown Next?
