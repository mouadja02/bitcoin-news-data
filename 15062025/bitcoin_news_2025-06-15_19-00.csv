2025-06-15T16:55:15,"President Trump Discloses $57,355,532 in Crypto Income From World Liberty Financial: Report","President Donald Trump has reportedly pocketed tens of millions of dollars in income from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), his family-backed decentralized-finance platform. According to a new report from the New York Post, records released by the Office of Government Ethics show that Trump’s stake in WLFI raked in just over $57.3 million for him, one of his largest sources of income in the past year. WLFI, which was launched last year, was co-founded by Trump’s three sons – Donald Jr., Eric and Barron – and others as a response to what they say is the growing politicization of the banking system. Previously, Donald Trump Jr. said that his family was debanked after getting into politics and described the banking system as a “pyramid scheme.” “There was a time… where I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone [and] I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked.” The disclosure reports that Trump’s personal crypto wallet is valued at between $1,000,001 and $5 million while listing millions of dollars worth of royalty payments he received for selling items with his name and likeness. Some of the President’s noteworthy liabilities include $100 million worth of mortgage loans for various properties, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of lawsuits and tens of thousands of dollars worth of credit card bills.

Amid this clash, the crypto market is also affected, as Bitcoin and altcoins are witnessing selling pressure. However, Ravencoin’s trend is still bullish, and it is coming down to its key levels from where it can bounce again. Let’s find the key levels in detail in this Ravencoin price prediction. Table of Contents What is Ravencoin? Ravencoin price prediction Ravencoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook Ravencoin price prediction 2025 Ravencoin price prediction 2030 Since its launch, Ravencoin ( RVN ) has reached an all-time high of $0.27391, followed by a 1363% price drop. At the time of writing, it is currently trading at $0.0196, which represents a 45% drop from $0.03573, which was seen 5 months ago in December 2024.. RVN 1 week chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss RVN price prediction by giving you its short-term and long-term price forecasts and exploring whether this token can continue its bullish run. You might also like: What Is Ravencoin (RVN) and Is It a Legit Cryptocurrency? What is Ravencoin? The goal of Ravencoin, a digital peer-to-peer (P2P) network, is to deploy a use case-specific blockchain that is intended to effectively manage a single function: the transfer of assets between parties. Built on a fork of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) code, Ravencoin was first announced on October 31, 2017, and on January 3, 2018, it released binaries for mining. This was known as a fair launch because there was no premine, initial coin offering, or masternodes. Its name was inspired by the Game of Thrones television series. Ravencoin, which is a fork of the BTC code, has four major features: a mining algorithm (KAWPOW, formerly X16R and X16RV2 respectively) designed to lessen the centralization of mining brought on by ASIC hardware; a modified issuance schedule (with a block reward of 5,000 RVN); a block time reduction to one minute; and a coin supply cap of 21 billion, which is a thousand times greater than BTC. Ravencoin seeks to address the issue of blockchain trade and asset transfers. In the past, an asset produced on the BTC blockchain could unintentionally be destroyed when the coins used to create it were traded. Token assets on the Ravenchain can only be issued by burning RVN coins, which are intended to function as internal currency within the network. A stake of a project, such as equities and securities, airline miles, an hour’s pay, or real-world custodial items like gold or actual euros, can all be represented by the assets. Now let’s discuss RVN price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Ravencoin price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the RVN token? Let’s dive into the RVN price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Ravencoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Ravencoin price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to drop by -0.85% and reach $0.01973 by July 13, 2025. As of June. 13th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the RVN price outlook has turned slightly bullish, with 14 technical analysis indicators showing bullish signals, 4 indicating bearish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Ravencoin price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the RVN token’s price could fluctuate between $0.0170 and $0.0418, and may likely hold a yearly average of $0.0358. CoinCodex projects that the RVN token can trade in the price channel of $0.019725 and $0.021148 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in RVN or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Ravencoin price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Ravencoin crypto price prediction for 2030, RVN’s price could vary between $0.02421 and $0.026785. DigitalCoinPrice expects that RVN’s price could climb to $0.0904 and $0.10 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the RVN price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the RVN token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including RVN. A great way for RVN to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the RVN token. You might also like: Ravencoin (RVN) now Supported on tZERO Android and iOS App Is Ravencoin a good investment? Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including RVN , please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Additionally, it is worth noting that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market can change rapidly, and a token that was once considered a future investment may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the RVN token. Will Ravencoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is challenging to predict the exact value of the RVN token, it is essential to watch for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Ravencoin price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low RVN can go. Should I invest in Ravencoin? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Ravencoin price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Additionally, it is worth noting that cryptocurrencies, in general, are highly speculative investments, and their success relies not only on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the RVN token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-06-15T16:13:42,"Kaspa Early Investors Now Flocking to Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Don’t Miss Bitcoin’s Second Coming","The post Kaspa Early Investors Now Flocking to Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Don’t Miss Bitcoin’s Second Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Kaspa was once the darling of proof-of-work maximalists. Its DAG-based structure and high-speed execution brought serious gains to those who believed early. But now, many of those same investors are pivoting fast. The destination? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a radically engineered blockchain designed not just for speed or security, but for unlocking real wealth for the everyday person. For many, it’s not just another altcoin—it’s Bitcoin’s second coming. Kaspa Had Its Run—But the Momentum Has Shifted There’s no denying Kaspa’s early promise. With block times measured in seconds and an innovative take on consensus, it drew praise from technologists and traders alike. But despite its brilliance, it’s facing limitations. Kaspa lacks a layered architecture, has no native staking, and remains too niche for widespread adoption. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is proving irresistible to those who profited from Kaspa’s rise and are now seeking the next transformative leap. With stronger architecture, a mobile-first strategy, and an entirely different approach to community growth, BTC-S is emerging as the smarter play. Bitcoin Solaris: Where Power Meets Purpose At the core of Bitcoin Solaris lies a dual-consensus model. Its Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work to maintain the Bitcoin ethos—decentralization, fairness, and security. But layered on top is the Solaris Layer, a Delegated Proof-of-Stake system that delivers 100,000 TPS and 2-second finality. Together, they form a blockchain that is: Scalable beyond legacy limits Energy-efficient, consuming 99.95% less than Bitcoin Fully ready for smart contracts and real-world utility The upcoming Solaris Nova App takes this even further, allowing users to mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones, without any need for expensive rigs or technical setup. (You can preview the rewards using this mining calculator ). Liquid Staking Built for Real Users Bitcoin Solaris goes beyond passive holding with its liquid staking system. Once staked, BTC-S tokens become sBTC-S, a fully tradable version that can still earn rewards while remaining usable in DeFi. Rewards + Liquidity in one Compatible with DeFi protocols Strengthens the network through participation Managed easily through the Solaris Nova App Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Referrals That Reward Both Sides Unlike most projects that only reward one party, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double rewards referral program . When someone joins through a referral, both the inviter and the new buyer receive 5% in BTC-S tokens automatically. Growing Buzz from Influencers and Analysts The buzz surrounding Bitcoin Solaris is impossible to ignore. A comprehensive review by 2Bit Crypto dives into why so many believe BTC-S is the only serious challenger to Bitcoin’s original mission. Meanwhile, Ben Crypto highlights its unique technical strengths and how mobile mining could redefine mass adoption. It’s not just a trend, it’s a migration. From Telegram groups to X threads, crypto enthusiasts are calling it a fresh start for people priced out of traditional mining or slow chains. Presale Demand Hits New Heights Bitcoin Solaris is now in phase 7 of its presale, with the price currently at $7 and climbing soon to $8. The launch is locked for July 31, with a $20 token price target—a potential 187% return for today’s buyers. Over 11,500+ users already joined $4.5M+ raised, gaining momentum by the day Only weeks left before the presale ends Recognized as one of the shortest and most aggressive launches in 2025 This is where Bitcoin Solaris truly shines . It’s not just about tech, it’s about access. It’s about giving everyday people a fair shot before the whales even wake up. The Final Word: Why This Matters Now Bitcoin Solaris isn’t here to replace Bitcoin. It’s here to complement it with better tools, more access, and faster pathways to growth. It carries the spirit of early Bitcoin but upgrades the infrastructure to serve today’s reality. No massive rigs, no centralized mining pools, only speed, fairness, and utility in your hands. Kaspa was a brilliant chapter. But the next chapter is already being written, and BTC-S is on the cover.

2025-06-15T16:11:59,"From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP eyes $10 as Bitcoin targets $200k, but rising memecoin LILPEPE may outshine Ripple in 2025’s bullish crypto market. Ripple is in the news again as the cryptocurrency market readies itself for a potential growth spurt. Analysts are predicting Bitcoin to surge to $200,000, which in turn would allow XRP to reach $10. They attribute this to a potent combination of positive technical indicators, institutional demand, and favorable regulations. But XRP is gaining ground. While Little Pepe, a memecoin, is gaining prominence, it is also becoming a significant player in the market. Powered by meme magic and battle-hardened blockchain engineering, LILPEPE is a breakout penny crypto that has the potential to surpass even XRP’s stellar projections in 2025. Here’s why investing in LILPEPE could be a lucrative opportunity during this meme-fueled bull market. You might also like: XRP price nears big move as RLUSD flirts with $500m milestone BTC at $200,000? XRP’s path to $10 looks real The conditions are favorable for Bitcoin to make a significant surge towards $200,000. With over $126 billion now locked into spot Bitcoin ETFs and exchange balances dwindling, the case for BTC’s 83% rise from $109K is becoming increasingly compelling. Altcoin surges historically follow a breakout to these levels, and XRP sits at the front of that wave. XRP has outperformed BTC by a massive 343% over the last 12 months. Analysts, based on projections of the XRP/BTC ratio, anticipate clear targets at $4.35 and $5, with a potential peak at $10. Add Ripple’s ongoing legal wins and increasing institutional usage as a payment solution, and there is a fundamentally strong asset with explosive potential. The meme kingdom: Why LILPEPE will shine brighter than XRP While XRP has institutional respect, LILPEPE commands the culture. The memecoin revolution has minted millionaires from mere memes. Launched on June 10, 2025, LILPEPE is revolutionizing the industry with a Layer 2 chain designed explicitly for memes, offering speed, affordability, security, and legendary status. Imagine a memecoin that doesn’t just exist on Ethereum but out-memes Ethereum itself. LILPEPE is the world’s first Layer 2 dedicated entirely to memes, with sniper-bot protection, zero tax, and a Launchpad (“Pump Pad”) tailored to launch viral meme projects straight to the moon. Why LILPEPE could dominate in 2025: Zero Tax, No Bots: Built-in sniper bot resistance ensures fair launches. Fast Finality: Transactions confirm faster than Elon tweets. Presale Still Live: Stage 1 ongoing; over $447,000 already raised at $0.001 per token. Tokenomics Made for Mooning: 100b total supply, with 26.5B allocated for presale. That’s your low-entry opportunity. CEX Listings: Plans confirmed for two top-tier exchange listings post-launch, strategically targeting the world’s biggest exchange. Buy LILPEPE with ETH or USDT via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Tokens are claimable after the presale ends; just connect a wallet and flex the memecoins. Not just another frog: The rise of the meme empire From the swamps of Solidity and the jungles of JavaScript, a small yet powerful hero emerged — Little Pepe. LILPEPE isn’t some recycled Pepe wannabe. He is the inheritor of the meme throne. With a narrative that blends web3 storytelling and community power, LILPEPE is giving rug-pulled frogs and boring Layer 2s something to cry about. Penny crypto, gigabrain potential At a token price of $0.001, LILPEPE represents the pinnacle of early adoption. This isn’t just a token floating in a pond. This is a frog equipped with a jetpack, equipped with meme magic, and backed by a community eager to take action. According to early ape whispers, if XRP outperforms Bitcoin’s rise by 10x, LILPEPE could increase 150x to 180x. And the price charts are still in infancy — this is pre-launch, pre-pump, pre-FOMO. Why settle for a 10x when the frog army is eyeing triple digits? Conclusion: All hail the meme king of 2025 Bitcoin at $200k? XRP at $10? It’s all within reach. While institutions are catching up with XRP, the most astute investors are already investing in LILPEPE, the only memecoin that boasts its Layer 2, sniper-free launches, zero tax, and a roadmap as comprehensive as a PEPE meme folder. Many projects have been started. Rug pulls, legs, and gas have burned many investors’ gains. But the present is a moment. Little Pepe is now available — small in name, powerful in meme. The presale is currently underway, with tokens soaring faster than the fervor on cryptocurrency Twitter. Don’t remain indifferent as LILPEPE transforms into the most legendary meme coin of 2025. Invest in LILPEPE today and allow the frog to lead towards a prosperous future. Let the Golden Meme Age begin. To learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website , Telegram , and X .

2025-06-15T16:10:54,"Billionaire Hedge Fund Manager Philippe Laffont Claims Bitcoin has a Good Beta Value for Portfolios","Philippe Laffont, founder of Coatue Management, attended Coinbase’s State of Crypto Summit in New York City and said that Bitcoin was becoming more attractive to institutional investors because its volatility has decreased. Laffont argued that crypto’s beta values have decreased, making digital assets like Bitcoin a key component of a modern-day portfolio. Philippe Laffont manages a tech-focused hedge fund and is interested in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin has experienced dramatic swings over time, turning off investors from buying the digital asset. Laffont was one of those investors who stayed away from Bitcoin due to its volatility. Bitcoin has surged through 2025 but has reduced its volatility over time. Laffont argues that Bitcoin has less volatility than it did years ago and may become even more attractive to future investors. Bitcoin has changed its market dynamics over time. Laffont pointed out that Bitcoin dropped 60% during 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite only dropped 33%. Conversely, Bitcoin only fell 5% in 2025 when President Trump introduced tariffs, while Nasdaq dropped 6%. The hedge fund manager believes this signifies Bitcoin’s growing maturity. Laffont also believes institutional investors drive down volatility by making informed decisions about adding Bitcoin to their portfolios. Bitcoin trades above $100k and fluctuates moderately given its high price bracket. Laffont, an experienced hedge fund manager, said that Bitcoin was once considered a speculative asset, but was now becoming more foundational, and could start to look more like a legacy market. Laffont avoided Bitcoin in the past due to how unstable it was. But now, according to Laffont, the math is changing, and the cost of getting into Bitcoin is decreasing. Laffont surmised that if the beta value of Bitcoin continues to go down, then the crypto market will become even more interesting. A beta value compares the volatility of an asset to the broader market. Coatue Management has invested in various crypto businesses, including Dune Analytics and Hut 8. Coatue specialises in technology investments, which fits the market of cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence. However, Laffont avoided crypto for some time due to issues with its underlying pricing structure. Laffont claims that he wakes up at 3 AM every night and bemoans what an ‘idiot’ he had been for not getting into crypto earlier. He asks himself over and over again why he didn’t invest more in crypto. During Laffont’s time as a hedge fund manager, he gained experience. He learned that simple ideas are much better than complicated ones regarding investment decisions. He admits that his team deliberated for years over use cases for Bitcoin and failed to see its simplistic value right before them. Laffont analysed the dynamics of Bitcoin and noticed that traders were holding their tokens for more extended periods, specifically concerning the number of traders holding tokens over one month. According to Laffont, the rate of traders selling Bitcoin after just one month has been dramatically reduced. Traders are making fewer in-and-out transactions, and are contemplating Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Traders, therefore, are treating Bitcoin more like an investment and less like a speculative asset. According to Laffont, this behavior change is changing the portfolio dynamics of digital assets. Laffont also noticed that big names were getting involved in cryptocurrencies, which was another key sign that the market was changing. He saw that BlackRock was getting involved in Bitcoin and was even playing a pivotal role in introducing crypto ETFs to the investment community. Laffont reasoned that more big names were bound to get involved after a few announced their interest in Bitcoin.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/billionaire-hedge-fund-manager-philippe-laffont-claims-bitcoin-has-a-good-beta-value-for-portfolios/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|BTCUSD|BTCUSDC|BTCUSDT|Cryptocurrency News|XBTUSD",cryptocompare

He said we’ll know when we’ve reached that moment when developers universally recognise the value of programmable dollars. Circle is the issuer of the widely used stablecoin USDC. Allaire believes that stablecoins are on the verge of being widely recognised worldwide. Allaire responded to a post by Sam Broner, partner at a16z Crypto, who stated that stablecoins improve competition and enable companies to build low-cost financial applications. Broner further commented that stablecoins allow anyone to program money, which leads to better access to economic applications. Sam Broner, partner at a16z Crypto, stated that fixed and marginal costs of creating a financial startup are now significantly cheaper due to the accessibility of stablecoins. Broner argued that stablecoins enable better competition in the FinTech market, lower product prices, and benefit the community overall. These comments by Broner and Allaire come as Walmart and Amazon plan to release their dollar-backed stablecoins . E-commerce giant Shopify announced it will integrate Circle’s USDC stablecoin by the end of 2025. There seems to be a lot of momentum gearing up behind stablecoin adoption. Allaire believes the hype is significant and indicates further progress in using stablecoins. Circle was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on June 5, jumping 165% in price due to traders buying the newfound stocks. There is a keen interest in crypto and AI companies on the stock market, adding to the speculative value of crypto stocks. Circle CEO Allaire believes the excitement has just begun and will culminate in an iPhone-like event. Stablecoins have been building momentum lately due to their practical use as a remittance medium. Tether, the largest stablecoin issuer by market capitalisation, announced on June 8 that they had no plans to create a public listing in the foreseeable future. Tether issues the stablecoin USDT and dominates the market. Paolo Ardoino, Tether CEO, said that the company will remain a private entity and will not follow suit with Circle’s IPO. As Allaire puts it, an “iPhone moment” could be just around the corner due to the amount of competition heating up around stablecoin use. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act may contribute to the breakout moment that Allaire envisions. Stablecoins are digital currencies often pegged to a real-world asset such as US dollars. Due to their underlying algorithm, stablecoins are very fast to transact and can be programmed for various purposes. Conversely, due to their high volatility, traditional cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are cumbersome to transact across borders. Stablecoins were invented to overcome Bitcoin’s limitations and attract institutional investors to the world of digital assets. The latter goal has been very successful if the current hype about stablecoins is anything to go by. There was much uncertainty surrounding using stablecoins due to the conflicting regulatory reports in America. At one stage, it was thought that stablecoins would be regulated as securities, which would have put a lot of unnecessary pressure on stablecoin issuers. The regulatory environment has changed significantly since then, and stablecoins could be on the verge of experiencing a golden age. Conversely, Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are issued by governments instead of private companies. The benefit of stablecoins is that they can be used easily by companies such as Amazon and Walmart. Circle, meanwhile, has released its stablecoin USDC on the XRP ecosystem , furthering the reach of the pegged US dollar and stablecoins in general. The move extends USDC across Ripple’s ISO accredited business services, boosting USDC’s legitimacy in the crypto market. Developers will benefit from this integration because they can utilise the stablecoin without engaging in complex bridging operations. The integration of stablecoins into major blockchain networks such as Ripple is a sign that stablecoins are on the verge of having an iPhone moment.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/circle-ceo-jeremy-allaire-predicts-stablecoins-will-have-an-iphone-moment-very-soon/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|USDT|USDC","Cryptocurrency|News|Circle|Stablecoins|USDC",cryptocompare
2025-06-15T16:00:29,"Altcoins Set To Outperform Bitcoin In The Coming Months — Blockchain Firm Explains Why","The talk around an altcoin season has been on the lips of the members of the crypto community since the start of the year. However, most altcoins have been unable to sustain any meaningful bullish momentum over the past few months. Interestingly, a market intelligence firm has come forward with the projection that these digital assets are set to outpace Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, in the coming months. Is The Altseason Around The Corner? In a June 14 post on the social media platform X, on-chain analytics platform Alphractal revealed that “something big” is about to happen with altcoins. This prediction is based on the Altcoin Dominance metric and its movement around a historically relevant support level. Alphractal’s analysis examined two Altcoin Dominance metrics: one that excluded all stablecoins and another that excluded Ethereum and all stablecoins. Historically, the former has found strong support around 25%, a level that has often served as a springboard to major altcoin rallies. As shown in the chart above, the Dominance metric fell to the 25% level before bouncing back to around 35% in 2020. Similarly, the metric declined to 24% before rallying to above 50% in 2021 — around the time of the last major altseason. As of now, the Dominance metric is around 27.91% and could be facing a potential reversal as it approaches this crucial support. Hence, there is an increased likelihood for altcoins to witness major market moves over the next few months. As for the Dominance metric — excluding ETH and stablecoins, the critical support stands around 18%. Breaching this support can be historically correlated to significant price movements that allowed altcoins to gain market share ahead of Bitcoin. Ultimately, the movement of these Dominance metrics signals that the market could be on the verge of a wave of volatility in the coming days. Alphractal mentioned that many altcoins are likely going to outperform Bitcoin in the coming months, regardless of whether the premier cryptocurrency rises or falls. The on-chain analytics firm concluded: These levels don’t guarantee the start of an Altcoin Season, but they’ve proven to be meaningful signals with a strong historical probability of leading to major market moves. Ethereum, The King Of Altcoins Ethereum still ranks as the second-largest cryptocurrency in the digital asset sector, with a market capitalization of over $302.2 billion. As of this writing, the ETH token is valued at around $2,504, reflecting a 1.6% price decline in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-set-to-outperform-bitcoin-the-coming-months/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Altcoins|Alphractal|Altcoin|altcoins|altseason|bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-15T16:00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) Fail to Rally on China-U.S. Trade Deal News, But This Coin Is Gaining Fast","Despite headlines buzzing over a new trade agreement between China and the U.S., Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) have failed to deliver the breakout many expected. But while the giants tread water, a new coin is stealing the show, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Priced at just $0.03, MUTM is rapidly gaining momentum across social media and crypto circles, with growing whispers of reaching $1 before summer ends.

2025-06-15T15:58:18,"Ripple CEO Says XRP is the Next Bitcoin. Here’s What this Means to XRP Price","In a recent broadcast from Bloomberg Live in Singapore, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reignited optimism in the XRP community by suggesting that XRP could be the “next Bitcoin.” The statement, captured in a video clip shared by crypto influencer JackTheRippler on X, has stirred renewed debate about XRP’s long-term potential, particularly its ability to rival Bitcoin in relevance, adoption, and price growth. Garlinghouse’s remarks come at a pivotal time, as Ripple continues to expand its global footprint in cross-border payments and institutional partnerships . His confident tone during the interview signals Ripple’s renewed push to solidify XRP’s role as a foundational asset for global financial infrastructure. Just a reminder that you are the lucky one holding the next #Bitcoin called #XRP ! $10,000 pic.twitter.com/UXj2WvxtMM — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) June 15, 2025 XRP’s Regulatory Advantage What sets XRP apart from many other digital assets is its regulatory positioning. Garlinghouse noted that “from the get-go, XRP has worked with regulators and regulated institutions like banks.” This emphasis on compliance is not new, but in the current climate, where regulatory uncertainty continues to cloud much of the crypto industry, it becomes increasingly crucial. Unlike Bitcoin, which was born out of a libertarian ethos of decentralization and minimal oversight, XRP has always aimed to complement the existing financial system rather than disrupt it. Ripple’s enterprise-grade payment solutions are being built in partnership with financial institutions, not in rebellion against them. This orientation toward working with regulators may help XRP scale in a manner that’s palatable to governments and banks, critical stakeholders in the trillion-dollar global payments market. The Bitcoin Comparison The Ripple CEO did not shy away from directly addressing the comparison with Bitcoin. When asked whether XRP could be the next Bitcoin, Garlinghouse responded, “If we work with the system to solve this problem, and we can solve the problem at scale —a problem measured in trillions of dollars—it is a lot of opportunity to create value in XRP.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This isn’t merely hyperbole. Ripple has long argued that global liquidity inefficiencies—especially in cross-border payments—represent a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity. XRP, as an on-chain liquidity solution, is central to Ripple’s vision for solving this. If it can indeed scale and offer settlement speeds and cost efficiencies far beyond traditional systems like SWIFT or correspondent banking networks, then the comparison to Bitcoin becomes less about ideology and more about market value. What This Means for XRP Price The speculative implications of Garlinghouse’s comments have not gone unnoticed. JackTheRippler, in sharing the clip, boldly declared: “Just a reminder that you are the lucky one holding the next Bitcoin called XRP! $10,000.” While such a price target may sound sensational to many, it underscores the long-held belief among XRP proponents that the asset remains grossly undervalued in light of its potential use cases. If XRP succeeds in becoming the liquidity layer for international payments, backed by institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and global utility, then a significant price appreciation could follow. The idea is not necessarily that XRP would copy Bitcoin’s trajectory point for point, but that it could experience a similar exponential rise driven by mainstream acceptance and institutional integration.

2025-06-15T15:24:00,"BTC stalls near $108K resistance again, yet MUTM’s momentum is turning heads","As Bitcoin (BTC) struggles once again to break through the $108,000 resistance level, investors and traders are increasingly turning their attention to projects that offer real utility and tangible returns within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Among these emerging contenders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making waves by combining innovative technology with real-yield lending models designed to reward users and active participants alike. While Bitcoin (BTC)’s price action remains uncertain, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is steadily gaining traction thanks to its unique lending options, a growing community, and a solid roadmap that promises significant developments in the near future. Understanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and its dual lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized protocol designed to facilitate lending and borrowing across a broad range of digital assets. What sets Mutuum apart is its dual approach to lending: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to deposit assets such as ETH, SOL, BTC, BNB, or AVAX into liquidity pools where they earn interest that adjusts dynamically based on borrower demand. The P2P model takes this one step further by allowing lenders to offer direct loans to other users with fully customizable terms. This option opens the door to lending assets typically unsupported by centralized platforms, such as popular memecoins Pepe (PEPE) and Dogecoin (DOGE). By enabling direct negotiations and flexible rates, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides lenders with enhanced earning potential and borrowers with access to more diverse funding sources. One of the key technical advantages Mutuum Finance (MUTM) boasts is its Layer-2 integration, which promises faster and more cost-effective transactions. Layer-2 solutions address major pain points in the DeFi world, such as network congestion and high fees, by processing transactions off the main blockchain while maintaining security. This architecture will allow Mutuum users to enjoy a seamless and efficient experience, positioning the protocol ahead of many competitors struggling with slow or expensive networks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also developing a fully decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin backed entirely by on-chain assets held within its protocol. This approach diverges from traditional stablecoins that rely on fiat reserves or centralized backing. The stablecoin will be minted algorithmically based on collateral deposited into the system, ensuring transparency and stability. By redirecting interest payments from loans into the protocol treasury, this stablecoin mechanism will further solidify Mutuum’s financial foundation and expand utility options for MUTM users. How MUTM holders benefit beyond price appreciation The native token of the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), has a total supply capped at 4 billion tokens. With over 12,000 holders and $10.55 million raised during Phase 5 of its presale at a current price of $0.03 per token, MUTM represents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking both capital appreciation and passive income. The token serves as a vehicle for earning dividends generated from protocol revenues. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to use a portion of its profits to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. This continuous buyback and redistribution cycle strengthens liquidity, incentivizes long-term holding, and applies upward demand pressure on MUTM. By staking mtTokens—tokenized representations of user deposits that accrue interest—participants gain eligibility for these passive income rewards while maintaining liquidity and flexibility. Security remains paramount in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has demonstrated commitment by completing a comprehensive CertiK audit. The manual review and static analysis process resulted in a Token Scan Score of 80.00, with the audit timeline initiated on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025. This rigorous assessment provides users with confidence in the protocol’s smart contracts and operational integrity—an important consideration for any investor or user seeking to engage with a trustworthy DeFi platform. Roadmap promises beta launch and continued growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made significant progress in its roadmap, successfully completing major elements of Phase 1, including the presale, marketing campaigns, and giveaway commencement. The team is actively working on core smart contract development, front-end and back-end infrastructure, and is preparing for the beta launch. By the time the token becomes live on exchanges, users will have access to test the beta version of the platform to explore its lending and borrowing capabilities firsthand. Alongside this, an ongoing $100,000 giveaway further stimulates community engagement and broadens awareness, encouraging more participants to discover the platform’s unique features and earn rewards early. Conclusion: a clear alternative to stalled crypto giants As the crypto market watches Bitcoin (BTC) hesitate near its resistance, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly building the foundation for sustained growth through practical use cases and community rewards. For investors seeking more than price swings—those wanting to earn passive income through a transparent and secure protocol—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a smart choice. With a solid roadmap leading to a beta platform launch, an active presale community, Layer-2 speed and cost advantages, and a comprehensive dividend model, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token. It is a functional DeFi ecosystem that rewards users and active participants alike, making it a top contender to watch closely in 2025 and beyond.

2025-06-15T15:23:08,"XRP Price Prediction: Down 2.6% This Week – Is a Reversal Brewing for XRP?","XRP declined by 2.6% this week, even as optimism over a potential settlement between Ripple and the SEC grows. Currently trading near $2.17 with a 24‑hour volume of $1.77 billion, XRP is up 0.35% today. Despite hopes for a resolution that might slash penalties and lift regulatory pressure, broader market weakness and profit-taking have kept traders cautious. Settlement Talks: Promise Meets Pushback A proposed deal would reduce Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million while dissolving the injunction. That spurred early excitement. However, Judge Analisa Torres raised doubts, asking both parties to justify why her earlier ruling should be overturned.

They’re proposing that $50 million be paid to the SEC, with the remaining funds returned… pic.twitter.com/UopQuQNG5q — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) June 12, 2025 According to attorney John Deaton, she demands “exceptional circumstances” before signing off. While Deaton believes there’s a 70% chance the settlement will gain approval, that uncertainty has kept XRP bulls on edge. Until the judge delivers a clear verdict, legal ambiguity is acting as a dampener, encouraging profit-taking and keeping traders on the sidelines. XRP Supported Amid Market Headwinds and Technical Standstill Despite the legal backdrop, broader crypto indices are weak. Regulatory worries and mixed sentiment have outweighed XRP’s long-term potential. Technically, the token seems to be in a consolidation phase: A descending trendline defies rallies at around $2.28–$2.29 XRP stays under the 50-period EMA near $2.20 Support is forming between $2.10 and $2.14, suggesting underlying buyer interest XRP/USD Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Momentum is gradually turning mixed-to-bullish. The MACD histogram is advancing toward neutral, and recent spinning–top candles highlight indecision rather than decisive downward action. Notably, XRP hasn’t produced bearish formations like the “Three Black Crows,” which suggests sellers are not firmly in control. This sets the stage for a potential breakout if buyers gain conviction. XRP Trade Plan Here’s a short-term XRP price prediction : Bullish Trigger: Look for a 4‑hour candle closing above $2.20 and the downward trendline Targets: First at $2.285, then extended to $2.338 Stop-loss: Just below the recent swing low near $2.145 Bearish Option: A drop below $2.145 could open the door to a $2.086 test Final Take XRP’s modest slide this week reflects the tug-of-war between doubt and opportunity. While settlement chatter fuels optimism, technical indicators remain range-bound. The catalyst could come from a decisive move above the 50‑EMA and $2.20, potentially paving the way for a rally to $2.29–$2.34. Conversely, a breakdown below $2.145 would likely lead to a retest of $2.09. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With XRP trading near $2.17, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,141,005.09 out of its $8,216,177 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply.

2025-06-15T15:02:36,"Stakeholders express concern over Brazil's new tax rule","All crypto investors in Brazil now have to pay tax on their profits after the government removed the tax exemption for small crypto holders. With the move, crypto holders must now pay a flat 17.5% rate on their monthly profits. The resolution is part of Provisional Measure 1303 from the country’s Ministry of Finance as part of the government’s effort to raise revenue. Before its implementation, investors who sold up to 35,000 Brazilian Real ($6,300) digital assets within a month did not have to pay tax. In contrast, those who sold above got taxed progressively, varying between 15% and 22.5%. However, the new flat rate of 17.5% means that everyone will pay the same amount regardless of the value of their transactions. This represents a positive development for largeholders, while smallholders may have to deal with the tax burden. Interestingly, crypto was not the only one affected by the new rule. Fixed-income securities were also affected as the government has imposed a 5% tax on the previously tax-free financial products. The tax on betting revenue also increased from 12% to 18%. Under the rule, taxation assessment will be done quarterly instead of monthly, as is currently the case with investors able to offset losses from the previous five quarters. Concerns from stakeholders about the impact of new tax rules Meanwhile, the new tax regime has attracted concerns from crypto stakeholders, many of whom believe that it could force many investors to opt for exchanges and brokers that do not have headquarters in the country so they can avoid the tax burden. According to Brazil-based crypto news outlet Portal do Bitcoin, crypto exchange Mercado Bitcoin questioned the reasoning behind the new rule in a public statement, noting that policymakers failed to engage with industry stakeholders before announcing the rules. It said: “The decisions were made hastily, without dialogue with the sector and without technical basis, even generating doubts about its legality.” The exchange further noted that the rules would make the Brazilian crypto sector less competitive. Thus, it is expected that the country’s legislature, the National Congress, will still review the rules, and the government will engage industry participants. Unsurprisingly, other crypto organizations also seem to agree with this. Advocacy groups such as the Brazilian Association of Cryptoeconomics and The Brazilian Association of Fintechs agree that the decision is a setback for the country’s crypto sector. They noted that the rules would likely make investors opt for offshore and non-compliant platforms or alternative financial products exempt from the tax. Such moves may not just weaken the market but could also expose investors to more risks. Interestingly, the crypto bank Bitybank said that the rule contradicts the consultative efforts of the Brazilian Central Bank. Even more of a concern is the complexity of this new rule for the crypto sector because it would affect most investors. According to Boost Research CEO Andre Franco, many investors would be confused because of the changes as they may not know how to calculate their taxes. Brazil lawmaker file decree to annul the Provisional Measure Unsurprisingly, some pro-crypto legislators have started opposing the bill. One such lawmaker, Deputy Gustavo Gayer, has already filed a legislative decree to annul the new rules, according to local media reports . Gayer claimed the Provisional Measure exceeds the powers of the Executive and contravenes the country’s tax system because there was no approval from the legislature. He also noted that taxes on crypto assets create legal uncertainty at a time when the sector is awaiting government regulation. He said: “The imposition of taxes on crypto assets and the creation of new tax obligations without due legislative discussion, without a broad technical debate and without the participation of the affected parties, compromises the predictability and transparency of the tax system.” Meanwhile, the Chamber of Deputies has reportedly warned that Provisional Measure 1303 will not be approved until a substantial change shows the Executive is more committed to cutting expenses.

2025-06-15T15:00:00,"Litecoin price forms bullish flag as LTC ETF odds jumps","Litecoin has pulled back in the past month, erasing its gains after bottoming in April. Litecoin ( LTC ) was trading at $85.98 on Sunday, down by almost 20% from its highest point in May. This pullback has mirrored that of other altcoins like Cardano ( ADA ) and Chainlink ( LINK ). Litecoin has pulled back despite data showing that the odds of the Securities and Exchange Commission approving a LTC ETF have jumped to 76%. The probability that the agency will approve the ETF is high because it is a proof-of-work cryptocurrency like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Its main difference from Bitcoin is its supply limit of 84 million coins, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. You might also like: Bitcoin price eyes multi-year breakout as ETF inflows hit $1.3 billion Therefore, since the SEC has already approved Bitcoin ETFs, there is a good chance it will do the same for Litecoin. An LTC ETF approval would be good for the coin since it would likely lead to more inflows from American investors. Another potential catalyst for LTC price is that whales have continued accumulating it. Santiment data shows that the accounts holding between 100,000 and 1 million tokens have increased their holdings from 25.8 million on April 15 to 27.8 million today. Further data shows that Litecoin’s social dominance has pointed upwards in the past few days, a sign that it is attracting attention from social media users. It rose to 0.734% from 0.512%. LTC whales and social dominance | Source: Santiment Litecoin price technical analysis LTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the LTC price dropped to $63.30 in April and then bounced back to $106.72 as the crypto market rally happened. Recently, however, it has pulled back and moved below the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages. Falling below that level is a sign that bears have prevailed. Litecoin price has formed a bullish flag chart pattern, a popular continuation sign. This pattern comprises of a vertical line, which in this case starts at $63.29 and ends at $106.72. It is now forming the flag section in the form of a descending channel. Therefore, Litecoin price will likely rebound, and initially target the resistance at $106.7, which is up by 25% from the current level. A climb above that resistance will point to more gains, potentially to $140, the highest swing in January and February this year.

2025-06-15T14:51:00,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Solana ETF Approvals Predicted To Be Closer Than Ever","Exchange-traded fund headlines have always injected fresh electricity into the crypto market. Every new filing hints at deeper capital and a stronger seal of legitimacy than retail enthusiasm alone can provide. The latest catalyst is Solana. On 13 June, the Securities and Exchange Commission quietly asked a cluster of heavyweight issuers to submit refreshed S1 documents for proposed spot Solana funds, a move many analysts interpret as an informal green light to keep the process moving. When the same regulator that only recently waved Bitcoin products through begins reviewing another chain, it shows that digital assets are no longer a single-coin story. Hope for a broader institutional embrace has returned just as prices struggle under geopolitical stress. Solana’s ETF Moment Could Set the Altcoin Market on Fire Within a short window, some of the largest names in asset management delivered updated filings for spot Solana ETFs. Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and even Canary all appeared on the list. These aren’t speculative newcomers. These are firms with decades of institutional reach now attempting to wrap Solana into something Wall Street can trade with a click. More importantly, this round of filings includes a serious feature: staking. That opens up the possibility of Solana ETFs not only tracking price but also generating native yield. UPDATE: Multiple stories broke the news earlier this week that the SEC had reached out to issuers requesting them to submit updated documents for their Solana ETFs & to include staking. As of 5 PM EST we have 6 of the 7 hopeful Solana ETF issuers that have submitted those S-1's pic.twitter.com/WqPI2jf2CW — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 13, 2025 It’s a striking change in tone. Until recently, the assumption was that altcoin-based ETFs were still years away. Now it feels like the floodgates could open, and Solana is first in line. The impact of that is not limited to just SOL. Whenever fresh institutional money enters a major chain, the effects bleed into everything that operates in its orbit: meme tokens, infrastructure projects, and DeFi applications. Add to that the growing chatter around companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring stablecoins for real-world utility. These aren’t just theoretical discussions. Blockchain is being scouted for high-volume commercial use, and if that materializes, Solana stands as one of the top contenders to support it. The network is fast, relatively low-cost, and already trending among developers. All of this builds a perfect backdrop. Solana’s possible ETF approval might not just lift one asset. It might ignite the next rotation. And if that happens, the smartest bets may be on what moves next, not just what moves first. Best Crypto to Buy Now – Altcoins Worth Checking Out Solaxy Solaxy is a layer two ledger created to relieve pressure on both Solana and Ethereum. Validators collect thousands of user interactions, compress them into a single proof, and post that proof to whichever base chain the sender prefers. Fees drop to almost nothing and finality settles in roughly one second. Developers keep the familiar Solana programming model, so migrations involve only a change of endpoint instead of a full rewrite. A portion of every network fee moves to a burn address, reducing supply as volume grows. Proposed Solana exchange-traded funds could send unprecedented traffic through the chain, and stress tests show that Solaxy absorbs those bursts without raising costs. Large desks can route trades through Solaxy, rebalance across chains, and settle on their chosen ledger while retaining the trust guarantees of each base network. It's now clear... NOTHING can slow $SOLX down. 🛸🪐49M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/uEFZXiROcQ — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 13, 2025 Having raised close to a whopping $50 million, SOLX, the native token of the project, is likely to go live across multiple exchanges very soon. The same mechanism lets consumer apps confirm in-game asset changes instantly yet still anchor ownership on a public ledger. With a live validator set, auditable throughput, and a supply curve that tightens whenever volume rises, Solaxy offers a direct line to any institutional wave that follows the first Solana fund approval. Snorter Snorter operates inside Telegram, the same chat windows traders already use each day. The bot monitors new liquidity pools on Solana, checks bytecode against a risk engine that screens for honeypots, and fires orders if the token passes. The entire cycle finishes in about a second, so users often enter before price trackers even list the pair. Preferences live locally, and keys never leave the owner’s wallet. Experienced scouts can publish playbooks for followers who mirror trades automatically, paying a portion of realised profit to the strategist. That fee flows to token stakers who keep servers online and fund recurring audits, creating an ecosystem where every role earns something. The project’s theme itself is exciting too, since it features an aardvark which, as the name suggests, sorts and finds out gems and opportunities for investors to make more profits. A creative use of design elements like this is often what intrigues and attracts attention, something that the developers have managed to understand and apply strategically. A Solana ETF wave would draw more builders and traders, and Snorter is prepared for that surge. It already aggregates pool data from Orca and Raydium, with Ethereum and Base support scheduled next month. A recent audit financed by the Solana Foundation cleared critical issues, giving newcomers confidence that orders route safely. For anyone who wants speed and security in the same interface, Snorter turns Telegram into a launchpad instead of a chat room. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper delivers the speed of the Solana Virtual Machine to the world’s oldest blockchain without surrendering Bitcoin’s security principles. The process begins when a user deposits native bitcoin into a monitored address. A relay contract written for Solana’s runtime then checks the incoming block headers and transaction proofs. Once verification passes, an equal amount of wrapped bitcoin appears on the Bitcoin Hyper network, ready for transfers that confirm almost immediately. Activity on this layer two does not remain in isolation. Transactions batch into concise proofs, and every cycle a summary of network state returns to Bitcoin’s first layer, anchoring the ledger in familiar proof-of-work territory. Withdrawals simply reverse the path. A request on the faster rail instructs the canonical bridge to unlock the original coins, so custody never leaves the user’s control. The native token forms the system’s economic engine. Guardians who watch for double spend collect it as payment, liquidity providers earn it for keeping channels full, and stakers receive a share of network fees while also voting on upgrades. Current distribution allocates 30% to ongoing development, 25% to a treasury for expansion, and the remainder across marketing, exchange listings, and community rewards. An audit by Coinsult has already cleared the codebase, easing common concerns around new infrastructure. The project has been recommended as a top token worthy of consideration by leading crypto-based publication websites and creators like Cilinix Crypto , among others. Roughly $1.2 million has entered the current presale stage already and is likely to fill soon before the next price advance. That early traction arrives at a moment when spot Solana funds are inching toward approval. If institutional traders gain regulated access to Solana, they will also seek rapid pathways between bitcoin pairs. Bitcoin Hyper provides that route today, marrying the liquidity of the flagship asset with a settlement speed that aligns with modern markets. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token powers a multi-chain crypto wallet built for users who need both simplicity and serious control. It connects to over sixty networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and even lesser-known EVM chains, with balances, NFTs, and positions all visible in one unified dashboard. The design feels more like a banking super app than a traditional wallet, yet everything remains fully self-custodial. You hold the keys, and the interface never cuts corners on privacy. The utility of the token runs throughout the experience. It governs staking tiers, unlocks early access to high-interest pools, and secures the smart contract modules that power everything from swaps to analytics. One of its most unique features is the Upcoming Tokens tab, which is an in-app portal that curates trending presales and early launches before they go mainstream. This section is already becoming a magnet for both retail and influencers looking for signal over noise. Where this wallet starts to stand apart is its positioning around the incoming ETF wave. If institutional interest widens the crypto funnel, retail users will demand a platform that simplifies everything without limiting what they can do. Best Wallet is designed to be that bridge. Its layered security uses social recovery, local encryption, and smart contract backup options, all working quietly in the background. The project recently earned a spotlight in the New York Post, which profiled it as a rare case of a wallet that balances intuitive design with advanced functionality. That kind of mainstream attention often arrives late in a cycle. This time, it may have landed right on cue. Conclusion Institutional doors do not swing open often, yet every sign now points to a wider entryway for crypto. The request for Solana fund prospectuses hints at a future where regulated products track more than one flagship asset. Each new filing raises the odds that deep capital will pour across the broader market, rewarding networks that prove they can handle real volume under pressure. Investors who position early could benefit from the momentum that usually follows a landmark approval, while those who wait may find themselves paying a premium for the same exposure. Projects mentioned above may be worth checking out, alongside similar altcoins which may hold 10x potential or more in the coming weeks or months.

2025-06-15T14:48:11,"Bitcoin-Backed Loans Unlock Real Estate Market for Crypto-Rich Investors","Bitcoin-Backed Loans Open Door for Property Purchasers Increasingly, Bitcoin holders are leveraging crypto-backed loans to purchase property—without losing a single satoshi or paying capital gains tax. “It’s becoming more mainstream by the day,” declared Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of cryptocurrency lender Ledn. “Early adopters, entrepreneurs, high-net-worth crypto investors who don’t necessarily qualify for traditional lending—this is how they’re gaining access to property.” How It Works: No Sale, No Tax Bitcoin-backed lending allows clients to borrow against their BTC holdings—typically a 50% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio—and be paid back in fiat or stablecoins. Since lending is not considered taxable in most jurisdictions, clients get access to liquidity while still being subject to potential gains in the price of BTC. “Borrowing against your Bitcoin as collateral does not usually trigger capital gains tax because you are not selling your Bitcoin,” Di Bartolomeo said. Quick Funding, Flexible Terms Funding of the loan is fast, with a minimum of just 9.6 hours using Ledn. The loans are used by borrowers either as a deposit or to purchase property outright. There are no monthly repayments; interest accumulates over time and borrowers are free to repay at any time without incurring a penalty—if the LTV is limited below 60%. If Bitcoin increases in value, one can withdraw excess collateral. But if BTC declines and the LTV reaches 80%, the lender auto-liquidates sufficient BTC to repay the loan, keeping the transaction safe while letting the borrower retain the property. No Credit Check, Only Bitcoin Unlike conventional lenders, crypto lenders such as Ledn do not perform credit checks. Having 2:1 collateral provides lenders with assurance, particularly as Bitcoin is traded 24/7 and provides extensive liquidity. “Bitcoin is the world’s cleanest collateral,” Di Bartolomeo stated. During Q1 2025, Ledn disbursed more than $300 million worth of retail loans and is projected to reach more than $1 billion by the end of the year. In 2024 alone, customers allegedly withdrew more than 1,000 BTC as excess collateral due to increasing prices—far exceeding what they paid in interest. They prefer this method in order to acquire hard assets such as property without selling their top-performing investment. “They want to invest in a new property without selling their Bitcoin,” Di Bartolomeo said. Demand Surges Among High-Net-Worth Crypto Owners Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca also testified in May that BTC holders are becoming more and more at ease with taking advantage of crypto as collateral. Xapo began lending against BTC with a maximum $1 million USD loan in March.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 670,400 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin treasury companies will be the source of tremendous selling pressure in the next bear market. Data from BitcoinTreasuries shows that private and public companies across the globe hold 1,112,904 BTC worth more than $117.445 billion at time of writing. Says DonAlt, “Bitcoin treasury companies… will be the reason for the next bear market being as violent as prior bear markets, and no one can convince me otherwise. Good Ponzi while they’re going though so keep going.” According to DonAlt, the next Bitcoin bear market could be as devastating as the one witnessed in 2018 when BTC collapsed from $20,000 to $3,000. “Whatever the top ends up being, 70-80% down from that would be my guess.” While DonAlt sees a crippling Bitcoin bear market once BTC tops out this cycle, he remains bullish on the crypto king for now. In a new strategy session, he says that a Bitcoin move below a key support level could trigger an over 11% correction from current levels. “If we set a new low below $101,000, I could easily see us wipe towards $95,000 if not $90,000 pretty quickly.” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,438.

2025-06-15T14:30:19,"Bitcoin Golden Cross Incoming, But Tensions Threaten Breakout","Bitcoin is still trying to regain short-term bullish momentum, as shown by its price action in the past 24 hours. After briefly slipping below $104,500, the cryptocurrency bounced back to trade above $106,000, and technical analysis now shows a technical formation that could cause the start of a more extended rally. Interestingly, as seen in the daily Ichimoku chart shared by analyst Titan of Crypto, Bitcoin is currently on the verge of confirming a golden cross, which is a bullish signal, within the coming days. Related Reading: Billionaire Snaps Up $100 Million Of Trump Coin – Details Ichimoku Cloud Builds Case For Bullish Breakout Taking to the social media platform X, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted the recent daily price close above the Tenkan line as a strong technical signal for Bitcoin. The Tenkan, also known as the conversion line, is an intriguing indicator for short-term trend strength in Ichimoku analysis. According to the analyst, the current setup on Bitcoin’s daily chart shows the conditions aligning for a golden cross where the shorter-term average overtakes the longer-term one, which is a potential long-term bullish shift. This crossover, if confirmed, would be one of the most reliable trend-reversal patterns in technical trading. Right now, Bitcoin’s price action is consolidating around $105,000. However, if this golden cross does play out well, Bitcoin could attempt another run toward the key resistance level around $111,600. However, current geopolitical instability, especially the rising tensions in the Middle East, could disrupt this technical picture at any moment and cause a reassessment of the bullish outlook. Image From X: Titan of Crypto Support And Whale Activity Clash With Bullish Setup Despite the bullish technical backdrop, other market signals are flashing warnings for Bitcoin. Notably, analyst Ali Martinez identified $104,124 as an important support level for Bitcoin. This price point is not just arbitrary, as it represents a heavy concentration of UTXO realized prices. Many investors bought in at that level, and if Bitcoin falls below it, the next likely destination could be $97,405. The URPD chart confirms that the safety net between $104,000 and $97,000 is somewhat thin. This means that once $104,000 is breached to the downside, a swift and steep correction could follow due to the lack of strong buying interest in that gap. Image From X: Ali_charts Further complicating the picture is the behavior of large Bitcoin holders. On-chain data shows that some of the biggest whales, addresses holding over 1,000 BTC, have started reducing their holdings in recent days. This decline in whale wallet count initially began shortly after Bitcoin reached its new all-time high of $111,800 on May 22. The reduction in whale count resumed again after Bitcoin was rejected at the $110,000 region early last week. Image From X: Ali_charts Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection As such, whale addresses holding over 1,000 BTC have fallen from a recent peak of 2,114 to a recent reading of 2,094 addresses.

2025-06-15T14:28:42,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Investor Snaps Up $127 Million in ETH – Contrarian Play?","Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,540, buoyed by a dramatic $127 million whale purchase of 48,825 ETH at an average price of nearly $2,605. This savvy move, especially during a recent dip triggered by geopolitical unrest and options expiry, reveals long-term confidence from large-scale buyers. Notably, this whale previously netted $30 million in Ethereum profits, suggesting a data-driven strategy. Crypto markets took a hit after escalating tensions in the Middle East rattled risk assets. ETH fell nearly 0.75% in 24 hours, reaching $2,524, as over 242,000 ETH in Deribit options expired, contributing to increased volatility.

(@MasterArborists) June 13, 2025 The put-call ratio stood at 1.20, with maximum pain around $2,700, indicating a bearish position bias. However, the whale purchase serves as a counterweight, supporting sentiment and offering a confidence boost amid uncertainty. Ethereum Technical Setup: Tight Range Between EMAs Ethereum’s price prediction remains neutral as the cryptocurrency consolidates in a critical price range between its 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level ($2,518) and the descending 50-period exponential moving average (EMA) ($2,580) on the 2-hour chart. The appearance of a Doji candle near the Fibonacci line highlights short-term indecision. While ETH broke through a rising wedge, prompting a sell-off, momentum indicators are quietly shifting. Ethereum Price Chart – Source: Tradingview MACD lines are converging toward a bullish crossover RSI is low, near 29, hinting at oversold conditions No multiple-candle bearish patterns like “Three Black Crows” Although ETH traded below its 20-day, 50-day, and 100-day EMAs, there is growing potential for a bounce if it can reclaim the $2,550–$2,580 range. Failure to do so could drag prices toward $2,440 and possibly $2,300, but renewed buying momentum might unlock higher targets. Ethereum Trade Plan: Balance Risk and Reward For those new to trading, here’s a simple and straightforward trade setup based on current chart activity and whale behavior: Bullish Scenario (Buy-the-Dip): Entry : Close above 38.2% Fib at ~$2,568 and 50-EMA Stop-loss : Just below today’s low (~$2,500) Targets : $2,607 (50% Fib), then $2,647 (61.8% Fib) Bearish Scenario (Breakdown Play): Entry : Close below trendline and $2,518 Stop-loss : Above $2,540 Target : $2,440, with downside risk toward $2,300 This balanced plan positions you for upside precision and downside protection. Final Take: Ethereum sits at a pivotal point, technical indicators suggest a pause after recent losses, but whale buying hints at sustained interest. A breakout above approximately $2,580 could pave the way for prices to reach $2,650–$2,700. Conversely, failure to hold current support might lead to pressure dropping to $2,440. Watch those zones closely and manage risk accordingly. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Ethereum trading near $2,547, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) .

The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 58% APY staking pool holding over 1.81 billion tokens, offering: The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income.

2025-06-15T14:20:00,"Forget Just Gold, Bitcoin Is Coming for $30T Bond Market Too: Bitwise CEO","Bitcoin’s potential as a store-of-value asset now extends beyond the gold market, according to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley. Key Takeaways: Bitcoin is now seen as competing with both gold and U.S. Treasuries as a store-of-value asset. Bitwise CEO says the $30 trillion Treasury market is part of Bitcoin’s total addressable market. Mounting US debt and fiscal instability are driving investor interest toward crypto alternatives. In a recent post on X , Horsley argued that the $30 trillion U.S. Treasury market, traditionally seen as a safe haven by institutions and bondholders, should also be considered part of Bitcoin’s total addressable market. “The opportunity for Bitcoin isn’t just gold; it is the $30 trillion-plus using Treasuries as a store of value,” Horsley wrote Friday, adding to growing sentiment that Bitcoin is emerging as an alternative to legacy financial instruments once considered risk-free. Bitwise CEO: Bitcoin Joins Gold, Silver as Flight-to-Safety Asset The comment came in response to economist Mohamed El-Erian, who warned that U.S. Treasury flows are no longer a reliable indicator of flight-to-safety behavior. Instead, El-Erian pointed to gold and silver as the new barometers. But for crypto proponents like Horsley, Bitcoin belongs in that same category, offering protection against inflation, geopolitical instability, and systemic risk. Recent macro conditions appear to support that shift. Soaring government debt, fiscal deficits, and monetary uncertainty are eroding trust in fiat-based financial instruments. In the U.S., President Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” is expected to add roughly $2.5 trillion to the national deficit, pushing the total debt load toward $37 trillion. Critics, including tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and former government officials, have raised alarms over the sustainability of current spending levels. The opportunity for Bitcoin isn't just gold. It's the $30T+ using Treasuries as a store of value. https://t.co/xOHG2NkPg0 — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) June 13, 2025 April 2025 saw a sharp bond market correction, as investors reacted to new tariffs and swelling deficits by selling off U.S. government securities. Amid that flight from bonds, Bitcoin has seen renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors seeking shelter in a digitally scarce asset that isn’t tied to government policy. The narrative is evolving. Bitcoin is no longer just a hedge against inflation or an alternative to gold, it’s positioning itself as a long-term counterweight to sovereign debt risk. Asia’s Billionaires Shift From U.S. Dollar to Bitcoin, Gold Asia’s wealthiest investors are moving away from the U.S. dollar and increasingly turning to Bitcoin, gold, and Chinese assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and market volatility. In May, UBS executive Amy Lo said that ultra-rich clients now allocate over 15% of their portfolios to crypto and precious metals. With Asia’s wealth management market expected to grow from $20.7 trillion to $37 trillion by 2029, the trend signals a major realignment in global capital flows. A 2024 Aspen Digital study found that 76% of Asia’s family offices and high-net-worth individuals now hold digital assets, up from 58% in 2022. Singapore leads the crypto charge, with over half of wealthy investors planning to increase their holdings in the next two years. Many have doubled their crypto allocations to over 10% of their portfolios, treating Bitcoin as a hedge similar to gold during past financial crises.

2025-06-15T14:00:00,"Cryptocurrency Prices Fluctuate While Bitcoin Solaris Guarantees 187% Returns for Presale Investors","This week, the crypto market responded to escalating geopolitical tension and liquidity rotation. Bitcoin fell nearly 4%, Ethereum and Solana dipped more than 8%, and the total market cap slid by over $250 billion. Barron’s reports that gold, not crypto, is attracting flight-to-safety flows. The Economic Times links this drop directly to renewed conflict and market stress. While price dips dominate headlines, a growing cohort of investors is moving capital into assets with clear frameworks, capped supply, and meaningful participation models. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris enters the picture — a protocol quietly offering structure in a market often ruled by speculation. Scarcity That’s Locked, Not Leveraged Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) follows the same foundational limit that gave Bitcoin its power: a maximum of 21 million tokens. But unlike most presale models, Solaris doesn’t leave room for manipulation after launch. There are no token printing functions, no inflation-based emissions, and no surprise unlocks. Only 4.5 million tokens, 20% of total supply are reserved for presale across all phases. Early buyers could see massive gains at the projected $20 exchange listing: even now in phase 7 at $7, presale participants are still positioned for an expected 186% return. These figures aren’t abstract — they’re derived directly from the stated public benchmarks and token supply math. Participation Without Barriers The typical mining story begins with capital: GPUs, rigs, validators, locked capital in staking pools. Bitcoin Solaris breaks that mold. Its mobile-native infrastructure allows BTC-S to be mined using smartphones. Not through gimmicks, but by contributing real computing resources to idle CPU and storage through the upcoming Nova App, tested in beta and now rolling out. What this unlocks is user access that doesn’t depend on wealth or technical skills. Earning BTC-S becomes something thousands can do while the phone sits unused — making crypto yield part of daily life, not a speculative gamble. Performance That Matches the Pitch Bitcoin Solaris isn’t selling future deliverables. Its dual-layer blockchain architecture is already operational. At the base, Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity deliver secure validation. The Solaris Layer stacks on top with Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time — enabling over 10,000 transactions per second, confirmed in under two seconds, using 99.95% less energy than legacy models. This isn’t a roadmap. These are tested outputs that redefine what accessibility in crypto infrastructure can mean. Security That’s Verified, Not Promised BTC-S stands out as one of the few early-stage projects with independent audits from day one. Cyberscope completed a full audit of its smart contract logic. Freshcoins reviewed its mobile mining backend. The team behind the project has undergone KYC verification , confirming their identities and roles. In an environment filled with anonymous wallets and speculative launches, this level of transparency offers something much rarer: accountability. Analyst Signals Confirm Market Interest Crypto researcher and influencer Ben Crypto released an in-depth breakdown this month, comparing Bitcoin Solaris’s architecture and incentive system to Bitcoin’s early days — not in branding, but in structure. He highlighted that a fixed supply paired with permissionless earning access gives BTC-S a path to organic adoption not seen since Bitcoin itself gained traction post-2012. The community response reflects that confidence. More than 11,500 wallets have participated, and over $4.5 million has been raised without private rounds, venture allocations, or whitelist-only manipulation. The Final Window Is Narrowing Phase 7 is active, with BTC-S priced at $7. That presale window closes soon. After this, public listings are expected to begin around $20, with liquidity incentives and mining competition ramping up significantly. Waiting means paying more. It also means entering a much more competitive yield environment. For those still on the sidelines, there’s a very real choice to make: join the protocol while participation is affordable or watch from the outside once market attention drives exposure.

2025-06-15T14:00:00,"Chart of the Week: Bitcoin's Summer Lull Still Offers 'Inexpensive' Trading Opportunity","""Hey bitcoin, Do Something!"" The viral meme — starring a stick figure poking the ground and depicting a need for reaction — might just sum up the current scene at digital assets trading desks during the slow, early summer days. Sure, bitcoin BTC just hit new fresh highs and is still trading above $100,000, but the P&L is diminishing daily for short-term volatility chasers. ""Bitcoin’s volatility has continued to trend lower, both in realized and implied measures, even as the asset reaches new all-time highs. This decline in volatility is particularly notable amid historically high price levels,"" said NYDIG Research in a recent note shared with CoinDesk. And despite macro and geopolitical headwinds hitting traditional assets hard, bitcoin has gone into a chill summer vibe . ""With the market now entering the typically quieter summer months, this downtrend may well persist in the near term,"" NYDIG added. Of course, this is perhaps a positive trend for bitcoin as it depicts a more maturing market and potentially speaks to its original promise of ""store of value,"" as the price reaches fresh new highs. However, traders love volatility, as the greater the movement, the bigger the P&L opportunities are. While fresh record highs might be great for long-term HODLers, for short-term traders, those juicy breakouts are getting hard to make money on. Why the calm? So what's driving these calm price actions? NYDIG is chalking it up to increased demand from bitcoin treasury companies, which seem to be popping up everywhere, and a rise in sophisticated trading strategies, such as options overwriting, as well as other forms of volatility selling. The market is getting more professional, and unless we see some true Black Swan events (FTX, anyone?) for crypto, prices will continue to remain calm. The opportunity But all is not lost — there are always opportunities to make money even when it's not as lucrative as it seems. ""The decline in volatility has made both upside exposure through calls and downside protection via puts relatively inexpensive,"" said NYDIG. Translation: Hedging and catalyst-driven plays are where the money might be in this market. If one thinks something big is coming, this is perhaps the time to position with directional bets. And there are a few big ones coming. ""For traders anticipating market-moving catalysts, such as the SEC’s decision on the GDLC conversion (July 2), the conclusion of the 90-day tariff suspension (July 8), or the Crypto Working Group’s findings deadline (July 22), this presents a cost-effective opportunity to position for directional moves,"" said NYDIG. So bitcoin's summer lull might not be a total dead zone; rather, it's a setup for those who are willing to play the patience game and hedge accordingly to trade potential market-moving events.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/15/chart-of-the-week-bitcoin-s-summer-lull-still-offers-inexpensive-trading-opportunity,"BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|RESEARCH","Markets|Bitcoin|Options|Hedging|Trading|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T13:28:10,"Experts predict when quantum computers will break Bitcoin’s encryption","Recent advances in quantum computing have reignited concerns about the security of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ). Most notably, IBM (NYSE: IBM ) plans to launch the world’s first fault-tolerant quantum computer, IBM Quantum Starling, by 2029, a major leap from today’s error-prone machines. As these developments unfold, experts are debating when quantum technology might break Bitcoin’s cryptographic defenses, specifically, its elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and SHA-256 hashing, which secure wallets and transactions. In this context, Finbold has gathered expert insights on when quantum computing could threaten Bitcoin. Craig Gidney In May 2025, Google quantum researcher Craig Gidney warned that the timeline might be shorter than expected. His findings revealed that breaking RSA encryption may require 20 times fewer quantum resources than previously estimated. While Bitcoin doesn’t use RSA, it does rely on ECC, which, like RSA, can be broken by Shor’s algorithm. Although Gidney didn’t directly mention Bitcoin, his research targeted encryption methods that underpin crypto wallets and, in some cases, transactions. He suggested a potential threat window between 2030 and 2035, depending on advancements in error correction. “I estimate that a 2048-bit RSA integer could be factored in under a week by a quantum computer with fewer than one million noisy qubits,” Gidney wrote. Adam Black In contrast, Adam Back, an early Bitcoin adopter and CEO of Blockstream, remains more cautious. In April 2025, he argued that quantum computers likely won’t pose a serious threat for at least two decades. Still, he acknowledged that future breakthroughs could force holders to migrate their coins to quantum-resistant addresses, including possibly Satoshi Nakamoto’s untouched stash, which could reveal whether the mysterious founder is still alive. David Carvalho Meanwhile, in a June 2025 opinion published by Cointelegraph , David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol, issued a more urgent warning. He claimed that quantum computers could crack Bitcoin within five years unless it quickly upgrades its cryptography. Carvalho specifically pointed to the emergence of technologies like Microsoft’s Majorana chip as a sign that powerful quantum systems are already on the horizon. According to him, about 30% of Bitcoin is currently stored in vulnerable addresses, and a single breach could shatter the trust built over the network’s 16-year history. “A breach would be catastrophic for holders, whose funds would be gone forever, and the ecosystem at large. It would prove that the unbreakable system can be broken. That’s why BlackRock recently acknowledged the threat of quantum to Bitcoin in its updated spot ETF filing. That’s why the time to act is now, before it’s too late,” he said. Chamath Palihapitiya Similarly, back in December 2024, as reported by Finbold, billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya cautioned that Bitcoin’s SHA-256 encryption might be broken within two to five years due to the pace of quantum progress. His warning came after Google unveiled its 105-qubit Willow chip, which was viewed as a significant milestone. He estimated that around 8,000 such chips could potentially break Bitcoin’s encryption. While scaling to that level remains a major hurdle, Palihapitiya urged blockchain developers to start reworking hashing algorithms now. Ultimately, the quantum threat to Bitcoin hinges on creating fault-tolerant quantum computers with millions of qubits, a milestone that’s still years away.

2025-06-15T13:20:45,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Holds Above $105,000 Despite Selling Pressure","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a second consecutive day, with the price down 0.52% as it struggles to stay above $105,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $104,951. BTC lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $110,355 thanks to macroeconomic factors and escalating geopolitical tensions after Israel struck key targets in Iran. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Could Become A Challenge Roxom Global CEO Borja Martel Seward has warned that when the Bitcoin bull market ends, a bearish phase could cause several Bitcoin treasury companies to struggle. Bitcoin has charted its own course despite growing macroeconomic uncertainties impacting the traditional and crypto markets. According to Seward, Bitcoin operates to its own “beating drum rhythm,” operating as an independent and contrarian asset in an economy dealing with cooling Fed rate cut expectations, quantitative tightening, US Treasury General Account replenishment, and potential Bank of Japan rate hikes. “Bitcoin goes at its own pace, bitcoin is independent, bitcoin has its own cycles.” Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are experiencing a bull run, which Seward believes could continue for a few months. Several other proponents of the asset, including Tim Draper, echoed the sentiment, asserting that Bitcoin could surge to new highs by the end of 2025. However, Seward cautioned against Bitcoin and crypto, stating, “Eventually, the bull market will finish. We will enter into a more bearish phase. This euphoria, this mania will dissipate. Some companies will go underwater, and the market structure will reset.” The warning comes amid a growing trend of public and private companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. The trend was pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which has become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . According to Seward, these companies' adoption of Bitcoin presents a unique dynamic for upcoming market shifts. “We will have to see how what today right now is a blessing regarding the bitcoin treasury companies turns out to play once the bear market hits, and we’ll see if treasury companies start selling or not.” Top Indicators Hint At $230,000 Peak CoinGlass has urged investors to “hold 100%” at current prices even as the asset reported record price levels and 30% gains in Q2. While Bitcoin may be consolidating after reaching record highs, a list of classic on-chain indicators is showing no signs of market exhaustion. CoinGlass’ “bull market peak” selection contains 30 potential selling triggers that aim to highlight long-term Bitcoin price tops. According to CoinGlass, none of the indicators are flashing a top signal. Popular trader Cas Abbe posted on X, stating, “None of the 30 major top indicators on Coinglass have triggered yet. Not Pi Cycle, Not MVRV, Not even RSI. According To these models $BTC will be $135K to $230K this cycle. This ain’t the top.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) lost momentum this week after crossing $110,000 on Monday. While it stalled after reaching this level, market watchers were hopeful of a push higher as bullish sentiment persisted. However, a dramatic escalation in Middle East tensions saw markets plunge, with BTC dropping to $105,828 on Thursday and falling to a low of $102,832 on Friday as bearish sentiment took hold. According to analysts, BTC has encountered downside volatility after it failed to stay above the crucial $106,000 level. Analyst Michael van de Poppe flagged the $106,000 level as vital for maintaining upward momentum. According to van de Poppe, BTC’s latest rally was rejected after testing $106,000, with the price falling back between the $104,000-$105,000 region. If BTC dips below $105,000 again, it could drop to $100,000 by the end of June, mimicking a similar rejection that saw the price drop sharply to $100,000. BTC registered a sharp drop on Monday (June 2), falling to a low of $103,768. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,092. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784.

ETF inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum slowed, reflecting waning investor confidence amid global fear. Though headline risk keeps Bitcoin under $105K, sustained institutional buying could prevent a drop beneath $100K. Bitcoin Technical Setup and Price Structure On the 2-hour chart, Bitcoin has formed a rising trendline off early-June lows near $102,817, printing higher lows that suggest durable support. Trading between the 23.6% Fib retracement at $104,643 and 38.2% Fib at $105,772, BTC finds itself sandwiched under the 50‑EMA at $105,940. A Doji candle near the lower boundary signals market indecision. Momentum indicators add nuance: the MACD line is converging with its signal, and the histogram is shrinking from negative territory—both signs of cautious bullish sentiment. Absence of bearish patterns like “Three Black Crows” and presence of a spinning top candle point to consolidation rather than capitulation. Risk Zones and Bitcoin Trade Strategy Here’s a potential Bitcoin price prediction you can follow: Bullish Entry : Watch for a breakout above $105,772 and the 50‑EMA. Stop‑loss : Place it below today’s swing low near $104,500. Targets : $106,685 (50% Fib) $107,598 (61.8% Fib) Alternatively: Bearish Strategy : If Bitcoin drops below $104,600 (trendline + 23.6% Fib), it could revisit $102,817 support.

2025-06-15T13:14:00,"Russia Paid Teenage Spies in Bitcoin, Blockchain Forensics Reveal","Russian intelligence agencies are increasingly relying on Bitcoin to fund covert operations across Europe, including the recruitment of teenagers as spies. Key Takeaways: Russian intelligence is using Bitcoin to fund covert operations, including the recruitment of teenage spies. Blockchain forensics traced espionage payments to wallets linked to the FSB, showing structured laundering patterns. This case is part of a broader trend, with crypto also used to finance propaganda and sabotage across Europe. A Reuters investigation , conducted with blockchain forensics firms Global Ledger and Recoveris, has revealed how the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) used crypto to finance espionage. One case involved Canadian national Laken Pavan, who was just 17 when he was recruited by the FSB after traveling to Donetsk to join pro-Russian forces. Teen Spy Case Reveals Russia’s Use of Coercion and Crypto Payments After several days in detention, Pavan was coerced into spying for Russia and assigned a handler known as Slon, Russian for “elephant.” His instructions included traveling across Europe to collect intelligence, with payments sent in Bitcoin. After receiving just over $500 in BTC while in Copenhagen, Pavan fled to Poland, where he turned himself in on May 22, 2024. He was later sentenced to 20 months in prison by Polish authorities. The payment Pavan received was traced to two intermediary wallets by blockchain analysts, which had received significant funds from a larger wallet created in June 2022. That wallet has since processed more than $600 million in Bitcoin, including transactions routed through Garantex, a sanctioned Russian crypto exchange. JUST IN: Russia's central bank showcases #Bitcoin as the most profitable investment over the past year pic.twitter.com/y9MB4vyGAD — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) May 15, 2025 Global Ledger’s analysis found that the wallets linked to Pavan’s payments operated exclusively during Moscow business hours, pointing to a highly structured laundering network. “Transactions from wallets linked to the FSB followed a structured laundering pattern, involving fund splitting, mixing with larger sums, and routing through unconnected deposit wallets,” Global Ledger said in its report. The case is not isolated. According to Marcin Zarakowski, CEO of Recoveris, Russian intelligence has used Bitcoin to fund multiple covert operations. “This method has been uncovered on multiple occasions,” he said, citing a 2023 case involving young Belarusians and Ukrainians who were paid in crypto by the GRU to install surveillance devices and spread propaganda in Poland. Some were even paid in BTC to commit acts of arson. 161 Bitcoin Wallets Tied to Russia’s FSB Show Patterned Activity Recoveris has also identified a network of 161 Bitcoin addresses linked to the FSB, with hundreds of transactions occurring within 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Moscow time. Russia’s reliance on crypto extends to mercenary funding in Donbas and payments to European politicians for disseminating pro-Kremlin narratives. As reported, Russia is exploring ways to use cryptocurrencies to settle grain export payments, as the country looks to bypass Western sanctions and modernize its trade infrastructure. More recently, Russia’s central bank announced that it is allowing qualified investors limited access to crypto-linked financial products.

Notably, the premier cryptocurrency has entered a consolidation movement between $105,000 – $106,000 following slight, after prices crashed to below $103,000 on Friday. Meanwhile, prominent analytics company Glassnode has shared some valuable insight into the Bitcoin market dissecting the growth of the current bull cycle so far. Bitcoin Demand Matches Maturation Rate In an X post on June 14, Glassnode draws comparisons of Bitcoin price growth in the present market cycle to previous ones. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection Notably, the crypto market cycle is a recurring four-year period marked by consecutive phases of accumulation, a bull market, distribution and a bear market. In the last two cycles i.e 2015-2018 and 2018-2022, Bitcoin achieved price gains of 1076% and 1007%, respectively, significantly multiplying its market cap. For the current cycle from 2022 till date, Bitcoin’s prices have now grown by 656%. While this figure is far off previous cycles, Glassnode reports that it’s a commendable achievement considering the premier cryptocurrency’s maturation in the past four years marked by an exposure to institutional investors and a $2 trillion valuation. Generally, assets are expected to produce little exponential growth with continued price growth. This can be seen with gold only achieving an estimated 192% growth over the past 10 years. Therefore, Glassnode notes that Bitcoin’s 6x market gain since 2022 is highly positive development that reflects a sustainable market demand even as the asset’s market cap grows. Bitcoin Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $105,540 following a slight 0.20% gain in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down by 35.39% representing significant fall in market participation. Interestingly, reputable analytics firm Sentora reports the Bitcoin network weekly fees fell by 3.31% following recent negative political events coupled with an already uncertain market sentiment. Meanwhile, exchange inflows also grew by $2.4 billion indicating a significant amount of investors are looking to distribute their holdings while the premier cryptocurrency struggles to re-establish a bullish price direction.

2025-06-15T12:25:18,"Vietnam passes crypto assets regulation in new digital tech law","Vietnam’s National Assembly has passed the Law on the Digital Technology Industry, a comprehensive legal framework that will formally bring digital assets under strict regulatory control. Passed on June 14 and set to come into force on January 1, 2026, the law is considered a landmark in promoting digital innovation in the nation. Vietnam enacts standalone digital tech law Local publications reported that under the new law, digital assets will be classified into two large groups: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both use encryption and digital technology to authenticate and transfer. However, they also specifically remove securities, digital fiat, and other financial instruments from the definition. It is now up to Vietnam’s government to specify, for example, what kind of business is allowed and what kind of scrutiny will apply to the use and transferability of such assets. The law requires cybersecurity processes and anti-money laundering (AML) actions to comply with the global requirements issued by the law. It must be in sync with international best practices. This move is possibly in response to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) including Vietnam on its “gray list” in 2023 for increased scrutiny. In addition to regulating crypto, the laws symbolize Vietnam’s larger aspiration to take its place as a regional digital technology center . It would offer sweeping incentives to companies in areas like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. Those perks include tax breaks, friendly land-use policies, and research and development investments—especially for chip design companies and AI data centers. Push for digital literacy and investor protection intensifies The law also aims for a digitally literate workforce. Provincial governments have been tasked with developing education and training plans, and national curricula will be reformed to include digital technology skills. “With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry,” the Vietnamese government said. In the meantime, Vietnam still grapples with crypto scams. Vietnamese authorities have recently arrested key figures behind a nationwide cryptocurrency scam that defrauded tens of thousands of investors out of nearly 10 trillion Vietnamese dong (approximately $400 million). According to local reporting, the fraud ring operated under the guise of a fake virtual currency exchange called MTC (Matrix Chain). The Dong Nai Provincial Police led the months-long investigation with support from the Ministry of Public Security and other regional forces. After nearly 200 days of surveillance and evidence collection, officers arrested the group’s ringleader, Nguyen Quoc Hung, and four accomplices during coordinated raids across multiple provinces. Police also rounded up four suspects earlier this year, accused of coming up with BitMiner, a bogus cryptocurrency mining company that pretended to be based in Dubai. More than 200 people lost more than 4 billion Vietnamese dong (about $157,300) in a scheme that sold fraudulent mining packages and educational content. In December 2024, Hanoi City Police foiled a large-scale crypto scam that defrauded around 100 businesses and 400 individuals of 30 billion Vietnamese dong (approximately $1.17 million). Authorities intervened just in time to stop an additional 300 people from falling victim. Operating under Million Smiles, the company promoted an in-house cryptocurrency, QFS, or Quantum Financial System, using deceptive advertising that linked it to ancestral treasures and spiritual claims. Vietnam’s new laws help fill the legal void around cryptocurrencies and signal the country’s willingness to be a global leader in the next era of global technology.

The company stated that altcoin dominance has reached historical support levels and warned that high volatility could be on the way in the coming days. Alphractal made the following statement in its statement: “Something big is about to happen in altcoins! Altcoin Dominance has reached historical support levels. We are on the verge of a wave of volatility in the coming days. Whether Bitcoin rises or falls, many altcoins are likely to outperform BTC in the coming months, so it is critical to be prepared.” Related News: Giant Whale Shorted These 16 Altcoins, Made Huge Profits Focusing on two important metrics in its analysis, Alphractal argued that these were the harbingers of serious rallies in the altcoin market in the past. Altcoin Dominance (excluding Stablecoins): It was stated that this metric found strong support at the 25% level and this level is often tested before major altcoin rallies. Altcoin Dominance (excluding ETH and Stablecoins): It was stated that this indicator has a critical support area around 18%. Falling below this level has historically triggered periods when altcoins gained significant market share against Bitcoin. The company noted that the levels in question do not directly guarantee an “altcoin season,” but that such technical signals have appeared before major market moves in the past. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-15T12:16:30,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Explained","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price has stayed mostly quiet this weekend, showing no big moves in either direction. The market is still moving sideways, with prices stuck within a narrow range. While there’s been a little bit of downward pressure, it hasn’t been enough to trigger any big changes. Some experts have wondered if Bitcoin’s current pattern might turn into a triangle, but there’s no clear sign of that happening. Triangles are rare patterns in the market, and it’s too early to say if this will develop into one. Bearish Update: For now, the focus remains on a correction phase that began after Bitcoin’s May high. The price has been pulling back since then, and it’s expected to possibly head lower before finding strong support. The key areas to watch are around $99,200 to $92,800. There’s even a chance it could dip as low as $81,340, which is considered an important support level. If Bitcoin breaks below that, it could signal the end of the bull market. Bullish Update: On the other hand, if Bitcoin holds above this zone, the long-term outlook remains positive. Once this correction ends, Bitcoin could target a move towards $130,000, and if market conditions improve, it might even rally higher, possibly up to $190,000. Looking at shorter timeframes, the price is currently holding above minor support levels. Over the weekend, it’s been expected that Bitcoin might see a small bounce or move sideways before heading lower again. A break above $108,822 could mean the market is turning more bullish in the short term, but for now, there’s no clear sign of that happening. In summary, Bitcoin is still in a correction phase with no confirmed breakdown or breakout. As long as it stays above key support levels, the larger uptrend remains intact.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-prediction-bullish-and-bearish-scenarios-explained/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
