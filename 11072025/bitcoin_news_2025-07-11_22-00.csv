2025-07-11T19:55:39,"Crypto Analyst Says Solana Rival on Cusp of Breakout, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum","A widely followed crypto analyst says that one rival of smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) is on the brink of breaking out while updating his outlook on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 550,900 followers on the social media platform X that layer-1 blockchain SUI Network ( SUI ) is one weekly close away from taking off. “SUI is on the cusp of a breakout from its macro triangle. It is one weekly close above the diagonal resistance away from kickstarting trend continuation to the upside. SUI continues to be a leader in terms of metrics across layer-1s, with its TVL (total value locked) is over $2 billion.” Source: Rekt Capital/X According to the analyst, not only is SUI ready to rally to the upside, but it has also overtaken Solana in terms of overall stablecoin transfers last month. “SUI has been consolidating inside this macro market structure for most of 2025, soon to challenge the top of the pattern for a major breakout attempt. Fundamentally speaking, SUI has overtaken Solana in terms of monthly stablecoin transfers in the last month.” SUI is trading for $3.56 at time of writing, a 10.6% increase on the day. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Rekt Capital says that its latest surge to a new all-time high means that the “storm is here.” “The price of Bitcoin has increased by +$10,000 since. The storm is here.” Source: Rekt Capital/X He also notes that the crypto king has entered its price discovery uptrend phase. BTC is trading for $117,755 at time of writing, a 5.9% increase during the last 24 hours. Concluding his analysis with ETH, Rekt Capital says that the second-largest digital asset by market cap is ready to rally across its entire macro range of between $2,500 and $3,900. “Ethereum is slowly getting ready to rally across its entire $2500-$3900 macro range (black-black). The macro range low of $2500 has been successfully retested as support to kickstart the range-bound move.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum is trading for $2,980 at time of writing, a 7.5% increase on the day.

2025-07-11T19:50:41,"Bitcoin Holders Remain Calm: Glassnode’s Crucial NUPL Insight","The cryptocurrency world is abuzz. Bitcoin (BTC) recently surged past $118,000, marking a new all-time high (ATH) that sent ripples of excitement across the market. Yet, amidst this euphoria, a fascinating insight from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode offers a more nuanced perspective. Their latest report on X reveals that despite the price milestone, the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric remains conspicuously below the ‘euphoria zone’ at 0.69. What does this surprising data tell us about the current Bitcoin bull run, and why is it so significant? What is NUPL and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin? Before diving deeper into Glassnode’s findings, let’s clarify what the NUPL metric actually represents. NUPL, or Net Unrealized Profit and Loss, is an on-chain indicator that measures the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market. It calculates the difference between realized cap and market cap, divided by market cap, effectively showing the aggregate profit or loss of all coins in circulation that have not yet been sold. When the NUPL value is high, it indicates that a large portion of the market is in profit, suggesting potential for profit-taking and market tops. Specifically, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) NUPL focuses only on coins held by entities identified as ‘long-term holders’ – typically addresses that have held their Bitcoin for over 155 days. These holders are often considered the ‘smart money’ or ‘strong hands’ in the market, less prone to panic selling and more likely to accumulate during dips. Their collective profit and loss status can provide profound insights into the market’s psychological state and potential turning points. A high LTH NUPL typically signals that these experienced holders are sitting on significant profits, often preceding major corrections as they begin to distribute their holdings. Glassnode’s Revelation: Is This Bitcoin Cycle Truly Different? The core of Glassnode’s recent report lies in a striking comparison: while Bitcoin has reached unprecedented price levels, the LTH NUPL has only spent approximately 30 days above the 0.75 threshold – a zone historically associated with peak market euphoria and distribution by long-term holders. Contrast this with the previous bull cycle, which saw a staggering 228 days above this very threshold. This stark difference, as highlighted by Glassnode , suggests a potentially unique characteristic of the current market phase. What could explain this divergence? Is it a sign of a more mature market, where institutional adoption and broader understanding lead to less speculative frenzy? Or does it indicate that long-term holders, perhaps scarred by previous bear markets, are simply holding out for even higher prices, anticipating a longer, more sustained bull run? The fact that the LTH NUPL remains at 0.69, below the typical ‘euphoria’ point, implies that a significant portion of these steadfast holders are still accumulating or holding, rather than engaging in widespread profit-taking. This behavior could be a strong bullish signal, suggesting that the market has not yet reached its peak of irrational exuberance. The Unwavering Conviction of Long-Term Holders The role of Long-Term Holders in the Bitcoin ecosystem cannot be overstated. These are the individuals and entities who have weathered multiple market cycles, enduring significant volatility and drawdowns. Their conviction is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s price stability and long-term growth. When LTHs begin to sell en masse, it often signals a market top. Conversely, when they continue to accumulate or hold through price rallies, it suggests underlying strength and confidence in future appreciation. The current data from Glassnode suggests that these seasoned investors are not yet showing signs of widespread distribution. Their collective unrealized profits, while substantial, are not at levels that historically trigger a mass exodus. This could mean several things: Increased Market Maturity: Long-term holders might be more sophisticated, understanding that Bitcoin’s long-term potential far exceeds previous cycles’ peaks. Supply Shock in Progress: If LTHs aren’t selling, it means new demand must be met by other market participants, potentially leading to a supply squeeze. Anticipation of Higher Peaks: They might believe the true ‘euphoria zone’ for this cycle is much higher, given the growing mainstream adoption and macroeconomic factors. Their continued holding pattern acts as a strong support mechanism for the price, indicating that the supply held by the most patient hands remains largely locked up. Decoding the Current Crypto Market Analysis This insight from Glassnode is crucial for any comprehensive Crypto Market Analysis . If long-term holders are not yet in a state of euphoria, it implies that the market might have more room to run before reaching a cyclical top. Unlike previous cycles where retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) often led to rapid price increases followed by sharp corrections driven by LTH distribution, this cycle appears to be unfolding differently. The absence of widespread LTH euphoria could point to: A More Sustainable Rally: A slower, more gradual climb might be healthier, allowing for new capital to enter without immediate heavy selling pressure from long-term holders. Institutional Influence: The growing presence of institutional investors, who typically have longer investment horizons and different profit-taking strategies, might be dampening the traditional retail-driven euphoria peaks. Broader Accumulation: It suggests that accumulation might still be ongoing at various levels, not just by long-term holders, but also by new entrants who are buying into the rally. This unique market dynamic suggests that while Bitcoin has achieved a new ATH, the underlying structure of the market, particularly from the perspective of its most seasoned participants, indicates a phase of continued strength rather than imminent exhaustion. Actionable Insights: Navigating Bitcoin’s Current Phase So, what does this mean for you, the investor, navigating Bitcoin ‘s current price action? The Glassnode data offers several key actionable insights: Patience is Key: The fact that long-term holders are not yet in a full euphoria state suggests that there might be more upside potential before a significant market top. Avoid premature profit-taking if your investment horizon is long-term. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Continue to pay close attention to on-chain indicators like NUPL, Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), and accumulation trends. These metrics provide a deeper understanding of market participant behavior beyond just price. Beware of Euphoria Creep: While LTHs aren’t euphoric yet, retail sentiment can shift quickly. Be prepared for increased volatility if and when the market does enter the traditional ‘euphoria zone.’ Risk Management: Despite the bullish signals, always practice sound risk management. Market conditions can change rapidly. This cycle’s distinct behavior, as illuminated by Glassnode, offers a valuable lesson: past performance is not always indicative of future results, and on-chain data provides a powerful lens to understand the present. The market is evolving, and the behavior of its most committed participants reflects this maturation. In conclusion, while Bitcoin ‘s new all-time high is undoubtedly exciting, Glassnode ‘s report on the Long-Term Holder NUPL provides a fascinating counter-narrative to the idea of immediate market overheating. The fact that these steadfast holders remain below the ‘euphoria zone’ suggests a more measured, potentially more sustainable, bull run compared to previous cycles. This unique dynamic, revealed through meticulous Crypto Market Analysis , offers a compelling reason for investors to remain observant and strategic, understanding that this cycle might just be unfolding in an unprecedented and intriguing way.

2025-07-11T19:50:21,"K33’s Bold Bitcoin Purchase: Swedish Crypto Broker Boosts Holdings to 85 BTC","In a significant move that underscores growing institutional confidence in the digital asset space, Swedish crypto broker K33 has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin reserves. This strategic decision to boost its Bitcoin holdings not only strengthens K33’s balance sheet but also sends a clear signal about its long-term conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What does this latest K33 Bitcoin purchase mean for the company and the broader crypto market? What’s Driving K33’s Strategic Bitcoin Purchase? K33, a prominent Swedish crypto broker , recently made waves by announcing on X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 50 Bitcoin (BTC). This latest acquisition brings its total Bitcoin reserves to an impressive 85 BTC. The average purchase price for this batch was reported at 1,089,220 SEK, which translates to approximately $114,186. This isn’t K33’s first foray into bolstering its reserves; the company previously completed a direct stock issuance worth $19.2 million specifically to enhance its BTC reserves. This aggressive accumulation strategy by K33 is not merely about holding a digital asset; it’s a calculated business decision. For a crypto broker, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin can serve multiple purposes: Balance Sheet Strength: Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ can act as a robust reserve asset, fortifying the company’s financial position in a volatile market. Client Confidence: Demonstrating conviction in Bitcoin through direct holdings can instill greater trust among clients, signaling that the broker is aligned with the long-term growth of the asset class it facilitates trading in. Future Growth Potential: With Bitcoin’s price movements often tied to supply halving events and increasing mainstream adoption, accumulating BTC at strategic points positions the company for potential future appreciation. The decision to conduct a stock issuance specifically for this purpose highlights a deliberate and well-funded strategy, moving beyond speculative trading to treating Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The Rise of the Swedish Crypto Broker: A Nordic Perspective K33’s actions reflect a broader trend of increased sophistication and confidence within the Nordic crypto landscape. As a leading Swedish crypto broker , K33 is at the forefront of digital asset adoption in a region known for its technological advancement and financial stability. Their proactive approach to increasing Bitcoin holdings sets a precedent for other financial institutions in the area and potentially across Europe. Historically, traditional financial institutions have been cautious about direct exposure to cryptocurrencies. However, companies like K33 are demonstrating that it’s possible to integrate digital assets into a core business model while maintaining regulatory compliance and investor confidence. This shift is crucial for the maturation of the crypto market, bridging the gap between nascent technology and established financial practices. What does this mean for the average investor? It suggests that the market is becoming more robust and reliable, with established entities taking on direct exposure, which could pave the way for more mainstream products and services. Decoding K33’s Bitcoin Holdings: What Does 85 BTC Mean? While 85 BTC might seem like a modest sum compared to the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, for a regional crypto broker, it represents a significant commitment. At current market prices, 85 BTC is a substantial investment, underscoring K33’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This amount places K33 among a growing list of public and private companies that are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The average purchase price of approximately $114,186 per BTC (in SEK equivalent) indicates that K33 is not shying away from current market valuations, suggesting they believe in significant upside potential. This contrasts with companies that might only acquire during deep dips, showcasing K33’s belief in the asset’s sustained growth trajectory, regardless of short-term fluctuations. For investors, this signals that even at elevated price points, institutions see value in accumulating Bitcoin. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties, rather than just a speculative asset. Navigating Crypto Market Trends: K33’s Vision K33’s strategic moves are undoubtedly influenced by current crypto market trends . The market has witnessed a resurgence of institutional interest, fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, and a broader recognition of digital assets as a legitimate investment class. These factors collectively contribute to a bullish sentiment, and K33 appears to be positioning itself to capitalize on this momentum. Their decision to increase Bitcoin holdings suggests a proactive stance on anticipating market shifts and adapting their business model accordingly. Instead of merely facilitating trades, K33 is actively participating in the market’s evolution, becoming a holder and believer in the assets they serve. This approach highlights several key insights for navigating the crypto market: Long-Term Vision: Successful players in the crypto space often adopt a long-term perspective, focusing on accumulation rather than short-term trading. Strategic Capital Allocation: Utilizing capital, even through stock issuance, to acquire core assets demonstrates a commitment to future growth. Confidence in Ecosystem: A broker investing in the very asset it trades signals profound confidence in the underlying technology and market infrastructure. These actions by K33 are a testament to the evolving maturity of the crypto market, moving from a niche investment to a recognized asset class within the global financial system. The Wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Continues K33’s latest acquisition is a compelling example of the accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . From public companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla to investment funds and now crypto brokers like K33, an increasing number of corporate entities are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. This trend is a powerful validator for Bitcoin’s legitimacy and its potential to serve as a global reserve asset. The implications of this widespread adoption are significant: Increased Liquidity: More institutional holders can lead to deeper liquidity pools, making the market more stable and efficient. Reduced Volatility: While Bitcoin remains volatile, increased institutional holding can, over time, contribute to a more stable price floor as large entities tend to be long-term holders. Regulatory Clarity: As more institutions enter the space, there is a growing demand for clearer regulatory frameworks, which can benefit the entire ecosystem. K33’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a piece of a much larger puzzle, illustrating how Bitcoin is steadily cementing its place within the global financial architecture. It signifies a future where digital assets are an undeniable part of corporate and institutional portfolios. A Bold Statement of Conviction K33’s decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 85 BTC, funded in part by a substantial stock issuance, is a powerful declaration of its confidence in the future of digital assets. As a leading Swedish crypto broker , K33 is not just facilitating trades; it is actively participating in the market’s evolution, showcasing a strategic vision aligned with the long-term growth of Bitcoin. This move highlights a crucial aspect of current crypto market trends : the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption , reinforcing Bitcoin’s role as a vital asset in modern portfolios. K33’s bold steps underscore a growing belief among financial entities that Bitcoin is here to stay, offering both strategic value and significant future potential.

2025-07-11T19:45:37,"Russian crypto criminal seeks U.S. President Trump’s pardon","The Russian founder of a cryptocurrency exchange shut down for allegedly processing illicit funds for criminals has turned to Donald Trump with a plea for a pardon. While having already served his sentence in America, the convicted crypto entrepreneur hopes the U.S. President will help him avoid extradition to France, where he is likely to spend more time in prison. Crypto exchange Bitzlato owner seeks clemency from Trump A Russian national who was arrested and sentenced in the United States for his crypto trading business has asked the U.S. head of state for a pardon, his lawyer, Ivan Melnikov, revealed to Russia’s TASS news agency. Melnikov, who serves as vice president of the Russian branch of the International Committee for Human Rights organization, was quoted on Friday as stating: “Anatoly Legkodymov, the Russian engineer and co-founder of the Bitzlato cryptocurrency platform, has officially asked U.S. President Donald Trump for pardon.” The lawyer noted that the move comes amid ongoing attempts by authorities in Paris to secure Legkodymov’s extradition to France, where he may receive another 20 years behind bars, according to the Russian media report. Legkodymov, who was also the majority owner and chief executive of Bitzlato, was arrested in Miami in 2023, with French help, and later charged for operating the peer-to-peer crypto trading platform as an unlicensed money exchange service. After court proceedings that took a year and a half, the Russian was sentenced to 18 months in prison, which he had already served in pre-trial detention. However, following France’s request for his extradition, the U.S. judiciary decided to keep him in custody. Melnikov, who claims that Bitzlato was actually “a noticeboard for transactions,” insisted: “Anatoly is not a criminal. He became a target in a political campaign against the crypto market and talented Russian programmers.” The legal defender added his client’s decision to seek a pardon from Trump was “based on the hope that the U.S. will return to a more balanced and fair approach to digital finance, and that the United States and Russia will gradually build dialogue.” Another Russian crypto boss in trouble with the West However, during his trial in a New York court, Legkodymov did plead guilty to running an unlicensed money-transmitting business in late 2023. He also agreed to forfeit $23 million worth of crypto assets associated with his exchange. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Hong Kong-registered Bitzlato operated globally, presenting itself as a platform requiring minimal identification from users. Announcing the charges against its Russian founder, the DOJ explained: “As a result of these deficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, Bitzlato allegedly became a haven for criminal proceeds and funds intended for use in criminal activity.” The department claimed that Bitzlato’s largest counterparty was Hydra, arguably the largest and longest-running darknet market, which was quite popular in the Russian-speaking corners of the dark web. Hydra users traded an estimated $700 million in coins with the exchange. The case of Bitzlato and its owner is not the first time a Russian crypto trading platform and its management have found themselves in trouble with law enforcement in the West. Last month, TASS reported that Poland agreed to hand over to the United States the former chief executive of Wex, once Russia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Dmitry Vasiliev was arrested in Warsaw in 2024 at a request from the U.S., where he is accused of fraud and money laundering. Wex is the successor of the infamous BTC-e exchange, believed to have laundered $9 billion. Its alleged operator, Russian citizen Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece in 2017 and later extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in December 2020. Vinnik was then transferred to the U.S. to face additional charges. He was eventually exchanged for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel in a prisoner swap deal agreed by the Trump administration and President Putin’s Russia. The Bitzlato founder Anatoly Legkodymov’s plea for pardon comes after in January, Trump signed an executive order pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the operator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace, who had served 11 years of his double life sentence without parole.

Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs, surging past the $118,000 mark, while altcoins are breaking above key resistance levels after months of consolidation. This wave of renewed optimism comes at a critical time for the industry, not just in terms of price action, but also regulation. Next week marks “Crypto Week” in the US House of Representatives, where the Financial Services Committee will review and debate three pivotal bills that could shape the future of digital assets. Lawmakers will consider three major pieces of legislation: the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the GENIUS Act. These proposals are expected to bring much-needed clarity to the crypto space and could have wide-reaching implications for the industry. This alignment of bullish price action and significant regulatory developments creates a powerful inflection point for crypto. As markets break out and US lawmakers consider legislation that could define industry standards, investors are watching closely. The coming days may prove to be a defining moment for the future of blockchain and digital finance. Crypto Sentiment Shifts as US Policy And Price Align The crypto market is entering a new bullish phase, powered by more than just rising prices. Legal clarity and growing institutional support in the United States are reinforcing investor confidence. After months of uncertainty, bulls are now celebrating a decisive momentum shift. US President Donald Trump’s administration recently passed a long-anticipated pro-crypto bill just ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline. Dubbed the “big, beautiful” bill by Trump, the legislation is widely expected to create a favorable environment for digital assets. Next week, the bullish sentiment may accelerate as the US House of Representatives kicks off “Crypto Week.” Led by the Financial Services Committee, lawmakers will review and debate three key pieces of legislation with long-term implications for the industry. The CLARITY Act seeks to define functional requirements for digital asset market participants, aiming to boost innovation while protecting consumers. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act targets centralized digital currencies that could compromise financial privacy. Finally, the GENIUS Act addresses stablecoin regulation, proposing a framework for federal oversight of this fast-growing payment technology. Together, these developments suggest that crypto is maturing. With strong technical setups, supportive macro tailwinds, and a historic week of US legislative progress ahead, digital assets are entering what could be the most pivotal phase of their adoption cycle to date. Market Analysis: Breakout Signals Return of Bullish Momentum The total crypto market cap has surged to $3.62 trillion, posting an 8.75% weekly gain and breaking out from a multi-week consolidation range. This latest candle reflects strong bullish momentum, closing well above the previous rejection area around $3.3 trillion. The breakout is supported by a significant spike in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest and broader participation across the crypto space. From a technical standpoint, the chart confirms a series of higher lows since the start of 2024, marking a healthy uptrend. The 50-week and 100-week moving averages (at $2.84T and $2.33T, respectively) are both sloping upward and well below the current price, reinforcing long-term strength. Importantly, the total market cap has now come within striking distance of its historical all-time high of $3.8 trillion. If this momentum sustains, a full retest and potential breakout above the ATH would mark a new phase of the bull cycle. Altcoins are showing signs of awakening, and Bitcoin dominance may begin to wane as capital rotates into higher-beta assets. The macro environment—with easing inflation fears and growing regulatory clarity—adds further fuel to this rally. A weekly close above $3.65T would confirm this bullish shift.

2025-07-11T19:25:05,"How to Mine Bitcoin? Forget Complex Rigs - Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Creates Instant Wealth Opportunity","Ask any newcomer to crypto how to mine Bitcoin and you’ll get one of two reactions: a spark of curiosity or a look of immediate regret. The concept sounds cool until you’re hit with GPU specs, energy bills, and warehouse-level complexity. That dream of becoming a crypto miner suddenly feels more like signing up for a second job. But what if mining didn’t require a machine louder than a jet engine or a monthly electricity bill the size of a mortgage? That’s the opportunity Bitcoin Solaris is opening up. And it’s flipping the idea of mining on its head. How to mine Bitcoin Solaris: One phone, one click, real rewards Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just creating another token. It’s building a system that makes wealth generation simple, accessible, and instant, even for people with zero mining experience. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, BTC-S will allow users to mine directly from their smartphones. There’s no need for external hardware, no complex configurations. Just tap and go. That’s it. The app is designed for global accessibility and operates within the dual-consensus architecture of BTC-S, which combines Proof-of-Work with Delegated Proof-of-Stake to balance decentralization with efficiency. Here’s how it works: You download the app when it becomes available. You tap once a day to validate presence and earn mining time. The app runs secure micro-processes that simulate contribution, verified through network consensus. The real magic? It’s designed to consume up to 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. You get participation and real rewards without needing anything beyond your phone and an internet connection. The Future of Crypto Doesn’t Wait BTC-S Is Already Moving A deeper look into the BTC-S tech edge Once you scratch beneath the surface, you realize BTC-S isn’t just another “convenience coin.” The technical depth behind the project is what gives it real staying power: 10,000+ transactions per second, backed by an optimized dual-layer architecture. Validator rotation system for fairness and increased decentralization. Smart contract capabilities that support enterprise, DeFi, and gaming. Cross-chain compatibility, including seamless Solana bridge integration. Energy efficiency that rivals the greenest solutions in blockchain. This infrastructure is being taken seriously. A full audit has been completed by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , confirming the system is built to scale and designed to perform. Even established influencers are highlighting the project’s potential. One recent review by Crypto League laid out how the BTC-S mobile-first vision could be one of the biggest shifts in blockchain adoption this year. And from the looks of it, the hype isn’t just noise. Presale firestorm and the rare rollback moment Currently in phase 11, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is lighting up the charts. At a price of $11, with a launch target of $20, the momentum is backed by over 14,150+ users and more than $6.6 million raised in a matter of weeks. But here’s the twist. Bitcoin Solaris has activated a rare Price Rollback, allowing new buyers to get in at $5 instead of $11, but only for a very short time. It’s not a discount. It’s a rebalancing move built into the system’s flexibility to allow more early adopters access. For anyone who missed Bitcoin under $100, this rollback might be the closest déjà vu they’ll ever get. To receive your tokens on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless delivery. This ensures a smooth handoff once the presale ends on July 31, 2025. Liquid staking that doesn’t lock you out BTC-S also introduces liquid staking, a model that offers rewards without restricting liquidity. Tokens staked are converted to sBTC-S 1:1, which can still be traded or used in governance and DeFi protocols. You earn while maintaining full access. Staking supports the network without traditional lockups. Fully integrated with the upcoming Solaris Nova App, offering a smooth, automated process. This flexible staking system is explained in depth in their staking overview and aligns with BTC-S’s philosophy of accessibility without compromise. Final verdict: mining made simple, wealth made possible Mining isn’t dead. It just needed a rebrand. And Bitcoin Solaris may have nailed it. No cables. No overheating GPUs. Just a vision of crypto where anyone can participate in wealth creation directly from their pocket. So next time someone asks how to mine Bitcoin, maybe you don’t need to explain ASICs and air conditioning. Just mention BTC-S. One app. One tap. One opportunity that might not come around again.

2025-07-11T19:10:51,"Bitcoin Acquisition: Universal Digital’s Bold Move Unlocks New Treasury Strategy","In a significant development that underscores the evolving landscape of corporate finance, Canadian-listed Universal Digital has made a notable entry into the world of digital assets. The company recently announced a strategic Bitcoin acquisition , adding 10 BTC to its treasury at an average price of $104,452. This move, as reported by JinSe Finance, is part of a broader corporate treasury strategy shift that many forward-thinking companies are now exploring. But what exactly does this mean for Universal Digital, and what are the implications for businesses considering a similar foray into cryptocurrency? Universal Digital’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Deep Dive Universal Digital , a name increasingly recognized in the digital finance space, has taken a decisive step to diversify its treasury holdings. The decision to acquire 10 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.04 million at the time of acquisition, reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. This isn’t just about holding a volatile asset; it’s about integrating a new class of assets into traditional financial frameworks. For Universal Digital, this Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a purchase; it’s a statement. It signals a belief in the long-term potential of decentralized digital currencies and an acknowledgment of their increasing role in the global economy. By adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, the company aims to: Diversify Assets: Reduce reliance on traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments, which may be susceptible to inflation and interest rate fluctuations. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold,’ offering a potential safeguard against the erosion of purchasing power. Future-Proofing: Position the company at the forefront of financial innovation, aligning with the burgeoning digital economy. Attract Talent & Investors: Appeal to a new generation of investors and employees who are increasingly comfortable with and invested in the digital asset space. Understanding the Corporate Treasury Strategy Shift Traditionally, corporate treasuries focused on preserving capital and ensuring liquidity through low-risk, low-yield investments like cash, short-term government bonds, and money market funds. However, with persistent low interest rates and rising inflation concerns globally, these traditional strategies offer diminishing returns. This environment has prompted many companies to re-evaluate their approaches, leading to a significant shift in corporate treasury strategy . The embrace of Bitcoin and other digital assets by companies like Universal Digital represents a paradigm shift. It’s a move from purely conservative, yield-focused strategies to more dynamic approaches that incorporate growth potential and inflation hedging. This new strategy involves: Risk Assessment: Carefully evaluating the volatility and regulatory risks associated with digital assets. Long-Term Vision: Viewing Bitcoin not as a speculative trade, but as a long-term strategic holding. Technological Integration: Developing secure custodial solutions and accounting practices for digital assets. This evolving strategy is not without its challenges, including price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for robust security measures. Yet, the potential benefits are compelling enough for companies to explore this frontier. Why Digital Asset Investment is Gaining Traction The trend of digital asset investment by corporations is accelerating, driven by several key factors. Beyond the inflation hedge narrative, companies are recognizing the fundamental innovation behind blockchain technology and the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Consider these points: Institutional Acceptance: Major financial institutions, from banks to asset managers, are increasingly offering crypto services and products, legitimizing the asset class. Technological Advancements: Improvements in security, scalability, and accessibility of digital assets make them more viable for corporate holdings. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a borderless asset, offering a unique advantage for international companies. First-Mover Advantage: Companies that strategically adopt digital assets early may gain a competitive edge in the rapidly digitizing global economy. While Bitcoin remains the primary choice for corporate treasuries due to its liquidity and established network, the broader appeal of digital asset investment extends to other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications, promising a future where digital assets play a more integral role in corporate balance sheets. The Canadian Company Crypto Trend: What It Means Canada has quietly emerged as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency space, fostering an environment that is increasingly conducive to Canadian company crypto adoption. Unlike some other jurisdictions, Canada has been relatively progressive in its approach to cryptocurrency regulation, notably approving Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which provide regulated investment vehicles for institutions and retail investors alike. Universal Digital’s move fits well within this national context. Several other Canadian entities, particularly in the mining sector like Hut 8 and HIVE Blockchain, already hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin as part of their operational and treasury strategies. This growing cohort of Canadian company crypto holders suggests a broader trend where Canadian businesses are not just participating in, but actively leading, the integration of digital assets into their financial frameworks. This could solidify Canada’s position as a hub for blockchain innovation and corporate crypto adoption. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Crypto Holdings Universal Digital’s acquisition of 10 BTC is a small but significant step in a much larger movement. As more companies grapple with economic uncertainties and seek new avenues for growth and asset preservation, the appeal of Bitcoin and other digital assets will likely continue to grow. This trend is not just about financial speculation; it’s about adapting to a new financial paradigm where digital assets are seen as legitimate, valuable components of a diversified portfolio. The journey for companies integrating digital assets into their treasuries will involve navigating evolving regulatory landscapes, managing volatility, and ensuring robust security protocols. However, the pioneering spirit demonstrated by Universal Digital and others indicates a strong belief in the transformative potential of this asset class. Their actions today could very well set the precedent for corporate treasury management in the years to come, unlocking new possibilities for financial resilience and innovation.

2025-07-11T19:03:37,"Bitcoin Depot: A Cleaner P&L, Yet Market Wants More Than Profit Growth","Summary Bitcoin Depot posted strong Q1 results, flipping to positive net income and expanding gross margins to 20.2% through pricing power and bigger transactions. Operating leverage is kicking in: revenue rose 19% while operating expenses fell, thanks to kiosk optimization and tight cost controls, driving cash flow positive results. Valuation looks cheap versus fintech peers, but regulatory risks and limited growth beyond the cash-to-crypto niche keep the market skeptical of a sustained re-rating. Bitcoin Depot's ( BTM ) Q1 numbers were solid. Net income flipped positive; margins kept climbing. Feels like Bitcoin Depot is finally out of the heavy spending phase and just letting the model do its thing. Gross margin? 20.2%. A year ago, it was 12.5%. That's a big jump. Volume helped, sure. But pricing power played an even bigger role. And here's the kicker—they didn't dump in fresh capital to make it happen. No big CapEx. No mad rush to add kiosks either. They've got about 2,000 already in inventory, so they can grow 2025 without burning cash. Most crypto companies are still cash incinerators. Not these guys. They're already throwing off cash. So, What's Pushing Margins Up? Two things. First, pricing. They hiked markups and kiosk fees , and it went straight to the bottom line. CFO David Gray even admitted they “deliberately widened spreads” on the call. Result? A 7.7-point bump in gross margin YoY. Second, bigger transactions. Average purchase size climbed 6% to $300. And since fees are part flat, part percentage, larger tickets—especially ones over the $200 KYC cutoff—drive more revenue. Above that, the flat fee's almost irrelevant. It's the percentage markup that pulls weight. Bitcoin Depot Operating Leverage Revenue jumped 19% to $164.2M in the quarter. Solid. But the real story was on the cost side—operating expenses actually fell 7% over the same period. CFO David Gray chalked it up to “leverage on the significant revenue outperformance.” Translation: Revenue went up, but the fixed cost base didn't budge. A few things drove that. Depreciation dropped by $1M YoY—from $2.9M to $1.9M—as older kiosks fully depreciated. More kiosk activity, sure, but barely any added operating expense to support it. That's the beauty of a year like 2025, when they're not rolling out tons of new machines but instead squeezing more from the network they already built. There's also the kiosk shuffle. Bitcoin Depot pulled underperforming units from weak spots and dropped them into busier locations. More traffic per machine equals higher transaction volume. It's a cheap way to juice performance without sinking cash into new hardware. Gray called it a “continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks to optimize fleet profitability.” That's corporate speak for “move the laggards where people actually use them.” They also tightened up day-to-day spend. Armored cash collection costs fell from $2.0M to $1.6M YoY. Wireless and maintenance expenses stayed flat or ticked down. Finally, crypto acquisition costs—the big swing factor in COGS—still move with market prices. But most other expenses are fixed or semi-fixed. So, as volumes and average ticket sizes rise, more of that growth falls straight to the bottom line. That's why margins keep widening. Valuation Peer Set for Bitcoin Depot Valuing Bitcoin Depot? Honestly, there's no straight answer. You could argue Coinbase or Robinhood are decent comps because they're onboarding people into crypto, but then again, they're not exactly the same—they're purely digital. On the other side, maybe Western Union or Green Dot make more sense, at least for the physical network part. I don't know… none of these fit perfectly. But together? It gives you some idea of where Bitcoin Depot might land. YCharts BTM's operating margin has finally flipped into positive territory, and it's been trending up. It's still nowhere near the levels you see at high-margin fintech names like Robinhood or Coinbase, but it's already doing better than Green Dot ( GDOT ) and Bakkt ( BKKT ). Even compared to an old-school player like Western Union ( WU ), it stacks up reasonably well. Going forward, margin growth is probably going to be one of the big levers for any sort of valuation re-rating. YCharts Honestly, BTM feels way undervalued. It's trading at less than a third of Green Dot's price-to-sales—wild—and even further behind fintech darlings like Robinhood ( HOOD ) and Coinbase ( COIN ). Why? Probably a cocktail of reasons: slimmer margins vs. app-native players, being small-cap (which never helps), and lacking that crypto-exchange hype that lets Coinbase pull insane multiples. And yeah, on the surface, the forward P/E looks scary-high. But that's mostly optics. They're still early in profitability; earnings are thin because they're just now scaling. Worth noting: net income swung from a $4.2M loss to $12.2M gain YoY. If they can keep up that pace, P/E will compress fast. Feels like BTM fits more with growthy fintechs like Robinhood than dinosaurs like Western Union ( WU ). Right now, price-to-sales says “cheap” despite strong top-line growth and positive cash flow. Ops metrics aren't flashy, but they're moving up. The key? Margin expansion—especially gross margin—and getting more out of those ~3,200 active kiosks. If they nail that, re-rating becomes a real conversation. Next 2–3 quarters could be pivotal for closing the gap with GDOT and maybe even inching toward the low end of fintech comps. Risks Honestly, regulation might be the biggest wildcard for Bitcoin Depot. The BTM space is drawing more heat than ever— California's crackdown in 2024 wiped out 80% of their kiosks in the state. FinCEN is leaning harder on AML/KYC too, and let's not forget the risk of Congress taking a swing at cash-to-crypto onramps because of money laundering fears. Oh, and New York? Still off-limits unless they manage to lock down a license—not a given. For now, compliance is a moat for them. But if regulators keep tightening the screws, that “moat” could easily flip into a cost anchor. Then there's the whole Bitcoin price dynamic. Management likes to say kiosks pay back no matter what BTC does, but let's be real—demand still swings with crypto cycles. When prices spike, people transact more (median ticket jumped 46% last year during the bull run). But in a prolonged bear market? You'd probably see volumes sag. BTM isn't a pure BTC trade like miners or exchanges, but consumer excitement for crypto is still a big piece of the demand puzzle. Tech-wise, they don't have a killer app or proprietary hardware. Scale and relationships are their edge, but as apps like Cash App, Coinbase, and PayPal keep upping their game, that advantage could erode. Plus, the pool of cash-first users they target may naturally shrink as financial digitization keeps advancing. And let's not forget the physical kiosk issues like vandalism and service downtime. They need regular maintenance—cash loads, connectivity fixes—and high density in some regions leaves them exposed to local downturns. Wrapping Up Bitcoin Depot's scale leadership gives it a clear edge in the market. With a larger network than rivals, it benefits from lower per-unit costs, better retail placement, and the kind of network effects that are hard for smaller players to replicate. On top of that, its ability to generate free cash flow provides the firepower to pay down debt and potentially return capital to shareholders—without resorting to dilution. There's also significant embedded growth in the existing kiosk base. Many of the ~3,200 recently deployed units are still ramping, and as utilization improves, they should drive both top line growth and operating leverage. Expansion into international markets and restricted states like New York could unlock entirely new revenue streams, and the kicker is that much of this can happen with minimal incremental CapEx. Regulation, while often viewed as a headwind, could actually strengthen Bitcoin Depot's position. Their compliance infrastructure creates a moat that weaker competitors struggle to match, effectively forcing them out of the market. And finally, Bitcoin Depot's focus on the cash-to-crypto niche fills a gap that digital-only platforms like Cash App or Coinbase can't reach as effectively—serving cash-preferred and underbanked users who remain a large and underserved segment. That said, the problem lies in the fact that the market does not see a growth outburst outside the placement of a few thousand more kiosk units. Seeking Alpha Unless the company is capable of devising a strategy beyond its Bitcoin to cash niche, the market will keep shrugging it off as just a growth flare followed by stagnation, and that way, the company will not earn a valuation re-rating. Mainly because of this, I will remain on the sidelines on this stock.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800734-bitcoin-depot-a-cleaner-p-and-l-yet-market-wants-more-than-profit-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING","BTM",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T19:00:54,"Bitcoin’s Historic Ascent: How US Fiscal Policy Fuels Unprecedented Growth","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! Bitcoin (BTC) has once again defied expectations, smashing through previous records to hit an unprecedented all-time high of $118,800. This isn’t just another price pump; it’s a monumental moment driven by a powerful confluence of factors, chief among them being sustained institutional ETF inflows and strategic US fiscal policy decisions. If you’ve been watching the crypto market , you know this kind of milestone signals a significant shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Understanding US Fiscal Policy and Its Impact on Bitcoin At the heart of Bitcoin’s latest surge lies the intricate dance between government spending and market dynamics. According to insights from The Block, the passage of what’s been colloquially termed the “Big Beautiful Bill” has played a pivotal role. But what exactly does this mean for the world’s leading cryptocurrency? What is Fiscal Policy? In simple terms, fiscal policy refers to the government’s use of spending and taxation to influence the economy. When governments spend more than they collect in taxes, they run a deficit, often funded by issuing more debt or, indirectly, by increasing the money supply. This expansionary policy aims to stimulate economic growth, but it can also lead to concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. The “Big Beautiful Bill” and its Implications While specific details of the “Big Beautiful Bill” remain under wraps, its very existence points to a significant expansion of government spending. Historically, large-scale fiscal stimulus packages, particularly those involving substantial debt issuance, have prompted investors to seek out alternative assets that can serve as a hedge against potential currency depreciation. Nicolai Søndergaard, a seasoned analyst at Nansen, rightly points out that such US policy moves are actively creating a more favorable environment for Bitcoin . This isn’t a coincidence; it’s a direct reaction to the perceived long-term implications of expansive monetary and fiscal policies. Consider the following effects of robust fiscal policy: Increased Money Supply: Large government spending often necessitates an increase in the money supply, which can dilute the purchasing power of existing currency. Inflationary Concerns: More money chasing the same amount of goods and services can lead to inflation, eroding savings held in traditional fiat currencies. Search for Value Storage: Investors look for assets with limited supply and decentralized characteristics to preserve wealth. The Game-Changing Role of Bitcoin ETF Inflows Beyond fiscal policy, the relentless flow of capital into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has been a primary catalyst for its price action. These investment vehicles have revolutionized how traditional investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin , bridging the gap between mainstream finance and the nascent digital asset space. Demystifying Bitcoin ETFs A Bitcoin ETF allows investors to buy shares that represent ownership of Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies the investment process, making it accessible to a much wider audience, including institutional investors, retirement funds, and retail investors who prefer regulated investment products. Why ETF Inflows Matter for the Crypto Market The sustained influx of capital into these ETFs signifies a profound shift in institutional adoption. When major financial players and large investment funds pour billions into these products, it has several critical implications for the entire crypto market : Validation and Legitimacy: ETF approval and subsequent inflows lend significant credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, dispelling previous skepticism. Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into the market improves liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoin without significant price impact. Broader Market Access: ETFs open the doors for a vast pool of traditional investors who previously couldn’t or wouldn’t engage directly with cryptocurrency exchanges. This expanded investor base creates sustained buying pressure. Supply Shock Potential: As ETFs accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin to back their shares, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, further driving up prices given constant or increasing demand. Bitcoin : A Digital Hedge Against Monetary Debasement ? The narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and monetary debasement isn’t new, but it has gained significant traction amidst current global economic conditions. As governments worldwide grapple with debt and potential inflation, Bitcoin’s unique properties make it an increasingly attractive alternative. The Debasement Dilemma Monetary debasement refers to the reduction in the intrinsic value of a currency, typically through inflation or by increasing the money supply. When a government prints more money or incurs massive debt, the purchasing power of each unit of currency can diminish over time. This erodes savings and makes long-term financial planning challenging for individuals and institutions alike. Bitcoin’s Value Proposition In this environment, Bitcoin shines. Here’s why it’s increasingly seen as a robust hedge: Decentralization: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single government or central bank, making it immune to political manipulation or arbitrary money printing. Fixed Supply: Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, ensuring scarcity. This contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be transferred anywhere in the world without intermediaries, offering a borderless and censorship-resistant form of value transfer. Transparency: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain), providing unparalleled transparency. These characteristics position Bitcoin as a compelling alternative to traditional assets, especially when investors are seeking refuge from the potential pitfalls of expansionary fiscal policies and the resulting risk of monetary debasement . Navigating the New Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges for Bitcoin While the current environment presents immense opportunities for Bitcoin, it’s also crucial to acknowledge the challenges and consider actionable insights for investors. Key Benefits of Bitcoin’s Growth Increased Mainstream Acceptance: New ATHs and institutional involvement normalize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. Innovation and Development: A rising price often fuels further investment into the Bitcoin ecosystem, leading to technological advancements. Wealth Preservation: For many, Bitcoin is proving to be an effective tool for preserving wealth against inflation. Potential Challenges Ahead Despite the positive momentum, the crypto market remains dynamic and faces potential hurdles: Volatility: While Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth, it remains a volatile asset. Price corrections are a natural part of its market cycle. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments globally are still developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could impact market sentiment. Macroeconomic Shifts: A significant shift in global economic policy or a sudden reduction in fiscal stimulus could alter market dynamics. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin ? The convergence of expansionary US fiscal policy and robust ETF inflows has undeniably propelled Bitcoin into uncharted territory. This latest all-time high is not merely a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing maturity as a global asset and its increasingly recognized role as a vital hedge against monetary debasement . As traditional financial systems navigate complex economic landscapes, Bitcoin stands ready to offer a decentralized, finite, and increasingly accepted alternative for wealth preservation and growth. This period marks a pivotal moment for the entire crypto market , signaling a deeper integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric. While the journey may still involve volatility, the fundamental drivers supporting Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition appear stronger than ever.

2025-07-11T18:54:09,"What Was the Real Reason for the Recent Bitcoin Rally? Analytics Company Lays Out the Reasons in Depth","Cryptocurrency analysis firm QCP Capital has published a comprehensive market assessment following Bitcoin's all-time high. Pointing out that Bitcoin was traded at $118,000 this morning, the company stated that this level is an indicator of both enthusiasm in the market and structural solidity. According to QCP Capital, the primary macro driver behind the rise is the Trump administration's reintroduction of tariffs. The firm notes that manufacturers and exporters are accelerating imports, stockpiling, and increasing production ahead of the new tax period. This frontloading process has led to a significant expansion of trade and production credit. The report stated, “Whether Trump will delay implementation again remains uncertain. However, these cycles of threats and delays positively increase economic uncertainty. Business confidence and production indices remain in growth territory.” Related News: BREAKING: Highly Surprising Move from Coinbase - Official X Account Changes Profile Photo to Surprise Altcoin - Price Jumps This view is particularly supported by the rising price of copper, a leading indicator of industrial health. This commodity, nicknamed “Doctor Copper,” signals rising industrial demand and improving liquidity conditions. According to QCP Capital, the second key macro development driving Bitcoin's rise is the accelerating era of financial dominance in the US. The firm notes that economic activity continues to expand despite high interest rates. The US Treasury Department's “Activist Issuance Strategy,” which repurchases long-term debt by issuing short-term bonds, rebalances the debt structure and reduces interest rate volatility. This creates a more predictable environment for financial markets. “Short-term bonds are seen as almost cash equivalents. Limited long-term issuance keeps the MOVE index low and tightens credit risk premiums, supporting the gradual rise in financial assets,” the report said. Before labeling the market euphoria a “bubble,” QCP Capital points out that it could actually be an indicator of mass adoption. With copper and global stock indices hitting records, it's natural that monetary hedges like gold and Bitcoin would similarly surge. The company noted that inflows into ETFs and public crypto treasuries are outpacing token supply and miner sales. Analysts believe indicators like STRK stock and SharpLink, which have absorbed ETH-related sales, suggest this structural demand is continuing. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T18:45:26,"Banks With One ‘Deficient’ Rating Could Still Be Considered ‘Well Managed’ Under New Federal Reserve Proposal","The U.S. Federal Reserve is mulling a rule change that would allow banks with one “deficient” rating to still be considered “well managed.” The Fed’s current large financial institution (LFI) rating framework includes three components: capital, liquidity and governance/controls, each of which has four potential ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1 and deficient-2. Currently, a single deficient-1 or deficient-2 score in any of the three components means a bank is no longer considered “well managed.” The Fed notes large banks must be “well managed” at each of their depository institutions to be treated as a financial holding company, which permits a firm to engage in a broader range of nonbanking activities like securities underwriting and dealing. Michelle W. Bowman, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, says nearly two-thirds of the large financial holding companies under the LFI rating framework aren’t considered “well managed” in the current system, despite having capital and liquidity levels “substantially above regulatory requirements.” “This is because the LFI framework currently assigns a firm’s ‘well-managed’ status based on a single deficiency in any one rating component, rather than taking a complete look at the financial and managerial health of a firm. The proposal would generally require a deficiency in either a large bank holding company’s capital or liquidity ratings, in addition to a deficiency in its governance and controls, in order to be classified as not well-managed. In this way, the proposal would provide greater recognition of a firm’s overall condition in determining well-managed status.” Banks with a single “deficient-2” score, the more severe deficiency, would still not be considered “well managed” in the proposed new system. The Fed is currently asking for public input on the proposal.

2025-07-11T18:45:15,"First-ever pro-crypto U.S. administration: bummer or slowburner?","July 14, 2025, marks the beginning of Crypto Week in D.C. The event signals that the administration continues its work on regulating (and sometimes deregulating) the crypto space. The results of the first half of 2025 indicate little to no easy wins for the industry, but some advances in place can’t be ignored. Rare wins One of the promises Trump made during his campaign was a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road marketplace. Charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, money laundering, and drug trafficking, he was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 following his arrest in Manhattan. Ulbricht was among the first to create a high-scale business accepting Bitcoin, playing a major role in Bitcoin’s grassroots adoption. While Ulbricht admitted his brainchild turned out to be harmful—as it facilitated fatal overdoses for many—he remained a symbolic hero for many early bitcoiners who believed 12 years served in prison was enough to pay for his crimes. Indeed, at the end of his first day in office, Trump signed a full, unconventional pardon for Ross, a move lauded by the crypto community. FREEDOM!!!! pic.twitter.com/itRuuyFAxe — Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) January 22, 2025 Ross wasn’t the only one who could breathe a sigh of relief thanks to the new administration. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, charged with financial crimes, were pardoned too. Now, the developers of Bitcoin mixers accused of money laundering hope for a more favorable outcome , as they didn’t launder money and only created the tool used by criminals and law-abiding citizens. The pardon of early Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver, charged with tax fraud, was reportedly discussed by Elon Musk while serving in the Department of Government Efficiency. Still, it doesn’t appear that Ver’s fate is significant for the POTUS. Read more: Trump pardons BitMEX founders, is ‘Bitcoin Jesus’ Roger Ver next? Once anti-crypto Gary Gensler resigned from his position as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission following Trump’s inauguration, the SEC became one of the most crypto-friendly agencies in the U.S. The agency used a combination of executive actions and guidance to create a smoother path for U.S. cryptocurrency businesses to develop in a loose and predictable legal environment. More than that, the SEC welcomed crypto business leaders and experts to help shape new industry rules. A Crypto Task Force created in January 2025 is working to provide U.S. crypto entrepreneurs and innovators with a much-needed framework. Names like Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda, and Paul S. Atkins are associated with the positive shift in the legal status of cryptocurrency. The old-fashioned application of securities laws to cryptocurrencies caused significant trouble for the industry, an approach left behind in 2025. The memecoins’ status changed to “collectibles,” paving the way for less restrictive business in that sector. JUST IN – 🇺🇸 SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on regulating the Bitcoin and crypto industry: ""I'm a freedom maximalist."" pic.twitter.com/No9myXE423 — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 11, 2025 The SEC in 2025 dropped several enforcement actions started during the Gensler era. It discontinued legal battles with Coinbase, Ripple, and other key industry players. Challenges and disappointments Another of Trump’s campaign promises was the creation of a Bitcoin stockpile, which echoed Sen. Cynthia Lummis’ plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Many failed to realize how different these two plans were. Trump’s vision, which materialized on March 6, 2025, via executive order, meant the creation of a Bitcoin stockpile composed of seized bitcoins held by the U.S. government (around 200,000 BTC). The reserve may be topped up through budget-neutral methods. Lummis’ plan (and respective bill) proposed the U.S. purchase one million bitcoins over five years. The crypto community lauded this plan, but it did not come to fruition. Instead, Trump’s version was seen as a disappointment by some, as it simply rebranded seized bitcoins as a “reserve.” So government cant buy but only steal crypto 🤔 — Dapp Centre (@degenlifer) March 7, 2025 On top of that, Trump’s order stipulated that an audit of U.S. Bitcoin holdings would be carried out. The audit was due in April, but there have been no updates on the results. Trump opposed work on central bank digital currencies, citing privacy concerns and expressing preference for stablecoins issued by private companies rather than government institutions. However, he did emphasize the need for clearer regulation of stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, is intended to shape this framework. Some believed it would be adopted in the spring, but the legislation took longer to finalize. Although the GENIUS Act was conceived as a bipartisan effort, during House discussions, Democrats suddenly pushed to include clauses restricting sitting U.S. presidents and other top officials and their families from participating in the cryptocurrency business. While they did not succeed, the bill’s adoption was delayed. Read more: GENIUS Act could bring trillions in institutional crypto capital: experts weigh in The president’s family’s involvement in the crypto industry is a concern shared by both Trump’s critics and some supporters. Trump, his wife Melania, and his sons Eric and Donald are reportedly behind ventures such as World Liberty Finance, memecoins Official Trump and Melania, the mining company American Bitcoin , and other ventures, using their influence as a privilege in the sector. Bloomberg estimates that Trump’s crypto gains reach $620 million at a minimum. Democrats continue their efforts to dismantle Trump’s crypto empire. How have the Trump Administration’s efforts in crypto regulations already influenced the industry? According to Carter Razink , co-founder of the company building stablecoin-backed rewards Spree Finance , the current influence can be described as having both hard and soft impacts. The hard impact is pro-crypto legislation such as the GENIUS Act, which gives stablecoins a definitive, trillion-dollar regulatory runway. The soft impact is that founders no longer fear “Operation Chokepoint 2.0”-style debanking—building the future of finance on U.S. soil now feels safe and even encouraged. Raznik says: “Together, these forces recalibrate the risk profile for digital-asset startups and tilt the scales back toward American innovation. As history shows, when the U.S. hosts the tech giants, it gains disproportionate geopolitical clout. Pairing that technology scale with financial leverage positions America to dominate the next wave of financial technology. We’re already seeing this unfold at Spree Finance, where on-chain stablecoins power rewards programs that work and feel like airline miles or credit card points. The more usable and well-regulated these stablecoins become, the more they’ll bridge traditional finance and the next generation of digital money.” You might also like: U.S. Senate passes landmark Genius Act, aiming to bring clarity in stablecoin regulation",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/first-ever-pro-crypto-u-s-administration-bummer-or-slowburner/,"REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|EXCHANGE","Feature|Cynthia Lummis|Donald Trump|politics|Regulation|Roger Ver|Stablecoin|Strategic Bitcoin reserve",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T18:41:59,"Binance Helped Trump-Linked Crypto Firm Before Founder Changpeng Zhao Sought Pardon: Report","The world’s largest digital asset exchange by trading volume may have played a larger role in the development of World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin USD1 than previously known. According to a Bloomberg report citing unnamed sources, Binance wrote the code for World Liberty Financial’s USD1 stablecoin smart contract. Once coded and promoted, Binance also made stablecoin available for a $2 billion transaction, completed in USD1. According to Bloomberg, approximately 90% of all USD1 is still in Binance-controlled wallets. USD1 launched in March 2025. Two months later, during a podcast interview, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who was convicted in 2023 of failing to maintain proper anti-money-laundering standards at Binance and has already served a short prison term, confirmed that he had applied for a presidential pardon . The news spurred three US senators to write a letter to the White House seeking answers: “We write to request information about reports that Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, founder and majority owner of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, is seeking a pardon from President Trump. Just weeks ago, Binance, Emirati firm MGX, and World Liberty Financial (WLF)—a cryptocurrency company financially linked to President Trump and his family—announced a $2 billion deal involving USD1, WLF’s stablecoin. The convergence of Mr. Zhao’s pardon application and Binance’s financial entanglements with the President’s family presents urgent concerns regarding the integrity of our justice system… Though he stepped down from his role as CEO after pleading guilty to these charges, Mr. Zhao still owns 90% of the company.” According to a World Liberty Financial spokesperson, Bloomberg’s reporting is “factually deficient and designed to further a political agenda.” A Binance spokesperson reiterated that CZ is no longer the exchange’s CEO. World Liberty Financial is linked with Donald Trump but apparently not controlled by him, escaping any conflict of interest with his presidential duties. Trump has reportedly placed all his assets in a trust controlled by his oldest son.

2025-07-11T18:40:26,"Bitcoin’s Monumental Leap: Reclaiming Fifth Spot Among Global Assets","In a truly electrifying development for the digital asset world, Bitcoin market cap has once again made headlines, soaring past Amazon to reclaim its coveted fifth position among the world’s largest assets by market capitalization. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful statement, underscoring the growing influence and undeniable momentum of the world’s premier cryptocurrency. For the first time since May 9, Bitcoin (BTC) has ascended to this elite tier, signaling a significant shift in the global financial landscape. Currently, BTC is trading at an impressive $118,671, reflecting a robust 6.76% increase over the past 24 hours, and boasting a colossal market cap of $2.36 trillion, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This incredible resurgence prompts us to delve deeper into what fuels such a meteoric rise and what it signifies for the future of finance. What Propelled Bitcoin’s Astounding Ascent in Global Assets? The journey of Bitcoin market cap to reclaim its spot among top global assets is a testament to a confluence of factors, each playing a crucial role in its recent trajectory. This isn’t a singular event but rather the culmination of sustained interest, evolving regulatory landscapes, and increasing institutional adoption. Let’s break down the key drivers: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have been a game-changer. These investment vehicles provide traditional investors with an accessible and regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The consistent inflows into these ETFs have provided a significant demand shock, absorbing large amounts of BTC from the market. Halving Narrative and Scarcity: The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, continues to build a strong narrative around scarcity. This programmed supply shock historically precedes bull runs, and investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on the expected price appreciation. Macroeconomic Factors: Lingering inflation concerns and a search for alternative store-of-value assets have pushed investors towards Bitcoin. In an era of quantitative easing and depreciating fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against economic uncertainties. Increasing Institutional Adoption: Beyond ETFs, major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This institutional validation lends credibility and stability to the asset class, moving it further into the mainstream. This remarkable climb in global assets highlights Bitcoin’s growing maturity and its undeniable presence on the world stage, challenging traditional financial paradigms. Understanding the Significance: Bitcoin vs. Traditional Giants To truly grasp the magnitude of Bitcoin’s achievement, it’s essential to put its market cap into perspective against other leading global assets . Surpassing Amazon, a tech behemoth with diverse revenue streams and a long-standing presence in global commerce, is no small feat. This comparison isn’t just about market value; it’s about the fundamental nature of these assets. While Amazon represents a centralized, innovative company driven by consumer demand and technological advancements, Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency, a protocol, and a network. Its value is derived from its network effect, security, scarcity, and utility as a censorship-resistant medium of exchange and store of value. The fact that an intangible, decentralized digital asset can command such a significant valuation, surpassing established corporate giants, speaks volumes about the ongoing financial revolution. It signals a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate, powerful, and potentially transformative asset class. Analyzing the Current BTC Price and Market Dynamics The recent surge in BTC price to over $118,000, coupled with its $2.36 trillion market cap, reflects robust investor confidence and strong buying pressure. This isn’t just speculative fervor; it’s backed by fundamental shifts in market dynamics. The demand side, particularly from institutional vehicles like ETFs, has been consistently strong. On the supply side, the upcoming halving further constrains the flow of new Bitcoin, creating an imbalance that naturally pushes prices higher. Furthermore, on-chain metrics reveal a healthy market. Long-term holders continue to accumulate, indicating a belief in Bitcoin’s future appreciation rather than short-term profit-taking. Exchange reserves of Bitcoin are decreasing, suggesting that fewer BTC are available for immediate sale, which further supports price appreciation. The volume across major exchanges also remains high, indicating active participation from both retail and institutional investors. This period of significant price discovery is characterized by: Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and market depth contribute to more efficient price discovery and reduced volatility swings, making the market more attractive to larger players. Positive Sentiment: News of Bitcoin’s market cap milestone creates a positive feedback loop, attracting more attention and capital from new investors. Network Effect Reinforcement: As more individuals and entities adopt Bitcoin, its utility and value proposition strengthen, further solidifying its position. The current BTC price action is a clear indicator that the market is repricing Bitcoin, acknowledging its growing importance in the global financial ecosystem. The Accelerating Pace of Cryptocurrency Growth Bitcoin’s journey to the top five is emblematic of the broader phenomenon of cryptocurrency growth . While Bitcoin leads the charge, the entire digital asset ecosystem is expanding at an unprecedented pace. We are witnessing innovation across various sectors, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the emergence of new blockchain technologies. This growth is fueled by: Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in blockchain scalability, security, and interoperability are making cryptocurrencies more efficient and user-friendly. Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, increasing regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions is providing a more stable environment for businesses and investors to operate within the crypto space. Global Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies offer financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations worldwide, fostering financial inclusion on a global scale. Web3 and Metaverse Development: The vision of a decentralized internet (Web3) and immersive virtual worlds (metaverse) heavily relies on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, driving further innovation and adoption. The sustained momentum in cryptocurrency growth suggests that digital assets are not just a passing fad but a foundational element of the future economy. Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the entire market, and its current success is a beacon for the industry as a whole. Is Bitcoin Truly the New Digital Gold? The narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold has gained significant traction, especially in light of its recent performance and its position among top global assets . Just as gold has served as a traditional store of value for millennia, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a modern-day equivalent, offering unique advantages in the digital age. Here’s why this comparison holds weight: Feature Gold Bitcoin Scarcity Finite supply, difficult to extract Fixed supply (21 million coins), programmed halving Durability Physical, does not corrode Digital, indestructible on the blockchain Divisibility Can be melted, but less practical Highly divisible (to 8 decimal places) Portability Heavy, difficult to transport large amounts Easily transferable across borders with internet Verifiability Requires assaying to confirm purity Cryptographically verifiable, transparent ledger Censorship Resistance Can be confiscated by governments Highly resistant to censorship or seizure While traditional gold has its merits, Bitcoin’s digital nature offers unparalleled portability, divisibility, and resistance to censorship. In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, these attributes make Bitcoin a compelling alternative for preserving wealth. Its recent climb in market cap reinforces the idea that institutional and retail investors alike are beginning to embrace Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate, long-term store of value, solidifying its role as digital gold for the 21st century. Challenges and What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin While the recent milestones are undoubtedly impressive, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and potential challenges that lie ahead for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market is known for its dramatic price swings, and while the long-term trend has been upward, short-term corrections are always a possibility. Regulatory uncertainty, though improving, remains a factor, as different countries adopt varying stances on digital assets. Furthermore, competition from other cryptocurrencies and evolving technological landscapes could also present challenges. However, the future outlook for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly positive. Its fundamental properties – decentralization, scarcity, and a robust network – continue to strengthen. As global economies grapple with inflation and geopolitical instability, Bitcoin’s appeal as a neutral, borderless asset is likely to grow. Continued institutional adoption, further innovation in the blockchain space, and increasing mainstream understanding will likely propel Bitcoin to even greater heights, potentially challenging even larger global assets in the years to come. Actionable Insights for Investors For those looking to navigate the exciting world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand Bitcoin’s technology, its value proposition, and the risks involved. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and build a position over time. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history is marked by significant volatility. A long-term investment horizon often yields the best results, allowing you to ride out short-term fluctuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is powerful, it’s wise to diversify across different asset classes and even within the crypto space to manage risk. Secure Your Assets: If you hold Bitcoin directly, use secure wallets (hardware wallets are highly recommended) and practice strong security habits. A Lasting Impression: Bitcoin’s Enduring Legacy Bitcoin’s reclamation of the fifth spot among global assets is far more than a fleeting market cap milestone; it’s a profound declaration of its enduring power and its burgeoning role in the future of finance. This achievement solidifies its position not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate, transformative force that is reshaping how we perceive value, ownership, and financial freedom. As cryptocurrency growth continues to accelerate, Bitcoin stands as a beacon of innovation, a testament to the power of decentralization, and an increasingly vital component of a diversified investment portfolio. Its journey from an obscure digital experiment to a trillion-dollar asset, challenging the dominance of traditional giants, is a compelling narrative that continues to unfold, promising an exciting and potentially revolutionary future for global finance.

The token is now in presale, currently in stage 5 at $0.03. Over 65% of the phase has already been sold. Mutuum Finance has over $12 million raised with over 13,000 investors already. As Bitcoin’s whales tinker at the top, it’s MUTM’s cohesive roadmap, spanning presale traction, protocol utility, security credentials, and community incentives, that is stealing the spotlight this July. Bitcoin Inches Toward Key Levels, But Eyes Shift Toward Market Movers Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover near $108,300, stabilizing after whale wallets pushed fresh accumulation over the past week. While some analysts point to a possible 30% rally if BTC breaks above the $110K–$112K resistance zone, price momentum has cooled slightly despite over $50 billion in spot ETF inflows this year. The lack of a decisive breakout leaves BTC in a wait-and-watch phase, especially as legacy holders move dormant coins, adding caution to the bullish narrative. As Bitcoin’s trajectory hangs in the balance, investor focus this July is beginning to pivot toward emerging assets like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are showing stronger technical momentum and on-chain growth. Fast-Moving Support Fuels $12M Raise for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has attracted more than 13,000 investors with a raise of more than $12 million. Hype for the project is through the roof and this is clearly a very good sign of the project moving forward. MUTM tokens are $0.03 in phase 5 but will go up 16.67% in phase 6. This phase is already more than 65% sold out as investors scramble to get in at the lowest price. The demand is becoming exponentially excellent and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a disruptor in DeFi is even more precious considering that it will be one of the hot crypto investments of 2025. $100K in Rewards Available Through MUTM Giveaway Mutuum Finance is set to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Mutuum Finance has launched its Bug Bounty Program with the help and coordination of CertiK, and a reward pool of 50,000 USDT will be provided in total. Reward is in four levels namely; Major, critical, minor, and low so that each level of exposure will be rewarded. This is one more step confirming that Mutuum is a project with proactive safety attitude and its commitment towards establishing the environment favorable to the finances that can be trusted. While Bitcoin (BTC) inches toward a possible 30% breakout, it’s Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that’s commanding real momentum this July. With over $12 million raised, more than 13,000 investors, and Stage 5 already 65% sold out, the project’s traction is undeniable.

Despite the exuberance in the price, the data is less exciting. Miner Volume share and Exchange Volume are reminiscent of previous price peaks. Not all indicators are screaming sell though. MVRV and James Check's Euphoria Zone still show room to run. But the proliferation of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana 'Treasury Companies' reminds of prior manias. I'm staying long. But it never hurts to lock in some profit at new highs. In October 2017 , a biotech diagnostic company named Bioptix rebranded to Riot Blockchain. The stock doubled. That entity is currently known as Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ); a survivor of the 2017 'race to be a blockchain company' trend that saw numerous publicly traded entities abruptly projecting a loose connection to a trendy market idea. Not to be outdone by RIOT, it was December 2017 when a company called Long Island Iced Tea Corp. (LTEA) made headlines for changing its name to 'Long Blockchain Corp.' Shares of that stock more than tripled. That entity is now defunct. Not only that, but 'Long Blockchain Corp' proved to be a marvelous sell signal during that cycle: Data by YCharts Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) had peaked just four days prior to Long Blockchain Corp's name change announcement and proceeded to fall by over 85% over the next twelve months. Why do I share this story? Because nobody rings a bell at the top, but there will always be signs for those willing to decode them. That, and I'd imagine a good portion of today's crypto bulls weren't investing in stocks or paying attention to coins during the 2017 run. I was and I find what we're experiencing in the market today to be an uncomfortable reminder of the hysteria of that time. 'Treasury' is The New 'Blockchain' Are Bitcoin miners pivoting to high-performance computing and AI? That's so 2024. 2025 is about K-pop companies and struggling mining outfits flipping to Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) and Solana USD ( SOL-USD ) Treasury businesses. Such is the case with BIT Mining Limited ( BTCM ). A company that now plans to pivot operations to a Solana Treasury company . Following the company's detail-starved press release, the stock closed higher by more than 150% on over 160 million shares traded on July 10th. Not bad for a ticker that had a 30-day average share volume of just 64k the day prior. BTCM is just the latest example of a small-cap company attempting to generate unjustified buying of its stock using crypto as a hype engine. But I won't just pick on BTCM, we've been seeing this for months: Upexi, Inc. ( UPXI ), DeFi Development Corp. ( DFDV ), and Sol Strategies Inc. ( CYFRF ) with Solana. SharpLink Gaming, Inc. ( SBET ), BTCS Inc. ( BTCS ), and Bit Digital, Inc. ( BTBT ) with Ethereum. Metaplanet Inc. ( MTPLF ), GameStop Corp. ( GME ), Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ), and too many other companies to list with Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin miners have been issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin—an asset that they're in the business of selling. But there's an old principle that generally works in business; when everyone is doing it, it stops working. Are we at the point where 'everyone' is buying crypto to juice stock market returns? Of course not. But we're quite clearly experiencing a phenomenon that hearkens back to the 'blockchain' moment in 2017 or the 'dot com' bubble before that. And while there will no doubt be some who believe Bitcoin is a special unicorn, immune from a downturn in digital assets; it won't be. Just as it wasn't in 2017. Cycle Top Indicators There are various metrics we can consider when we're trying to figure out when it's the right time to start lightening up a BTC position. One metric that I like a lot is the holders who are in/out of the money at any given time. Of course, at all-time highs, you're going to have a lot of winners—and we certainly do today: BTC, In/Out of Money Trend (IntoTheBlock) But I think the reason why this chart above is helpful is that it can give us a sense of cycle maturity. When I look at the holders in the money staying above 90% for most of the last 15 months, it seems quite similar to the 2017 bull run to me. Where the 2021 bull cycle ended with an explosive double-top, the 2024/5 vintage has been more of a grind with several multi-month consolidation periods along the way—just like 2017. A metric that is looking quite similar to the 2021 run is the miner's volume share: Miners Volume Share (IntoTheBlock) This is the percentage of on-chain volume derived from miner addresses. At present, this figure has fallen to 4.3%. A sign of a healthy network with robust usage would actually be one where miner volume continues to go down over time. Yet, monthly transactions and volume in recent months have been well below last year's highs. This is likely an indication that miners are simply HODLing to a larger degree than they were when the miner volume share was higher. But again, the last cycle showed an aggressive rally to a marginal nominal new high. That action was accompanied by a collapse in the miner volume share. We're starting to see that again now. Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score (CoinGlass) Some of the other metrics that are worth considering for Bitcoin cyclical indications are the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, MVRV Ratios, and the Mayer Multiple. I've covered these in past articles and am showing the MVRV Z-score in the chart above. This is important; none of these metrics are currently indicating a sell signal . In fact, some of them might even be foreshadowing a BTC price closer to $150k. Maybe Bitcoin will get there, maybe it won't. We'll find out. What I do want to share is the Euphoria Zone chart from well-regarded Bitcoin analyst James Check: Bitcoin Euphoria Zone (CheckOnChain) We are not currently in a ""Euphoria Zone,"" which is triggered when the MVRV gets overheated. But we have seen two distinct Euphoria Zones already this cycle, three if you count the all-time high that happened in early 2024 just before the official halving event. We commonly get several of these Euphoria Zones during a cycle. It's certainly possible we get another one this year, but I'm personally not expecting a long drawn-out one in the event we get it. Price Action I'm going to share two price charts that I think will be quick and easy to understand. The first is the weekly: Bitcoin Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) While there's a clear RSI divergence to be aware of here, I actually think this chart looks pretty good. All major MAs are headed higher, the coin is leaving the station as far as the 8-week MA is concerned. The weekly implies higher prices in my view. But this isn't the only time frame to consider. I'm far less convinced about the monthly: Bitcoin Monthly Chart (TrendSpider) In this chart, I've connected the peaks from the last two cycles to estimate a rough trend resistance. We're there. To be sure, Bitcoin is attempting to break out above it. But we've seen a similar attempt failed in the past—April 2021 being a good example. Again, we have RSI divergences. And even the volume trend looks underwhelming. My chart is showing Kraken volume rather than Binance, but most exchanges have volume generally declining. Blockchain.com aggregates volume from multiple exchanges. It speaks for itself: 30-Day Average Exchange Volume (Blockchain.com) We have a coin price ripping higher while exchange volume is collapsing. We've seen this before and it foretells a nearing peak. Closing Thought Am I saying sell all your coins today? Absolutely not. You could actually talk me into Bitcoin being at the beginning of a halving cycle blow-off phase that could realistically take it to $125-150k in the weeks/months ahead. I share all of these charts and past signals as a reminder; history doesn't repeat but it rhymes. The behaviors we're seeing in today's equity market are highly reminiscent of what we observed back in 2017. Locking in wins can be difficult at all-time highs. For me, I think there is enough in the data to justify locking in a portion of this win. To be sure, I'm still very much long Bitcoin both on-chain and through the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ), but I've now taken some of it off at $118k BTC.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800727-amid-fresh-bitcoin-all-time-highs-bearish-signals-are-mounting?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE","ETH-USD|SOL-USD|BTCM|BTC-USD",cryptocompare

The token that once attracted millions of followers now trades at $0.465 , dangerously close to its all-time low of $0.400 . Even the recent Pi2Day celebration failed to inject momentum into the struggling altcoin, which has suffered a devastating 26.4% decline over the past two weeks. The technical indicators paint an increasingly bearish picture for Pi Network. The cryptocurrency has established a negative correlation of -0.27 with Bitcoin, meaning it moves in the opposite direction to the market leader. Technical Outlook: Pi Network Still Bearish – But a Breakout Could Flip the Script Pi Network remains locked in a firm downtrend, trading within a descending channel that has defined price action since its post-launch peak. Each rally attempt has failed at the upper boundary of the channel, reinforcing it as a strong resistance zone. Source: TradingView The volume profile also shows muted participation, with declining volume throughout the downtrend, suggesting that buyer conviction remains low. Despite that, the RSI has climbed to 55.46 – a neutral but improving signal that could indicate momentum is starting to shift. While the current setup still leans bearish, a confirmed breakout above the descending channel could trigger a sharp reversal. In that scenario, PI could target key resistance levels at $0.98, $1.38, and $1.67 – with the potential for a sustained recovery if bullish momentum builds.

Market participants also took a bit of a breather after back-to-back record closes for the benchmark S&P 500 index ( SP500 ). The S&P ( SP500 ) was last -0.3% in afternoon trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) seesawed and was last -0.2% , and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) was last -0.7% . Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. In addition, Trump said he would impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on other remaining countries. “Stocks are not quite desensitized to tariff headlines just yet. We are still seeing knee-jerk reactions to negative trade headlines. Volatility is an opportunity for investors who are still too exposed to cash,” said Michael Landsberg, CIO at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 8 basis points to 4.43%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 3 basis points to 3.92%. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget showed an unexpected surplus of $27B in June, when it was expected to be in deficit by $41.5B.

The flagship coin surged over 3.8 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a new all-time high (ATH) of about $118,885, which was set during the mid-London session on Friday, July 11. Following the sustained bullish sentiment, heavy crypto liquidations, amounting to over $1.2 billion, were recorded in the past 24 hours. Out of the entire crypto liquidations today, short trades amounted to over $1 billion, whereby BTC’s share was around $567 million. As Coinpedia had previously reported, Bitcoin’s cumulative short liquidation leveraged trades entered at around $112k amounted to $12 billion. With Bitcoin price having surged above $118k, a short squeeze has been triggered and the sellers have now turned bullish. Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Has More Upside Momentum Bitcoin will continue to experience bullish sentiment in the coming months, largely fueled by rising demand from institutional investors. For instance, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs recorded the highest cash inflow, of about $1.18 billion in the past few months. BlackRock’s IBIT has led in the net Daily Cash Inflow, whereby it currently has more than $80 billion in net cash under management. According to data compiled by BitcoinTreasuries , Strategy and Metaplanet have continued to lead dozens of companies holding BTC in their respective treasuries. BTC price will continue to experience bullish sentiment fueled by the growing global money supply. Furthermore, more countries are forming alliances to ditch the U.S. dollar, as observed with the BRICS movement, thus weakening the greenback amid its ongoing depreciation. How to Trade Crypto Summer During a crypto summer, almost the entire crypto market experiences bullish sentiment fueled by sustained optimism and growth. Capital rotation happens from the largest crypto projects to the smallest by market cap. From a technical analysis standpoint, considering oversold crypto tokens, including memecoin, with immense potential to disrupt the web3 space will likely offer higher returns. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market has a similar vibe in 2025 to the crypto summer of 2017, which resulted in one of the largest bull runs ever recorded. The narrative is bolstered by the fact that the U.S. President Donald Trump ruled in 2017 and is the current leader.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-experiences-impact-of-a-12b-short-squeeze-here-is-how-to-prepare-for-imminent-crypto-summer/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T18:14:12,"Bitcoin Breaks ATH, Hayes Flips Bullish: ‘Maelstrom Is Backing Up the Truck’","BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has decisively flipped bullish and even announced that Maelstrom Fund is “backing up the truck.” The exec’s comments came as Bitcoin (BTC) broke through its all-time high above $118K on strong volume. He also revealed that Ethereum (ETH) began to follow with potential outperformance, and markets began pricing in a Trump administration’s readiness to ease trade tensions. From Bearish to Bullish This pivot follows Hayes’ prior cautious stance, which was rooted in concerns about a Treasury General Account (TGA) refill draining liquidity. In his previous essay, Hayes explained that the US Treasury Secretary, whom he calls “The Big Bessent Cock (BBC),” faces an impossible task: funding ballooning deficits without causing a bond market revolt. To manage this, the government is turning to innovative liquidity engineering, including stablecoin adoption by “too big to fail” (TBTF) banks, which could unlock up to $6.8 trillion in T-bill buying power. Hayes also noted that if the Fed stops paying interest on reserves, it could unleash another $3.3 trillion, bringing the total potential liquidity injection to $10.1 trillion. He argued this approach was the modern replacement for QE, by maintaining equity markets and crypto afloat despite the Fed’s tightening posture. The exec warned that the TGA refill could briefly interrupt crypto’s bull momentum. Despite this, Bitcoin’s resilience in busting through resistance while Ethereum appears to be positioning for a “monster alt season.” “Frontloading Ahead of Trump Tariffs” Adding to this backdrop, QCP Capital, in its latest analysis, also identified frontloading ahead of potential Trump tariffs as a key macro driver. Manufacturers are accelerating imports and production to preempt implementation, which has led to increased trade and manufacturing credit and improved liquidity conditions. The firm views the current environment as supportive for continued crypto upside, with steady ETF inflows and strong structural demand boosting momentum.

2025-07-11T18:10:58,"BITU: Should You Buy This Leveraged ETF With Bitcoin At All-Time High?","Summary BITU is a 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF best suited for active traders aiming to time short-term market moves, not long-term investors. Despite Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs, BITU underperformed YTD due to volatility and the inherent risks of leveraged ETFs, including value decay. I remain very bullish on Bitcoin long term but would avoid entering BITU at current levels, preferring to hold Bitcoin directly instead. My hold rating on BITU reflects its high risk, underperformance in volatile markets, and suitability only for tactical, short-term trades. I last covered the Proshares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) in December 2024 , arguing how this is an ETF only suitable for active traders. Today, I am revisiting this ETF and asking myself a different question: with Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) hitting new all-time highs, would it make sense for a risk-prone investor to enter a trade in BITU to maximize future gains? BITU: Performance Since My Last Coverage In December, at the time of my last BITU coverage, Bitcoin was worth ~$101,000 per coin. At the time of writing, after some volatility and correcting down to the mid-80Ks, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of ~$119,000 per coin. So, how did BITU perform? In line with what I described in my last coverage, BITU underperformed its underlying crypto asset YTD by almost 20%, as the table below shows. BITU vs. IBIT; YTD (Seeking Alpha) This underperformance happened by design. BITU, like all leveraged ETFs, faces challenges during volatile periods. Its high leverage magnifies both profits and losses, making recovery from steep declines difficult. When the underlying index falls sharply, the daily rebalancing needed to sustain 2x leverage gradually reduces the ETF's value, leading to underperformance compared to the unleveraged index, even if the market later reaches new all-time highs. This is exactly what happened YTD, with Bitcoin suffering a steep decline in price around the end of April and BITU not managing to recover yet , even as Bitcoin hit new ATHs. BITU: ETF Profile and Evolution The BITU ETF is a leveraged fund that “seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of the Bloomberg Bitcoin Index.” Rather than directly owning Bitcoin, BITU employs financial tools like swaps to track and double Bitcoin’s daily price changes. This approach shields BITU from custodian risks faced by standard Bitcoin ETFs. However, it carries counterparty risk, as the fund depends on instruments issued by financial entities, such as investment banks, which are among the swap providers for the fund. Like every leveraged fund, BITU charges a hefty 0.95% expense ratio (which I find reasonable given the nature of the fund and cost of leverage). BITU also has good liquidity metrics, with a Bid/Ask spread currently at 0.04%, significantly less than the 0.06% that it registered in December at the time of my last coverage. I see this as a positive development in the context of the objective of the fund. It means, in my opinion, that active traders are using BITU consistently , improving its liquidity. BITU’s AUMs are just slightly above what they were in December. They increased by $50 million, equivalent to ~4% of the $1.26 Bln AUM figure. Timing the Bitcoin Market With BITU: Not for Everyone I think the only sensible way to use leveraged ETFs is by holding them short-term when trying to time the market. This is a concept I described in my previous work on Seeking Alpha, including in my recent coverage of a semiconductor leveraged fund that may be a good play in case of a new AI Wave . BITU is no exception. Traders who believe we are on the cusp of a sustained Bitcoin bull run in the upcoming months may want to consider entering at this point in time to maximize their gains. Personally, I am a long-time Bitcoin bull. Having recently covered my thoughts on Bitcoin developing as a global reserve asset based on on-chain data , my bull case remains that of Bitcoin maturing into an asset that rivals gold in market capitalization. I have a target of roughly $750,000 per Bitcoin. However, I also refrain from short-term Bitcoin predictions, and I do not actively trade it. I do believe that we may see further volatility ahead before Bitcoin actually matures into a reserve asset. In fact, I believe it may take longer than many expect to get there, as institutions will take time to actually adopt a prominent “holding behavior”. This is again something readers can see in my previous Bitcoin work , and that I won’t cover in more detail in this article. In a scenario where I was forced to only be exposed to Bitcoin with leveraged products, today I would wait. While I am not using Technical Analysis to predict short-term Bitcoin movements, I do like the “Fear and Greed Index ” as a gauge of short-term price movement. This is an index that measures investor sentiment, using factors like volatility and trading volume on a 0–100 scale. Low scores (0–25) reflect fear, indicating caution, while high scores (75–100) show greed, pointing at overconfidence. Fear & Greed Index, BTC (Coin Market Cap) The Index is currently signalling the beginning of a new “Greed” phase , with the previous “Fear” phase in March, which corresponded to the bottom of Bitcoin in the mid $80Ks. Based on this index, I do expect the bull run to continue for the immediate future (we are still only at the beginning of a greed phase). But I would still not take the risk of entering BITU now. In conclusion, I would tread carefully and only enter a trade in BITU now if I were an active trader convinced we were going to see new ATHs in the upcoming weeks and months. Risks of Leveraged ETFs The main risk of BITU, as a 2X leveraged fund, is that of underperformance of its underlying asset (Bitcoin) in case of volatility. In my past article on BITU, I explained this risk with an example, which I report here below: – Assume a 2x leveraged ETF based on an asset worth $100. – A -5% move in the underlying asset results in a -10% move for the ETF, reducing its value to $90. – To recover to $100, the ETF needs to gain more than 10% because it’s now starting from a lower base. – If the underlying asset recovers to $100 with a +5.26% move, the leveraged ETF will only gain +10.52%, bringing it to $99.47, not $100. This illustrates the fundamental issue with a fund like BITU. Other risks include its hefty expense ratio (should investors hold it for longer periods of time) and generally the higher volatility of the fund. Conclusion When investing, as the old adage goes, one should try to “ Buy Low, Sell High ”. Of course, this is easier said than done, which is why for most investors (me included) a long-term hold approach is preferable. Personally, I would not enter a 2X leveraged position in Bitcoin via BITU as the cryptocurrency reaches new ATHs. I would rather simply hold Bitcoin long term (which is exactly what I am doing). If I really were to use a leveraged product like BITU, I would prefer to do so when fear hits the crypto market rather than when we are entering a new greed phase. However, some people may disagree, and based on their own assessment (including Technical Analysis or other data points), they may believe we are on the verge of repeatedly seeing new ATHs. For these investors, entering BITU today could actually make sense as it maximizes their exposure and potential gains. My final “ hold ” rating for BITU does not reflect bearishness towards Bitcoin (on the contrary, I am very bullish on Bitcoin long term ), but rather the peculiar, leveraged nature of this fund and its objectives.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800722-bitu-should-you-buy-this-leveraged-etf-with-bitcoin-at-all-time-high?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT","BITU",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T18:10:34,"Bitcoin Price: Analyst Predicts Astounding $150K Target Within Months","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as leading voices weigh in on Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Fresh insights from a prominent crypto analyst suggest that the king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the verge of an astonishing surge, potentially hitting the $150,000 mark in the coming months. This bold BTC prediction is rooted in a fascinating market phenomenon: the parabolic trend . Understanding Kevin Svenson’s Astounding Bitcoin Price Outlook In a recent captivating YouTube broadcast, renowned crypto analyst Kevin Svenson shared his compelling analysis, indicating that Bitcoin is currently exhibiting a distinct parabolic trend . This pattern, often seen in assets undergoing rapid acceleration, significantly heightens the probability of a sustained upward movement. Svenson’s insights, highlighted by The Daily Hodl, point to a critical correlation: Bitcoin’s tendency to mirror the S&P 500 index when it achieves new all-time highs. Svenson emphasized that the current rally is not merely a fleeting bounce but appears to be the genesis of a structural uptrend designed to unfold over several months. This long-term perspective differentiates his analysis from short-term market fluctuations, offering a more robust framework for understanding Bitcoin’s potential growth. The analyst’s detailed examination of BTC’s weekly chart, combined with the classic parabolic trend diagram, underpins his projection for the Bitcoin price to enter the ambitious zone ranging from $140,000 to $150,000 in the foreseeable future. What is a Parabolic Trend and Why Does it Matter for BTC Prediction? A parabolic trend in financial markets refers to a chart pattern where the price of an asset experiences increasingly rapid gains, forming a steep, upward-curving trajectory that resembles a parabola. This indicates strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum. For a crypto analyst like Kevin Svenson, identifying such a trend in Bitcoin’s chart is a significant signal for several reasons: Accelerated Growth: It suggests that the rate of price increase is not only positive but is also accelerating, leading to exponential gains. Investor Enthusiasm: Parabolic moves often coincide with heightened investor interest and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), driving more capital into the asset. Breakout Potential: Once a parabolic trend is confirmed, it often precedes significant price breakouts to new all-time highs. Market Psychology: The visual nature of the curve can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, as more investors notice the rapid rise and jump in. The correlation Svenson draws with the S&P 500 is also crucial. Historically, when traditional markets like the S&P 500 reach new peaks, it often signals a broader risk-on environment, where investors are more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin. This macroeconomic backdrop provides a fertile ground for Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, bolstering the $150K BTC prediction . Beyond the Parabolic Trend: Other Factors Fueling Bitcoin’s Ascent While the parabolic trend is a compelling technical indicator, several fundamental factors also contribute to a bullish Bitcoin price outlook and support such ambitious targets: Bitcoin Halving Event: The quadrennial halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically leading to significant price appreciation in the months following the event. This supply shock, combined with steady or increasing demand, creates upward price pressure. Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds are now gaining easier, regulated access to Bitcoin, driving substantial demand. Macroeconomic Landscape: As central banks globally navigate inflation and interest rate policies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against traditional financial instability or as a digital store of value, akin to ‘digital gold.’ Growing Retail Interest: Renewed positive sentiment, driven by price surges and mainstream media coverage, often reignites interest from individual investors, adding to the buying volume. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including advancements in scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, enhances its utility and efficiency, making it more attractive for wider adoption. Navigating the Path to $150K: Challenges and Opportunities for Bitcoin Investors While the BTC prediction of $150,000 is exciting, it’s essential for investors to understand the inherent volatility and potential challenges in the cryptocurrency market. Even with a strong parabolic trend , market corrections can be sharp and sudden. A seasoned crypto analyst would always advise caution and due diligence. What are the Potential Hurdles on the Road to $150K? Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulations in different jurisdictions can introduce market volatility and impact investor sentiment. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns, severe recessions, or significant shifts in monetary policy could dampen risk appetite across all asset classes, including Bitcoin. Market Manipulation: Despite increasing market maturity, the crypto space can still be susceptible to large-scale market movements influenced by whales or coordinated actions. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events, such as major security breaches or technological vulnerabilities, could temporarily erode confidence in the digital asset space. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the Bitcoin Price Surge: For those looking to capitalize on the potential Bitcoin price surge, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not solely rely on single analyst predictions. Diversify your information sources and understand the underlying technology and market dynamics. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk assets, and significant price swings are common. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility. Long-Term Vision: While a $150K target within months suggests rapid growth, Bitcoin’s history is characterized by cycles. A long-term investment horizon often yields better results. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Follow reputable analysts and news outlets. Security First: Ensure your Bitcoin holdings are stored securely, preferably in a hardware wallet, to protect against hacks and theft. The Future of Bitcoin: A Glimpse into the Next Frontier The convergence of technical indicators like the parabolic trend and strong fundamental drivers paints a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s immediate future. Kevin Svenson’s $150,000 BTC prediction , while ambitious, is grounded in observable market behavior and historical precedents. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, captivating investors and analysts alike with its potential for unprecedented growth. Whether Bitcoin reaches this astounding target within months or takes a little longer, the underlying trend of increasing adoption, technological innovation, and its growing role in the global financial system suggests a bright future. The journey to $150,000, if it materializes, will undoubtedly be a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and its enduring appeal as a revolutionary asset.

2025-07-11T18:05:32,"‘This Could Very Well Be the Ultimate Bull Trap’ – Trader Issues Urgent Crypto Warning As Bitcoin Blasts Past $118,000","An analyst who became popular after accurately calling the 2022 crypto meltdown is warning that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) explosive move this week may be a bull trap. Pseudonymous analyst Capo tells his 970,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may suddenly correct after printing a new all-time high (ATH) of about $118,700 on Thursday. A bull trap is a false signal that indicates that the bearish trend is over, but then the price abruptly reverses course and witnesses a deeper drawdown. “This could very well be the ultimate bull trap. Staying cautious.” Capo says that the broader crypto market looks primed to potentially form a bull trap as well, as alts have yet to print bullish higher high price patterns. He also expects another black swan event, a rare and unanticipated event that catalyzes a massive market meltdown. “May was the local top for the market, with altcoins down 30%-50% from there. We’ve already seen a form of Black Swan with the Middle East conflict escalation, but I’m expecting another one. So far, this is still a lower high for alts, even if Bitcoin is making new ATHs due to buying pressure from institutional strategic reserves. In any case, invalidation levels are clear, and they haven’t been hit. Most altcoins remain in a clear downtrend, and some have even made new ATLs (all-time lows). The only crypto asset that has truly had a bull market is BTC, with a few other exceptions.” Capo also tells his 128,307 subscribers on the instant messaging platform Telegram that the TOTAL2 chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, is not yet invalidating a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) on the three-day timeframe. A head-and-shoulders pattern typically suggests that an asset is losing momentum and could reverse its uptrend if the price breaks below the structure’s support. “Despite BTC reaching a new ATH, altcoins remain at a clear resistance. Something feels very off. I don’t trust this move.” Source: Capo/Telegram At time of writing, TOTAL2 is trading for $1.31 trillion. Lastly, Capo says Bitcoin may be forming a blow-off top, a chart pattern in technical analysis showing a sudden rise in price that is followed by a sharp decline. Source: Capo/Telegram Looking at his chart, Capo suggests Bitcoin may correct to the $64,000 range. Bitcoin is trading for $117,317 at time of writing, up 5.4% in the last 24 hours.
