Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.69926729 11.27% Market Cap $ 24,745,809,849.0762 Trading Volume $ 1,536,754,324.3284 Circulating Supply 35,388,198,743.3986 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 The Cardano price is trapped in a long bleeding range in the entire H1 2025, but showed signs of recovery in late June, triggered by the ceasefire in the Iran-Israel-US short-term war. Over the last 20 days, it has recovered nearly 22% from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the second week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.63 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF and global sentiment rising as BTC jumped beyond its June high. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. Moreover, in the past 30-day span, Spot volume has peaked at $1.44 billion, daily active addresses have increased, and addresses holding between “10 million ADA to 100 million ADA” coins have peaked at 13.13 billion from a low of 12.81 billion. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year.

2025-07-11T07:51:07,"New Bitcoin Record At $118K: On-Chain Clues Reveal This Rally Is Different","Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to a fresh all-time high above $ 118,000, after gaining more than 6% over the past day. Despite this, on-chain data suggests the current rally remains far from overheated and instead hints at further growth potential. Room for Further Growth During the previous peaks in March and December 2024, the MVRV ratio climbed above 2.7 as speculation intensified. The current high, on the other hand, comes with a more moderate reading of 2.2 and reflects a steadier market environment. According to CryptoQuant, UTXO data show that short-term holders (under one month) now make up just 15% of the market. This is down from 30% during previous highs, which indicates limited new capital inflows and a cautious investor profile. At the same time, the SOPR for short-term holders means that recent buyers are not aggressively selling, but are keeping sell-side activity muted. The Miner Position Index (MPI) also continues its downward trend, which points to restrained selling activity as many mining firms opt to accumulate Bitcoin rather than liquidate. Such behavior contrasts sharply with past cycles when rising prices led to rapid distribution as spot and derivatives traders rushed to exit. Instead, this rally appears to be backed by strategic adoption from nation-states and corporations, and therefore, suggests the possibility of a structurally different bull cycle. CryptoQuant went on to explain, “As a result, analyzing on-chain data today requires deeper and more contextual interpretation, rather than relying solely on repetitive historical patterns. Because this recent breakout to a new high occurred without signs of overheating, there is solid potential for further price appreciation in the mid-to-long term.” This pattern of cautious optimism extends further. Data reveals that even amid the price surge, traders remain hesitant to move coins back to exchanges. Traders Are Holding Tight Bitcoin has posted almost a 20% price rise since its June 22nd local bottom, yet traders are not rushing to move coins back onto exchanges, according to Santiment. Instead, holders continue to shift Bitcoin into self-custody wallets. In the past four months alone, exchange balances have dropped by 315,830 BTC, which is a 21% decline. The five-year picture is even more significant. Since July 2020, 1.88 million Bitcoin have moved away from exchanges, thereby reducing balances by 61%. With fewer coins on exchanges, sudden mass sell-offs become less likely. This means that long-term investors are choosing personal storage over potential short-term trades.

2025-07-11T07:47:50,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.57787627 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction July XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.57787627 5.92% Market cap $ 152,270,479,776.33 Circulating Supply 59,068,187,926.00 Trading Volume $ 7,329,722,589.8967 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction July In H1 2025, the XRP price action shifted from a decline to a consolidation phase. In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely, XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. Source: Tradingview On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC. Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . Meanwhile, another positive development in July reveals that Ripple has applied for a U.S. banking license , enhancing credibility. The market sentiment has shifted, and with a wave of optimism sweeping through in July, the upper border of the falling wedge has been breached near the key $2.40 resistance. This surge was fueled by strong momentum as Bitcoin crossed the $112,000 mark , reaching a new all-time high of $117,985. Also, a short-term golden cross has formed between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs in the XRP price chart, which signals robust momentum. As XRP crypto approaches mid-May’s peak, a break above $2.60 could ignite a rally toward $2.95 in the short term, with the potential to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. Source: Tradingview The recent 20-day momentum is supported by increasing investor interest and positive developments, leading to a rise in exchange outflows. Technical indicators on the XRP price chart reveal a spike in money inflows, pushing the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) value up to 0.19 from this week’s low of 0.04. Meanwhile, the MACD and Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms have turned bullish, suggesting a sustained short-term rally. However, caution is warranted as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 74, indicating overheated conditions. This suggests that XRP may need to consolidate to cool down before making another upward move in the short term. If XRP price fails to generate enough bullish momentum, it could retest the strong support at $2.40. A failure to hold above this level could lead to a flash crash, pushing XRP’s price lower. In the event that selling pressure resumes, the critical support at $2.10, which aligns with the 200-day EMA, becomes essential. Losing this support could result in a decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25.

The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T07:32:02,"XRP Price Prediction as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High","The post XRP Price Prediction as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP looks bullish right now . In the last seven days, the token has surged by 15.7%, with a 7% gain in the past 24 hours alone, pushing its price to $2.59. This upward momentum is turning heads across the crypto market, with analysts now hinting that $3 could be the next major target. CasiTrades, a well-known crypto analyst, shared a post on X noting that XRP is defying short-term bearish indicators and may be gearing up for a significant breakout. His analysis points to a larger move building under the surface despite bearish signals flashing on short-term timeframes. XRP Market Overview: Strong Momentum in Q3 2025 So far, 2025 has been an eventful year for XRP. In Q1, the price saw only a minor gain of 0.45%. Q2 showed stronger momentum with a 7.12% increase. But it’s Q3 where XRP has truly come alive—so far, the token has jumped 15.7%, with most of the rally coming after July 8. At the start of this month, XRP traded at $2.17. For the first week of July, it remained within a narrow range of $2.17 to $2.27. However, since July 8, the price has climbed steeply, gaining over 14%. In the last hour alone, XRP added another 1%, confirming strong short-term momentum. XRP Breaks Out: Analyst Sees Little Resistance Ahead According to CasiTrades, XRP has ignored signs of market exhaustion typically found on the 1-hour chart, indicating that a much larger move could be forming. He explains that XRP’s ability to push higher, despite bearish technical signals, is a sign of strength. Currently trading at $2.59, XRP is just 4% below the next key resistance level at $2.69. CasiTrades highlights that there is very little resistance between these levels, suggesting the token could reach $2.69 quickly if the bullish momentum continues. What’s the Ideal Entry Point for XRP? While the breakout is exciting, CasiTrades advises caution when chasing pumps. He recommends waiting for a solid pullback, ideally to the $2.45 zone. Historically, XRP has retraced to the 0.236 Fibonacci level after new highs, and this area could offer a low-risk entry. However, once XRP reaches $2.69, there are two likely outcomes. The price could either retrace to $2.45 or break above resistance and rally toward $3 or beyond. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025) , XRP Bull Run Ahead From a technical standpoint, XRP is showing strong momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 74.12, indicating the token is overbought. But XRP continues to trade above all its major moving averages, including the 50-day ($2.22), 100-day ($2.21), and 200-day ($2.36) lines. Despite the rally, volatility remains relatively low with an Average True Range (ATR) of 0.1021. This means the price action is steady and trending, rather than erratic, often a good sign in the early stages of a longer move. Conclusion XRP is clearly in breakout mode, outperforming much of the crypto market this month. With strong technicals, growing momentum, and minimal resistance ahead, all eyes are on the $2.69 level. If XRP clears that barrier, the road to $3 may come faster than expected. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T07:19:45,"Bitcoin surges past $118K all-time high without overheating as on-chain data signals more upside","Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $118,399 early on July 11 during Asian trading hours, marking another major milestone in the ongoing bull market. Yet, unlike past euphoric peaks, this breakout appears fundamentally calmer and more structurally sound. In a June 11 analysis , CryptoQuant contributor Avocado Onchain noted that several important indicators point to the market not being overheated. The MVRV ratio, which compares Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market value to its realized value, currently stands at 2.2. That’s well below the overheated levels of 2.7 seen during the March and December 2024 highs, pointing to relatively moderate speculation. There’s also been a noticeable shift in investor behavior. During earlier bull market tops, short-term holders, wallets that held BTC for less than a month, made up around 30% of the market. Today, that number has dropped to 15%. Fewer short-term players often means less volatility and a lower risk of sudden selloffs. Similar conclusions can be drawn from other indicators. There appears to be little sell pressure based on the lack of a significant spike in the Short-Term Holder SOPR, which measures profit-taking among recent buyers. You might also like: Here’s why Bitcoin hit an all-time high and can run to $120k Meanwhile, miners, often early sellers during market tops, are staying relatively quiet. The Miner Position Index has been drifting lower, and some mining firms appear to be accumulating rather than selling. Retail investors are also missing from the picture, according to another CryptoQuant analysis . Their “Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge” metric remains in the gray zone, a signal that retail traders have yet to re-enter the market. Retail frenzy has historically been associated with late-stage bull market peaks. Given that institutions and exchange-traded funds are still driving the trend, the current absence might indicate that the top is still a long way off. Looking ahead, short-term support levels may offer clues about where the market heads next. The $106,500 and $101,200 zones, which represent the average cost basis for holders who purchased Bitcoin in the previous one to three months, are being watched by analysts. The upward trend may continue if Bitcoin maintains its position above those levels. A drop below could trigger short-term selling but might also bring in new buyers. Overall, this rally appears to be more sustainable than previous ones. Bitcoin may have more room to rise without the chaos that frequently occurs near the top, as long as there is steady institutional interest, calm on-chain signals, and retail still largely on the sidelines.

2025-07-11T07:10:40,"Cryptocurrency rally: why did crypto go up today?","The cryptocurrency rally accelerated this week, with Bitcoin nearing the crucial resistance level of $120,000 and the Fear and Greed Index moving into the greed zone of 67. This article answers a common question: “why did crypto go up today?” Chinese crypto trading hopes The first main catalyst for the ongoing cryptocurrency rally is the optimism that Chinese companies will get involved in the industry. This optimism pushed most brokerage stocks to their highest levels in months. Further, a Shanghai regulator said that it would explore and intensify research on the industry. This is a significant development, as China banned cryptocurrencies a few years ago. Therefore, analysts expect that the country will ease rules for investing and trading these coins. Such a move will lead to higher volume since most of the Chinese trading happens “illegally.” Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETF demand The other main reason why crypto is going up today is the ongoing surge in demand for cryptocurrency ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs had a whopping $1 billion in inflows on Thursday, bringing the cumulative figure to over $51.3 billion. Similarly, Ethereum ETFs have over $383 million in inflows, pushing the cumulative figure to over $5.1 billion for the first time on record. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF has over $5.6 billion in assets, while Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH have over $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The other top crypto ETFs have also added more assets in the past few months. For example, the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP (XXRP) has over $189 million in assets, while the newly launched REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) has added $61 million in assets. These numbers indicate a substantial demand for these coins among investors. Analysts expect the SEC will approve several altcoin ETFs, including XRP, Solana, Bonk, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows are happening at a time when data shows that their supply on exchanges are in a strong downward trend. As such, high demand and low supplies will often lead to higher supplies. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts Cryptocurrency prices are also going up because of the rising hopes that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates later this year. In a statement on Thursday, Christopher Waller , a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, said that he supported cutting interest rates later this month. Donald Trump has called for the bank to cut rates by 300 basis points. This is notable since Trump is set to appoint the next Fed Chair who will replace Jerome Powell when his term ends. Powell may decide to either quit or remain at the Fed, where he will serve as governor. Trump will likely select a Fed Chair who will commit to drop interest rates sharply. He has even hinted that he may appoint a Fed Chair long in advance in a move to undermine Powell. Risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies often do well when the Fed is cutting rates. Bitcoin price strong technicals BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Crypto is going up because of Bitcoin’s strong technicals. It has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and a bullish flag. Also, it has remained above all moving averages, while top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have all rallied. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $150,000. Such a move will likely lead to more crypto market rally.

2025-07-11T07:09:26,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025)","The post Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has staged a powerful rally today, with the total market cap climbing over 5.24% in the past 24 hours to $3.65 trillion. Trading volumes exploded by 47.14%, reaching a staggering $208.23 billion, signaling massive participation behind the move. While the Fear & Greed Index holds at a neutral 67, momentum is clearly favoring the bulls. Why is the Crypto Market Up Today? We had numerous fundamental drivers today, ranging from record-breaking ETF inflows to aggressive short liquidations. Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.17 billion in net inflows on July 10 alone, while Ethereum continued to benefit from the momentum around its staking ecosystem and ETF developments. Meanwhile, marketers are closely watching the upcoming “Crypto Week” in the U.S. Congress on July 14, which could shape long-term regulatory clarity. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Bitcoin has led the charge with an impressive breakout to a new all-time high of $118,339.82, posting a 6.11% gain over the past 24 hours. The price pierced through the resistance at $117,000, on the back of aggressive short liquidations worth $570 million. This move triggered a cascade of stop losses and short covers, pushing BTC sharply higher. The record $1.2 billion in ETF inflows added fuel to the rally, effectively tightening the available supply on exchanges. Technically, the daily chart reveals an ascending triangle breakout with strong volume confirmation. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could test the $121,000 to $122,500 range in the next 24 hours. That being said, we cannot rule out the immediate support near $114,800, which could act as a retest level before another leg up. Check out our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Ethereum, too, saw significant upside today, climbing 8.76% to trade at $3,024.90. ETH saw a 32.7% jump in daily volume, hitting $37.26 billion. The recent rally was triggered in part by short covering, as the token reclaimed levels above the $2,600 “max pain” point from recent options expiry. Additionally, on-chain data reveals that whales accumulated $358 million worth of ETH in the past 24 hours, a strong sign of growing institutional confidence. Looking at the chart, Ethereum is breaking out of a cup-and-handle pattern on the 4-hour chart. With momentum on its side and RSI still below extreme overbought territory, ETH appears poised to test the $3,120 to $3,180 zone in the near term. Support is now seen at $2,920, which was a key resistance flipped into support. Also read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ripple XRP Price Prediction: XRP is no laggard either, climbing 6.55% on the day to trade at $2.58, supported by strong buying interest and a surge in trading volume to $6.83 billion. The main catalyst appears to be growing optimism around a final resolution in the long-running Ripple vs. SEC case. Reports hint at the final terms of the settlement being reached, boosting investor confidence. Technically speaking, XRP price broke above the key resistance level of $2.50 with increasing volume, triggering a bullish flag breakout. The MACD indicator on the hourly chart has flipped bullish, and price structure suggests continuation toward the $2.75 to $2.80 level in the short term. Support now rests at $2.45, which is likely to attract dip-buyers if the price pulls back. FAQs Why are crypto prices up today? The Crypto prices are rising today due to a combination of record ETF inflows, over $1 billion in short liquidations, whale accumulation in ETH, and optimism ahead of U.S. regulatory discussions set for July 14. Will Bitcoin price break out to another all-time high? Yes, if the bullish momentum sustains, BTC price could eye another ATH above $121k. How much is 1 XRP for?

2025-07-11T07:04:28,"Crypto scammer Nicholas Truglia sentenced to 12 years in prison for failing to pay $20m restitution","Hacker Nicholas Truglia’s 18-month prison sentence has been upgraded to 12 years after he failed to pay $20 million in restitution for the victim of a SIM-swap he conducted back in 2018. According to a report by the Inner City Press, a New York federal judge revised Truglia’s initial 18-month sentence to 12 years on July 10 after he failed to pay the mandated $20 million in restitution to his victim, crypto investor and promoter Michael Terpin. The new sentence exceeds federal guidelines by a significantly large margin, more than eight times the original sentence. The law recommends an extended sentencing to be between 51 and 63 months. However in Truglia’s case, he allegedly moved his stolen funds around and converted them to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and took a cut for himself, thereby violating his terms. A damning video of him speaking in a masked voice about how he would still get to keep his stolen crypto even after being in prison for 10 years convinced the judge to extend it to 12 years in prison. “If ten years are okay, I’ll be sentencing you to twelve [years],” said Senior Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.

He would then be returned to the Southern District of New York courthouse the following day and transported to a correctional center in Essex. Nicholas Truglia’s arrest chronology Nicholas Truglia was initially released from prison after serving 12 months of his sentence, under the condition that he had to repay the $20 million in damages to Michael Terpin. However, he failed to do so even after his release. Truglia was arrested again in May 2023 for allegedly violating terms of his supervised release after evidence surfaced of him moving around his crypto funds and purchasing luxury goods. Despite a contempt order, Truglia was released in November 2024 after the presiding judge allowed him to roam free as long as he was committed to paying his $20 million restitution. Instead he failed to do so and retained approximately $673,000 from cuts made. Back in December 2022, then-25-year-old Nicholas Truglia was sentenced to prison for 18 months for his participation in a SIM swap crypto scam that stole over $20 million worth of cryptocurrency from crypto investor Michael Terpin. He was able to gain access to the victim’s emails and other accounts by hijacking the Terpin’s phone number by replacing it with a SIM card he controlled.

2025-07-11T07:00:41,"Bitcoin Sees Coinbase Premium Recovery, But Strength Still Below June Peak – What It Means For BTC?","Yesterday, Bitcoin (BTC) finally broke above $110,000, hitting a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $111,999. Exchange data indicates that this latest surge was supported by a late rebound in the Coinbase Premium Gap, signalling a resurgence in spot demand from US investors. Bitcoin Breakout Supported By Coinbase Premium Recovery According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Enigma Trader, the Coinbase Premium Gap jumped from approximately 6.9 on July 7 to 48.8 by July 10. While this indicates renewed spot buying interest in the US, it still falls short of the June peak, when the metric exceeded 80. To explain, the Coinbase Premium Gap measures the difference in Bitcoin’s price between Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair), helping gauge US spot market demand. A positive premium suggests strong buying pressure from US investors, while a negative premium may indicate weaker domestic interest or stronger overseas demand. Enigma Trader emphasized that Bitcoin’s recent breakout wasn’t solely driven by derivatives. Instead, the growing Coinbase Premium suggests meaningful spot buying activity from US investors. However, the premium’s failure to match its June high implies that some large investors remain hesitant to chase the current rally – casting doubt on whether the bullish momentum can be sustained without stronger follow-through. BTC To Benefit From Fresh Liquidity? In another CryptoQuant Quicktake post, contributor SunflowrQuant suggested that Bitcoin could benefit from fresh liquidity entering the market. The analyst pointed to two key metrics – the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). For the uninitiated, the SSR reflects the amount of “dry powder” available to purchase BTC. It is calculated by dividing Bitcoin’s market cap by the total supply of stablecoins. A higher SSR suggests reduced buying power, while a lower SSR indicates an abundance of capital waiting to be deployed. Recently, the SSR has surged to 18 – its highest level in two years. Meanwhile, the MACD has also crossed above its signal line, a move that often precedes renewed market inflows and rally potential. SunflowrQuant added: While price is carving new highs, this “new fuel” signal is promising; still, unless we see expanding volume and SSR cooling back toward the 16–15 zone, the $113,000-$115,000 area looks attractive for profit-taking, whereas a weekly close below $99,000 should be treated as a stop-loss trigger. From a technical standpoint, conditions remain favorable. Analyst Merlijn The Trader recently noted that BTC has broken out of a bullish descending broadening wedge pattern and may now be targeting as high as $144,000. However, macroeconomic risks remain. For instance, if the US Federal Reserve chooses not to cut interest rates, Bitcoin’s rally could stall .

2025-07-11T07:00:37,"Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time","The Bitcoin open interest has risen rapidly once again, with the price pushing above previous peaks to new all-time highs. The BTC price has also stayed over the $100,000 mark for an extended period of time, triggering a new wave of confidence that the cryptocurrency has found its bottom. This has led to crypto traders making their bets and driving the open interest up, pushing it back above December 2024 levels and May 2025 peaks. Bitcoin Open Interest Crosses $70 Billion Again Back in December 2024, the Bitcoin open interest had recorded a new milestone after the volume rose to over $70 billion, marking a new all-time high at the time. The Bitcoin price had also risen sharply at this time and was able to hit $100,000 for the first time in history, triggering even more interest in the asset. Related Reading: Last Crash Before The Surge: Why Bitcoin Is Set To Drop Below $107,000 However, once both the price and the open interest hit these milestones, it wasn’t long before the shorters began to take over the market. The Bitcoin price quickly plummeted back down below $100,000, and over the next few months, open interest would crash back down to the $40 billion territory, resulting in a 40% loss by May 2025. Now, once again, the Bitcoin open interest has crossed the $70 billion mark, sitting close to the $77 billion peak recorded back in May 2025, data from Coinglass shows. In the same vein, the BTC price has been able to maintain above $100,000 and has hit a new all-time high of $117,000. Going by historical performance, it is likely that the Bitcoin price will continue to rise from here, but this break to new all-time highs could carry bearish implications. This is because it is possible that the trend from December 2024 could play out once again. If this happens, then the Bitcoin price could retrace after hitting new highs, an expected correction as shorts pile up. BTC Price Risks Another Crash As the Bitcoin open interest continues to rise and the price has already broken out to new highs, the expectations of a downtrend have become stronger. NewsBTC reported that crypto analyst FriendlyRox expects the Bitcoin price to crash by almost 50%, putting the target as low as $60,000 by the time it’s done. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP’s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated Crypto analyst and market expert Capo of Crypto has also joined the train, predicting a notable crash event that will send Bitcoin below $100,000 and obliterating altcoins in the process. This comes as institutions are piling into the crypto market, with Bitcoin in the lead, and Capo forecasts a possible ‘Black Swan’ event like the COVID crash.

2025-07-11T06:46:01,"Here’s why Hyperlane price has surged over 100% today","Hyperlane’s native token, HYPER, extended its rally for a second consecutive day following its listing on two premier South Korean exchanges. According to data from crypto.news, Hyperlane ( HYPER ) rallied to an all-time high of $0.66 on July 11, morning Asian time, before stabilizing near $0.61 at the time of writing. This marks a 100% gain in the past 24 hours and a cumulative increase of over 450% over the last two trading sessions. The rally unfolded in a markedly high-volume trading environment, with daily turnover exceeding $4.1 billion, an increase of more than 3,000% from prior averages. Concurrently, open interest in HYPER futures contracts climbed 147% to a record $186.5 million, indicating growing speculative interest and positioning from derivatives traders anticipating further upside. This sharp price appreciation is primarily attributed to the token’s listing in KRW trading pairs on both Upbit and Bithumb . While HYPER had previously been available in BTC and USDT pairs on Upbit since late May, the earlier listings led to only modest gains . The new KRW pairings, however, seem to have enhanced accessibility and liquidity for South Korean investors, resulting in an immediate surge in buying activity . You might also like: Bitcoin price prediction July 2025: Will BTC hit new all-time highs this summer? The strong demand for the KRW trading pair among South Korean investors is clear from the fact that most of today’s trading volume came from Upbit, which recorded $2.6 billion. Binance and Bithumb followed with $384 million and $246 million, respectively. For the uninitiated, Hyperlane functions as a permissionless interoperability protocol, offering modular messaging and bridging solutions across Layer 1 chains, rollups, and app-specific chains. It enables developers to deploy freely, configure tailored security models, and build cross‑chain applications with ease. The HYPER token powers the protocol by supporting validator staking, protocol governance, and usage incentives. Hyper price analysis From a technical perspective, HYPER’s price broke out of a descending resistance trendline, invalidating over three months of bearish structure. HYPER 1-day price chart — July 11 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators, including the RSI and MACD, are both at multi-month highs, signaling strong bullish momentum. Importantly, neither indicator has produced a bearish divergence yet, supporting the case for continued upward movement. HYPER MACD and RSI chart — July 11 | Source: crypto.news The next significant resistance level lies at the psychological $7 mark, which, if broken, could open the path for further price discovery. However, the rally may face short-term resistance as exchange wallet balances have jumped by 34% in the last 24 hours, according to Nansen, now holding 34.54 million tokens. This is often a sign that early investors may be positioning to lock in profits, which could introduce some selling pressure in the short term.

Here Are The Predictions","Investments in options that predict the Bitcoin price will surpass $140,000 by the end of September have surpassed $868 million, according to data from cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit. The transactions in question consist of “call options,” which involve the expectation that the price will rise above $140,000 on the specified expiration date (September 26). Call options are known as products where investors take bullish positions.

While Bitcoin’s fresh all-time high helped, there’s more to this rally than just market momentum. According to popular crypto analyst Dr Altcoin, Pi may have already hit its lowest price, and we might never see $0.40 again. Here’s what’s giving him that confidence. Dr Altcoin Says $0.40 Was Pi’s Final Bottom Dr Altcoin believes Pi Coin’s recent dip to $0.40 may have been its last major low. It’s now been over a week since it touched that zone, and he sees no signs of it falling back, especially with a major shift happening in its token supply. According to Pi Scan data , the amount of unlocked Pi hitting the market will shrink by about 30%, dropping to just 116 million coins by the end of August. That means fewer coins available for selling, which could reduce pressure on the price and help it move higher naturally. It has been over a week since Pi dropped to the $0.4 range. It is unlikely to fall further, especially as we approach the end of August, when the amount of unlocked Pi is expected to decrease by at least 30%. If my prediction is correct, this month’s price will be the lowest Pi… pic.twitter.com/CTcDgpmkza — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) July 10, 2025 Pi’s Big AI Bet Could Be the Game-Changer At the same time, Pi Network is entering the AI space with full force. Its new Pi AI Studio allows developers to build and launch AI projects within the ecosystem.

If Pi captures just 1% of the projected $16 trillion AI market by 2030, its market cap could reach $160 billion, a huge leap from its current $3.97 billion. That could send Pi’s price soaring past $22 in the long term , a 46x gain from where it is now. Bitcoin’s Rally Pushes Pi Higher Bitcoin’s rally to a new all-time high has also lifted the entire crypto market, and Pi is riding the wave. It recently broke above $0.45 and is now holding strong at $0.52. This is the token’s first real upward momentum this month, and many see it as a sign that Pi is entering a new phase of growth. Supporting this outlook, the MACD ( Moving Average Convergence Divergence ) indicator just flashed a bullish crossover. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to a July 11 announcement, Pump.fun has already begun integrating Kolscan’s features into its platform, describing the acquisition as a move that would “enable better products for both Kolscan and Pump.fun users” while introducing “totally new experiences” to the onchain trading space. we’re excited to announce that pump fun has acquired @kolscan Kolscan is a wallet tracker that monitors the activities of top onchain traders. it provides realtime transactions, token PnL, and a leaderboard ranking their performance our integration will not only enable better… pic.twitter.com/V4VDcOwVeG — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) July 10, 2025 Kolscan is a real-time analytics tool that tracks the activity of top onchain traders, also referred to as key opinion leaders (KOLs). It offers wallet-level insights into token holdings, live transactions, and trading performance. One of its central features is a dynamic leaderboard ranking traders based on their profit and loss performance, allowing users to monitor and compare the strategies of influential traders in the Solana ecosystem. You might also like: Bitget Wallet launches new Pump.fun integrated mobile app for meme coin trading Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen has confirmed that Kolscan will remain free to use, and the platform has planned a series of improvements to enhance data accuracy, speed up trade updates, and introduce new tools for tracking and copying top-performing strategies. Cohen said the acquisition aligns with his belief that “onchain trading is a social sport,” where users not only speculate but also trade alongside friends and compare performance. According to Cohen, products that “provide social insights/tools and gamify the trading experience” are key to Pump.fun’s continued growth. Previously, the token deployer had introduced the livestreaming feature , which was temporarily suspended and later relaunched with moderation systems in place after users began abusing the tool to broadcast harmful and violent content. Pump.fun’s move to acquire Kolscan also comes as the platform faces mounting pressure to stay ahead of the competition. After dominating the Solana memecoin scene earlier this year, its market share has slipped below 60% and revenue has also declined , while rivals like LetsBonk continue to gain traction. The integration of Kolscan may help Pump.fun reassert its edge by adding utility and transparency that go beyond simple token deployment. Meanwhile, the Kolscan acquisition comes just ahead of Pump.fun’s highly anticipated ICO and can be seen as a strategic move to bolster investor confidence by demonstrating the platform’s commitment to expanding its ecosystem and enhancing user experience through social and data-driven features. As previously reported by crypto.news, the ICO will offer 15% of the total PUMP token supply, equivalent to 150 billion tokens, at a price of $0.004 each. An additional 18% has already been sold to institutional investors under the same terms.

Source: Cryptonews The milestone comes as Bitcoin surges to new all-time highs above $118,400, creating perfect storm conditions for the second-largest cryptocurrency to begin its own parabolic advance. The breakthrough follows a grueling eight-month battle that saw Ethereum decline from January’s opening near $3,298 to its cycle low in April. Historical price data reveals a volatile journey through 2025, with February closing around $2,900, March at $2,650, and the devastating April collapse to $1,794 before recovery began. President Trump’s recent declaration on Truth Social that crypto is “ through the roof “ has triggered massive buying pressure across digital asset markets. Bitcoin price prediction as $BTC explodes past $113K record levels targeting $120K by tomorrow following Trump's explosive crypto endorsement declaring it's going ""through the roof"". $120K tomorrow? #Bitcoin #ATH #Trump https://t.co/QZaaKfinrt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 10, 2025 The timing of Trump’s endorsement, combined with unprecedented dollar weakness, has created ideal conditions for risk asset appreciation, with institutional investors interpreting this as a signal of continued monetary accommodation. The Ethereum breakout coincides with Bitcoin’s explosive rally past $117,000, which liquidated over $1.14 billion in leveraged positions within 24 hours. Over $243 million in Ethereum liquidations alone contributed to the market-wide short squeeze, which pushed both cryptocurrencies to new highs. Dollar Collapse Fuels Crypto Rally Across Major Assets Trump’s proposed 300-basis-point interest rate cut has created massive tailwinds for alternative assets, as the dollar experiences its worst performance since 1973. The Dollar Index has fallen 10.1% year-to-date, trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average, the largest margin in 21 years. The emergency-level monetary intervention into a growing economy, with an annual growth rate of 3.8%, would push inflation above 5% while driving the dollar down an additional 10%. Historical precedent warns against such aggressive policy, as the Federal Reserve has never implemented cuts exceeding 75 basis points outside recession periods. Kobeissi Letter analysis projects dramatic asset price inflation following potential rate cuts, with gold targeting $ 5,000 per ounce and continued capital flight into cryptocurrencies. It's official: President Trump is now calling for the first 300+ basis point interest rate cut in US history. This would be 3 TIMES larger than the 100 bps cut on March 15th, 2020, the largest in history. So, what happens if the Fed does this? Let us explain. (a thread) pic.twitter.com/k3Bo0ri1zY — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 Bitcoin’s correlation with dollar weakness positions digital assets as primary beneficiaries of monetary debasement and currency depreciation. Corporate treasury adoption accelerates as companies seek protection from currency debasement, with over $1 billion allocated to crypto treasuries this week alone. The institutional revolution combines with retail FOMO to create sustained buying pressure. Bitcoin ETFs have purchased $15 billion worth of BTC since mid-April , according to 10X Research, with steady institutional demand supporting higher trading ranges. Trump’s crypto-friendly policies include establishing a national crypto reserve and appointing pro-crypto officials to key regulatory positions. Technical Analysis Confirms Bullish Breakout Pattern Ethereum’s daily chart reveals a textbook breakout scenario following months of consolidation within a descending channel pattern. The asset spent considerable time forming lower highs and lows, ranging from $4,000 to $1,500, before breaking decisively above the Ichimoku cloud resistance. Source: SMART_MONEY_FLOW_SMF on TradingViews The Ichimoku cloud breakout represents a shift from bearish to bullish momentum, with price definitively reclaiming the psychological $3,000 level. The technical setup establishes $2,950-$3,050 as key support after the breakout, with ascending projections targeting $3,600, $4,200, and $4,800. In fact, according to MerlijnTheTrader , the weekly perspective provides even stronger bullish confirmation, showing a clean reclamation of the $2,200 resistance with minimal pullbacks. The price action indicates strong buying pressure across timeframes, with blue arrow projections extending toward $10,000 based on historical bull market patterns. The broader context of Bitcoin establishing new highs above $117,000 provides additional momentum for Ethereum, which historically outperforms Bitcoin in percentage terms during parabolic phases. Previous resistance levels at $4,000 represent the next major target given historical significance as cycle highs. Key risk factors include failing to hold above the $2,800-$2,900 support level, which could indicate false breakout scenarios and potential retests of the $2,200 levels. However, current momentum and institutional participation suggest a continued upward trajectory toward $4,000 initially. Based on technical indicators and market structure, Ethereum is positioned for continued appreciation toward $3,600-$4,200 in the near term, with the potential for an extension to $4,000+ if Bitcoin’s momentum sustains.

2025-07-11T06:30:56,"China Crypto Regulation Sees Growing Push for Yuan-Based Stablecoin","The post China Crypto Regulation Sees Growing Push for Yuan-Based Stablecoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News China is showing fresh signs of interest in digital currencies. Although crypto is banned, the interest hasn’t faded. From regulators to tech giants, enthusiasm for digital currencies, especially stablecoins, is heating up fast. A recent report from Reuters shows that Chinese regulators are renewing their focus on the sector. Shanghai Officials Explore Stablecoin Strategy This week, the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission held a key meeting with local officials to explore strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies. This shows a shift in tone in the country’s approach. He Qing, head of the Shanghai regulator, stressed the need to pay closer attention to new technologies and to do more research on digital currencies. The meeting was attended by about 60–70 people. Since Shanghai is China’s main financial center, it often takes the lead in testing new government policies and regulatory changes. At the meeting, a policy expert from Guotai Haitong Securities broke down the basics of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, discussed the global regulatory trends, highlighted the risks and opportunities of stablecoins, and offered policy advice for digital assets growth. Tech Giants Push For Yuan-based Stablecoin China tech giants like JD.com and Ant Group are also urging the central bank to allow Yuan-based stablecoins to compete with US-dollar-backed crypto. Both companies plan to apply for licenses in Hong Kong, where new stablecoin rules take effect on August 1. Stablecoins are gaining global momentum. With the U.S. ahead with advanced crypto regulations, major companies like Amazon and Walmart are also exploring stablecoin projects. Crypto Hype Meets Warning Signs However, making changes in China will not be easy. Just last month, central bank governor Pan Gongsheng warned that the rise of digital currencies and stablecoins brings major regulatory challenges. China banned crypto trading and mining in 2021 over concerns about financial stability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Australia Expands Digital Currency Trials with Project Acacia as CBDC Race Heats Up , Recently, a Chinese industry group has warned investors about scams linked to stablecoins. The Beijing Internet Finance Association said some groups are using the hype around stablecoins to promote fake high-return schemes disguised as financial innovation. The association has warned that these activities can quickly turn into crimes like illegal fundraising, fraud, pyramid schemes, and money laundering. Rising Interest in Digital Assets But the surge in interest is clear as an index tracking stablecoin-related stocks in China has jumped 88% over the past three months. A similar index in Hong Kong has more than doubled. Digital currencies are gaining ground fast. Bitcoin has been breaking records lately. Just today, it is up over $118,000, hitting a record high.

Despite its 2021 crypto ban, China is exploring digital currencies, especially stablecoins, to counter US dollar dominance in digital finance. Shanghai officials and tech giants like JD.com and Ant Group are advocating for yuan-based stablecoins to promote yuan internationalization and efficient cross-border payments. How is China’s interest in stablecoins impacting the market? The renewed interest is evident in the surge of stablecoin-related stocks: an index in China jumped 88% and a similar index in Hong Kong more than doubled over three months.

(Technical Analysis)","Summary Cryptocurrencies are in a frenzy, and this happens after months of muted performance and range-bound markets despite the cryptos’ tendency to generate lots of market movement. Daily Bitcoin charts are showing decent strength in the most recent moves up - particularly after war fears failed to create a strong reversal in prices. The latest gap down just breaching the $100,000 mark quickly got bought by dip buyers. With Bitcoin making all-time highs, it might drag up other altcoins with it. Some names like ADA, SUI, XRP and others are getting lifted by the newfound bullish sentiment. By Elior Manier A thesis of failed opportunities by sellers to send the crypto market to correct lower had been a sign of a potential move to new all-time highs, which just happened on Thursday. Cryptocurrencies are in a frenzy, and this happens after months of muted performance and range-bound markets despite the cryptos’ tendency to generate lots of market movement. A general trend of entries from financial institutions into cryptocurrencies, allowed by progressively lenient regulations, is bringing non-negligible flows and adding an even more solid backstop demand to digital assets. Traditional investors are progressively entering the most recent primary market through ETFs, with the latest ETF launch opening the door for Solana. This comes amid market participants trying to diversify from the US dollar. Trump’s frantic policy is creating significant uncertainty, particularly for the Federal Reserve, which is seeing chances of losing some of its political independence. The US President is doing the most to influence the Fed board members, regularly insulting Jerome Powell on his Truth Social. The latest move to all-time highs liquidated many participants who were betting on no more new highs for Bitcoin - you can take a look at these flows right here . A $600M liquidation won’t be enough to take markets to continuous all-time highs; however, with a real appetite for risk and technology investments (as seen with the Nasdaq making daily ATHs), the move might just continue. Bitcoin Daily and Intra-Day analysis Bitcoin Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart, July 10, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Daily Bitcoin charts are showing decent strength in the most recent moves up - particularly after war fears failed to create a strong reversal in prices. The latest gap down just breaching the $100,000 mark quickly got bought by dip buyers. Failed patterns in technical analysis tend to be major signs of reversals, as is currently the case in crypto markets. After breaching the $113,000 level, Fibonacci extensions (127% to 138%) point to potential resistance at $120,000, and a further breakout to potential key resistance at $135,000 (161.8%). You can check this guideline on how to spot potential resistances and new zones of interest in price discovery with Fibonacci extensions with this article. Bitcoin 2H Charts Bitcoin 2H Chart, July 10, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Range-bound conditions in the world's leading cryptocurrency had built up Volume-At-Price at its all-time highs - good conditions to launch the crypto to discover new levels. A fail to retest again the lower end of the 100,000-110,000 range led to buyers stepping in before, leading to the current impulsive move. A measured move using the previous impulse points to a 115,000 minor potential resistance. The RSI is largely overbought, which may calm the buying flows, however only temporarily. It will be interesting to look at the reaction to a potential retest of the 110,000 pivot to spot if more buyers step in. In the meantime, the direction has higher probabilities of more upside than downside, that is if nothing crazy happens in macro. Crypto Market Cap Crypto Total Market Cap, July 10, 2025 (Source: TradingView) The overall market cap still hasn't caught up to the December 2024 $3.86T highs, and the way this impulsive move is going, it seems that except for any surprising negative surprise or geopolitical turmoil, we should be at least going back to the previous highs. Markets are currently standing about 6% to the market cap highs. With Bitcoin making all-time highs, it might drag up other altcoins with it. Some names like ADA ( ADA-USD ), SUI ( SUI-USD ), XRP ( XRP-USD ) and others are getting lifted by the newfound bullish sentiment. Safe Trades!

Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of Bitcoin, has once again raised concerns about the growing number of companies turning to crypto. He argues that these firms lack solid business models and instead rely on speculative hype. Schiff described the current rush into crypto as a cycle of “fools chasing other fools,” where each wave of buyers simply hopes to offload their holdings to the next group at higher prices. While Bitcoin bulls celebrate a record-breaking year, Schiff urges investors to shift their attention to silver, a commodity he believes offers more sustainable growth. The logic behind Bitcoin or Ethereum treasury companies is to take advantage of foolish investors who are willing to pay larger premiums to buy stock … The post Peter Schiff Slams Bitcoin “Fools,” Points Out Silver To Outperform BTC This Year appeared first on Coin Edition .",coinquora,https://coinedition.com/peter-schiff-slams-bitcoin-pushes-silver/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|ASIA|ETH","Market|Market News|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-07-11T06:26:23,"Crypto Liquidations Top $1 Billion as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High","The post Crypto Liquidations Top $1 Billion as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the past 24 hours, more than $1 billion in crypto short positions were liquidated, according to data from Coinglass. The bulk of these liquidations came from traders betting against Bitcoin, just as the market saw another strong push upward , driven in part by continued ETF inflows and a supportive macro backdrop. Short positions worth $1.02B were liquidated in 24 hours https://t.co/uBQ0VD9qtJ pic.twitter.com/WkMN0FTTbC — ICO Drops (@ICODrops) July 11, 2025 This wipeout was led by Bitcoin futures, which accounted for $590 million of those liquidations. Ethereum futures were next in line, causing $241 million in losses. One of the biggest single hits was an $88.5 million short position on Bitcoin (BTC-USDT) on the exchange HTX. In total, about 237,000 traders were liquidated in this 24-hour period. The overwhelming majority, nearly 90%, were trying to profit from a market drop that never happened. Instead, they got caught on the wrong side of a powerful rally. However, most of the liquidations happened on Bybit and HTX. Bybit alone saw $461 million in liquidations, with over 93% of those being shorts. Binance and HTX followed closely with $204 million and $193 million in liquidations, respectively. Bitcoin ETF Demand Keeps Climbing Bitcoin touched a new all-time high above $118,000 today, with investor demand still rising through spot ETFs. Over $15 billion has now flowed into these products since they launched, and data shows institutional buying hasn’t slowed down. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF alone holds more than 700,000 BTC, and its rising revenue now rivals some of BlackRock’s biggest legacy offerings. Analysts suggest this kind of steady inflow is helping to stabilize price action and may continue to support Bitcoin through the summer. Traders Reposition Ahead of Potential Rate Cuts Alongside ETF demand, the broader macro environment is also playing a role. With Donald Trump pushing for aggressive interest rate cuts , potentially down to 1%, risk assets like Bitcoin are seeing renewed appeal. Traders are now positioning for what they expect could be a friendlier environment for crypto under future policy shifts. Many are piling into call options at higher strike prices, including $130,000, showing that sentiment remains strong. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Crypto Going Up Today ? , Altcoins Follow the Breakout Ethereum is also making headlines . In a rare flip, ETH surpassed Bitcoin in 24-hour futures volume, suggesting trader focus may be broadening beyond BTC. With growing expectations around a spot ETH ETF approval, Ethereum may be next in line for a surge in institutional attention. XRP jumped above $2.57, DOGE crossed $0.19, and Solana posted a 5% gain, all on the back of renewed market optimism. The broad-based rally suggests traders are rotating into altcoins after accumulating Bitcoin, anticipating wider market gains if ETF inflows and regulatory clarity continue. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T06:22:51,"Bitcoin hits new high above $118K as BTC ETFs see over $1B in inflows on Thursday","Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $118,000 early Friday, fueled by rising institutional demand and strong signals from across the crypto industry. As per CoinMarketCap data, the coin reached an all-time high of $118,403. The world’s largest cryptocurrency gained over 6% in the past 24 hours, trading at $118,376 at the time of writing. The rally coincided with a sharp spike in inflows to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which recorded $1.18 billion on Thursday—the second-highest daily total since their launch. Short-sellers were hit hard by the move, with more than $1 billion in crypto short positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. Of the $1.01 billion in liquidations, roughly $570 million came from Bitcoin shorts and $206.93 million from Ether shorts, affecting 232,149 traders. The broader crypto market also rallied, with total market capitalization rising 5% to $3.66 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC ETF inflows continue hot streak Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded massive inflows on July 10, with total net additions touching $1.18 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $448.5 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $324.3 million and Ark’s ARKB at $268.7 million.

Cumulatively, over the six trading sessions starting July 2, total net inflows across all issuers stood at $2.69 billion. The sustained buying reflects renewed institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated ETF products, amid improving sentiment in the broader crypto market. ETH breaches $3,000 Ethereum surged past $3,000 on Thursday, briefly touching the $3,030 mark for the first time in five months, as buying momentum gathered pace. The rally, echoing Bitcoin’s strength, was fueled by a combination of market-wide bullishness and strong inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. ETH gained over 6% in the past 24 hours and more than 15% over the last three days. US spot Ethereum ETFs saw net inflows of $383 million on the day, their fifth straight session of positive flows. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) accounted for the bulk of the activity, pulling in $300.9 million.

This comes amid a heated rally in the broader cryptocurrency market where BTC’s price just reached a new all-time high above $118,000. Ironically, some warning signs are starting to pop already. According to popular on-chain monitoring resource Lookonchain, a wallet linked to the Ethereum Foundation has sold 1210 ETH for 3.5 million USDC at an average price of around $2890 over the past hours. A wallet linked to the #EthereumFoundation sold 1,210 $ETH for 3.5M $USDC at an average price of ~$2,890 over the past 6 hours. https://t.co/2srVIybEGt pic.twitter.com/ez1k5Q6uT1 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 11, 2025 At the time of this writing, ETH’s price is trading above $3,000 for the first time since late February 2025. Source: TradingView But why is this a worrying signal? Well, there are certain things that the crypto community has playfully earmarked as bad news in the past few cycles. For instance, whenever you start seeing Jim Cramer talking about how Bitcoin is the greatest asset and that he owns millions of it, it’s time to unpack. The Ethereum Foundation selling has kind of been the same sign, at least on multiple occasions. The entity sells ETH to fund development and it’s usually offloading during rallies, oftentimes marking local tops. Of course, that’s not always the case. For example, last year, it sold different batches of ETH in September, October, and November, while the cryptocurrency achieved a local top in December. The post Top Signal?

2025-07-11T06:02:09,"Prominent Cryptocurrency Analyst Shares Scenario Predicting Bitcoin Price Day by Day: “First to $444,000, then…”","Cryptocurrency analyst Fred Krueger shared a noteworthy scenario during the days when Bitcoin reached historic highs. Titled “The Great Treasury Bubble,” this scenario fictionally chronicles how Bitcoin rose to $444,000 through institutional treasuries from August 2025 to August 2026, before falling dramatically to $84,000. Krueger's script progresses day by day as follows: August 11, 2025: With Bitcoin at $132,000, Japanese company Metaplanet purchased an additional 5,445 BTC, bringing its total holdings to a symbolic 21,000 BTC. This purchase was financed by a 100 billion yen BTC-backed loan from Goldman Sachs Japan and a new Strategy-like yield product, JSTRK. By the end of the day, BTC had risen to $138,000. August 21, 2025: US-based Strategy announced the acquisition of 20,000 BTC. Funding was provided through convertible bonds and balance sheet leverage. BTC exceeds $150,000. September 15, 2025: Companies like Galaxy Digital, Riot, and GameStop also joined the BTC treasury strategy. ETF inflows skyrocketed. BTC: $178,000. October 7, 2025: BTC surpasses $201,000. Strategy launches new high-yield institutional product, STRK+. January 12, 2026: BTC reaches $296,000. Metaplanet announced it refinanced its debt with 15% interest. JSTRK trading broke records in Osaka. April 6, 2026: Bitcoin peaks at $444,000. Strategy published its report, “Bitcoin is now the core currency of modern businesses.” It also hedged 3,000 BTC with bearish options. In Krueger's scenario, the collapse begins from here: April 16, 2026: Strategy sells 1,100 BTC to acquire waste management company AmeriPure. CFO: Wall Street shaken. May 18, 2026: Metaplanet acquired the logistics company OsakaLogix. 4,000 BTC was hedged. June 23, 2026: Internal Strategy memos leaked, claiming STRK+ investors were not paid. BTC collateral was seized. BTC fell 22% in one day to $330,000. July 10, 2026: Metaplanet announced it sold 6,000 BTC and shifted its focus to cash-generating sectors. BTC: $196,000. August 10, 2026: A year later, Bitcoin plummets to $84,000. The strategy is under regulatory scrutiny. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T06:00:53,"Solana Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle—Next Stop $164?","Solana has shown a potential breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle. Here’s where the next price target could lie, according to an analyst. Solana Has Surged Above Symmetrical Triangle Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Solana has just broken a resistance line. The level in question is part of a Symmetrical Triangle, a pattern from technical analysis (TA). This pattern belongs to the class of triangles, formations that involve the asset trading within two converging trendlines. The upper line acts as a source of resistance, while the lower one as that of support. A break out of either of these levels implies a continuation of trend in that direction. A surge above the triangle is a bullish sign and a drop under it a bearish one. Since the price’s range becomes narrower as it travels within a triangle, a breakout can become more likely as it approaches the apex. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype—$4.4B Inflows Back The Move Generally, triangle breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the height of the formation (that is, the distance between the upper and lower trendlines at their widest). There are three popular triangle types: Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical. The first and second variants have one trendline parallel to the time-axis. In the case of the Ascending type, it’s the upper level. This means that as Solana moves inside an Ascending Triangle, its range gets narrower toward a net upside. Similarly, the Descending Triangle involves the opposite setup, with the support line being parallel to the time-axis instead. The third type, the Symmetrical Triangle, is the middle ground between the two: it has the two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In other words, the Symmetrical Triangle represents a period of consolidation where the range gets narrower in true sideways fashion. Due to this fact, a breakout is more-or-less equally probable to occur in either direction. In contrast, there is a bias associated in Ascending and Descending Triangles. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle Solana was trading inside just earlier: As is visible in the above graph, the Solana price was nearing in on the end of the triangle and as probability would dictate, a breakout was becoming likely. The asset indeed ended up finding a break and it seems to have been in the up direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum’s Correlation Is Fading So what could be next for SOL? According to the analyst, the asset might target $164. This level corresponds to the 1.272 Fibonacci Extension line. Fibonacci Extension levels are defined based on ratios found in the popular Fibonacci series. The 1.272 level, in particular, corresponds to the square root of 1.618, which is the famous ‘Golden Ratio.’ SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is floating around $158, up 3% in the last 24 hours.

Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which brought in $448.5 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $324.3 million and ARK Invest’s ARKB with $268.7 million. Bitwise’s BITB also saw healthy inflows of $77.2 million. While smaller funds like HODL added $15.2 million, several others including BTCO, EZBC, BRRR, and BTCW reported no activity. Grayscale’s GBTC was the only major fund to see outflows, losing $40.2 million. The overall positive flow suggests continued institutional confidence as Bitcoin trades near its all-time high. July 11, 2025 06:06:10 UTC $5B in BTC and ETH Options Set to Expire on July 11 On July 11, over 37,000 Bitcoin options worth $4.3 billion are set to expire, with a Put/Call Ratio of 1.05 and a max pain point at $108,000. At the same time, 240,000 Ethereum options valued at $710 million will also expire, showing a Put/Call Ratio of 1.11 and a max pain point at $2,600. This data suggests a balanced market sentiment, with both BTC and ETH trading above their respective max pain levels, potentially pressuring short positions.
