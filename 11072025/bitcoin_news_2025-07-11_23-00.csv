2025-07-11T20:48:08,"Surprising Statements from Arthur Hayes, Who Previously Expected a Decline: “Get Ready for a Monster Altcoin Season”","Following the remarkable increases in the cryptocurrency market in the last 24 hours, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes made an extremely optimistic prediction for altcoins. In a post on the X (formerly Twitter) platform today, Hayes claimed that a “monster altcoin season” will begin in the market. Hayes, who has long maintained a cautious stance, has now completely reversed this view and announced his ultra-bullish outlook. According to Hayes, the primary drivers of this new era will be market indicators and political developments in the US. His statements have resonated widely with both investors and analysts. Related News: Watch Out: Grayscale Announces the Possible Addition of 29 New Altcoins to its Investment Products - There Are Big Surprises, Here's the List Hayes had previously warned that the Treasury General Account (TGA) fill, the US Treasury Department's process of rebuilding cash reserves at the Fed, could pressure risky assets by draining liquidity from the market, which he argued could weaken short-term market sentiment. However, this week's sudden surges have virtually dispelled these concerns. Bitcoin's consecutive new highs in just two hours prompted Hayes to reassess the market. Hayes noted that Ethereum has also gained significant momentum during the same period, suggesting that the leading altcoin could be the precursor to a strong altcoin season. Hayes also highlighted market expectations that US President Donald Trump might soften his stance on tariffs. Using the humorous phrase “TACO” (Trump Always Chicken Out), Hayes argued that this policy could also create an environment favorable for risky assets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T20:42:27,"Bitcoin’s breakout isn’t about the Fed, it’s about market structure: analysts","Bitcoin’s record-breaking climb past $118,000 isn’t tied to Fed policy or equities. Instead, analysts say spot ETF demand and corporate treasury strategies are driving this historic move. Meanwhile, altcoins are surging in BTC’s wake. Bitcoin ( BTC ) shattered its previous all-time high of $116,000 on July 11, peaking at $118,872 before settling near $117,300, pulling a 3% daily gain that masked the frenzy beneath the surface. Ethereum ( ETH ) outpaced BTC with a 7% surge, reclaiming $3,000 for the first time since February, while memecoins like Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) posted double-digit rallies. According to Thomas Perfumo, Kraken’s global economist, Bitcoin is “breaking a months-long range” and entering fresh territory for price discovery. Perfumo noted that over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours alone, while Bitcoin dominance slipped slightly—a rare sign that altcoins are leading the charge. “Concurrently, strength in U.S. equities, currently trading at or near all-time highs, is showcasing a robust risk-on environment, a supportive backdrop for crypto,” Perfumo said in a statement obtained by crypto.news on Friday. With Bitcoin dominance dipping to 54%, the market is witnessing a rare convergence, one where institutional accumulation and derivatives chaos fuel gains across the board, not just at the top. The question now isn’t whether macro matters, but whether crypto’s market mechanics have permanently decoupled from traditional triggers. You might also like: DDC announces $100m Bitcoin treasury partnership with Animoca Brands Market structure, not macro, is steering the rally What distinguishes this rally from previous surges is its foundation. Analysts aren’t pointing to central banks or macro volatility as the spark. Instead, they’re watching structural flows inside the crypto market itself, most notably the direct impact of spot ETF demand. Bitcoin ETFs logged their biggest single day of inflows in 2025 on Thursday, pulling in $1.18 billion, according to SoSoValue data . Ethereum ETFs followed suit with their second-strongest performance of the year at $383 million. These are not speculative futures bets or proxy trades through microcap equities. They are direct, capital-intensive commitments to spot assets. Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen, views the breakout through that lens. “In my view, this isn’t a macro-driven rally, but rather an isolated event. That said, recent U.S. policy developments such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin. We’re seeing Bitcoin treasury strategies proliferate across companies, which reflects growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance sheet asset,” he also said in a statement sent to crypto.news. Sondergaard emphasized that Bitcoin’s clean break through key liquidation levels, and its ability to hold above them, acted as a trigger point for this latest market-wide rally. What comes next hinges on sustainability. Past rallies relied on macroeconomic tailwinds. This one is testing whether crypto’s internal mechanics, such as ETF flows, corporate adoption, and derivatives markets—can independently support valuations. If so, we may be witnessing the birth of a new market paradigm, one where crypto writes its own rules.

2025-07-11T20:30:03,"Ethereum Targets Liquidity Above $3,000 – Price Magnet Forming","Ethereum just broke above the critical $3,000 level, marking a major technical milestone after surging over 20% since Tuesday. This decisive breakout signals renewed strength in the second-largest cryptocurrency, with bulls reclaiming control after weeks of tight consolidation. The move is reigniting interest across the broader altcoin market, which had remained relatively muted during Bitcoin’s recent rally to all-time highs. Now, with ETH leading the charge, many altcoins are showing signs of reversal and upward momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal? According to top analyst Ted Pillows, a key factor behind Ethereum’s rally is the large concentration of liquidity resting just above the $3,000 mark. Once Ethereum cleared the $2,850 resistance, momentum rapidly accelerated, driving price through the $3,000 level and into a new range of opportunity. This rally comes amid a broader shift in market sentiment. As Bitcoin sets record highs, Ethereum and other altcoins appear poised to catch up. The big question now: can ETH maintain this level and lead a full altcoin season, or is this just a temporary breakout before another round of consolidation? Ethereum Breaks Out Of Consolidation Range Ethereum has spent the last several weeks consolidating within a clearly defined range that began in early May. The altcoin hovered between support around $2,800 and resistance just below $3,000, with multiple failed attempts to break above. That changed yesterday. ETH finally closed above this key resistance, signaling a potential breakout and confirming the start of a new bullish phase. This move comes as broader macroeconomic conditions improve. Strong labor market data in the US, alongside signs of de-escalation in several global conflicts, have helped reduce uncertainty and reignite risk appetite across financial markets. With Bitcoin reaching new highs and risk-on sentiment returning, Ethereum’s breakout may signal the next wave of upside for altcoins. Top analyst Ted Pillows highlighted a key technical factor: “ETH liquidity is lying above $3,000 — and liquidity is a magnet.” This means that large clusters of buy and stop orders are concentrated above this level, attracting price movement toward those zones. Now that Ethereum has broken past resistance, the presence of high liquidity could accelerate its move upward as traders chase momentum. The breakout also holds symbolic weight. It shows that investors are regaining confidence in Ethereum’s value proposition, particularly with the broader altcoin market showing signs of life. If ETH can hold this breakout and establish $3,000 as new support, the next leg higher could materialize quickly, opening the door to targets in the $3,400–$3,600 range. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason ETH Breaks Major Resistance Ethereum (ETH) has decisively broken above the psychological and technical resistance at $3,000, closing its most recent candle at $3,008.97. This breakout follows a strong 15% daily surge, as seen in the chart, marking a powerful move backed by growing bullish momentum. Volume has expanded significantly, confirming trader conviction and institutional participation in this move. The breakout puts an end to nearly two months of sideways action, with ETH previously locked between the $2,500–$2,850 range. The 200-day simple moving average (SMA), currently near $2,796, was breached with strength, acting as a springboard for price acceleration. The reclaim of this moving average adds technical validation to the breakout and signals the beginning of a new bullish leg. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves ETH is now in a key zone for potential continuation. As long as bulls defend the $2,850–$2,900 level as support, Ethereum has room to rally toward $3,400 and beyond. With Bitcoin trading at all-time highs and macro conditions turning favorable for risk assets, ETH could lead the next wave of altcoin expansion.

2025-07-11T20:20:57,"Ethereum ETFs See Inflow Surge as BlackRock’s ETHA Draws in Record $300M in a Day","Ethereum's ether (ETH), the second largest crypto asset, is seeing renewed investor interest, with spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. recording one of their strongest streak of momentum of their one-year history. On Thursday, BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) booked its largest daily inflow to date, with over $300 million, pushing its total assets under management to $5.6 billion, data compiled by Farside Investors show. That’s part of a broader resurgence in ether-backed investment products. The nine U.S.-listed ETH ETFs attracted a combined $703 million in net inflows this week, according to crypto data provider SoSoValue . Although Friday’s data is still pending, it has already marked the third-strongest weekly haul since the products launched last July. Investor demand has picked up lately even as ether’s price has lagged behind bitcoin this year, a new report from asset manager Fineqia noted. The AUM of ETH-backed exchange-traded products (ETPs) grew 61% faster in the first half of 2025 than the market capitalization of the underlying asset, a sign of steady inflows into the products, the report said. The report notes that ETP demand began to rebound by late April and continued into June, outpacing ETH's price gain. The capital flood helped fuel ETH's rebound to $3,000, its highest price in more than four months.

2025-07-11T20:20:34,"IBIT Bitcoin ETF Unleashes Unprecedented Growth, Dominating the Investment Landscape","In a stunning display of market demand and institutional confidence, BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), IBIT, has not just entered the investment arena; it has emphatically conquered it. Surpassing an astounding $80 billion in assets under management (AUM) in a mere 374 days, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF has set an unprecedented benchmark, becoming the fastest ETF in history to reach this colossal milestone. This isn’t just a win for BlackRock; it’s a monumental moment for the entire world of cryptocurrency investment , signaling a profound shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. The Phenomenal Rise of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF: A New Benchmark? The numbers speak for themselves, painting a vivid picture of IBIT’s meteoric ascent. As reported by Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the IBIT Bitcoin ETF hit the $80 billion mark in just over a year. To put this into perspective, the previous record holder, Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO), took a staggering 1,814 days—nearly five times longer—to achieve the same feat. IBIT’s current AUM stands at an impressive $83 billion, solidifying its position as the 21st largest ETF globally, a truly remarkable achievement for a product that was only launched recently. This rapid accumulation of capital underscores a significant shift in investor appetite and a growing comfort with Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. The sheer velocity of this ETF AUM growth is not merely a statistical anomaly; it reflects a powerful underlying current of institutional and retail interest converging on a regulated, accessible pathway to Bitcoin exposure. Understanding the Power of a Bitcoin Spot ETF: What Makes IBIT Different? For years, the crypto community and traditional finance alike awaited the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF in the United States. Why was this such a big deal? Unlike futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, which track the price of Bitcoin futures contracts, a spot ETF directly holds actual Bitcoin. This direct exposure is crucial for several reasons: Direct Price Correlation: A spot ETF aims to track the price of Bitcoin more closely, reducing the basis risk associated with futures contracts. Simplicity for Investors: It offers a straightforward, regulated, and familiar investment vehicle for traditional investors who might be wary of direct cryptocurrency purchases, managing private keys, or dealing with unregulated exchanges. Institutional Comfort: For large institutions like pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, investing through an ETF provides the regulatory clarity, liquidity, and oversight they require, making it easier to allocate capital to digital assets within their existing frameworks. BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers, brought its considerable weight and reputation to the table with IBIT, instilling confidence in a market segment often perceived as volatile and risky. Their robust infrastructure, compliance protocols, and extensive distribution network played a pivotal role in attracting significant capital from a diverse range of investors. Unpacking the Surge in ETF AUM Growth: What’s Driving This Unprecedented Inflow? The incredible ETF AUM growth seen in IBIT is not accidental. Several key factors have converged to create this perfect storm of success: Pent-Up Demand: For years, institutional investors and even many retail investors have sought a regulated, secure, and easy way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership. The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs finally unlocked this immense pent-up demand. BlackRock’s Brand Power: As a titan in the asset management industry, BlackRock’s entry into the Bitcoin ETF space lent immediate credibility and legitimacy to the asset class. Their track record and robust compliance frameworks reassured hesitant investors. Market Timing: The launch coincided with a period of renewed bullish sentiment in the crypto market, fueled by Bitcoin’s halving event and growing anticipation of interest rate cuts. This positive macro environment encouraged inflows. Ease of Access: Traditional investment platforms now offer IBIT, allowing investors to buy and sell shares through their existing brokerage accounts, just like any other stock or ETF. This accessibility removes significant barriers to entry for new investors. Competitive Landscape: While IBIT is leading, the presence of multiple spot Bitcoin ETFs (like Fidelity’s FBTC, Ark Invest’s ARKB, etc.) has created a healthy competitive environment, driving innovation and investor choice. The Dawn of Unprecedented Institutional Bitcoin Adoption IBIT’s rapid ascent is arguably the clearest signal yet of accelerating institutional Bitcoin adoption . This isn’t just about retail investors dipping their toes; it’s about large financial entities integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios and investment strategies. What does this signify? Validation of Bitcoin: Institutional capital flows validate Bitcoin as a legitimate, investable asset class, moving it further away from its early reputation as a niche or speculative digital curiosity. Diversification for Portfolios: Institutions are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a diversifier, a hedge against inflation, and a high-growth asset in a low-yield environment. Market Maturation: The presence of regulated ETF products contributes to the overall maturation of the cryptocurrency market, bringing more liquidity, stability, and transparency. Broader Acceptance: As more institutions gain exposure, it paves the way for even wider acceptance and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. We could see more crypto-backed products, derivatives, and services emerge. This trend is not confined to the U.S. alone; global interest in similar regulated products is soaring, with other countries closely watching the success of these U.S.-based spot ETFs. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Investment? The success of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF has profound implications for the future trajectory of cryptocurrency investment . It suggests a future where digital assets are increasingly interwoven with traditional finance, offering both new opportunities and challenges. Opportunities Ahead: Increased Mainstream Participation: More accessible products will attract a broader base of investors, potentially leading to greater market capitalization and liquidity for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Innovation in Financial Products: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, further broadening the institutional investment landscape. Enhanced Market Stability: As institutional capital tends to be more patient and long-term oriented, increased institutional participation could potentially reduce some of the extreme volatility historically associated with crypto markets. Challenges to Consider: Regulatory Scrutiny: With increased adoption comes greater regulatory attention. Future regulations could impact market dynamics. Market Volatility: While institutional money may bring stability, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Investors in IBIT are still exposed to the inherent price swings of Bitcoin. Competition: The ETF market is highly competitive. While IBIT leads, other funds are vying for market share, which could lead to fee wars and constant innovation. Custody Risks: While ETFs mitigate some risks for individual investors, the underlying assets (Bitcoin) still require secure custody solutions, which come with their own set of challenges. For individual investors, the emergence of products like IBIT offers a convenient avenue for exposure. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in a Bitcoin Spot ETF is still an investment in Bitcoin itself, carrying the associated risks. Diversification, understanding one’s risk tolerance, and conducting thorough due diligence remain paramount. A New Era Dawns for Digital Assets The incredible achievement of the IBIT Bitcoin ETF , reaching $80 billion faster than any other ETF in history, is more than just a financial milestone. It’s a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s maturation and its undeniable integration into the mainstream financial system. This unprecedented ETF AUM growth signals a new chapter for institutional Bitcoin adoption , opening doors for broader cryptocurrency investment and reshaping the future of global finance. As IBIT continues its remarkable trajectory, it serves as a beacon, highlighting the immense potential and growing acceptance of digital assets in the portfolios of both traditional and modern investors.

2025-07-11T20:14:16,"U.S. stocks end the week slightly lower as traders parse Trump's tariff moves","Wall Street's major averages were beat up on Friday, ending in the red, as President Donald Trump slapped a 35% tariff on Canada and threatened to impose more tariffs across the board. For the week, markets ended slightly lower after posting back-to-back record closes as market participants juggled Trump's tariff announcements against a healthy appetite for technology and growth stocks. The S&P ( SP500 ) on Friday closed -0.3% at 6,259.75 points, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) seesawed but ended -0.2% at 20,585.53 points, and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) finished -0.6% at 44,371.51 points. Week-to-date, the indices were -0.3% , -0.1% , and -1% , respectively. Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. In addition, Trump said he would impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on other remaining countries. “Equity markets were a nothingburger all week at index level. All manner of analysis suggests that equities ‘should’ put in a short-term correction around now. Price does not, thus far, agree, with the ascent from the April lows continuing to confound fundamentalists everywhere,” Alex King, investing group leader of Cestrian Capital Research , told Seeking Alpha. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 7 basis points to 4.42%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 1 basis point to 3.90%. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget showed an unexpected surplus of $27B in June, when it was expected to be in deficit by $41.5B. Meanwhile, bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a new all-time high on Friday, fueled by growing institutional interest and supportive signals from the Trump administration. “The big winners this week have been Bitcoin and Ether, the latter of which is quietly going mainstream under the guise of Everything Is Token. We believe both will trend higher even if equities do, one day, take a breather,” King said. The focus will shift slightly from tariffs and trade developments to the second quarter U.S. earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from major banks.

2025-07-11T20:11:20,"Bhutan Capitalizes on Bitcoin Rally With $23.7M Sale, Outpaces German Strategy","As Bitcoin surges past $112,000, Bhutan strategically liquidates a portion of its holdings at peak market levels, securing significant gains while other governments, notably Germany, face scrutiny for poorly timed sales. Bhutan Executes Timely Bitcoin Sale Bhutan’s sovereign investment fund, Druk Holding and Investments (DHI), made headlines on Wednesday by transferring 213.5 BTC, valued at $23.73 million, to a Binance deposit address. This marked the second consecutive week of sizeable transfers from the Himalayan kingdom, signaling an effort to capitalize on current market strength. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the transaction, which strategically occurred just hours before Bitcoin reached its highest price level in months. The move is part of Bhutan’s broader treasury strategy, which has increasingly leaned on digital assets as a sovereign wealth tool. Despite recent sales, Bhutan maintains a substantial Bitcoin reserve of 11,711 BTC, estimated at $1.3 billion at current valuations, positioning it as one of the most crypto-forward governments globally. Bitcoin Climbs After Weeks of Consolidation The sale comes as Bitcoin broke past the $112,000 mark this week after spending nearly two months fluctuating between $105,000 and $111,000. Data from Coingecko recorded over $60 billion in global trading volume within a 24-hour window as the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged amid growing market optimism and institutional interest. This bullish momentum, largely fueled by persistent inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and sustained support from institutional investors, has created sharp contrasts in the approaches of government-backed crypto holders. Germany’s Mistimed Sell-Off Highlights Bhutan’s Prudence In stark contrast, the German government offloaded 49,858 BTC between June 19 and July 12, 2024, at an average price of $57,600 per coin. The total liquidation netted $2.87 billion, but the decision proved costly as Bitcoin’s value more than doubled shortly after the sell-off. At current market rates, the same Bitcoin stockpile would be worth approximately $5.54 billion, representing $2.67 billion in missed unrealized gains. Germany’s poorly timed exit, executed just before the market’s significant rally, has sparked criticism over its asset management strategy. Growing Portfolio and Modest Altcoin Gains Arkham’s data revealed that Bhutan’s overall crypto holdings increased to $1.304 billion as of July 10, a notable rise from $1.26 billion the previous week. The bulk of this $38.4 million gain stemmed from Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, though smaller assets within the government’s wallet also posted modest gains. Tokens such as AIKEK and KIBSHI appreciated by approximately 17% and 42%, respectively, while BOBO, a memecoin holding of 69 million units, added a marginal $3.60 in value. These incremental increases, though minor compared to Bitcoin’s performance, reflect Bhutan’s diversified digital asset portfolio strategy, extending beyond just mining and Bitcoin accumulation.

2025-07-11T20:10:37,"US Stock Market Opening: Why the Decline is Sending Ripples Through Crypto","The financial world often operates like a complex, interconnected web. When one major segment experiences turbulence, it’s natural for ripples to spread, affecting other markets. Today, the news from the US stock market opening lower has certainly caught the attention of investors worldwide, and especially those deeply invested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. While crypto markets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the broader economic winds blowing through traditional finance. Understanding these connections is crucial for navigating today’s volatile landscape. Understanding the Latest US Stock Market Opening The start of trading today saw a noticeable downturn across all three major U.S. stock indices. This immediate dip often reflects prevailing investor sentiment and macroeconomic concerns that are shaping decisions across various asset classes. For many, the traditional stock market acts as a barometer for the overall economic health, and its movements can provide insights into the appetite for risk among global investors. Here’s a quick snapshot of how the indices opened: S&P 500: -0.39% Nasdaq: -0.31% Dow: -0.60% These figures, while seemingly small percentages, represent billions of dollars in market capitalization and reflect a cautious, if not bearish, sentiment right from the opening bell. Decoding the Recent Stock Market Decline : What the Numbers Say A stock market decline , even a modest one at the open, can be triggered by a confluence of factors. These often include: Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation can erode purchasing power and corporate profits, leading investors to pull back. Interest Rate Hikes: Central banks raising interest rates to combat inflation can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers, slowing economic growth. Economic Data: Weaker-than-expected jobs reports, manufacturing data, or consumer confidence surveys can signal an impending economic slowdown. Geopolitical Tensions: Global events and political instability can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to seek safer assets. Corporate Earnings: Disappointing earnings reports from major companies can drag down sector-specific or broader market performance. While the exact catalysts for today’s specific opening dip would require deeper analysis of concurrent news, these are the general forces that often contribute to such movements. Investors are constantly weighing these factors, and their collective decisions shape the market’s trajectory. How Nasdaq Performance Reflects Tech Sector Jitters The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, often acts as a bellwether for investor appetite for higher-risk, higher-reward assets. The observed -0.31% dip in Nasdaq performance at the open suggests that the tech sector, which has often led market rallies in recent years, is currently facing headwinds. This could be due to concerns over rising interest rates, which disproportionately impact growth stocks by making future earnings less valuable, or perhaps specific company news within the tech space. When the tech giants on the Nasdaq experience pressure, it can send a signal across the broader market. Many crypto projects, particularly those focused on Web3, DeFi, and NFTs, are often seen through a similar lens as tech startups – high growth potential, but also higher risk. Therefore, a struggling Nasdaq can sometimes foreshadow or coincide with similar sentiment in the digital asset space. The S&P 500 Dip : A Broader Economic Bellwether? The S&P 500, representing the 500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies, is widely considered the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Its -0.39% S&P 500 dip at the open indicates a broader market apprehension that extends beyond just the tech sector. This index includes a diverse range of industries, from finance and healthcare to consumer staples and industrials. A decline here suggests that concerns are not isolated but are affecting a wide swath of the U.S. economy. For crypto investors, observing the S&P 500 is crucial because it often reflects the general ‘risk-on’ or ‘risk-off’ sentiment. When the S&P 500 shows weakness, it often means investors are pulling back from riskier assets across the board, which can include cryptocurrencies. Navigating the Crypto Market Reaction to Traditional Finance Volatility The big question for our readers is: what does this crypto market reaction look like? Historically, there have been periods where cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have shown a correlation with traditional stock markets, particularly the Nasdaq. When the stock market dips, Bitcoin and other digital assets can sometimes follow suit, especially during times of macroeconomic uncertainty. This is often attributed to: Liquidity Crunch: In times of panic, investors might sell off crypto to cover losses in traditional markets or to increase their cash reserves. Risk-Off Sentiment: Both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies are often considered ‘risk-on’ assets. When investors become risk-averse, they tend to divest from these assets first. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional money enters the crypto space, the correlation with traditional finance might strengthen, as these institutions manage diversified portfolios. However, it’s also important to remember that the crypto market has its own unique drivers, including technological advancements, regulatory news, network upgrades, and community sentiment. While today’s stock market opening might send initial ripples , the long-term trajectory of digital assets will depend on a broader set of factors. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the current market dynamics, what can crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand that volatility is inherent in both markets. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level. Diversify (Wisely): While diversification within crypto is important, consider how your overall investment portfolio balances traditional and digital assets. Long-Term Perspective: For many, cryptocurrencies are a long-term investment. Short-term market fluctuations, while impactful, may not dictate the ultimate success of your strategy. Dollar-Cost Averaging: Consider a strategy of regular, smaller investments rather than trying to time the market. This can help mitigate the impact of volatility. Conclusion: The Interconnected Financial Landscape The lower opening of the major U.S. stock markets today serves as a stark reminder of the interconnectedness of global finance. While cryptocurrencies strive for decentralization and independence, they are not entirely decoupled from the macroeconomic forces that influence traditional assets. The stock market decline , reflected in the Nasdaq performance and S&P 500 dip , inevitably sends ripples through the entire investment ecosystem, prompting a cautious crypto market reaction . For crypto enthusiasts, this highlights the importance of not just understanding the blockchain and tokenomics, but also keeping a pulse on broader economic indicators. By doing so, investors can better anticipate potential shifts and make more informed decisions in their journey through the exciting, yet sometimes unpredictable, world of digital assets.

2025-07-11T20:04:55,"On-chain Metrics Indicate Potential for Further Bitcoin Rally","On July 11, Bitcoin breached the $118,000 mark. This growth occurred amid active buying by long-term investors. According to CryptoQuant, the balance of ”accumulators” reached an annual maximum of 248,000 BTC. The figure has increased by 71% since June 22. Such strong demand was last seen on December 20, 2025. At that time, Bitcoin traded at $97,000, and the number of coins held at holders' addresses reached a record 278,000 BTC. A Signal for Growth Demand is recovering from a dip in the fourth quarter of 2024. Although net interest remains negative, it is growing rapidly, indicating that buyers are strengthening their positions. Analyst Axel Adler Jr. believes that the first point for profit-taking will come at a price of $130,900. The MVRV ratio must reach 2.75 to begin distribution. The expert compared the market capitalization to the realized capitalization. Glassnode noted a $4.4 billion increase in realized capitalization while crossing $113,000. This shows active investor trades rather than speculative growth, analysts said. $150,000 Target Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead has set a $150,000 target for Bitcoin. The expert sees a bullish cup-and-handle formation that formed in June. Reidhead is confident of further gains for the asset after it returns to $112,000. Kyle Reidhead wrote, ”See you at $150,000.” The chief analyst of Bitget Research, Ryan Lee, shares the same forecast, provided that the current trend and inflows of institutional capital are maintained. In a commentary to ForkLog, the expert said that several factors are influencing the strengthening of Bitcoin: Pro-cryptocurrency rhetoric from the administration of US President Donald Trump Steady inflows of funds into ETFs Increased interest from corporate treasuries All this creates conditions for a continuation of the bullish trend as early as the start of the third quarter. As Lee noted, growth above $117,000 is an important signal for the market and can only be an intermediate stop before a new spurt. The average projected price of Bitcoin in the coming months is $125,000, with an expected trading range of $105,000 to $150,000. The $108,500 (support) and $130,000 (resistance) levels remain important technical benchmarks. According to Lee, consolidation above $130,000 will open the way to a new phase of growth. At the same time, the expert recalled a characteristic feature of the crypto market—high volatility: ”Sharp growth can be accompanied by a rapid correction—down to $110,000, or even into the $100,000–$105,000 range, where the key support zone is located. However, the fundamental trend remains positive.”",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9910/on-chain-metrics-indicate-potential-for-further-bitcoin-rally,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

BTC soared to a new all-time high, just days after crossing $112,000, as it raced to $118,403 before registering a marginal decline and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 5% in the past 24 hours, trading around $116,617. Meanwhile, ETH rallied over 7%, reaching an intraday high of $2,972 before moving to its current level of $2,963. Ripple (XRP) also traded in positive territory, with the price up over 6%, trading around $2.56. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) crossed the crucial $160 mark thanks to the market rally. The altcoin is up almost 5%, trading around $164. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 10%, trading around $0.198, while Cardano (ADA) is up almost 11%, trading around $0.685. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Hedera (HBAR) , Toncoin (TON) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable gains. Remixpoint Raises $215 Million To Expand Bitcoin Holdings Energy company Remixpoint has raised 31.5 billion yen ($215 million) to expand its Bitcoin treasury. The firm will allocate all the raised funds to purchase BTC. Remixpoint raised the funds through its 25th series of stock acquisition rights and a fourth series of unsecured bonds. The series of stock acquisition rights will create over 55 million new shares, and represents a 39.5% share dilution. Remixpoint is currently the 30th largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, holding 1,051 BTC. The firm plans to increase its holdings to 3,000 BTC in the near term. The news comes after Remixpoint announced that CEO Takashi Tashiro will be paid in Bitcoin as part of the company’s efforts to be “in the same boat” as its shareholders. Remixpoint’s board has unanimously approved its Bitcoin investment strategy, highlighting the potential to enhance corporate value from a risk-return perspective while preserving flexibility. “We have become even more convinced of Bitcoin’s future, and this decision is the result of extensive discussions. We understand the difference between seizing opportunities and playing it safe, as well as the distinction between a challenge and recklessness.” US Treasury Officially Removes Controversial Biden-era Reporting Rule In a big win for DeFi platform compliance with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the US Treasury Department officially removed the controversial DeFi broker reporting rules. The Biden-era rule required DeFi platforms to issue IRS 1099-DA forms for all user transactions. The repeal was part of an earlier act in which the US Congress repealed the rule. President Donald Trump signed the bill in April. Several DeFi-friendly congressmen viewed the rule as a burden on DeFi platforms. They also believed it went against the principles of decentralization. Under the new reporting rules, DeFi platforms will be exempt from several compliance requirements. These include know your customer (KYC) rules and transaction reporting. Additionally, the Congressional Review Act mechanism also ensures the IRS cannot issue a substantially similar rule in the future unless authorized by Congress. However, the repeal is applicable only to non-custodial DeFi applications, with centralized exchanges still subject to 1099-DA forms. Bitcoin (BTC) Could Move To $120,000 Predictions that Bitcoin’s (BTC) latest rally could soar past $120,000 during its latest bull run are on track, with the flagship cryptocurrency crossing $118,000 during the ongoing session and showing no signs of slowing down. While BTC is soaring to record levels, altcoins are emerging as bigger winners, with Ethereum (ETH) crossing the crucial $3,000 mark, and Ripple (XRP) surging past $2.50. ETH is up over 8%, while XRP is up 7%, with buyers firmly in control. BTC broke past $112,000 on Thursday after weeks of trading in range, and continued its uptrend on Friday. Analysts have stated that there is clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying. “Bitcoin’s latest breakout above $112,000 confirms the market has broken out of its ‘indecisive’ phase. There's clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying.” The flagship cryptocurrency’s market dominance has also reached multi-year highs. Strong ETF demand, exchange outflows, and corporate treasuries are giving significant bullish signals for the Bitcoin market. Altcoins Surge Bitcoin’s (BTC) dominance jumping to multi-year highs has raised questions about altcoins. While BTC is cornering significant capital, altcoins have significant potential for a rally. According to analysts, an altcoin rally could likely come down to macroeconomic factors. “Right now, the trend favors Bitcoin. But just beneath it, altcoins are quietly positioning for a late-summer rotation. But if macro shocks hit (a hawkish Fed pivot or geopolitical escalation), Bitcoin could spike in dominance as risk appetite vanishes.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has soared to a new all-time high just hours after crossing $112,000 on Thursday. The flagship cryptocurrency’s latest push was powered by strong demand from retail and institutional investors, and the crypto-friendly policies of the Trump administration. According to analysts from Sygnum Bank, BTC’s latest rally is being driven by its growing recognition as a safe-haven asset. Katalin Tischhauser, the head of research at Sygnum Bank, stated that BTC has outperformed and has been decoupling on days when the S&P 500 and broader markets corrected. “This has been supported by Bitcoin’s increasing status as a safe haven asset in the face of fiat debasement, also confirmed by the first US state signing a Bitcoin reserve bill into law, following the federal Bitcoin reserve established by Executive Order.” Bitcoin reserves across centralized exchanges have also been declining since April, a sign of long-term confidence in the asset. Declining reserves could lead to a supply shock-driven rally. The flagship cryptocurrency raced to a new all-time high of $118,403, barely 24 hours after it crossed $112,000. BTC’s jump past $118,000 triggered a wave of liquidations, wiping out over $1 billion in short contracts in 24 hours. According to data from Coinglass, the value of shorts liquidated on July 10 is the single-largest liquidation event this year. Long contracts worth $120 million were also liquidated in the same timeframe, highlighting the market’s renewed bullish momentum. Derivatives exchange Bybit accounted for most of the liquidations, with $291 million in contracts liquidated, 98% of which were shorts. HTX saw $138 million in liquidations while Gate ($71.8 million), OKX ($54.62 million), and Binance ($54.56 million) completed the top 5. Analysts pointed out that the current breakout is far calmer and structurally sound, and highlighted that despite the surge, important indicators suggest the market is not overheated. BTC’s MVRV ratio stands at 2.2, significantly lower than the overheated levels seen during rallies in March and December 2024. There has also been a shift in investor behavior. Analysts noted that during previous bull markets, short-term holders made up around 30% of the market. However, the current rally has seen that number drop to 15%, meaning less volatility and a lower risk of sudden selloffs. Miners have also remained relatively quiet, while retail investors are largely missing. BTC has mostly traded positively since last Tuesday’s low of $105,328. The flagship cryptocurrency recovered from this level, rising nearly 3% and settling at $108,845. Buyers retained control on Thursday as BTC crossed $110,000 for the first time since May, reaching an intraday high of $110,583. The price registered a marginal decline from this level and settled at $109,637. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC was back in the red on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. Price action returned to positive over the weekend as BTC rose 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,231. Source: TradingView BTC started the current week in the red, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. However, market sentiment began picking up, with the price rising 0.62% on Tuesday and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control as BTC rose over 2%, briefly crossing $112,000 for the first time before settling at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC raced to an intraday high of $116,401 before settling at $115,159. The flagship cryptocurrency soared past $118,000 during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $118,403 before moving to its current level of $117,255, up almost 2%. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) is on the verge of reclaiming $3,000, a level the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has not seen since February 2025. ETH is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours, as the crypto market soars to new highs. The price had lagged behind BTC this cycle, but the narrative has finally turned bullish thanks to growing ETF inflows and tokenization narratives fueling investor confidence. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could trigger another rally, taking it past the $3,500 mark. Data analytics platform Swissblocks highlighted that the current scenario for ETH is more bullish than Q2, potentially marking the beginning of alt season. ETH inflows have gained momentum, with institutional demand also rising. Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) ETH futures open interest jumped to $3.27 billion, the highest since February 2. The jump suggests increased institutional positioning, indicating a growing appetite among investors to gain exposure to ETH. ETH registered a sharp drop on Tuesday (July 1), dropping over 3% to $2,407. Despite the bearish sentiment, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 7% to cross the moving averages and settle at $2,572. Buyers retained control on Thursday as ETH rose 0.79%, reaching an intraday high of $2,636 before settling at $2,592. However, it lost momentum on Friday, dropping over 3% and settling at $2,509. ETH recovered over the weekend, rising 0.35% on Saturday and over 2% on Sunday to settle at $2,572. Source: TradingView Despite the positive weekend, ETH was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.12% to $2,543. The price rebounded on Tuesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,616. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH rose almost 6% to cross $2,700 and settle at $2,770. Buyers retained control on Thursday as the price reached an intraday high of $3,001 before settling at $2,950. The current session sees ETH up over 1%, trading around $2,981. If ETH closes above $3,000, it could extend its rally beyond $3,500. The MACD and RSI show strong bullish sentiment, but ETH could see a small correction before resuming its rally. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) lost momentum during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down after reaching an intraday high of $166. SOL crossed the crucial $160 mark on Thursday when it raced to $165 before closing at $164. The altcoin’s uptick came amid a jump in market activity as 23-hour trading volumes rose 19% to $4.9 billion, indicating that traders could be readying for a potential breakout. Institutional interest in SOL is also picking up, adding weight to an already-bullish scenario as altcoins get dragged higher by BTC’s jump to a new all-time high. Despite SOL’s impressive performance, it remains substantially lower than its January peak of $294. Analysts, including James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, predict that a Solana ETF could be approved by October. SOL registered a substantial drop last Tuesday, falling over 5% to $147. Despite the selling pressure, the price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 4% to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. SOL reached an intraday high of $156 on Thursday but lost momentum after reaching this level and fell back to $152. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as the price dropped over 3%, slipping below $150 and settling at $147. Sellers retained control on Saturday as SOL registered a marginal decline. However, it recovered on Sunday, rising almost 3% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. Source: TradingView SOL was back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 2% and settling at $148. Despite the bearish start to the week, the price recovered on Tuesday, rising nearly 2% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL rose 3.54%, crossing the 50-day SMA and settling at $157. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price soared past $160, reaching an intraday high of $165 before settling at $164. The current session sees SOL marginally down as it runs into resistance around the 200-day SMA. A break above this level could see the price reach $200. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) finally broke above the 200-day SMA and the resistance around $2.20, with bulls controlling the momentum. With a clear bullish structure forming, analysts predict a further uptrend, potentially pushing XRP past $2.70. XRP has largely traded below $2.40 since the end of April, except for a surge to $2.65 in mid-May. The token is up almost 6% in the past 24 hours and over 16% in the past week. XRP started the previous week in positive territory despite facing selling pressure and volatility. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping almost 3% to $2.17.

2025-07-11T20:04:31,"US National Debt Surges $384,700,000,000 in Just One Week As Massive Pile of Debt Shatters New All-Time High","The US national debt has reached a new record high just one week after a massive spending bill cleared Congress. The Treasury’s Debt to the Penny database shows the government’s mountain of debt surged $384.7 billion from July 3rd to the 9th. That brings the total outstanding debt to an all-time high of $36.6 trillion. This rapid rise is largely driven by the refilling of the Treasury General Account (TGA), as the government resumes borrowing to cover delayed payments and restore cash reserves. The spending bill, signed by President Trump, raised the debt ceiling by a whopping $5 trillion – the largest increase in US history. The debt ceiling now stands at $41.1 trillion, averting default until 2027. The wide-ranging legislation permanently extends the 2017 tax cuts, reducing federal revenue by trillions over the next decade. After accounting for offsets, the CBO forecasts the bill will add around $2.8 trillion to the deficit in 10 years. The Trump administration disputes the estimate, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says he believes the bill’s tax cuts and deregulation will spur economic growth that outpaces deficit concerns.

2025-07-11T20:02:01,"Is the BTC Rally Driven by Spot or Leveraged Demand? Glassnode Weighs In","The past 24 hours have witnessed bitcoin (BTC) record all-time highs (ATHs) again and again, with the latest being at almost $119,000. While it is evident that institutional demand and whale movements are driving this rally, analysts have identified another cohort of investors who have contributed to the surge. According to a tweet by the market insights firm, Glassnode, demand from leveraged traders is playing a bigger role in this rally than spot investors. Leveraged Demand Drives BTC Rally Glassnode revealed that Bitcoin’s spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) has been on a decline for weeks. CVD analyzes investor sentiment by telling whether aggressive buyers or sellers are dominating the market. The metric measures trading activity by comparing buying and selling volume over a period. Over the past weeks, bitcoin’s spot CVD has recorded rare buy-side spikes, with the latest being on July 9. Conversely, futures CVD has been more reactive. The futures market has recorded frequent buy-side spikes, indicating that traders have been buying BTC aggressively. Since BTC touched $112,000, spot traders have been selling, while futures investors have been buying. Funding for the spot market has remained low and even became negative at some point. As a result, this bitcoin rally has been fueled more by leverage than spot demand. Futures traders have been buying more; however, the market has witnessed little confirmation from spot investors. Notably, Glassnode said low funding is a sign that positioning is not yet crowded. Unfortunately, this shows a structurally fragile setup, which can only get better if spot interest returns. No Signs of Overheating Yet Glassnode’s analysis suggests there is no strong structural backing to support this rally. However, the Bitcoin market is yet to see any signs of overheating, meaning that there is still room for additional growth. The market appears steady, alongside metrics like the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) and Short-term holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR). Others, like the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) and Miner Position Index (MPI), also signal that sell-side activity is muted. These indicators suggest that investors are cautiously optimistic and not eager to offload their assets. While the market awaits bitcoin’s next move, there is a surge in open interest, with long positions dominating. This comes after shorts have been wiped out , with liquidations running close to $1 billion. The post Is the BTC Rally Driven by Spot or Leveraged Demand?

2025-07-11T20:00:23,"US Dollar Decline Triggered by Loss of Confidence in US Trade and Fiscal Policies, Says Private Banking Giant","The vice president of the private investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman says that America’s trade policies are weakening the US dollar. In a new interview on CNBC, Elias Haddad explains why the greenback is falling by record levels this year. “Clearly the decline in the dollar here reflects the loss of confidence in the US trade, security and perhaps even fiscal policy because you also see a bit of a divergence between the dollar index and the rate differential. I think that reflects this policy uncertainty.” He says the protectionist trade policies under the Trump administration are primarily behind the ongoing drag on the US currency. “First of all, higher tariffs. The average effective tariff rate in the US went from 2% early this year to about 18% right now. That’s a downside risk to growth, upside risk to inflation. That’s bearish for the US dollar. “ Haddad says the ongoing trade war threatens to accelerate the declining role of the US dollar as a primary reserve currency. He says the government’s efforts to narrow the trade deficit also appear to be counterproductive. “The policies aimed at narrowing the trade deficit mean you’ve got less US dollar flowing overseas. There will be less dollars flowing back into US securities – so for all these reasons, we remain bearish on the US dollar.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-11T19:55:39,"Crypto Analyst Says Solana Rival on Cusp of Breakout, Updates Outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum","A widely followed crypto analyst says that one rival of smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) is on the brink of breaking out while updating his outlook on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 550,900 followers on the social media platform X that layer-1 blockchain SUI Network ( SUI ) is one weekly close away from taking off. “SUI is on the cusp of a breakout from its macro triangle. It is one weekly close above the diagonal resistance away from kickstarting trend continuation to the upside. SUI continues to be a leader in terms of metrics across layer-1s, with its TVL (total value locked) is over $2 billion.” Source: Rekt Capital/X According to the analyst, not only is SUI ready to rally to the upside, but it has also overtaken Solana in terms of overall stablecoin transfers last month. “SUI has been consolidating inside this macro market structure for most of 2025, soon to challenge the top of the pattern for a major breakout attempt. Fundamentally speaking, SUI has overtaken Solana in terms of monthly stablecoin transfers in the last month.” SUI is trading for $3.56 at time of writing, a 10.6% increase on the day. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, Rekt Capital says that its latest surge to a new all-time high means that the “storm is here.” “The price of Bitcoin has increased by +$10,000 since. The storm is here.” Source: Rekt Capital/X He also notes that the crypto king has entered its price discovery uptrend phase. BTC is trading for $117,755 at time of writing, a 5.9% increase during the last 24 hours. Concluding his analysis with ETH, Rekt Capital says that the second-largest digital asset by market cap is ready to rally across its entire macro range of between $2,500 and $3,900. “Ethereum is slowly getting ready to rally across its entire $2500-$3900 macro range (black-black). The macro range low of $2500 has been successfully retested as support to kickstart the range-bound move.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum is trading for $2,980 at time of writing, a 7.5% increase on the day.

2025-07-11T19:54:11,"State of Crypto: Previewing Congress' 'Crypto Week'","U.S. lawmakers may actually get a crypto bill to the president's desk. The House is set to vote on market structure and stablecoin legislation next week, bringing the U.S. a vital step closer to drafting new rules for the industry. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Crypto win The narrative The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on a market structure bill, a stablecoin bill and a bill banning a U.S. central bank digital currency next week. Perhaps it's premature to suggest the industry will notch a major win — but all signs indicate that U.S. President Donald Trump will sign a stablecoin bill into law before the August recess, as his team has sought since February. Why it matters The crypto industry has long sought ""regulatory clarity"" on its own terms — previous rule proposals it disagreed with were fervently opposed and the industry's political action committees poured tens of millions of dollars into the 2024 elections to try and create a Congress that would be friendlier to crypto policies. Next week, those efforts may pay off, as the House of Representatives gets set to vote on a stablecoin bill that may become law within weeks and a market structure bill that could get to the White House before Christmas. Breaking it down The House of Representatives dubbed next week — July 14 to July 18 — ""Crypto Week."" The main event will be the House vote on, and expected passage of, the ""Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025"" (Clarity), the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act and the ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025"" (GENIUS). The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet Monday at 4:00 p.m. ET to discuss each of the bills . That means there may be a floor vote, where the entire House votes, by Tuesday. Though there was some discussion of packaging the Clarity and GENIUS Acts into one larger bill, it appears there will instead be separate votes for each of the bills. If the GENIUS Act does receive its own vote, U.S. President Donald Trump may sign it into law as soon as next Friday or the following Monday, I'm told, though at this point none of this is confirmed (and obviously depends on the actual House vote). Notably, the House Financial Services Committee confirmed on Thursday that the House would vote on the GENIUS Bill sent to it by the Senate, and not its own ""Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy"" (STABLE Act), as previously reported by CoinDesk's Jesse Hamilton. It is likely that all three bills will pass, and with bipartisan majorities. To recap: The Clarity Act will create a framework for how different cryptocurrencies are treated by federal regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission. There's no Senate counterpart to this bill yet, though the Senate Banking Committee has already held multiple hearings on market structure issues, and the Senate Agriculture Committee has scheduled a hearing for this upcoming Tuesday on the same topic. Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott previously said he expects the Senate to wrap up its work on market structure by Sept. 30. The House's last effort to pass market structure legislation, last year's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, saw massive bipartisan support with 279 lawmakers (208 Republicans and 71 Democrats) voting in favor of the bill. While there is no public whip count yet for this year's version, the Clarity Act passed out of the House Agriculture Committee with massive bipartisan support (47-6) and the House Financial Services Committee with some bipartisan support (32-19). Either number suggests both Democrats and Republicans will vote for the bill on the House floor. The GENIUS Act will set up a framework for overseeing stablecoins. The Senate already passed the GENIUS Act, meaning once the House passes it, it goes to Trump's desk for his signature into law. This could mark the stablecoin bill as the first major crypto-focused bill to become law. The GENIUS Act could then also be one of the few bills that isn't a ""must-pass"" to go through the legislative process, meaning it's not a budget bill and it's not the annual National Defense Authorization Act. While the House is voting on the Senate version and not its own STABLE Act, updated House text in the Clarity Act would add some additional rules around stablecoins. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act would, as the name suggests, ban the U.S. from developing or launching a central bank digital currency. The House passed a version of this bill in 2024 as well. In theory, the passage of these bills is positive for the industry. Though it may take time for regulators to write and implement rules after these bills become law, within the next few years crypto companies will have firm guidelines to operate within. Less clear is what these bills may actually do for usage or adoption. A recent publication by Moody's Ratings suggested that while passage of the GENIUS Act will ""have significant implications for banks"" but that stablecoins writ large ""need to offer a compelling advantage over existing consumer and commercial payment systems"" to become a more broadly accepted transaction tool. ""While there appears to be solid bipartisan political support for U.S. stablecoins, assuming issuers are prohibited from paying any kind of financial incentive, we view the likelihood of a significant shift in domestic payments toward stablecoins as relatively modest,"" the report said. Democrats are raising concern about the potential for these bills' passage to enable or further corruption, with Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters and Rep. Stephen Lynch pointing to Trump's crypto ventures and their potential for enriching the president. ""These bills serve as a brazen stamp of approval for the blatant abuse of power we’re witnessing in real time,"" Waters said in a statement. The House Ways and Means Committee is also holding a hearing on crypto taxation next Wednesday, though it hasn't shared many details yet. To recap the schedule for next week, or if you want to just see it at a glance: Monday, July 14, 4:00 p.m. ET: The House Rules Committee will meet and discuss the Clarity Act, GENIUS Act and Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act. Tuesday, July 15, 3:00 p.m. ET: The Senate Agriculture Committee will hold a hearing on market structure legislation. Tuesday, July 15, time TBA: The House may meet and begin voting on all three bills discussed above. Wednesday, July 16, 9:00 a.m. ET: The House Ways and Means Committee will hold a hearing on crypto taxation. Thursday, July 17: Nothing is scheduled (at least right now). Friday, July 18: If the House votes to advance GENIUS on Tuesday, there may be a bill signing.

2025-07-11T19:50:41,"Bitcoin Holders Remain Calm: Glassnode’s Crucial NUPL Insight","The cryptocurrency world is abuzz. Bitcoin (BTC) recently surged past $118,000, marking a new all-time high (ATH) that sent ripples of excitement across the market. Yet, amidst this euphoria, a fascinating insight from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode offers a more nuanced perspective. Their latest report on X reveals that despite the price milestone, the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric remains conspicuously below the ‘euphoria zone’ at 0.69. What does this surprising data tell us about the current Bitcoin bull run, and why is it so significant? What is NUPL and Why Does it Matter for Bitcoin? Before diving deeper into Glassnode’s findings, let’s clarify what the NUPL metric actually represents. NUPL, or Net Unrealized Profit and Loss, is an on-chain indicator that measures the overall profitability of the Bitcoin market. It calculates the difference between realized cap and market cap, divided by market cap, effectively showing the aggregate profit or loss of all coins in circulation that have not yet been sold. When the NUPL value is high, it indicates that a large portion of the market is in profit, suggesting potential for profit-taking and market tops. Specifically, the Long-Term Holder (LTH) NUPL focuses only on coins held by entities identified as ‘long-term holders’ – typically addresses that have held their Bitcoin for over 155 days. These holders are often considered the ‘smart money’ or ‘strong hands’ in the market, less prone to panic selling and more likely to accumulate during dips. Their collective profit and loss status can provide profound insights into the market’s psychological state and potential turning points. A high LTH NUPL typically signals that these experienced holders are sitting on significant profits, often preceding major corrections as they begin to distribute their holdings. Glassnode’s Revelation: Is This Bitcoin Cycle Truly Different? The core of Glassnode’s recent report lies in a striking comparison: while Bitcoin has reached unprecedented price levels, the LTH NUPL has only spent approximately 30 days above the 0.75 threshold – a zone historically associated with peak market euphoria and distribution by long-term holders. Contrast this with the previous bull cycle, which saw a staggering 228 days above this very threshold. This stark difference, as highlighted by Glassnode , suggests a potentially unique characteristic of the current market phase. What could explain this divergence? Is it a sign of a more mature market, where institutional adoption and broader understanding lead to less speculative frenzy? Or does it indicate that long-term holders, perhaps scarred by previous bear markets, are simply holding out for even higher prices, anticipating a longer, more sustained bull run? The fact that the LTH NUPL remains at 0.69, below the typical ‘euphoria’ point, implies that a significant portion of these steadfast holders are still accumulating or holding, rather than engaging in widespread profit-taking. This behavior could be a strong bullish signal, suggesting that the market has not yet reached its peak of irrational exuberance. The Unwavering Conviction of Long-Term Holders The role of Long-Term Holders in the Bitcoin ecosystem cannot be overstated. These are the individuals and entities who have weathered multiple market cycles, enduring significant volatility and drawdowns. Their conviction is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s price stability and long-term growth. When LTHs begin to sell en masse, it often signals a market top. Conversely, when they continue to accumulate or hold through price rallies, it suggests underlying strength and confidence in future appreciation. The current data from Glassnode suggests that these seasoned investors are not yet showing signs of widespread distribution. Their collective unrealized profits, while substantial, are not at levels that historically trigger a mass exodus. This could mean several things: Increased Market Maturity: Long-term holders might be more sophisticated, understanding that Bitcoin’s long-term potential far exceeds previous cycles’ peaks. Supply Shock in Progress: If LTHs aren’t selling, it means new demand must be met by other market participants, potentially leading to a supply squeeze. Anticipation of Higher Peaks: They might believe the true ‘euphoria zone’ for this cycle is much higher, given the growing mainstream adoption and macroeconomic factors. Their continued holding pattern acts as a strong support mechanism for the price, indicating that the supply held by the most patient hands remains largely locked up. Decoding the Current Crypto Market Analysis This insight from Glassnode is crucial for any comprehensive Crypto Market Analysis . If long-term holders are not yet in a state of euphoria, it implies that the market might have more room to run before reaching a cyclical top. Unlike previous cycles where retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) often led to rapid price increases followed by sharp corrections driven by LTH distribution, this cycle appears to be unfolding differently. The absence of widespread LTH euphoria could point to: A More Sustainable Rally: A slower, more gradual climb might be healthier, allowing for new capital to enter without immediate heavy selling pressure from long-term holders. Institutional Influence: The growing presence of institutional investors, who typically have longer investment horizons and different profit-taking strategies, might be dampening the traditional retail-driven euphoria peaks. Broader Accumulation: It suggests that accumulation might still be ongoing at various levels, not just by long-term holders, but also by new entrants who are buying into the rally. This unique market dynamic suggests that while Bitcoin has achieved a new ATH, the underlying structure of the market, particularly from the perspective of its most seasoned participants, indicates a phase of continued strength rather than imminent exhaustion. Actionable Insights: Navigating Bitcoin’s Current Phase So, what does this mean for you, the investor, navigating Bitcoin ‘s current price action? The Glassnode data offers several key actionable insights: Patience is Key: The fact that long-term holders are not yet in a full euphoria state suggests that there might be more upside potential before a significant market top. Avoid premature profit-taking if your investment horizon is long-term. Monitor On-Chain Metrics: Continue to pay close attention to on-chain indicators like NUPL, Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), and accumulation trends. These metrics provide a deeper understanding of market participant behavior beyond just price. Beware of Euphoria Creep: While LTHs aren’t euphoric yet, retail sentiment can shift quickly. Be prepared for increased volatility if and when the market does enter the traditional ‘euphoria zone.’ Risk Management: Despite the bullish signals, always practice sound risk management. Market conditions can change rapidly. This cycle’s distinct behavior, as illuminated by Glassnode, offers a valuable lesson: past performance is not always indicative of future results, and on-chain data provides a powerful lens to understand the present. The market is evolving, and the behavior of its most committed participants reflects this maturation. In conclusion, while Bitcoin ‘s new all-time high is undoubtedly exciting, Glassnode ‘s report on the Long-Term Holder NUPL provides a fascinating counter-narrative to the idea of immediate market overheating. The fact that these steadfast holders remain below the ‘euphoria zone’ suggests a more measured, potentially more sustainable, bull run compared to previous cycles. This unique dynamic, revealed through meticulous Crypto Market Analysis , offers a compelling reason for investors to remain observant and strategic, understanding that this cycle might just be unfolding in an unprecedented and intriguing way.

2025-07-11T19:50:21,"K33’s Bold Bitcoin Purchase: Swedish Crypto Broker Boosts Holdings to 85 BTC","In a significant move that underscores growing institutional confidence in the digital asset space, Swedish crypto broker K33 has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin reserves. This strategic decision to boost its Bitcoin holdings not only strengthens K33’s balance sheet but also sends a clear signal about its long-term conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What does this latest K33 Bitcoin purchase mean for the company and the broader crypto market? What’s Driving K33’s Strategic Bitcoin Purchase? K33, a prominent Swedish crypto broker , recently made waves by announcing on X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 50 Bitcoin (BTC). This latest acquisition brings its total Bitcoin reserves to an impressive 85 BTC. The average purchase price for this batch was reported at 1,089,220 SEK, which translates to approximately $114,186. This isn’t K33’s first foray into bolstering its reserves; the company previously completed a direct stock issuance worth $19.2 million specifically to enhance its BTC reserves. This aggressive accumulation strategy by K33 is not merely about holding a digital asset; it’s a calculated business decision. For a crypto broker, holding a significant amount of Bitcoin can serve multiple purposes: Balance Sheet Strength: Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ can act as a robust reserve asset, fortifying the company’s financial position in a volatile market. Client Confidence: Demonstrating conviction in Bitcoin through direct holdings can instill greater trust among clients, signaling that the broker is aligned with the long-term growth of the asset class it facilitates trading in. Future Growth Potential: With Bitcoin’s price movements often tied to supply halving events and increasing mainstream adoption, accumulating BTC at strategic points positions the company for potential future appreciation. The decision to conduct a stock issuance specifically for this purpose highlights a deliberate and well-funded strategy, moving beyond speculative trading to treating Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. The Rise of the Swedish Crypto Broker: A Nordic Perspective K33’s actions reflect a broader trend of increased sophistication and confidence within the Nordic crypto landscape. As a leading Swedish crypto broker , K33 is at the forefront of digital asset adoption in a region known for its technological advancement and financial stability. Their proactive approach to increasing Bitcoin holdings sets a precedent for other financial institutions in the area and potentially across Europe. Historically, traditional financial institutions have been cautious about direct exposure to cryptocurrencies. However, companies like K33 are demonstrating that it’s possible to integrate digital assets into a core business model while maintaining regulatory compliance and investor confidence. This shift is crucial for the maturation of the crypto market, bridging the gap between nascent technology and established financial practices. What does this mean for the average investor? It suggests that the market is becoming more robust and reliable, with established entities taking on direct exposure, which could pave the way for more mainstream products and services. Decoding K33’s Bitcoin Holdings: What Does 85 BTC Mean? While 85 BTC might seem like a modest sum compared to the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, for a regional crypto broker, it represents a significant commitment. At current market prices, 85 BTC is a substantial investment, underscoring K33’s conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This amount places K33 among a growing list of public and private companies that are adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The average purchase price of approximately $114,186 per BTC (in SEK equivalent) indicates that K33 is not shying away from current market valuations, suggesting they believe in significant upside potential. This contrasts with companies that might only acquire during deep dips, showcasing K33’s belief in the asset’s sustained growth trajectory, regardless of short-term fluctuations. For investors, this signals that even at elevated price points, institutions see value in accumulating Bitcoin. It reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties, rather than just a speculative asset. Navigating Crypto Market Trends: K33’s Vision K33’s strategic moves are undoubtedly influenced by current crypto market trends . The market has witnessed a resurgence of institutional interest, fueled by the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, and a broader recognition of digital assets as a legitimate investment class. These factors collectively contribute to a bullish sentiment, and K33 appears to be positioning itself to capitalize on this momentum. Their decision to increase Bitcoin holdings suggests a proactive stance on anticipating market shifts and adapting their business model accordingly. Instead of merely facilitating trades, K33 is actively participating in the market’s evolution, becoming a holder and believer in the assets they serve. This approach highlights several key insights for navigating the crypto market: Long-Term Vision: Successful players in the crypto space often adopt a long-term perspective, focusing on accumulation rather than short-term trading. Strategic Capital Allocation: Utilizing capital, even through stock issuance, to acquire core assets demonstrates a commitment to future growth. Confidence in Ecosystem: A broker investing in the very asset it trades signals profound confidence in the underlying technology and market infrastructure. These actions by K33 are a testament to the evolving maturity of the crypto market, moving from a niche investment to a recognized asset class within the global financial system. The Wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Continues K33’s latest acquisition is a compelling example of the accelerating trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . From public companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla to investment funds and now crypto brokers like K33, an increasing number of corporate entities are integrating Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. This trend is a powerful validator for Bitcoin’s legitimacy and its potential to serve as a global reserve asset. The implications of this widespread adoption are significant: Increased Liquidity: More institutional holders can lead to deeper liquidity pools, making the market more stable and efficient. Reduced Volatility: While Bitcoin remains volatile, increased institutional holding can, over time, contribute to a more stable price floor as large entities tend to be long-term holders. Regulatory Clarity: As more institutions enter the space, there is a growing demand for clearer regulatory frameworks, which can benefit the entire ecosystem. K33’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a piece of a much larger puzzle, illustrating how Bitcoin is steadily cementing its place within the global financial architecture. It signifies a future where digital assets are an undeniable part of corporate and institutional portfolios. A Bold Statement of Conviction K33’s decision to significantly increase its Bitcoin holdings to 85 BTC, funded in part by a substantial stock issuance, is a powerful declaration of its confidence in the future of digital assets.

2025-07-11T19:45:37,"Russian crypto criminal seeks U.S. President Trump’s pardon","The Russian founder of a cryptocurrency exchange shut down for allegedly processing illicit funds for criminals has turned to Donald Trump with a plea for a pardon. While having already served his sentence in America, the convicted crypto entrepreneur hopes the U.S. President will help him avoid extradition to France, where he is likely to spend more time in prison. Crypto exchange Bitzlato owner seeks clemency from Trump A Russian national who was arrested and sentenced in the United States for his crypto trading business has asked the U.S. head of state for a pardon, his lawyer, Ivan Melnikov, revealed to Russia’s TASS news agency. Melnikov, who serves as vice president of the Russian branch of the International Committee for Human Rights organization, was quoted on Friday as stating: “Anatoly Legkodymov, the Russian engineer and co-founder of the Bitzlato cryptocurrency platform, has officially asked U.S. President Donald Trump for pardon.” The lawyer noted that the move comes amid ongoing attempts by authorities in Paris to secure Legkodymov’s extradition to France, where he may receive another 20 years behind bars, according to the Russian media report. Legkodymov, who was also the majority owner and chief executive of Bitzlato, was arrested in Miami in 2023, with French help, and later charged for operating the peer-to-peer crypto trading platform as an unlicensed money exchange service. After court proceedings that took a year and a half, the Russian was sentenced to 18 months in prison, which he had already served in pre-trial detention. However, following France’s request for his extradition, the U.S. judiciary decided to keep him in custody. Melnikov, who claims that Bitzlato was actually “a noticeboard for transactions,” insisted: “Anatoly is not a criminal. He became a target in a political campaign against the crypto market and talented Russian programmers.” The legal defender added his client’s decision to seek a pardon from Trump was “based on the hope that the U.S. will return to a more balanced and fair approach to digital finance, and that the United States and Russia will gradually build dialogue.” Another Russian crypto boss in trouble with the West However, during his trial in a New York court, Legkodymov did plead guilty to running an unlicensed money-transmitting business in late 2023. He also agreed to forfeit $23 million worth of crypto assets associated with his exchange. According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Hong Kong-registered Bitzlato operated globally, presenting itself as a platform requiring minimal identification from users. Announcing the charges against its Russian founder, the DOJ explained: “As a result of these deficient know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, Bitzlato allegedly became a haven for criminal proceeds and funds intended for use in criminal activity.” The department claimed that Bitzlato’s largest counterparty was Hydra, arguably the largest and longest-running darknet market, which was quite popular in the Russian-speaking corners of the dark web. Hydra users traded an estimated $700 million in coins with the exchange. The case of Bitzlato and its owner is not the first time a Russian crypto trading platform and its management have found themselves in trouble with law enforcement in the West. Last month, TASS reported that Poland agreed to hand over to the United States the former chief executive of Wex, once Russia’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Dmitry Vasiliev was arrested in Warsaw in 2024 at a request from the U.S., where he is accused of fraud and money laundering. Wex is the successor of the infamous BTC-e exchange, believed to have laundered $9 billion. Its alleged operator, Russian citizen Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in Greece in 2017 and later extradited to France, where he was sentenced to five years in prison in December 2020. Vinnik was then transferred to the U.S. to face additional charges. He was eventually exchanged for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel in a prisoner swap deal agreed by the Trump administration and President Putin’s Russia. The Bitzlato founder Anatoly Legkodymov’s plea for pardon comes after in January, Trump signed an executive order pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the operator of the Silk Road darknet marketplace, who had served 11 years of his double life sentence without parole.

Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs, surging past the $118,000 mark, while altcoins are breaking above key resistance levels after months of consolidation. This wave of renewed optimism comes at a critical time for the industry, not just in terms of price action, but also regulation. Next week marks “Crypto Week” in the US House of Representatives, where the Financial Services Committee will review and debate three pivotal bills that could shape the future of digital assets. Lawmakers will consider three major pieces of legislation: the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the GENIUS Act. These proposals are expected to bring much-needed clarity to the crypto space and could have wide-reaching implications for the industry. This alignment of bullish price action and significant regulatory developments creates a powerful inflection point for crypto. As markets break out and US lawmakers consider legislation that could define industry standards, investors are watching closely. The coming days may prove to be a defining moment for the future of blockchain and digital finance. Crypto Sentiment Shifts as US Policy And Price Align The crypto market is entering a new bullish phase, powered by more than just rising prices. Legal clarity and growing institutional support in the United States are reinforcing investor confidence. After months of uncertainty, bulls are now celebrating a decisive momentum shift. US President Donald Trump’s administration recently passed a long-anticipated pro-crypto bill just ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline. Dubbed the “big, beautiful” bill by Trump, the legislation is widely expected to create a favorable environment for digital assets. Next week, the bullish sentiment may accelerate as the US House of Representatives kicks off “Crypto Week.” Led by the Financial Services Committee, lawmakers will review and debate three key pieces of legislation with long-term implications for the industry. The CLARITY Act seeks to define functional requirements for digital asset market participants, aiming to boost innovation while protecting consumers. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act targets centralized digital currencies that could compromise financial privacy. Finally, the GENIUS Act addresses stablecoin regulation, proposing a framework for federal oversight of this fast-growing payment technology. Together, these developments suggest that crypto is maturing. With strong technical setups, supportive macro tailwinds, and a historic week of US legislative progress ahead, digital assets are entering what could be the most pivotal phase of their adoption cycle to date. Market Analysis: Breakout Signals Return of Bullish Momentum The total crypto market cap has surged to $3.62 trillion, posting an 8.75% weekly gain and breaking out from a multi-week consolidation range. This latest candle reflects strong bullish momentum, closing well above the previous rejection area around $3.3 trillion. The breakout is supported by a significant spike in trading volume, suggesting renewed investor interest and broader participation across the crypto space. From a technical standpoint, the chart confirms a series of higher lows since the start of 2024, marking a healthy uptrend. The 50-week and 100-week moving averages (at $2.84T and $2.33T, respectively) are both sloping upward and well below the current price, reinforcing long-term strength. Importantly, the total market cap has now come within striking distance of its historical all-time high of $3.8 trillion. If this momentum sustains, a full retest and potential breakout above the ATH would mark a new phase of the bull cycle. Altcoins are showing signs of awakening, and Bitcoin dominance may begin to wane as capital rotates into higher-beta assets. The macro environment—with easing inflation fears and growing regulatory clarity—adds further fuel to this rally. A weekly close above $3.65T would confirm this bullish shift.

Forget Complex Rigs - Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Creates Instant Wealth Opportunity","Ask any newcomer to crypto how to mine Bitcoin and you’ll get one of two reactions: a spark of curiosity or a look of immediate regret. The concept sounds cool until you’re hit with GPU specs, energy bills, and warehouse-level complexity. That dream of becoming a crypto miner suddenly feels more like signing up for a second job. But what if mining didn’t require a machine louder than a jet engine or a monthly electricity bill the size of a mortgage? That’s the opportunity Bitcoin Solaris is opening up. And it’s flipping the idea of mining on its head. How to mine Bitcoin Solaris: One phone, one click, real rewards Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just creating another token. It’s building a system that makes wealth generation simple, accessible, and instant, even for people with zero mining experience. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova App, BTC-S will allow users to mine directly from their smartphones. There’s no need for external hardware, no complex configurations. Just tap and go. That’s it. The app is designed for global accessibility and operates within the dual-consensus architecture of BTC-S, which combines Proof-of-Work with Delegated Proof-of-Stake to balance decentralization with efficiency. Here’s how it works: You download the app when it becomes available. You tap once a day to validate presence and earn mining time. The app runs secure micro-processes that simulate contribution, verified through network consensus. The real magic? It’s designed to consume up to 99.95% less energy than traditional mining. You get participation and real rewards without needing anything beyond your phone and an internet connection. The Future of Crypto Doesn’t Wait BTC-S Is Already Moving A deeper look into the BTC-S tech edge Once you scratch beneath the surface, you realize BTC-S isn’t just another “convenience coin.” The technical depth behind the project is what gives it real staying power: 10,000+ transactions per second, backed by an optimized dual-layer architecture. Validator rotation system for fairness and increased decentralization. Smart contract capabilities that support enterprise, DeFi, and gaming. Cross-chain compatibility, including seamless Solana bridge integration. Energy efficiency that rivals the greenest solutions in blockchain. This infrastructure is being taken seriously. A full audit has been completed by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , confirming the system is built to scale and designed to perform. Even established influencers are highlighting the project’s potential. One recent review by Crypto League laid out how the BTC-S mobile-first vision could be one of the biggest shifts in blockchain adoption this year. And from the looks of it, the hype isn’t just noise. Presale firestorm and the rare rollback moment Currently in phase 11, the Bitcoin Solaris presale is lighting up the charts. At a price of $11, with a launch target of $20, the momentum is backed by over 14,150+ users and more than $6.6 million raised in a matter of weeks. But here’s the twist. Bitcoin Solaris has activated a rare Price Rollback, allowing new buyers to get in at $5 instead of $11, but only for a very short time. It’s not a discount. It’s a rebalancing move built into the system’s flexibility to allow more early adopters access. For anyone who missed Bitcoin under $100, this rollback might be the closest déjà vu they’ll ever get. To receive your tokens on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless delivery. This ensures a smooth handoff once the presale ends on July 31, 2025. Liquid staking that doesn’t lock you out BTC-S also introduces liquid staking, a model that offers rewards without restricting liquidity. Tokens staked are converted to sBTC-S 1:1, which can still be traded or used in governance and DeFi protocols. You earn while maintaining full access. Staking supports the network without traditional lockups. Fully integrated with the upcoming Solaris Nova App, offering a smooth, automated process. This flexible staking system is explained in depth in their staking overview and aligns with BTC-S’s philosophy of accessibility without compromise. Final verdict: mining made simple, wealth made possible Mining isn’t dead. It just needed a rebrand. And Bitcoin Solaris may have nailed it. No cables. No overheating GPUs. Just a vision of crypto where anyone can participate in wealth creation directly from their pocket. So next time someone asks how to mine Bitcoin, maybe you don’t need to explain ASICs and air conditioning. Just mention BTC-S. One app. One tap. One opportunity that might not come around again.

2025-07-11T19:10:51,"Bitcoin Acquisition: Universal Digital’s Bold Move Unlocks New Treasury Strategy","In a significant development that underscores the evolving landscape of corporate finance, Canadian-listed Universal Digital has made a notable entry into the world of digital assets. The company recently announced a strategic Bitcoin acquisition , adding 10 BTC to its treasury at an average price of $104,452. This move, as reported by JinSe Finance, is part of a broader corporate treasury strategy shift that many forward-thinking companies are now exploring. But what exactly does this mean for Universal Digital, and what are the implications for businesses considering a similar foray into cryptocurrency? Universal Digital’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Deep Dive Universal Digital , a name increasingly recognized in the digital finance space, has taken a decisive step to diversify its treasury holdings. The decision to acquire 10 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $1.04 million at the time of acquisition, reflects a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. This isn’t just about holding a volatile asset; it’s about integrating a new class of assets into traditional financial frameworks. For Universal Digital, this Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a purchase; it’s a statement. It signals a belief in the long-term potential of decentralized digital currencies and an acknowledgment of their increasing role in the global economy. By adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, the company aims to: Diversify Assets: Reduce reliance on traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments, which may be susceptible to inflation and interest rate fluctuations. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold,’ offering a potential safeguard against the erosion of purchasing power. Future-Proofing: Position the company at the forefront of financial innovation, aligning with the burgeoning digital economy. Attract Talent & Investors: Appeal to a new generation of investors and employees who are increasingly comfortable with and invested in the digital asset space. Understanding the Corporate Treasury Strategy Shift Traditionally, corporate treasuries focused on preserving capital and ensuring liquidity through low-risk, low-yield investments like cash, short-term government bonds, and money market funds. However, with persistent low interest rates and rising inflation concerns globally, these traditional strategies offer diminishing returns. This environment has prompted many companies to re-evaluate their approaches, leading to a significant shift in corporate treasury strategy . The embrace of Bitcoin and other digital assets by companies like Universal Digital represents a paradigm shift. It’s a move from purely conservative, yield-focused strategies to more dynamic approaches that incorporate growth potential and inflation hedging. This new strategy involves: Risk Assessment: Carefully evaluating the volatility and regulatory risks associated with digital assets. Long-Term Vision: Viewing Bitcoin not as a speculative trade, but as a long-term strategic holding. Technological Integration: Developing secure custodial solutions and accounting practices for digital assets. This evolving strategy is not without its challenges, including price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for robust security measures. Yet, the potential benefits are compelling enough for companies to explore this frontier. Why Digital Asset Investment is Gaining Traction The trend of digital asset investment by corporations is accelerating, driven by several key factors. Beyond the inflation hedge narrative, companies are recognizing the fundamental innovation behind blockchain technology and the increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Consider these points: Institutional Acceptance: Major financial institutions, from banks to asset managers, are increasingly offering crypto services and products, legitimizing the asset class. Technological Advancements: Improvements in security, scalability, and accessibility of digital assets make them more viable for corporate holdings. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a borderless asset, offering a unique advantage for international companies. First-Mover Advantage: Companies that strategically adopt digital assets early may gain a competitive edge in the rapidly digitizing global economy. While Bitcoin remains the primary choice for corporate treasuries due to its liquidity and established network, the broader appeal of digital asset investment extends to other cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications, promising a future where digital assets play a more integral role in corporate balance sheets. The Canadian Company Crypto Trend: What It Means Canada has quietly emerged as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency space, fostering an environment that is increasingly conducive to Canadian company crypto adoption. Unlike some other jurisdictions, Canada has been relatively progressive in its approach to cryptocurrency regulation, notably approving Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which provide regulated investment vehicles for institutions and retail investors alike. Universal Digital’s move fits well within this national context. Several other Canadian entities, particularly in the mining sector like Hut 8 and HIVE Blockchain, already hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin as part of their operational and treasury strategies. This growing cohort of Canadian company crypto holders suggests a broader trend where Canadian businesses are not just participating in, but actively leading, the integration of digital assets into their financial frameworks. This could solidify Canada’s position as a hub for blockchain innovation and corporate crypto adoption. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Crypto Holdings Universal Digital’s acquisition of 10 BTC is a small but significant step in a much larger movement. As more companies grapple with economic uncertainties and seek new avenues for growth and asset preservation, the appeal of Bitcoin and other digital assets will likely continue to grow. This trend is not just about financial speculation; it’s about adapting to a new financial paradigm where digital assets are seen as legitimate, valuable components of a diversified portfolio. The journey for companies integrating digital assets into their treasuries will involve navigating evolving regulatory landscapes, managing volatility, and ensuring robust security protocols. However, the pioneering spirit demonstrated by Universal Digital and others indicates a strong belief in the transformative potential of this asset class. Their actions today could very well set the precedent for corporate treasury management in the years to come, unlocking new possibilities for financial resilience and innovation.

Feels like Bitcoin Depot is finally out of the heavy spending phase and just letting the model do its thing. Gross margin? 20.2%. A year ago, it was 12.5%. That's a big jump. Volume helped, sure. But pricing power played an even bigger role. And here's the kicker—they didn't dump in fresh capital to make it happen. No big CapEx. No mad rush to add kiosks either. They've got about 2,000 already in inventory, so they can grow 2025 without burning cash. Most crypto companies are still cash incinerators. Not these guys. They're already throwing off cash. So, What's Pushing Margins Up? Two things. First, pricing. They hiked markups and kiosk fees , and it went straight to the bottom line. CFO David Gray even admitted they “deliberately widened spreads” on the call. Result? A 7.7-point bump in gross margin YoY. Second, bigger transactions. Average purchase size climbed 6% to $300. And since fees are part flat, part percentage, larger tickets—especially ones over the $200 KYC cutoff—drive more revenue. Above that, the flat fee's almost irrelevant. It's the percentage markup that pulls weight. Bitcoin Depot Operating Leverage Revenue jumped 19% to $164.2M in the quarter. Solid. But the real story was on the cost side—operating expenses actually fell 7% over the same period. CFO David Gray chalked it up to “leverage on the significant revenue outperformance.” Translation: Revenue went up, but the fixed cost base didn't budge. A few things drove that. Depreciation dropped by $1M YoY—from $2.9M to $1.9M—as older kiosks fully depreciated. More kiosk activity, sure, but barely any added operating expense to support it. That's the beauty of a year like 2025, when they're not rolling out tons of new machines but instead squeezing more from the network they already built. There's also the kiosk shuffle. Bitcoin Depot pulled underperforming units from weak spots and dropped them into busier locations. More traffic per machine equals higher transaction volume. It's a cheap way to juice performance without sinking cash into new hardware. Gray called it a “continued process of relocating underperforming kiosks to optimize fleet profitability.” That's corporate speak for “move the laggards where people actually use them.” They also tightened up day-to-day spend. Armored cash collection costs fell from $2.0M to $1.6M YoY. Wireless and maintenance expenses stayed flat or ticked down. Finally, crypto acquisition costs—the big swing factor in COGS—still move with market prices. But most other expenses are fixed or semi-fixed. So, as volumes and average ticket sizes rise, more of that growth falls straight to the bottom line. That's why margins keep widening. Valuation Peer Set for Bitcoin Depot Valuing Bitcoin Depot? Honestly, there's no straight answer. You could argue Coinbase or Robinhood are decent comps because they're onboarding people into crypto, but then again, they're not exactly the same—they're purely digital. On the other side, maybe Western Union or Green Dot make more sense, at least for the physical network part. I don't know… none of these fit perfectly. But together? It gives you some idea of where Bitcoin Depot might land. YCharts BTM's operating margin has finally flipped into positive territory, and it's been trending up. It's still nowhere near the levels you see at high-margin fintech names like Robinhood or Coinbase, but it's already doing better than Green Dot ( GDOT ) and Bakkt ( BKKT ). Even compared to an old-school player like Western Union ( WU ), it stacks up reasonably well. Going forward, margin growth is probably going to be one of the big levers for any sort of valuation re-rating. YCharts Honestly, BTM feels way undervalued. It's trading at less than a third of Green Dot's price-to-sales—wild—and even further behind fintech darlings like Robinhood ( HOOD ) and Coinbase ( COIN ). Why? Probably a cocktail of reasons: slimmer margins vs. app-native players, being small-cap (which never helps), and lacking that crypto-exchange hype that lets Coinbase pull insane multiples. And yeah, on the surface, the forward P/E looks scary-high. But that's mostly optics. They're still early in profitability; earnings are thin because they're just now scaling. Worth noting: net income swung from a $4.2M loss to $12.2M gain YoY. If they can keep up that pace, P/E will compress fast. Feels like BTM fits more with growthy fintechs like Robinhood than dinosaurs like Western Union ( WU ). Right now, price-to-sales says “cheap” despite strong top-line growth and positive cash flow. Ops metrics aren't flashy, but they're moving up. The key? Margin expansion—especially gross margin—and getting more out of those ~3,200 active kiosks. If they nail that, re-rating becomes a real conversation. Next 2–3 quarters could be pivotal for closing the gap with GDOT and maybe even inching toward the low end of fintech comps. Risks Honestly, regulation might be the biggest wildcard for Bitcoin Depot. The BTM space is drawing more heat than ever— California's crackdown in 2024 wiped out 80% of their kiosks in the state. FinCEN is leaning harder on AML/KYC too, and let's not forget the risk of Congress taking a swing at cash-to-crypto onramps because of money laundering fears. Oh, and New York? Still off-limits unless they manage to lock down a license—not a given. For now, compliance is a moat for them. But if regulators keep tightening the screws, that “moat” could easily flip into a cost anchor. Then there's the whole Bitcoin price dynamic. Management likes to say kiosks pay back no matter what BTC does, but let's be real—demand still swings with crypto cycles. When prices spike, people transact more (median ticket jumped 46% last year during the bull run). But in a prolonged bear market? You'd probably see volumes sag. BTM isn't a pure BTC trade like miners or exchanges, but consumer excitement for crypto is still a big piece of the demand puzzle. Tech-wise, they don't have a killer app or proprietary hardware. Scale and relationships are their edge, but as apps like Cash App, Coinbase, and PayPal keep upping their game, that advantage could erode. Plus, the pool of cash-first users they target may naturally shrink as financial digitization keeps advancing. And let's not forget the physical kiosk issues like vandalism and service downtime. They need regular maintenance—cash loads, connectivity fixes—and high density in some regions leaves them exposed to local downturns. Wrapping Up Bitcoin Depot's scale leadership gives it a clear edge in the market. With a larger network than rivals, it benefits from lower per-unit costs, better retail placement, and the kind of network effects that are hard for smaller players to replicate. On top of that, its ability to generate free cash flow provides the firepower to pay down debt and potentially return capital to shareholders—without resorting to dilution. There's also significant embedded growth in the existing kiosk base. Many of the ~3,200 recently deployed units are still ramping, and as utilization improves, they should drive both top line growth and operating leverage. Expansion into international markets and restricted states like New York could unlock entirely new revenue streams, and the kicker is that much of this can happen with minimal incremental CapEx. Regulation, while often viewed as a headwind, could actually strengthen Bitcoin Depot's position. Their compliance infrastructure creates a moat that weaker competitors struggle to match, effectively forcing them out of the market. And finally, Bitcoin Depot's focus on the cash-to-crypto niche fills a gap that digital-only platforms like Cash App or Coinbase can't reach as effectively—serving cash-preferred and underbanked users who remain a large and underserved segment. That said, the problem lies in the fact that the market does not see a growth outburst outside the placement of a few thousand more kiosk units. Seeking Alpha Unless the company is capable of devising a strategy beyond its Bitcoin to cash niche, the market will keep shrugging it off as just a growth flare followed by stagnation, and that way, the company will not earn a valuation re-rating. Mainly because of this, I will remain on the sidelines on this stock.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800734-bitcoin-depot-a-cleaner-p-and-l-yet-market-wants-more-than-profit-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING","BTM",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T19:00:54,"Bitcoin’s Historic Ascent: How US Fiscal Policy Fuels Unprecedented Growth","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! Bitcoin (BTC) has once again defied expectations, smashing through previous records to hit an unprecedented all-time high of $118,800. This isn’t just another price pump; it’s a monumental moment driven by a powerful confluence of factors, chief among them being sustained institutional ETF inflows and strategic US fiscal policy decisions. If you’ve been watching the crypto market , you know this kind of milestone signals a significant shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. Understanding US Fiscal Policy and Its Impact on Bitcoin At the heart of Bitcoin’s latest surge lies the intricate dance between government spending and market dynamics. According to insights from The Block, the passage of what’s been colloquially termed the “Big Beautiful Bill” has played a pivotal role. But what exactly does this mean for the world’s leading cryptocurrency? What is Fiscal Policy? In simple terms, fiscal policy refers to the government’s use of spending and taxation to influence the economy. When governments spend more than they collect in taxes, they run a deficit, often funded by issuing more debt or, indirectly, by increasing the money supply. This expansionary policy aims to stimulate economic growth, but it can also lead to concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies. The “Big Beautiful Bill” and its Implications While specific details of the “Big Beautiful Bill” remain under wraps, its very existence points to a significant expansion of government spending. Historically, large-scale fiscal stimulus packages, particularly those involving substantial debt issuance, have prompted investors to seek out alternative assets that can serve as a hedge against potential currency depreciation. Nicolai Søndergaard, a seasoned analyst at Nansen, rightly points out that such US policy moves are actively creating a more favorable environment for Bitcoin . This isn’t a coincidence; it’s a direct reaction to the perceived long-term implications of expansive monetary and fiscal policies. Consider the following effects of robust fiscal policy: Increased Money Supply: Large government spending often necessitates an increase in the money supply, which can dilute the purchasing power of existing currency. Inflationary Concerns: More money chasing the same amount of goods and services can lead to inflation, eroding savings held in traditional fiat currencies. Search for Value Storage: Investors look for assets with limited supply and decentralized characteristics to preserve wealth. The Game-Changing Role of Bitcoin ETF Inflows Beyond fiscal policy, the relentless flow of capital into Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) has been a primary catalyst for its price action. These investment vehicles have revolutionized how traditional investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin , bridging the gap between mainstream finance and the nascent digital asset space. Demystifying Bitcoin ETFs A Bitcoin ETF allows investors to buy shares that represent ownership of Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies the investment process, making it accessible to a much wider audience, including institutional investors, retirement funds, and retail investors who prefer regulated investment products. Why ETF Inflows Matter for the Crypto Market The sustained influx of capital into these ETFs signifies a profound shift in institutional adoption. When major financial players and large investment funds pour billions into these products, it has several critical implications for the entire crypto market : Validation and Legitimacy: ETF approval and subsequent inflows lend significant credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, dispelling previous skepticism. Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing into the market improves liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoin without significant price impact. Broader Market Access: ETFs open the doors for a vast pool of traditional investors who previously couldn’t or wouldn’t engage directly with cryptocurrency exchanges. This expanded investor base creates sustained buying pressure. Supply Shock Potential: As ETFs accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin to back their shares, it reduces the available supply on exchanges, further driving up prices given constant or increasing demand. Bitcoin : A Digital Hedge Against Monetary Debasement ? The narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and monetary debasement isn’t new, but it has gained significant traction amidst current global economic conditions. As governments worldwide grapple with debt and potential inflation, Bitcoin’s unique properties make it an increasingly attractive alternative. The Debasement Dilemma Monetary debasement refers to the reduction in the intrinsic value of a currency, typically through inflation or by increasing the money supply. When a government prints more money or incurs massive debt, the purchasing power of each unit of currency can diminish over time. This erodes savings and makes long-term financial planning challenging for individuals and institutions alike. Bitcoin’s Value Proposition In this environment, Bitcoin shines. Here’s why it’s increasingly seen as a robust hedge: Decentralization: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single government or central bank, making it immune to political manipulation or arbitrary money printing. Fixed Supply: Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins, ensuring scarcity. This contrasts sharply with fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be transferred anywhere in the world without intermediaries, offering a borderless and censorship-resistant form of value transfer. Transparency: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain), providing unparalleled transparency. These characteristics position Bitcoin as a compelling alternative to traditional assets, especially when investors are seeking refuge from the potential pitfalls of expansionary fiscal policies and the resulting risk of monetary debasement . Navigating the New Landscape: Opportunities and Challenges for Bitcoin While the current environment presents immense opportunities for Bitcoin, it’s also crucial to acknowledge the challenges and consider actionable insights for investors. Key Benefits of Bitcoin’s Growth Increased Mainstream Acceptance: New ATHs and institutional involvement normalize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. Innovation and Development: A rising price often fuels further investment into the Bitcoin ecosystem, leading to technological advancements. Wealth Preservation: For many, Bitcoin is proving to be an effective tool for preserving wealth against inflation. Potential Challenges Ahead Despite the positive momentum, the crypto market remains dynamic and faces potential hurdles: Volatility: While Bitcoin has shown remarkable growth, it remains a volatile asset. Price corrections are a natural part of its market cycle. Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments globally are still developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. Unfavorable regulations could impact market sentiment. Macroeconomic Shifts: A significant shift in global economic policy or a sudden reduction in fiscal stimulus could alter market dynamics. What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin ? The convergence of expansionary US fiscal policy and robust ETF inflows has undeniably propelled Bitcoin into uncharted territory. This latest all-time high is not merely a number; it’s a testament to Bitcoin’s growing maturity as a global asset and its increasingly recognized role as a vital hedge against monetary debasement . As traditional financial systems navigate complex economic landscapes, Bitcoin stands ready to offer a decentralized, finite, and increasingly accepted alternative for wealth preservation and growth. This period marks a pivotal moment for the entire crypto market , signaling a deeper integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric. While the journey may still involve volatility, the fundamental drivers supporting Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition appear stronger than ever.

2025-07-11T18:54:09,"What Was the Real Reason for the Recent Bitcoin Rally? Analytics Company Lays Out the Reasons in Depth","Cryptocurrency analysis firm QCP Capital has published a comprehensive market assessment following Bitcoin's all-time high. Pointing out that Bitcoin was traded at $118,000 this morning, the company stated that this level is an indicator of both enthusiasm in the market and structural solidity. According to QCP Capital, the primary macro driver behind the rise is the Trump administration's reintroduction of tariffs. The firm notes that manufacturers and exporters are accelerating imports, stockpiling, and increasing production ahead of the new tax period. This frontloading process has led to a significant expansion of trade and production credit. The report stated, “Whether Trump will delay implementation again remains uncertain. However, these cycles of threats and delays positively increase economic uncertainty. Business confidence and production indices remain in growth territory.” Related News: BREAKING: Highly Surprising Move from Coinbase - Official X Account Changes Profile Photo to Surprise Altcoin - Price Jumps This view is particularly supported by the rising price of copper, a leading indicator of industrial health. This commodity, nicknamed “Doctor Copper,” signals rising industrial demand and improving liquidity conditions. According to QCP Capital, the second key macro development driving Bitcoin's rise is the accelerating era of financial dominance in the US. The firm notes that economic activity continues to expand despite high interest rates. The US Treasury Department's “Activist Issuance Strategy,” which repurchases long-term debt by issuing short-term bonds, rebalances the debt structure and reduces interest rate volatility. This creates a more predictable environment for financial markets. “Short-term bonds are seen as almost cash equivalents. Limited long-term issuance keeps the MOVE index low and tightens credit risk premiums, supporting the gradual rise in financial assets,” the report said. Before labeling the market euphoria a “bubble,” QCP Capital points out that it could actually be an indicator of mass adoption. With copper and global stock indices hitting records, it's natural that monetary hedges like gold and Bitcoin would similarly surge. The company noted that inflows into ETFs and public crypto treasuries are outpacing token supply and miner sales. Analysts believe indicators like STRK stock and SharpLink, which have absorbed ETH-related sales, suggest this structural demand is continuing. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T18:45:26,"Banks With One ‘Deficient’ Rating Could Still Be Considered ‘Well Managed’ Under New Federal Reserve Proposal","The U.S. Federal Reserve is mulling a rule change that would allow banks with one “deficient” rating to still be considered “well managed.” The Fed’s current large financial institution (LFI) rating framework includes three components: capital, liquidity and governance/controls, each of which has four potential ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1 and deficient-2. Currently, a single deficient-1 or deficient-2 score in any of the three components means a bank is no longer considered “well managed.” The Fed notes large banks must be “well managed” at each of their depository institutions to be treated as a financial holding company, which permits a firm to engage in a broader range of nonbanking activities like securities underwriting and dealing. Michelle W. Bowman, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, says nearly two-thirds of the large financial holding companies under the LFI rating framework aren’t considered “well managed” in the current system, despite having capital and liquidity levels “substantially above regulatory requirements.” “This is because the LFI framework currently assigns a firm’s ‘well-managed’ status based on a single deficiency in any one rating component, rather than taking a complete look at the financial and managerial health of a firm. The proposal would generally require a deficiency in either a large bank holding company’s capital or liquidity ratings, in addition to a deficiency in its governance and controls, in order to be classified as not well-managed. In this way, the proposal would provide greater recognition of a firm’s overall condition in determining well-managed status.” Banks with a single “deficient-2” score, the more severe deficiency, would still not be considered “well managed” in the proposed new system. The Fed is currently asking for public input on the proposal.
