2025-07-11T04:21:00,"BTC continues climb above $116K, XRP surges over 6% as bulls target $3","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its bullish run on Friday, trading above $116,000 after setting a new all-time high the previous day. Bitcoin’s consolidation around the upper boundary of its previously broken range at $108,355 ended on Wednesday, paving the way for a sharp move higher. The rally was mirrored by Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), both of which broke through key resistance levels, reinforcing the broader strength across the top cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, both major cryptocurrencies were trading over 6% higher. The overall crypto market was up around 5% to trade at $3.64 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance is around 64%. As bullish structures continue to form, traders are positioning for further upside, with sentiment turning increasingly optimistic. The surge also triggered the largest wave of liquidations in years, underscoring the abrupt shift in market momentum. The Bitcoin rally: where is BTC going? The cryptocurrency is now up approximately 24% year-to-date, with analysts setting their sights on $130,000 as the next major resistance. According to 10X Research, the latest breakout was driven by a decisive shift in market structure toward a bullish trend. Bitcoin has reached 10X Research’s July price target of $116,000, a level the firm projected based on seasonal trends pointing to a 9% rally. 10x Research @10x_Research · Follow The Quiet Bitcoin Signal That Triggered $1 Billion in Crypto LiquidationsActionable Market InsightsWhy this report mattersBitcoin just hit our July price target ($116,000)—but what’s unfolding beneath the surface is even more critical. A fresh uptrend signal has 8:07 am · 11 Jul 2025 3 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply While 10X had previously expected a broader consolidation through the summer, its outlook turned more bullish in recent weeks as upside positioning remained limited, setting the stage for a sharp move higher. According to the firm, a fresh trading signal was triggered as Bitcoin made a new short-term high, indicating that the rally could extend further. Historically, such signals have produced a median gain of 20%, with six out of ten instances delivering positive returns. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could climb as high as $133,000 by September, as per the research firm. Crypto liquidations surge More than $1.14 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass, marking one of the most significant shakeouts in recent months. Short traders bore the brunt of the losses, accounting for nearly $1.02 billion of the total. Bitcoin alone was responsible for over half of the liquidations, with $591 million in positions wiped out. Ethereum followed with $241 million in liquidations, while other major tokens—including Hyperliquid, Solana, and XRP—also experienced sharp losses. ETH and XRP eye key targets Ethereum rebounded after finding support near the $2,461 daily level last week, rallying 10% to close above its resistance at $2,724 on Wednesday. The upward momentum continued with a 6.59% gain on Thursday, bringing the price to retest the key psychological level of $3,000. As of Friday, ETH is hovering around $2,970. A daily close above $3,000 could pave the way for a move toward the next resistance level at $3,730. US spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows of $383 million on Thursday, marking five consecutive days of positive flows. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw the biggest inflow at around $300.9 million. Ripple (XRP) extended its recovery on Friday, reaching highs of around $2.59. According to data from Glassnode, the number of addresses on the XRP Ledger has steadily increased over the past two years, now averaging 7.3 million—up from 6.3 million at the start of the year and 5.7 million as of July 10, 2024. The ongoing growth in network activity, coupled with recent price momentum, suggests XRP may have the potential to accelerate its uptrend, with a short-term target above the $3.00 mark.

Called the Crypto Blue Chip ETF, the fund will track cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cronos, and now XRP. XRP Price Prediction Since the announcement, XRP’s price has surged. In the last 24 hours alone, it’s up 6%, currently trading at $2.57, and eyeing the $2.60 mark next. The breakout has opened doors for a fresh rally, with targets at $2.67 and beyond in the coming days or weeks. On the charts, analysts are spotting bullish signs. In fact, XRP has officially broken out of a major resistance zone between $2.31 and $2.36, a level that had capped its price for weeks. The breakout suggests that XRP is moving out of its long sideways range and could be gearing up for a stronger rally. If XRP can clear short-term hurdles around $2.44, it could continue climbing towards its next important resistance between $2.60 and $2.65. On the downside, any pullback might find support around the old resistance zone at $2.31 to $2.36, now expected to act as a safety net for prices. Can XRP Hit New All-Time-Highs? XRP is currently in the middle of a third wave rally, a phase typically known for strong upward moves. If this momentum continues, XRP could eventually eye $3.30, $5.00, and possibly even higher levels like $9.81 in the longer term, though that would require very bullish market conditions. In the short term, if prices face a pullback, key support levels to watch are around $2.25–$2.36.

2025-07-11T04:00:50,"Bank Of Korea Warns Of Stablecoins From Non-Bank Entities, Claims Risk Of Market Confusion","The Bank of Korea’s Governor has warned about the issuance of stablecoins by non-bank entities, arguing that these digital assets could confuse monetary policies and foreign exchange regulations. BOK Concerned About Non-Bank Stablecoins At a Thursday press conference, Bank of Korea (BOK) Governor Lee Chang-yong expressed concerns about the potential issuance of digital assets pegged to the Korean Won (KRW) by non-bank entities. According to local news outlet Yonhap News Agency, Lee affirmed that “if multiple non-bank institutions issue won-pegged stablecoins, it could lead to confusion similar to that caused by private currency issuance in the 19th century,” likely referring to the Free Banking Era between 1837 and 1864 in the US. “In such a situation, it would be difficult to implement monetary policy, and adverse effects such as having to go through the process of returning to a central bank system again could arise,” he stated. The BOK’s governor explained that if won-pegged stablecoins are allowed to be issued indiscriminately, it could conflict with foreign exchange liberalization policies. Additionally, allowing non-bank entities to handle payments and settlement services could also significantly alter banks’ profit structure. Nonetheless, he considers that the issue can’t be decided by the Bank of Korea alone, as it needs to be discussed with the pertinent authorities. “Once the relevant minister is appointed, we will discuss and determine the direction to take,” he shared. Lee’s remarks follow the growing momentum of stablecoins in the country. Recently, Min Byeong-deok, a member of the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), proposed a comprehensive legislation to establish a more structured regulatory framework for crypto assets in the country, which includes a licensing system for stablecoin issuers and clear rules. The proposed Digital Assets Basic Act is expected to complement the Virtual Asset Investor Protection Act, potentially allowing non-bank entities to participate in the issuance of stablecoins. A bank official recently told the local news media outlet that the financial institutions are preparing for two legalization scenarios, as it remains unclear whether non-bank entities will be allowed to be stablecoin issuers. As such, the banking sector is considering a business model in which banks establish a joint venture to collectively issue stablecoins, while also contacting various non-bank companies to prepare for the legalization and issuance of stablecoins. Meanwhile, another bank official affirmed that banks are discussing stablecoins with the BOK, other banks, “payment” companies, crypto exchanges, and blockchain companies to prepare for the upcoming launch. South Korea’s Digital Asset Shift As the atmosphere shifts toward stablecoins, the Bank of Korea has also pivoted to the sector. As reported by Bitcoinist, the financial institution halted its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project, the Hank River Project, ahead of its second phase of testing. Notably, the BOK and seven banks finished the first phase of testing in June and originally scheduled the second stage for the end of the year. During the now-suspended phase, the project was going to focus on testing peer-to-peer transfers, expanding payment merchant locations, and simplifying authentication methods. Banks participating in the project reportedly requested that the BOK establish a CBDC General User Real-Transaction Test Task Force involving all relevant departments of the Bank of Korea and banks. The request aimed to develop a long-term roadmap, including post-test commercialization plans, as the financial entities were bearing the “excessive cost burden without concrete plans for commercialization.” According to a senior bank official, the Bank of Korea explained that it would “wait and see how the situation develops, given that the legalization of stablecoins is currently underway, while it is unclear how CBDC, stablecoins, and deposit tokens differ and can coexist.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bank-of-korea-warns-of-stablecoins-from-non-bank-entities-claims-risk-of-market-confusion/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News|Bank of Korea|bank of Korea governor|bitcoin|BOK|btc|BTCUSDT|soth korea stablecoins|South korean banks|stablecoin bill|Stablecoin regulation|Stablecoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T03:52:22,"FETH: The Ethereum Hype Has Merit","Summary Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin significantly since the launch of spot ETH ETFs in the US, declining 22% versus Bitcoin's 64% gain. Despite Ethereum's lagging price action, some investors and companies, like Bit Digital, are making sizable bets on ETH over BTC. There is some merit to the recent hype surrounding ETH given stablecoin footprint, stablecoin transfer volume, and tokenized asset trends. The Fidelity Ethereum ETF is my preferred ETH-proxy due to its reasonable fee and custody self-reliance. As we approach a full year with spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs in the United States, the price performance of the underlying asset has utterly disappointed against that of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Data by YCharts In fact, since the launch of spot ETH funds in the US, Ethereum has actually declined by nearly 22% while Bitcoin has grown by close to 64% and just made yet another all time high mark just under $114k per coin. In spite of that, with the 'Bitcoin Treasury' narrative in the public markets getting increasingly crowded and competitive, big bets are being made on Ethereum - most notably from SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) back in May as well as from Bit Digital ( BTBT ) more recently; the latter being a company that I hold and have covered roughly a dozen times through the years. Is the Ethereum Treasury flavor of 2025's crypto capital raise bonanza warranted on any fundamental justification? This article covering the Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ) will aim to assess if it's finally time to long ETH and its many proxies rather than the Bitcoin-adjacent products and equities that have done so well year to date. Year To Date Capital Flows Versus ETH Market Dominance 2025 has been good for Digital Asset investment products. The asset class is running on twelve consecutive weeks of positive net flows and is coming in at just under $19 billion in net investment demand year to date: Asset (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin $719 $15,719 $164,182 Ethereum $202 $3,086 $15,864 Multi-asset -$10.7 $60 $4,103 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $21.6 $113 $1,436 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $10.6 $335 $1,409 Total $947 $18,962 $188,156 BTC Dominance 75.9% 82.9% 87.3% ETH Dominance 21.3% 16.3% 8.4% Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of July 4th Ethereum's share of this net flow is interesting. While BTC is still clearly driving the bus in the industry, ETH has started to take a larger share this year and this summer. Of the total $188.2 billion in AUM, ETH claims just an 8.4% share of the market. ETH Dominance (CoinMarketCap) This is somewhat in line with the 9% share of total digital asset market capitalization shown in the chart above. Yet, there is a clear change happening. Year to date, ETH is pulling in 16.3% of net flow and 21.3% through the first few days of July. That's a small sample size, to be sure, but similar to the 23% share exhibited during the month of June. The point is, digital asset investors and corporate treasury stewards are increasingly betting on ETH. Why? Is There Justification For ETH Excitement? From a raw activity standpoint, Ethereum is still far from what I'd call irrational exuberance. Metrics like daily active addresses or monthly transactions show generally positive trends over the last year. That said, fees are a big part of this ecosystem, and Ethereum generated $39.1 million in monthly fees in June. While that was actually ahead of Solana for the first time since December, June fees were still well below the highs of last year and not even remotely close to the highs from the prior bull cycle. Monthly Fee Trend By Chain (Artemis) That said, Ethereum is still seeing growth in key areas. For instance, in the all-important stablecoin segment of the market, Ethereum has the largest share of any blockchain network and continues to see growth in monthly transfer volume: Monthly Ethereum Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Artemis) June marked the fourth consecutive month where Ethereum processed at least $1 trillion in stablecoin transfers. Though Base ( COIN ) actually beat Ethereum in the metric during the month, Ethereum beat Solana, Base, and Tron ( TRX-USD ) in stablecoin transfer volume in 3 of the last 4 months. Asset tokenization is an area that has been generating some headlines lately with Hester Peirce of the SEC recently insinuating that tokenized stocks are indeed still securities. Ethereum does not have a large share of the $427 million tokenized stocks market cap, but it is crushing the competition in tokenized treasuries: Tokenized Treasuries (RWA.xyz) As of article submission, the total market cap of tokenized treasury products across all blockchains is $7.5 billion. Of that number, Ethereum has a commanding 77% share of the market and is by far the largest recipient of BlackRock's ( BLK ) Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL-USD) with $2.6 billion of that $2.8 billion product. My personal view is we are still in the early stages of asset tokenization. It's something that I wrote about specifically pertaining to Ethereum exactly two years ago, and it's terrific to see the thesis beginning to take shape. FETH Is Still A Solid Choice For ETH Exposure I wrote about the Fidelity Ethereum ETF back when it launched in 2024 and have not updated my view since. I still like this fund, and it's my primary vector for ETH exposure at this point in time. Fund Details Ticker FETH Inception 07/22/2024 Expense Ratio 0.25% AUM $1.45B Source: Grayscale Fidelity's ETH product is not the cheapest at 0.25%, though it is very much in line with the market. It isn't the largest fund by AUM at $1.45 billion. But it is the only fund that self-manages the ETH assets rather than relying on Coinbase ( COIN ) for custody services. This minimizes third-party risk and potentially keeps fees lower longer term should Coinbase ever decide to raise the price on custody. Most importantly, the fund performs in line with the market. Data by YCharts I don't see much of a downside in picking FETH over something like ETHA, despite the large AUM disparity. If anything, I think giving away a couple bps is worth the third-party risk minimization. Risks To FETH and ETH In many ways, what we're witnessing in the market today could be a sign of very late-cycle behavior. Not just for equities but for digital assets as well. The proliferation of public companies looking to raise capital with the promise of scaling digital asset treasuries could certainly be viewed as an alarming trend. The masters of this craft over in Tysons Corner, Virginia, are actually experiencing compression in mNAV: MSTR mNAV 1yr (StrategyTracker) Strategy ( MSTR ) currently has an mNAV multiple of 1.9x. This is closer to a 1 year low than a 1 year high and perhaps an indication that the appetite for any and all equity premiums over digital asset values isn't actually limitless after all. Just because buying Bitcoin at any price has worked so well for the MSTR, it does not mean every company that buys BTC, ETH, or SOL will be able to generate the same positive flywheel that Strategy just pulled off over the last 28 months. So if one is buying ETH under the assumption that an ETH-based Strategy-type actor will emerge and pump everyone's bags, I wouldn't hold my breath. Final Takeaways Despite what I view to be fairly obvious risks, longing Ethereum and products like FETH could well provide long-term gains in an environment where tokenization takes a larger share of global assets. Ethereum is the top network for stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. It's still home to several of the top protocols in DeFi, like AAVE ( AAVE-USD ) and Uniswap ( UNI-USD ). And it could certainly benefit from taking a larger share of tokenized stocks should Ethereum prove to be the winning network as far as TradFi actors like Blackrock are concerned. Until there is a viable staking ETF in the US market, FETH is still my preferred long-ETH product for long-term investors.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800529-feth-the-ethereum-hype-has-merit?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING","ETH-USD|FETH",cryptocompare

The latest rally caught traders off guard and triggered the highest wave of liquidations in years, signaling a powerful shift in momentum. As of 11:15pm ET, Bitcoin had broken past the earlier high of $113,734 set just hours prior. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is now up roughly 24% year-to-date, with analysts eyeing $130,000 as the next key level. The latest price spike came as market structure turned decisively bullish, according to 10X Research. Traders Rush to Reposition After Quiet Volatility Triggers Bullish Setup In a note to clients, the firm said a short-term breakout signal had been triggered, historically followed by median gains of 20%. That would imply a price target near $133,000 by September. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is now in the ""Greed"" zone after $BTC hit a new ATH earlier today. Where do you stand on the scale? pic.twitter.com/c4LkrLF1fH — CoinGecko (@coingecko) July 11, 2025 “Our trading signals indicate that this short-term breakout carries a 60% probability of further upside over the next two months,” Markus Thielen, founder of 10X, told Cryptonews. Behind the scenes, the landscape has been quietly shifting. Implied volatility recently hit its lowest levels in months, giving traders cheap access to upside bets. At the same time, many had been underexposed following June’s options expiry, leading to a scramble to reposition. Over $1B in Short Positions Liquidated as Bitcoin Blasts Higher Adding fuel to the rally, over $1.14b in leveraged positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours alone, according to data from CoinGlass . Of that, nearly $1.02b came from short traders. BREAKING: OVER $1 BILLION WORTH OF SHORTS ON CRYPTO LIQUIDATED IN THE PAST 24 HOURS pic.twitter.com/jlLixbWanA — DEGEN NEWS (@DegenerateNews) July 11, 2025 Bitcoin accounted for more than half of the total carnage, with $591m in liquidations. Ethereum saw $241m wiped out, while smaller tokens like Hyperliquid, Solana and XRP also saw heavy losses. Trump Policies, $15B in ETF Buys Add Fuel to Bitcoin’s Fire This new wave of volatility comes as Trump’s crypto-friendly policies gain traction. In March, the president signed an executive order to establish a national crypto reserve. His administration has since appointed pro-crypto voices to key positions, including SEC’s Paul Atkins and AI policy lead David Sacks. Meanwhile, Trump-linked businesses are deepening their involvement. Trump Media & Technology Group recently filed to launch a crypto ETF that would hold multiple tokens, including Bitcoin. With steady ETF demand, easing macro conditions and regulatory tailwinds, many traders now see this breakout as the start of a broader uptrend. “Bitcoin may be transitioning into a higher trading range,” said Thielen. “Since mid-April, Bitcoin ETFs have bought $15b worth of BTC and they are causing prices to rally.” As crypto markets heat up once again, all eyes are on next week’s US CPI print and the start of “Crypto Week” in Washington, both of which could offer fresh catalysts, or risks, for the world’s most closely watched digital asset.

2025-07-11T03:34:59,"Rare Flip: Ethereum’s $62.1B Futures Volume Tops Bitcoin’s $61.7B","In a rare but potentially telling market shift, Ethereum futures volume overtook Bitcoin’s over a 24-hour period, recording $62.1 billion compared to BTC’s $61.7 billion on July 10. This reversal, highlighted by market analytics platform Glassnode, may suggest a subtle but meaningful rotation in trader sentiment. While the OG cryptocurrency remains the market leader in price and dominance, Ethereum’s uptick could point to growing confidence in its ecosystem. Catalysts Driving the Ethereum Surge Several converging factors could explain this sudden dominance, including growing institutional confidence in the second-largest crypto by market cap, as evidenced by Bit Digital’s recent move to convert its entire $173 million BTC treasury into Ethereum. We also recently saw deep-pocketed investors scoop up 200,000 ETH worth more than half a billion dollars over a two-day period. Not only did they boost their collective holdings to 22% of ETH’s supply, but they also indicated their long-term conviction in the asset. Additionally, there’s anticipation building around potential approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of staking within spot Ethereum ETFs. According to K33 Research, this could push up the price of ETH far more significantly than has been done by technical upgrades to the network. And while Bitcoin may have reached a new all-time high (ATH) past $113,000, the flip arrived just as ETH recorded a sizable uptick of its own, hitting $2,810 at one point, to move closer to a key resistance level not breached since February. Analysts like Daan Crypto Trades argue that a break above $2,800 could trigger liquidations that would ignite “a lot of momentum,” which might see Ethereum reach $3,000 and beyond. Market Mechanics Interestingly, during BTC’s run to the new ATH, Glassnode observed a curious shift in the structure of the futures market. In late June, rising Bitcoin prices were met with declining open interest, possibly indicating short squeezes; however, this time, open interest went up alongside BTC’s price, suggesting fresh long positions were entering the market. Despite Ethereum’s strong showing, caution remains warranted. Bitcoin still commands a greater share of institutional products and remains the macro barometer for crypto.

2025-07-11T03:28:46,"Crypto Scammer’s Sentence Jumps from 18 Months to 12 Years in $20M Fraud Case","A man convicted in a $22 million crypto fraud scheme saw his prison sentence sharply increased after failing to repay the money he owed his victim. Nicholas Truglia, 27, who was initially sentenced to 18 months, received a new 12-year sentence on Thursday in a New York federal court. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ordered the increase after ruling that Truglia had willfully ignored his obligation to pay back nearly $20.4 million in restitution. “You paid not a cent, not one cent,” Judge Hellerstein told Truglia during the hearing. The judge further ordered an added 3-month supervised release while noting Truglia’s lifestyle. “You didn’t have a job, but you lived in splendor,” Judge Hellerstein said. Judge Slams Crypto Fraudster’s Lavish Lifestyle in SIM-Swap Sentencing According to the report from Bloomberg, Truglia’s legal team argued the new sentence was unlawful. His attorney, Mark Gombiner, said in court that the punishment was “an extraordinary abuse of discretion” and confirmed plans to appeal. #breaking for real: Hacker Truglia sentenced to 12 years, more than double the guideline of 51 to 63 months, for not paying his $20 million restitution. Video of him speaking behind a mask cited and used. Appeal to follow – but remand to Marshals about to occur https://t.co/tWBdzgd4zT — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) July 10, 2025 Arrested in the California Bay Area in 2018, Truglia pleaded guilty in 2021 to participating in a scheme that involved hijacking a victim’s phone number through SIM swapping and draining their crypto accounts. The hackers exploited a telecom employee to gain control of Michael Terpin’s phone number. Terpin, a blockchain investor and CEO of Transform Group, suffered a loss of $24 million due to this scheme. Notably, Truglia was tasked with converting stolen cryptocurrency into Bitcoin. In 2019, Terpin filed a civil lawsuit for $75 million against the scammer and was awarded the full amount in damages by the court. That same year, he also took legal action against AT&T, his wireless carrier at the time, filing a $224 million lawsuit for their negligence. Their failure to secure his cell phone allowed the hackers to compromise it, resulting in his loss. At the time of his initial sentencing, prosecutors revealed that Truglia held more than $50 million in assets, including cryptocurrency, luxury goods, and fine art. Gombiner told the court that his client had turned over all assets he could access, including funds from a Wells Fargo account. Truglia claimed that much of his wealth remained locked in an inaccessible Bitcoin wallet. He told the judge he would repay the victim if he could access the funds. Terpin, who joined the hearing by phone, rejected that explanation, calling it “a giant smoke screen.” U.S. Ramps Up Enforcement as Crypto Crimes Lead to Decades-Long Sentences In the U.S., crypto crimes continue to result in severe penalties. On May 23, Trung Nguyen, a Massachusetts man who ran an unlicensed cash-to-Bitcoin business, was sentenced to six years in federal prison . His company, disguised as a vending machine operator, processed over $1 million in illicit cash, including funds for a known methamphetamine dealer. Nguyen, who used the alias “DCS420,” was convicted in 2024 for money laundering and failing to register with FinCEN. Just two weeks earlier, on May 9, Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa received a 30-year sentence for sending crypto to ISIS operatives . U.S. prosecutors revealed that between 2019 and 2022, Chhipa funneled more than $185,000 to the terrorist group, funding fighters and prison escapes. A federal judge sentenced Chhipa to over 30 years for funding ISIS through cryptocurrency, supporting fighter salaries, and prison breaks. #DOJ #CryptoCrime https://t.co/74BdhgaEjh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 His use of burner phones and fake identities ultimately failed to hide his tracks. He was caught attempting to flee and intercepted on an Interpol notice. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice is pushing for a 20-year sentence for Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius. Prosecutors say Mashinsky’s fraudulent practices cost investors $550 million, describing his actions as deliberate and self-serving. Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding investors with false promises of high crypto returns. #Celsius #AlexMashinsky https://t.co/R4syyDiKaU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 He pled guilty in late 2024 after Celsius collapsed in mid-2022, freezing $4.7 billion in customer funds.

2025-07-11T02:00:26,"Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal?","Altcoins have endured years of underperformance as Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market. Despite several short-lived rallies, most altcoins remain far below their previous highs, weighed down by investor skepticism and capital concentration in BTC. However, there are signs that sentiment might be shifting. In recent days, strong altcoins have started to recover, showing resilience as broader market conditions improve. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops – Bullish Setup Takes Shape Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical setup revealing that the altcoin market is now bouncing off a major support zone. This move has sparked fresh debates among traders and investors. Is this the start of a long-awaited altseason, or merely a temporary relief bounce before further downside? The bounce comes as macroeconomic uncertainty begins to fade and liquidity returns to the crypto market. Still, key resistance levels remain untouched for many projects, and overall confidence in altcoins hasn’t fully returned. While the current setup is promising, confirmation will depend on whether this rally can break above critical levels and sustain higher prices. Altcoins Eye A Breakout As Ethereum Holds The Key Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but sentiment is beginning to shift. Bulls are preparing for an expansive move across the board, with growing anticipation that a breakout could materialize once Ethereum clears its current resistance zone. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a well-defined consolidation range, and altcoins have mirrored this sideways behavior, struggling to gain momentum without a clear signal from the market’s second-largest asset. Carl Runefelt recently shared insights suggesting that the altcoin market is showing signs of life. By analyzing the TOTAL3 chart—which tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—Runefelt highlights that altcoins are bouncing off key support in BTC terms. This bounce could indicate the beginning of a recovery rally, especially if capital rotation from BTC into altcoins accelerates in the coming sessions. Historically, altcoins thrive when Ethereum leads the charge. A confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance zone could ignite broad participation and kickstart a new altseason. The current market structure suggests that many investors are positioning early, anticipating that macroeconomic clarity and market stability will fuel risk-on behavior. However, the rally is not yet confirmed. Bulls still need Ethereum to break out decisively and sustain momentum above recent highs. If that happens, many oversold altcoins could see sharp recoveries and set the stage for a broader market expansion. For now, patience and timing remain key as traders watch ETH and TOTAL3 closely for signals of the next leg up. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves TOTAL3 Chart Shows Key Rebound From Macro Support The TOTAL3 chart, which measures the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is showing early signs of recovery after a sustained period of weakness. As of now, the chart reflects a bounce from the $830 billion level, which aligns closely with the 100-week simple moving average (SMA), currently acting as dynamic support. This level has historically served as a critical pivot zone, especially in mid-cycle consolidations. The market cap sits near $875 billion, still over 40% below the previous cycle’s peak, but with bullish momentum building. The recent weekly candle has posted a strong green body, suggesting renewed interest in the altcoin segment. Volume has also picked up, showing growing confidence among participants as many altcoins recover from deeply oversold conditions. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise Technically, this bounce could signal the beginning of a new macro leg higher, especially if the 50-week SMA is reclaimed and price holds above $900 billion.

2025-07-11T01:22:10,"Bitcoin crosses $117K as Ether hits $3,000 and XRP surges by 5%","Bitcoin is now sitting above $117,000 for the first time in its history, rising more than 60% since its lowest point in April. The exact figure? $117,080. Ether touched $3,000, before rebounding slightly to $2,800 at press time. Meanwhile, XRP surged by 5% to $2.6. This rally is happening while the U.S. Dollar saw its steepest six-month fall since 1973, dropping nearly 11% amid a simultaneous rally in tech stocks, led by Nvidia, which just became the first company ever to hit $4 trillion. The timing of Bitcoin’s price actions lines up exactly with new warnings about U.S. debt, fiscal chaos, and an economy that’s clearly slipping. In early April 2025, Bitcoin had been sinking as markets braced for another global trade war. On April 9th, the White House hit pause on tariffs, giving a 90-day delay. That was the same day Bitcoin bottomed. Then on April 20th, without a single headline moving markets, Bitcoin suddenly shot up, and didn’t stop. Something deeper was driving the rebound. The U.S. government just raised the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, bringing it to $41.1 trillion. Right now, the national debt is hovering around $37 trillion. If things stay on track, the ceiling will be maxed out again in under three years. That’s the real issue spooking the market. Elon exits DOGE as Bitcoin spikes On April 22nd, Elon Musk announced he was stepping down from the Department of Government Efficiency, also called DOGE. That announcement came just two days after the rally began, and the timing matched too perfectly to ignore. The market read it as a sign that the fiscal picture in Washington was even worse than expected. Elon’s exit was quickly followed by an open fight between him and President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House after the 2024 election. But that clash wasn’t just personal. It was political, and it came as Trump pushed Congress to pass what he called the “Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB). The bill is projected to add $5.5 trillion to the national debt if made permanent. As talk of the bill intensified, Bitcoin climbed even faster. The full timeline shows how closely Bitcoin tracked the bill’s progress. On June 22nd, Bitcoin briefly dipped into its $100,000 support. But by July 1st, as analysts increased the odds of the OBBB passing, the price started to rise again. On July 3rd, the House approved the bill. And by July 4th, Trump had signed it into law. That same week, Bitcoin passed $117,000, while the U.S. Dollar Index dropped to levels not seen since March 2022. That’s not the only sign of trouble. In the first half of 2025, the dollar dropped 10.8%, its worst performance to start a year since 1973. Even during the inflation panic of 1986, the dollar didn’t fall this fast. And the drop is continuing despite Trump’s ongoing tariff campaign. The administration has been sending out “tariff letters” and escalating pressure on foreign trade partners. Normally, that kind of aggression should boost the dollar. But that’s not what’s happening. Elon launched his new “America Party” a few days ago. When asked on X if the party would support Bitcoin, Elon didn’t dodge. “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” he said. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has taken a hard line. The latest FOMC minutes show that several members see no rate cuts coming in 2025. The official stance has been “wait and see” for months, meaning interest rates will likely stay higher for longer. That, too, should support the dollar. But the opposite is playing out. The greenback keeps sinking, and that has everything to do with the debt crisis. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While the broader trend remains bullish, some analysts now anticipate a short-term pullback. Bitcoin Remains Bullish But Some Pullback Expected According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, early warning signs suggest that BTC may face a brief correction. The analyst noted that if momentum doesn’t pick up soon, Bitcoin could struggle to maintain its bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top Binance taker buy/sell volume has shown a noticeable spike in aggressive buy orders – usually a bullish signal – but sell volume has also risen in tandem, effectively absorbing most of the demand. Despite this uptick in buy volume, BTC’s price has not responded proportionally, suggesting distribution or selling pressure. For the uninitiated, Binance taker buy/sell volume measures the amount of aggressive buying versus selling on the exchange using market orders. A higher taker buy volume indicates strong buyer interest, while higher taker sell volume signals stronger selling pressure. In addition, Binance open interest has surged during the recent price rally, signalling an influx of leveraged positions. While rising open interest can support further gains, the subdued price reaction raises concerns about Bitcoin’s short-term strength. Meanwhile, funding rates have stayed mostly neutral throughout the rally. However, the most recent push to a new ATH saw BTC’s funding rates turn slightly positive, hinting at increasing long exposure and renewed bullish sentiment. The breakout also triggered significant short liquidations, likely fuelling a short squeeze. Data from Coinglass shows that over the past 24 hours, $521 million in positions were liquidated – $448 million of which were shorts. Market Needs A Breather Before Climbing Higher Concluding, the CryptoQuant contributor noted that despite the emerging signs of caution, Bitcoin’s overall bullish structure remains intact. However, the market is now seeing the early signs of a potential short-term pullback, especially due to the spike-driven nature of the move.

For example, crypto analyst Christian Chifoi suggested that the current price action may be a deceptive move designed to trap bullish traders – potentially pushing BTC down to $97,000 before the final rally begins. That said, the recent weakness observed in the US Dollar Index (DXY) has fuelled hopes for a capital reallocation to alternative assets, including BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $110,885, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-11T00:10:35,"BlackRock Unveils Astounding Shift: More Ethereum Than Bitcoin Acquired","In the fast-paced world of digital assets, where headlines often dictate market sentiment, a recent revelation has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency community. Imagine the world’s largest asset manager, a titan like BlackRock , making a significant pivot in its digital asset strategy. For years, Bitcoin has been the poster child for institutional interest, but new data suggests a compelling narrative shift. What if the institutional giants are now looking beyond Bitcoin, and seeing immense potential in another leading cryptocurrency? The Institutional Shift: BlackRock’s Bold Ethereum Play The news broke via Arkham Intelligence, a prominent blockchain analytics platform, on X (formerly Twitter): BlackRock , with its staggering assets under management, is reportedly buying more Ethereum than Bitcoin . This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a significant re-prioritization that speaks volumes about evolving institutional perspectives on digital assets. Specifically, Arkham Intelligence reported that BlackRock acquired ETH worth $158 million, compared to approximately $125 million worth of BTC. This difference, while not astronomical, marks a notable divergence from the typical Bitcoin-first approach that has characterized much of the recent institutional adoption narrative. To put these figures into perspective, consider the recent inflows into Bitcoin Spot ETFs, many of which are managed by firms like BlackRock. While Bitcoin continues to attract substantial capital, this specific transaction highlights a growing appetite for Ethereum’s unique value proposition. This move by a financial powerhouse like BlackRock signals a deeper exploration into the diverse landscape of cryptocurrencies beyond just the market leader. Here’s a quick breakdown of the reported acquisitions: Asset Reported Value Acquired Source Ethereum (ETH) $158 Million Arkham Intelligence Bitcoin (BTC) $125 Million Arkham Intelligence Why Ethereum? Unpacking BlackRock’s Strategic Bitcoin Diversification So, why the sudden, or perhaps gradual, shift towards Ethereum ? While Bitcoin is widely recognized as digital gold, a store of value, Ethereum offers a different set of functionalities and growth vectors. Ethereum is the backbone of the decentralized internet, powering a vast ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various decentralized applications (dApps). Its ongoing network upgrades, particularly the transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism with the Merge and subsequent improvements like the Dencun upgrade, have significantly enhanced its scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Key reasons that might be driving BlackRock’s increased interest in Ethereum include: Staking Yields: With Ethereum’s move to PoS, institutions can earn yield by staking their ETH, offering a potential revenue stream that isn’t available with Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work model. This could be a compelling factor for large asset managers looking for passive income opportunities. Ecosystem Growth: The sheer breadth and depth of the Ethereum ecosystem, from DeFi protocols with billions in total value locked to the booming NFT market, present diverse investment opportunities and potential for future innovation. Future-Proofing: As the digital economy evolves, smart contract platforms like Ethereum are seen as foundational infrastructure. Investing in ETH could be viewed as an investment in the future of decentralized technology and the programmable web. Diversification Strategy: For a firm as large as BlackRock, diversification is key. While Bitcoin remains a core holding, adding substantial Ethereum allows them to gain exposure to different facets of the crypto market, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk while capturing additional growth. This strategic move suggests that BlackRock is not just looking at crypto as a singular asset class but is discerning between the different value propositions offered by leading digital currencies. It’s a testament to Ethereum’s maturation and its growing appeal as a fundamental building block of the Web3 economy. The Impact of BlackRock’s Crypto Investment Strategy on the Market When an entity like BlackRock makes such a pronounced move, the entire market takes notice. This increased crypto investment in Ethereum by a leading institutional player has several significant implications: Boosted Ethereum Sentiment: The news can act as a strong bullish signal for Ethereum, potentially attracting more retail and institutional investors who might view BlackRock’s actions as a stamp of approval. Legitimization of Altcoins: While Ethereum is a blue-chip crypto, this move helps to further legitimize the broader altcoin market, suggesting that institutional capital is willing to venture beyond just Bitcoin. It could pave the way for increased interest in other smart contract platforms or specific sector-focused tokens. Paving the Way for ETH ETFs: BlackRock has already filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Their increasing accumulation of Ethereum could be a precursor to a potential spot Ethereum ETF, which would unlock even greater institutional access to the asset. Shifting Narratives: For years, the dominant narrative has been ‘Bitcoin as digital gold.’ This shift introduces a stronger narrative for ‘Ethereum as digital oil’ or ‘programmable money,’ highlighting its utility and economic activity. The ripple effect of such a significant institutional player diversifying its digital asset holdings cannot be overstated. It reinforces the idea that cryptocurrencies are becoming an increasingly integral part of global investment portfolios, moving beyond speculative assets to recognized components of a diversified strategy. Understanding Institutional Adoption in the Digital Asset Space The journey of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency space has been a fascinating one, marked by cautious optimism, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately, growing acceptance. From initial skepticism, major financial institutions have gradually recognized the immense potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. This has manifested in various forms, including: Custody Solutions: Development of secure custody services for digital assets, addressing a primary concern for large investors. Investment Products: Launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, trusts, and most recently, spot Bitcoin ETFs, providing regulated avenues for exposure. Direct Investments: Firms like BlackRock making direct purchases of cryptocurrencies, either for their own balance sheets or for client funds. Blockchain Integration: Exploration and implementation of blockchain technology in traditional finance for settlement, tokenization of assets, and other applications. While challenges remain, particularly around regulatory clarity and market volatility, the trend towards greater institutional involvement is undeniable. This influx of sophisticated capital brings with it increased liquidity, stability, and ultimately, greater mainstream acceptance for the crypto market. BlackRock’s latest move is not an isolated incident but rather a significant milestone in this ongoing evolution. Navigating the Future: What BlackRock’s Move Means for Your Portfolio For individual investors, BlackRock’s increased crypto investment in Ethereum offers valuable insights but also warrants careful consideration. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement when a major player makes a bold move, but it’s crucial to remember that institutional strategies are often long-term and executed with vast resources and sophisticated risk management. Here are some actionable insights and considerations: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While institutional validation is powerful, it should not be the sole basis for your investment decisions. Understand the fundamentals of Ethereum, its technology, ecosystem, and potential risks. Diversification is Key: Just as BlackRock is diversifying, consider how Ethereum fits into your own diversified crypto portfolio. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, even if that basket is ETH. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Institutional moves often signal long-term conviction. For retail investors, this means looking beyond short-term price fluctuations and understanding the potential for long-term growth driven by fundamental utility and adoption. Market Dynamics: Be aware that large institutional purchases can impact market supply and demand, potentially leading to price movements. However, these movements can be volatile. Regulatory Landscape: Keep an eye on regulatory developments, especially regarding potential Ethereum ETFs, as these could significantly alter market access and liquidity. BlackRock’s strategic shift isn’t just news; it’s a powerful signal that the digital asset landscape is maturing, and leading institutions are increasingly recognizing the multifaceted value proposition of cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin. A Pivotal Moment for Ethereum and the Crypto Market The revelation that BlackRock is accumulating more Ethereum than Bitcoin marks a truly pivotal moment in the ongoing story of institutional adoption of digital assets. It underscores a growing understanding and appreciation for Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its utility as a foundational layer for decentralized applications, and its potential for future growth. This strategic crypto investment by one of the world’s most influential financial entities not only validates Ethereum’s position but also signals a broader trend of diversification and sophistication in institutional digital asset portfolios. As the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world continue to blur, such moves by industry giants will undoubtedly shape the future trajectory of the entire digital asset market, ushering in a new era of mainstream acceptance and innovation.

In a new interview on the White Crypto YouTube channel, the hedge fund veteran says Bitcoin could go up by up to 65% from the current level before the end of the year. “Well, every time I make a price prediction, I get it wrong. But I did say last year that I thought we could close in on $100,000. We didn’t quite get there until after the [President Trump] inauguration. But I do think this is $150,000 to $180,000 by year-end.” According to Scaramucci, demand for Bitcoin from institutional investors is primed to keep going up. “Bitcoin supremacy, if you will, is creeping up and I think that’s going to continue because it’s the go-to asset for institutional investors. That’s not to say that the other coins won’t do well. But I think institutional dollars that are coming into the space, something like 80% of those dollars will end up in Bitcoin.” Scaramucci, however, says Bitcoin is currently facing various headwinds amid the heavy demand. “There are a lot of things holding Bitcoin back. We’re fighting in the Gulf, we’re fighting in Ukraine and we’re fighting in the former Soviet Union, Russia. There’s global tension. There’s a fear of recession. We’re still getting over the aftermath, economically, of COVID. And so there are a lot of things holding Bitcoin back. But despite that, there’s very heavy net buying of Bitcoin, particularly through the [exchange-traded funds] ETFs.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,273 at time of writing.

2025-07-10T23:41:19,"Ethereum: Beginning Of A Large Long-Term Breakout Rally (Technical Analysis)","Summary Ethereum is breaking out above $2,600 with a high-conviction technical setup, signaling the start of a potential multi-year bull phase with projected upside targets of $5K, $10K–$12K, and even $54K. A favorable political shift is fueling the rally: President Trump has designated crypto a strategic asset, dismantled anti-crypto regulatory forces, and appointed a White House advisor for crypto policy. Institutional adoption is accelerating as BlackRock and Fidelity pour hundreds of millions into ETH spot ETFs weekly. Ethereum is also becoming the backbone of tokenized financial instruments. Fundamentals and technicals are aligned: Ethereum is not just seeing capital inflows—it’s taking out its 200-day and 200-week EMAs, monthly RSI is launching off historic rally zones, and the ETH/BTC ratio is turning decisively in ETH’s favor. Ethereum is the financial operating system for the emerging Intelligence Economy, with real-world use cases, tokenized assets, and structural demand driving a transition from speculative trade to institutional-grade investment. As Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) challenges the key $2600 resistance level, the technical setup is for a powerful long-term breakout rally. This is accompanied by a very strong set of fundamental circumstances that support the technicals. My short-term target is approximately $5000, intermediate-term $10-12,000, and longer-term $54,000. FUNDAMENTALS First, let’s contextualize the setup. Ethereum is the basis for much of the emerging Web3 economy. ERC‑20 tokens, Layer‑2 rollups, decentralized finance [""DeFi""], Non-fungible tokens [""NFTs""], Decentralized Autonomous Organizations [""DAOs""] are all based on the ETH smart contract ecosystem. While there is competition, Ethereum still dominates the space in terms of developer activity and total value locked-in. A dramatic shift from a hostile to a favorable political and regulatory environment is the wide spectrum backdrop. President Trump’s executive orders gave crypto the status of a strategic asset and put an end to the DOJ’s anti-crypto task force. Crypto acceptance is becoming normalized now with the White House appointing David Sacks as Special Advisor for AI & Crypto. Congress is advancing bipartisan frameworks like the CLARITY Act, FIT21, and the stablecoin GENIUS Act, with passage expected by the end of 2025. This will create regulatory clarity for digital assets, staking, stablecoins, and smart contracts. In this supportive political context, Ethereum is seeing explosive institutional adoption. Spot ETFs led by BlackRock ( ETHA ) and Fidelity ( FETH ) have drawn hundreds of millions in weekly inflows . Asset managers are embedding Ethereum-based tokenization into the real-world financial infrastructure by launching on-chain money markets and Treasury instruments. This institutional backing is creating a structural bid under ETH. As a result, Ethereum is riding a wave of institutional capital inflows. Spot ETFs attracted more than $148 million in net inflows on July 3, including BlackRock’s ETHA ($85 million) and Fidelity’s FETH ($64.7 million). Inflows continued on July 7–8, with daily ETF purchases exceeding $120 million. This influx represents regulated exposure and persistent structural demand from institutions involving trusted names (BlackRock, Fidelity). Fidelity and BlackRock are also pioneering tokenized money markets and Treasury funds on Ethereum. Fidelity’s “OnChain” share class launched on May 30. Real-World Asset [""RWA""] tokenization volume is about $24 billion, 60% of which sits on the Ethereum blockchain. These moves reflect a shift in the view of Ethereum from a speculative crypto play to core financial infrastructure. It's starting to be seen as a platform underpinning institutional asset issuance, transparency, and settlement. The convergence of regulatory legitimacy, institutional participation, and real economic and financial utility creates a fundamental bullish case for ETH, which is confirmed by the technical picture. TECHNICALS Let's start with the short-term view. Since May, ETH has been consolidating above and below the $2600 level in a sideways pattern: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView It looks set to take out that level now following a drop to $2100 in June. A close above $26-2700 should get a fast new rally high around 3k. Daily chart: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView A break of $2.6k should also take out that trendline and leave behind the 200-day EMA, which has anchored the consolidation of the last two months. The red upper rail of the formation should be seen quickly, with $4k a natural area for profit taking and a consolidation. ETH Weekly: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView The ETH price is not only taking out its 200-day EMA after consolidating around it; it is also doing the same for its weekly 200-day EMA. That's a powerful technical configuration. Weekly RSI has a long way to go before it gets upside extended, and we can see that a wave 3 position can be called here. That means that the upper resistance zone of $4–5k would be the wave 3 target. After a bit of volatility there, we can expect wave 5. If the current trendline were to hold, then we could be looking at 10k by March 2026. That's just eyeballing at this point. We would have to see how the trend develops and the corresponding state of RSI. Still, a 500% rally from the April low is well within the performance profile for this asset. Monthly ETH: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView The long-term structural setup is for Major Wave 5. After the Major Wave 1-2 sequence, Wave 3 yielded an over 3000% return. A similar rally for Wave 5 would price ETH at $54k. If the duration of the rally is similar, it would reach that mark by December 2026. Note that in addition to currently taking out the 200-day and 200-week EMAs, price is also rising above the key 10-month SMA. The last major wave rallies started when the monthly RSI was at the same level it saw at the April low (when I turned bullish on Ethereum). Basically, April 2025=March 2020. Or something similar. With much more supportive fundamental conditions. The Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio also confirms the long-term buy setup: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView When Bitcoin dominance peaked in December of 2019, the next big ETH rally was not far away. The setup is similar this time as well. Let's look at crypto relative performance. Since the April low, only TAO has beaten out ETH. ETH is outperforming BTC by almost 2 to 1 factor: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView 3 Months: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView 1 month: BullBear.Substack.com, TradingView It's clear that Ethereum is attracting capital and separating from the pack. That doesn't mean that other plays won't also do well in this cycle, but we have passed the point of pure speculative bets and entered the phase of real investment and structural build-out. While I wouldn't put all your eggs in this single basket, it's not a bad idea to take some BTC and reallocate to ETH at this time. Or maybe sell some Apple stock and put it into a forward investment. Ethereum is one significant component of the emerging Intelligence Economy that investors should be taking very seriously right now. The new economic engine will distribute value in dedicated tokens, many of which will be based on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Russian media outlet RBC reported that the government has revamped a draft law on mining that passed a first reading in the State Duma back in 2022. Government officials are now working with lawmakers on a bid to refine the bill ahead of a second reading. Inside a Russian data processing center. (Source: @regruvideo/YouTube/Screenshot) Mining Crypto Soon to Be Off-limits in Many Russian Data Centers The bill proposes asking data processing centers to sign up to a registry curated by the Ministry of Digital Development and Communications. This process will involve operators pledging not to mine crypto at their centers. Only operators who make these pledges will be allowed to receive electricity at preferential rates. The bill’s architects say its goal is to prevent miners from being able to claim benefits when paying for electricity. These benefits will only be provided only to data centers that have been formally recognized as “communication facilities.” Russian electricity firms provide subsidized power to residential users, as well as industrial sector and commercial firms. But in recent months, lawmakers have called for power companies to roll out special unsubsidized rates for crypto mining companies. Membership of the registry will be entirely voluntary, the bill’s authors added. However, all firms that join the registry will be barred from even housing crypto mining rigs, even if these are not connected to the internet.

RBC quoted the Intelion Director-General Artem Shchepinov as stating that he anticipated the measure. Shchepinov added that it would help solidify Russia’s technological sovereignty and strengthening regulated its digital infrastructure. Others, however, complained that Moscow has not asked the private sector for input before formulating the bill. A blockchain expert was quoted as saying that the new law could have a detrimental impact on both the industrial crypto mining industry and the conventional data center industry. But a data center operator claimed the move would do little to dent the capabilities of major industrial miners. These centers are “self-sufficient and sustainable,” he said, and “do not require government support.” Engineers work on a new 48 MW Intelion data center in the Russian Republic of Khakassia. (Source: @intelionmining/VK/Screenshot) Dual-use Facilities However, many major industrial miners operate dual-use centers. These facilities can house both mining and more conventional IT resources. Shchepinov appeared to suggest that his company has already begun preparing for the change. He gave the example of Intelion’s facilities in the Samara Oblast. The executive explained that Intelion has already divided this facility into “two clusters that provide crypto mining and AI computing in parallel.” In May, industry figures revealed that Intelion and BitRiver’s combined revenues for the financial year 2024 hit the $200 million mark . Around 90% of Russian industrial miners focus their efforts on Bitcoin (BTC), most experts in the nation agree.

2025-07-10T23:20:02,"Israel Iran Tensions: Urgent Warning from Defense Minister","In an increasingly interconnected world, geopolitical shifts often send ripples across global markets, impacting everything from oil prices to investor sentiment in digital assets. A recent statement from Israel’s defense minister has brought the simmering Israel Iran tensions back into sharp focus, signaling a potential escalation that warrants close attention. This development, reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, underscores the fragile state of peace in the region and its far-reaching implications. Understanding the Core of Israel Iran Tensions The animosity between Israel and Iran is deeply rooted, stemming from the 1979 Iranian Revolution, which transformed Iran from a regional ally of Israel into its staunchest adversary. This long-standing rivalry is characterized by ideological differences, a struggle for regional dominance, and the contentious issue of Iran’s nuclear program. For decades, both nations have engaged in a shadow war, marked by cyberattacks, covert operations, and proxy conflicts across the Middle East. Historical Context: From a period of quiet cooperation before 1979, the relationship deteriorated sharply after the Islamic Revolution, with Iran adopting an anti-Israel stance as a core tenet of its foreign policy. Nuclear Program: Israel views Iran’s nuclear ambitions as an existential threat, insisting it will not permit Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Iran, for its part, maintains its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Proxy Warfare: Iran supports various non-state actors, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, and Houthi rebels in Yemen. These groups often engage in direct conflict or threaten Israel, acting as extensions of Iranian influence. The current heightened rhetoric is not an isolated incident but part of a continuous, complex interplay of actions and reactions that define this critical regional dynamic. Why the Talk of Renewed Military Action Now? Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, recently conveyed a stern warning: if Iran threatens Israel, Israel will once again carry out military action against Iran. This statement, while not unprecedented, comes at a time of significant regional volatility. The precise triggers for this renewed emphasis on military action are multifaceted, often linked to specific incidents or perceived escalations by either side. Recent developments that could fuel such warnings include: Alleged Israeli Strikes: Israel has frequently conducted airstrikes in Syria, targeting Iranian assets and arms shipments to Hezbollah, which it views as a direct threat. These actions often provoke Iranian vows of retaliation. Iranian Activity: Concerns over Iran’s continued enrichment of uranium, its ballistic missile program, and its support for proxy groups that directly threaten Israeli borders contribute to Israel’s heightened alert. Regional Instability: The ongoing conflict in Gaza and the broader tensions in the Red Sea, where Houthi rebels (backed by Iran) have attacked shipping, create a volatile backdrop that makes direct confrontation between Israel and Iran more plausible. The concept of “military action” can encompass a range of responses, from targeted airstrikes against specific sites to broader, more conventional engagements. The decision to publicly state this intention serves as both a deterrent and a signal of preparedness, indicating that Israel is not shying away from its commitment to self-defense. Understanding the Broader Middle East Conflict Landscape The Israel-Iran dynamic is a central pillar of the broader Middle East conflict . It intertwines with numerous other regional flashpoints, creating a complex web of alliances and antagonisms. Understanding this landscape is crucial for grasping the potential ramifications of any direct confrontation. Key regional actors and their roles in the broader conflict include: Actor Role/Alignment Impact on Israel-Iran Tensions United States Israel’s primary ally, maintaining a significant military presence in the region and often mediating or attempting to de-escalate tensions. Provides military aid to Israel, imposes sanctions on Iran, influencing the strategic balance. Saudi Arabia & Gulf States Sunni-majority states, largely wary of Iranian influence, some pursuing normalization with Israel. Their stance on Iran and evolving relations with Israel directly impact regional power dynamics. Lebanon (Hezbollah) Hezbollah, a powerful Shiite political party and militant group, is a key Iranian proxy on Israel’s northern border. A potential second front in any Israel-Iran conflict, capable of launching significant attacks on Israel. Syria Iran maintains a strong military presence and influence in Syria, using it as a conduit for arms and personnel to Hezbollah. A frequent target of Israeli airstrikes aimed at disrupting Iranian logistics and preventing military buildup. Iraq A complex political landscape with Iranian-backed militias holding significant sway. Could become a launchpad for Iranian-backed attacks or a transit point for weapons. Any direct clash between Israel and Iran has the potential to draw in these regional and international players, transforming a localized conflict into a wider regional conflagration with devastating consequences. How Does This Impact Regional Security ? The stability of the Middle East is perpetually at stake, and renewed threats of military action between Israel and Iran pose a severe risk to regional security . The ripple effects of such a conflict would extend far beyond the immediate combat zones, affecting neighboring countries, global trade routes, and humanitarian efforts. Escalation Risk: Even limited military action carries the inherent risk of rapid escalation, potentially drawing in proxy groups and leading to a multi-front conflict. Maritime Security: The Strait of Hormuz, a vital chokepoint for global oil shipments, is particularly vulnerable. Any disruption there could have massive global economic consequences. The Red Sea, already affected by Houthi attacks, could see further destabilization. Energy Markets: The Middle East is a critical source of global oil and gas. Increased tensions or direct conflict could lead to supply disruptions, causing oil and gas prices to surge, impacting economies worldwide. Humanitarian Crisis: A large-scale conflict would undoubtedly exacerbate existing humanitarian crises, leading to mass displacement, increased casualties, and a greater need for international aid. Cyber Warfare: Both nations possess advanced cyber capabilities, and a conflict could easily spill into the digital realm, targeting critical infrastructure and financial systems. The preservation of regional security relies on de-escalation, diplomatic efforts, and the adherence to international norms, all of which are severely tested by such declarations. Navigating the Broader Geopolitical Impact on Global Markets The specter of conflict in the Middle East has a predictable and significant geopolitical impact on global markets. Investors tend to react to uncertainty by moving away from riskier assets towards safe havens, and this sentiment can reverberate across various sectors, including the volatile cryptocurrency market. Traditional Markets: Historically, heightened tensions in the Middle East lead to spikes in oil prices, as supply concerns mount. Gold, often seen as the ultimate safe-haven asset, also tends to rally. Stock markets, conversely, typically experience declines due to increased risk aversion and economic uncertainty. Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics: While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are often touted as uncorrelated assets or ‘digital gold,’ they are not immune to global geopolitical tremors. In times of extreme uncertainty: Risk-Off Sentiment: A general ‘risk-off’ environment in traditional finance can spill over into crypto, leading to sell-offs as investors liquidate assets across the board to cover losses or reduce exposure. Flight to Quality (or perceived quality): Some argue that Bitcoin could act as a safe haven, particularly in regions experiencing currency devaluation or capital controls. However, its volatility means it is not yet universally accepted as such. In major geopolitical crises, the initial reaction often involves a broad market sell-off before any ‘digital gold’ narrative might take hold. Regulatory Scrutiny: Geopolitical instability can also prompt governments to increase scrutiny on financial flows, potentially affecting crypto exchanges and transactions. Supply Chains and Inflation: Beyond direct market movements, a prolonged conflict could disrupt global supply chains, leading to higher inflation as the cost of goods and transportation rises. This, in turn, could influence central bank policies and broader economic stability. For crypto investors, monitoring geopolitical developments like the Israel-Iran tensions is crucial. While direct causality is complex, understanding the broader market sentiment and potential for systemic shocks can inform investment strategies and risk management. Conclusion: A Region on Edge The recent warning from Israel’s defense minister, Israel Katz, underscores the enduring and dangerous nature of Israel Iran tensions . The declaration of potential renewed military action is a stark reminder of the volatile dynamics at play in the Middle East conflict , which constantly threatens regional security . The potential for escalation is high, with serious implications for global stability, energy markets, and the broader economic landscape, including the sensitive cryptocurrency sector. As the world watches, diplomatic efforts remain paramount to de-escalate tensions and prevent a wider conflagration that would have devastating geopolitical impact on countless lives and livelihoods.

2025-07-10T23:17:58,"Data highlights Bitcoin holders have negligible impact on Bitcoin market price","A new research by crypto investment firm, Keyrock, has shown that Bitcoin treasury companies account for just 0.59% of daily BTC price movements. The Brussels-based firm released the market report on July 10. The report shows that the Bitcoin Treasuries company has minimal influence on price action despite holding a combined 847,000 BTC, approximately 4% of the total Bitcoin supply. Keyrock report relied on data from both public and private companies that disclose Bitcoin holdings in financial reports or regulatory filings. Per the report, the largest corporate holder, Strategy, alone controls over 1% of the total BTC supply. Interestingly, in the second quarter of 2024, corporate holdings grew by over 159,000 BTC, marking the highest quarterly increase so far. However, the report shows this had little to no effect on Bitcoin’s short-term market movements and no strong correlation between treasury buying and BTC price trends. It noted that most companies behave as long-term holders and do not move coins frequently. Bitcoin Treasury Firms Impact on Price (Source: Keyrock) Thus, Bitcoin, which is held in corporate treasuries, does not influence trading behavior or market momentum. Price action remains dominated by spot markets, exchange-traded products, derivatives, and retail activity. Treasury growth, while symbolic, has not translated into volatility or upward price pressure. Bitcoin-heavy stocks trade at significant premiums Meanwhile, the new report shows that public companies holding large Bitcoin reserves often trade at a premium to their actual BTC value. MicroStrategy currently leads with a 91.3% premium over the market value of its holdings.. That means investors pay $191 for every $100 of Bitcoin exposure through its stock. Other treasury firms also show similar premiums, ranging from 20% to 60%, depending on market cycles and investor demand. These premiums reflect how equities with Bitcoin exposure are priced above the value of the coins they hold. Bitcoin Treasury Firms Premium (source: Keyrock) The report tracked multiple companies with disclosed BTC holdings and found consistent overvaluation in share price compared to underlying assets. This trend was present even when Bitcoin was flat or declining. The firm noted that these premiums move independently of Bitcoin’s price. They often respond faster to market sentiment, news, or speculation. Premiums narrowed sharply during drawdowns but widened again during price surges. This gap between share price and BTC value highlights a cost difference for investors using public equities to gain Bitcoin exposure. While treasury holdings appear passive, the pricing of their stocks is not. As of July 2025, MicroStrategy remains the most overvalued relative to its Bitcoin. The report did not name all the companies reviewed, but confirmed that this pattern is widespread. Most Treasury Bitcoin cannot be used as Collateral Interestingly, the report also highlighted why Bitcoin held by treasury companies might not have much impact on the price action, noting that it is because most of the BTC remains inactive. The report confirms that most holdings are stored offline and not used as collateral or in financial products. Companies holding BTC rarely use their reserves for lending, yield generation strategies, or derivatives. Their internal rules and custody structures limit their operational use of the assets, which means that while treasury firms hold large volumes, they are not used for leverage or liquidity. Keyrock notes that only a small percentage of treasury assets are moved or deployed after acquisition. Most remain static, even during market volatility. This approach keeps holdings secure but also limits strategic flexibility. Treasury companies do not benefit from yield or lending returns, even as other platforms generate revenue from active BTC use. However, the report noted that unless these firms adapt, they may lose ground to institutions with more dynamic strategies, as treasury growth without use cases is not the best way to maximize resources.

2025-07-10T23:10:05,"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s Urgent Warning: 50% Chance of Higher US Interest Rates","In a financial landscape often characterized by shifting sands and unpredictable currents, a recent statement from one of the most influential figures in global finance has sent ripples across markets. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon , a voice that commands significant attention, has weighed in on the future trajectory of U.S. interest rates, suggesting a notable 40% to 50% probability of them climbing higher. This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a crucial forecast from the head of America’s largest bank, prompting investors and everyday citizens alike to ponder the potential implications for their finances, from traditional portfolios to the dynamic cryptocurrency market. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s Crucial Forecast: What It Means for You Jamie Dimon’s insights are rarely delivered without careful consideration, and his latest commentary on U.S. interest rates is no exception. According to a report by Walter Bloomberg on X, Dimon stated he would price in a 40% to 50% chance of U.S. interest rates rising further. This isn’t a definitive prediction, but rather an assessment of risk and probability, which is a hallmark of how seasoned financial leaders approach complex economic scenarios. When the JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon speaks, the market listens because his perspective is often grounded in extensive data, deep economic analysis, and a firsthand view of the global financial system’s health. So, what does a 40-50% chance truly signify? It means that while a rate hike isn’t a certainty, it’s far from a remote possibility. For context, many economists might assign lower probabilities to such an event, especially after a period of aggressive rate hikes. Dimon’s assessment suggests that underlying inflationary pressures or unexpected economic resilience could force the Federal Reserve’s hand once again. For individuals, this directly translates into potential changes in: Borrowing Costs: Mortgages, car loans, and credit card interest rates could all see increases, making borrowing more expensive. Savings Returns: On the flip side, savings accounts and money market funds might offer slightly better returns, though often not enough to fully offset inflation. Investment Strategies: Higher rates impact the valuation of assets, influencing decisions in stocks, bonds, and alternative investments like real estate and cryptocurrencies. Understanding this probability is the first step in preparing for potential shifts in the economic landscape. Understanding the US Interest Rates Forecast: Why Now? The Federal Reserve has been on a historic journey of interest rate hikes over the past couple of years, aiming to tame persistent inflation. After a series of aggressive increases, the Fed has paused, leading many to believe the hiking cycle was over. However, the latest US interest rates forecast from Dimon indicates that the battle against inflation might not be entirely won, or that other economic factors are at play. Several key elements could contribute to the potential for higher rates: Sticky Inflation: While the headline inflation numbers have come down, core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) has proven more stubborn. Services inflation, in particular, remains elevated. Resilient Economy: The U.S. economy has shown remarkable resilience, with strong job growth and consumer spending defying predictions of a slowdown. A robust economy can fuel demand, potentially leading to further price increases. Geopolitical Factors: Global events, supply chain disruptions, or energy price spikes could re-ignite inflationary pressures, compelling central banks to act. The Federal Reserve’s mandate is to achieve maximum employment and price stability. If inflation remains above their 2% target, and the economy continues to show strength, the Fed might view further rate hikes as a necessary tool to cool demand and bring prices back into line. This delicate balancing act forms the core of the current economic debate, and the US interest rates forecast from influential figures like Dimon adds significant weight to the ‘higher for longer’ narrative. The Broader Economic Outlook: Navigating Uncertainty Jamie Dimon’s warning serves as a potent reminder that the economic outlook remains fraught with uncertainty. While many hope for a “soft landing” – where inflation cools without triggering a recession – the path is narrow and precarious. A 40-50% chance of higher rates suggests that the risks of a less benign outcome are substantial. Consider the potential scenarios shaping the broader economic outlook : Soft Landing: Inflation gradually returns to target, and economic growth slows but avoids a recession. This is the ideal, but difficult to achieve. Hard Landing (Recession): Higher rates cool the economy too aggressively, leading to a significant downturn, job losses, and corporate distress. No Landing (Persistent Inflation): The economy remains strong, but inflation also persists, forcing the Fed to maintain higher rates for an extended period, or even hike further. Each scenario has distinct implications for businesses, employment, and personal wealth. For instance, in a hard landing, unemployment rises, and corporate earnings decline, impacting stock markets. In a “no landing” scenario, the cost of living remains high, eroding purchasing power. Dimon’s statement pushes the needle towards scenarios where the Fed’s job is far from over, highlighting the need for vigilance in understanding the evolving economic landscape. Anticipating Market Impact: From Stocks to Crypto The prospect of higher interest rates has a cascading market impact across virtually all asset classes. For traditional markets, the immediate reaction often involves a re-evaluation of asset valuations, as future earnings and cash flows are discounted at a higher rate. This typically puts downward pressure on growth stocks, which rely more on future earnings, and can make bonds more attractive due to higher yields. But what about the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies? The market impact on digital assets is complex: Risk-Off Sentiment: Higher interest rates generally foster a “risk-off” environment. When safer assets (like government bonds) offer better returns, investors may pull capital from riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. Liquidity Squeeze: Tighter monetary policy reduces overall liquidity in the financial system. Less available capital can lead to reduced trading volumes and potentially lower prices for speculative assets. DeFi Implications: In decentralized finance (DeFi), higher traditional interest rates can make DeFi lending less comparatively attractive, potentially impacting demand for certain protocols and stablecoins. Correlation with Tech Stocks: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have shown some correlation with tech stocks in recent cycles. If higher rates hurt tech, crypto could follow suit. However, it’s also worth noting that crypto markets have unique drivers, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, and adoption rates. While a general risk-off environment can weigh on prices, strong fundamental growth in the crypto space could provide some resilience. Investors should be prepared for increased volatility and consider how their crypto portfolios align with their overall risk tolerance in an environment of potential rate hikes. Addressing Inflation Concerns: Strategies for Investors At the heart of the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions and Jamie Dimon’s warning are persistent inflation concerns . Inflation erodes purchasing power, making everything from groceries to housing more expensive. Central banks raise interest rates primarily to combat inflation by increasing the cost of borrowing, thereby reducing demand and slowing economic activity. If Dimon’s probability assessment holds true, and rates do climb higher due to ongoing inflation concerns , what strategies can investors employ? Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, commodities, real estate, and a portion in digital assets) can help mitigate risks. Quality Assets: Focus on companies with strong balance sheets, consistent earnings, and pricing power that can pass on increased costs to consumers. Short-Duration Bonds: In a rising rate environment, shorter-duration bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes than long-duration bonds. Real Assets & Commodities: Assets like real estate, gold, and certain commodities can sometimes act as inflation hedges, though their performance is not guaranteed. Dollar-Cost Averaging: For long-term investors, consistently investing a fixed amount over time (dollar-cost averaging) can smooth out market volatility, especially in unpredictable periods. Re-evaluating Crypto Holdings: While crypto can be volatile, some argue that Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, could act as a hedge against fiat inflation over the long term. However, this is a debated topic, and careful consideration of risk is paramount. Ultimately, staying informed and adapting your strategy to the evolving economic landscape is key. Jamie Dimon’s perspective isn’t a definitive forecast, but a crucial signal to be prepared for continued volatility and potential policy shifts as the fight against inflation continues. A Crucial Takeaway for the Future Jamie Dimon’s recent statement, assigning a 40-50% probability to higher U.S. interest rates, is more than just a headline; it’s a significant indicator from a top financial leader. It underscores the ongoing challenges faced by central banks in achieving price stability and navigating a resilient yet uncertain global economy. For investors, this means maintaining a proactive stance, understanding the potential market impact on both traditional assets and the dynamic cryptocurrency space, and strategically addressing lingering inflation concerns . While the future remains unwritten, being prepared for various economic scenarios is the smartest move.
