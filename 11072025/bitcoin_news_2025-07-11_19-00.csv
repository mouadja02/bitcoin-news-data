2025-07-11T16:55:18,"U.S. Treasury Department Officially Revokes Controversial Crypto Broker Reporting Rule After Republican Lawmakers Vote It Down","The Department of the Treasury is formally taking down a new rule that expanded the definition of a broker under the U.S. Tax Code. The rule titled “Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers that Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales” classified decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges as brokers required to furnish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with information on user transactions involving digital assets. The rule was published in the Federal Register on December 30th during the final weeks of the Biden administration and took effect on February 28th. In March, legislators from both chambers of Congress voted to repeal the controversial law, a move supported by President Donald Trump, who signed the bill reversing the crypto broker rule on April 11th. The Treasury Department says the controversial rule now has no legal force or effect. “Pursuant to the CRA (Congressional Review Act), any rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or effect by enactment of a joint resolution shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect. Accordingly, the Treasury Department and the IRS are reverting the text of the section 6045 regulations back to the text that was in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the Final Rule.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-11T16:51:25,"Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Prepares to Break Out of Descending Channel Pattern – Is $100 ADA Next?","The Cardano price has rocketed 15% over the past 24 hours, positioning for further gains as Bitcoin reaches $118,000 all-time highs , with the market increasingly focusing on altcoins like ADA that demonstrate strong fundamentals and promising technical indicators. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.7185, marking a 24% increase over the past seven days and solidifying its position as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $25.4 billion. The recent rally was accompanied by over $1.7 billion in ADA trading volume, representing a substantial 50.12% increase in a single trading session. Cardano Technical Analysis: Why Analysts Predict “Made in America” ADA Could Hit $100 With ADA successfully breaking above the upper resistance trendline of a falling wedge pattern, analysts are projecting a reclaim of the $1 psychological level in the short term, alongside a potential new all-time high above $3 in the medium term. Additionally, Cardano’s status as a “Made in America” cryptocurrency, which appeared on President Trump’s strategic reserve list mentioned in March, has led many analysts to project an ambitious $100 target for ADA. LONG: $ADA /USDT (1W) Cardano is experiencing a #bullish trend, surpassing MA200. pic.twitter.com/LWqWLIP0sj — CryptostarExpert (@CryptostarExper) July 11, 2025 This ambitious target could materialize over the next few market cycles if Cardano successfully secures multiple ETF listings and establishes strategic partnerships across education, government, and business enterprise sectors . On the technical front, the ADA/USDT 2-week chart displays a strong bullish bounce from the crucial support region between the 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels, which previously functioned as a demand zone. Source: TradingView Following a consolidation period and rejection wicks below $0.60, the Cardano price has now surged to $0.7176, gaining over 22% in the latest candle formation. This particularly indicates renewed buying interest among investors. The projected trajectory suggests a potential pullback before continuation, targeting a recovery wave toward key resistance levels at $0.9989, $1.2164, and ultimately $1.3795. The Fibonacci structure adds to this bullish outlook, as price action reclaims levels above the golden ratio (0.618), increasing the probability of continuation if momentum remains sustained. Should bulls successfully defend the $0.65–$0.70 region during any minor retracement, ADA could enter a medium-term uptrend targeting the $1.00 psychological zone and higher levels. And with broader adoption expected to accelerate in the coming years, a long-term move toward $100 ADA is no longer out of the question. While ADA Pumps, Smart Money Find 349% APY in Bitcoin Hyper Presale With the crypto market swinging wildly, many investors are now looking for undervalued altcoins with serious upside potential. One new project catching attention is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) – the main token powering the first-ever Layer 2 chain built for Bitcoin. Put simply, HYPER is designed to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper by using Solana-style technology behind the scenes. Right now, HYPER is still in its presale phase, meaning early buyers can grab tokens at a discount before they officially launch on public exchanges.

2025-07-11T16:50:39,"Crypto Funding Surge: Industry Set to Exceed $18 Billion in 2024","The world of digital assets is buzzing with incredible news! We’re witnessing a monumental wave of crypto funding , with the industry rapidly approaching a staggering $18 billion in total investments this year. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a powerful signal of growing confidence and maturity within the blockchain ecosystem. If you’ve been following the market, you know that sustained investment is a key indicator of health and future potential, and these numbers are shouting optimism from the rooftops. What’s Driving This Unprecedented Crypto Funding Boom? Recent reports highlight an astounding pace of investment. Just last week, seven crypto projects collectively secured over $141 million. This impressive figure has pushed the total funding for crypto startups this year to nearly $11 billion, according to DL News, citing data from DefiLlama. What’s truly remarkable is that this sum already surpasses the total funding recorded for all of 2023 by more than $1 billion! This isn’t just about breaking records; it’s about setting new benchmarks for growth. The current trajectory suggests that the industry is well on its way to exceeding PitchBook’s annual funding forecast of $18 billion. This surge isn’t accidental; it’s a culmination of several factors converging to create a fertile ground for investment. Here’s a closer look at what’s fueling this remarkable influx of capital: Market Recovery and Maturation: Following a period of consolidation, the crypto market has shown significant signs of recovery. Key events like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin halving have injected renewed optimism and legitimacy, drawing in both retail and institutional investors. Clearer Use Cases: Projects are no longer just speculative; they’re solving real-world problems. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming (GameFi), and from supply chain management to digital identity, the practical applications of blockchain technology are becoming increasingly evident. Institutional Confidence: More traditional financial institutions are entering the space, either directly through investments or by offering crypto-related services. This institutional validation brings substantial capital and expertise. Innovation Across Sectors: New sectors within crypto, such as Real World Assets (RWA), DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), and the convergence of AI with blockchain, are attracting significant attention and capital. The Evolution of Blockchain Investment: Where is the Capital Flowing? The nature of blockchain investment is evolving. It’s no longer just about backing the next big token; it’s about funding foundational infrastructure, innovative applications, and projects that demonstrate long-term viability. A particularly interesting trend noted by DL News is that two of the five largest fundraisers last week are actively adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This move signals a strategic shift, where companies are not just raising capital in fiat or stablecoins, but are also accumulating Bitcoin as a treasury asset, reflecting deep conviction in its future value and role as digital gold. This trend highlights a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a robust and appreciating asset, rather than just a volatile speculative instrument. It also suggests that companies are looking beyond immediate operational needs, adopting a long-term strategy that incorporates digital assets directly into their financial reserves. Key Areas Attracting Significant Blockchain Investment: Investment Area Description & Why It’s Hot DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Still a powerhouse, focusing on scalable, secure, and user-friendly protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Attracts capital for its potential to revolutionize traditional finance. Gaming & Metaverse (GameFi) Merging gaming with blockchain to create play-to-earn models and true digital ownership. Investments are pouring into high-quality game development and metaverse infrastructure. Infrastructure & Layer 2 Solutions Projects building the foundational layers, scaling solutions (e.g., rollups), and interoperability protocols that enable the entire ecosystem to function more efficiently and at a larger scale. Essential for widespread adoption. Real World Assets (RWA) Tokenization Bridging traditional assets (like real estate, bonds, commodities) to the blockchain. This unlocks liquidity and efficiency, attracting significant interest from institutional investors. AI + Blockchain Synergy Projects exploring how AI can enhance blockchain (e.g., for security, data analysis) or how blockchain can decentralize AI (e.g., decentralized AI training, data marketplaces). A rapidly emerging and exciting field. Are Web3 Startups Leading the Charge? Absolutely. The term Web3 startups encompasses a vast array of innovative companies pushing the boundaries of decentralized technology. These are the pioneers building the next generation of the internet, characterized by decentralization, user ownership, and token-based economies. The significant capital flowing into these ventures indicates a strong belief in the long-term vision of Web3. From decentralized social media platforms to new forms of digital identity, and from robust data privacy solutions to creator economy tools, Web3 startups are attracting investment because they promise to fundamentally shift power dynamics from centralized entities to individual users. This aligns with a broader societal push for more equitable and transparent digital interactions. Key Characteristics of Funded Web3 Startups: Solving Real Problems: Moving beyond hype, these startups address issues like data privacy, censorship, and lack of ownership. Strong Teams: Investors prioritize teams with proven track records, technical expertise, and a clear vision. Scalability and User Experience: Focus on building products that can handle large user bases and offer intuitive interfaces, crucial for mainstream adoption. Sustainable Tokenomics: Designing token models that align incentives and ensure long-term viability for the project and its community. How Does This Impact Overall Digital Asset Growth? The influx of capital directly correlates with broader digital asset growth . When startups receive significant funding, it fuels innovation, development, and expansion. This leads to: Increased Innovation: More resources mean faster development of new technologies, protocols, and applications. Talent Attraction: Well-funded projects can attract top talent, further accelerating growth and quality within the ecosystem. Infrastructure Development: Capital is deployed to build more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure, benefiting the entire digital asset landscape. Market Liquidity and Adoption: As more projects launch and gain traction, they contribute to overall market liquidity and drive greater mainstream adoption of digital assets. Enhanced Trust and Legitimacy: Significant venture capital backing signals to the wider market that these projects are serious, well-vetted, and have long-term potential, fostering greater trust. Essentially, this funding surge acts as a powerful accelerator, propelling the entire digital asset ecosystem forward and paving the way for new use cases and greater utility for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. What Role is Venture Capital Crypto Playing in This Evolution? Venture capital crypto firms are the primary drivers behind this funding boom. These specialized VCs understand the unique nuances of the crypto market, possess deep industry connections, and are willing to take calculated risks on nascent technologies. Their strategic investments are not just about providing capital; they often come with mentorship, networking opportunities, and strategic guidance that are invaluable for young startups. The shift in venture capital focus from purely speculative bets to more utility-driven and revenue-generating projects is a clear sign of the industry’s maturation. VCs are now looking for sustainable business models, strong governance, and clear pathways to adoption, rather than just hype. This discerning approach ensures that the capital is directed towards projects with the highest potential for long-term success and impact. Challenges and Considerations Amidst the Boom: While the funding surge is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in various jurisdictions can still pose challenges for global crypto projects. Market Volatility: Despite signs of recovery, the crypto market remains inherently volatile, which can impact investor sentiment. Talent Wars: The demand for skilled blockchain developers and professionals is high, leading to intense competition for talent. Project Dilution: A rapid influx of new projects could lead to dilution of attention and resources, making it harder for truly innovative projects to stand out. However, the sheer volume of investment suggests that the benefits and opportunities far outweigh these risks in the eyes of sophisticated investors. The Future is Bright: What Does This Mean for You? This unprecedented surge in crypto funding paints a remarkably positive picture for the future of the digital asset space. It signifies that smart money is flowing into foundational technologies and innovative applications, paving the way for a more decentralized, efficient, and user-centric digital world. For entrepreneurs, this means more opportunities for groundbreaking projects to secure the capital needed to thrive. For developers, it means a robust job market and exciting challenges. For users, it promises more refined, secure, and impactful blockchain-powered products and services. The industry’s trajectory towards surpassing $18 billion in funding this year is not just a financial milestone; it’s a testament to the enduring power and transformative potential of blockchain technology. It underscores a collective belief that digital assets and decentralized systems are not just a fleeting trend, but a fundamental shift in how we interact with technology, finance, and each other.

Ethereum Foundation’s ETH Sale Sparks Debate, But Focus Stays on Ecosystem Growth The Ethereum Foundation confirmed its latest ETH sale, noting that proceeds from the transaction would be used to support its core operations. These include ongoing protocol research, community grants, and the development of infrastructure critical to the Ethereum ecosystem. The Foundation, which has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, plays a central role in guiding and supporting Ethereum’s development. Its sales of ETH are relatively infrequent and typically aimed at raising funds for continued network improvements. 0/ Earlier this week, the EF finalized the terms of a 10,000 ETH sale at an average price of $2,572.37 via OTC. For this sale, our OTC counterparty was @SharpLinkGaming . — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) July 11, 2025 Sharplink’s direct purchase of ETH from the Foundation—rather than through traditional exchanges or OTC desks—represents a rare and strategic move. The transaction indicates the company’s alignment with Ethereum’s long-term goals and its support for the network through staking and restaking commitments. Joseph Lubin, Chairman of Sharplink and also a co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, described the decision as more than a financial transaction. “At a time when Ethereum is entering a new era of institutional relevance, we are proud to support the network’s long-term strength and decentralization mission,” Lubin said. “Sharplink is acquiring, staking, and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards.” According to Lubin, this marks the beginning of a broader model where mission-aligned organizations directly invest in and support the networks they depend on. The move is intended to reduce circulating supply and help reinforce Ethereum’s security and stability. Earlier today, blockchain data revealed that a suspected Ethereum Foundation address, 0xd779, sold 100 ETH via CoW Protocol. The ETH was first moved from a Gnosis Safe and swapped for 336,475 DAI, which was then transferred to a known Foundation address, 0x9eE4.

Despite the criticisms, on-chain data shows the Foundation still holds approximately 269,000 ETH, valued at just over $900 million. The Foundation has maintained transparency around its treasury management. While some interpret these sales as market-negative, the stated purpose remains ecosystem-focused, aimed at sustaining long-term development and community funding. Ethereum Rally Gains Momentum as Institutional Flows and Supply Shock Fuel $10K Price Target Ethereum’s broader market narrative is quickly aligning with a potential surge in ETH price, with analysts and investors pointing toward $10,000 as a realistic target.

The move comes as Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally past $118,000 lifts sentiment across the crypto market.

2025-07-11T16:35:04,"Why Bitcoin is On Fire And Everyone’s Going HYPER About Bitcoin Hyper Token","The Bitcoin price is on fire ($118,000) and Bitcoin Hyper’s (HYPER) Layer 2 solution token is just what the market’s been waiting for to take the Bitcoin ecosystem to the next level. Some say the Bitcoin price breakout has been building for a while, while others think the return of tariff angst is shining a favorable macro light on the top crypto. Others point to the flood of new money coming into crypto from retail, in addition to the demand shock pressure of institutions loading up, as the creation of Bitcoin treasury public companies threatens to hoover up what remains of the limited supply. Whatever the exact cause of the price melt-up, the results are crystallizing a formidable market setup for Bitcoin Hyper token . Bitcoin Hyper has raised nearly $2.4 million and is available to purchase and stake today at the low price of $0.012225. Staking rewards are a super generous 348%. The staking yield is changes dynamically depending on how much deposits there are in the smart contract staking pool, so it pays to move fast. Bitcoin Hyper utilizes a non-custodial bridge, where users deposit Bitcoin on one side. After verifying using zero-knowledge proof cryptography, a wrapped version of BTC is unlocked on the Layer 2 side of the bridge through a minting process. Bitcoin Hyper is an elegant and practical solution to the problem of lack of scalability and the governance quagmire that has prevented Bitcoin from developing its full programmability potential. Bitcoin to $150,000 before the summer ends – HYPER token into hyperspace In the past 24 hours there has been a five-fold increase in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows ($1.175.6 billion) to the second-highest level ever, and open interest in bitcoin options are seeing bets converge on a price target of $150,000 by the end of August. Source: Deribit And that’s before we start on those gestating technicals that have been foretelling a breakout for Bitcoin that is having the effect of propelling the entire market higher, even as stocks start to falter. Glassnode’s accumulation trend score metric signalled that Bitcoin has been in an accumulation regime since the end of April, but has failed to replicate the steep trajectory of the previous two such phases (see chart below). According to Glassnode analysts, the tight trading range of the past couple of months suggested a “moderately strong accumulation regime”, in which market participants saw the price (prior to yesterday’s explosion) as “offering relatively compelling value”.

Long-term holder (LTH) accumulation is outpacing new coin issuance to miners, creating a favorable backdrop for upward price pressure.

Source: Glassnode HYPER token takes Bitcoin to the next level Not surprisingly, Bitcoin Hyper token holders are salivating at the prospect of Bitcoin hitting new highs. The higher Bitcoin’s price goes, the more interest it generates in society at large and the greater the adoption potential. That matters for Bitcoin Hyper because, unlike many other new token launches, it is laser-focused on coding and building to improve Bitcoin and bring it closer to its original idea of becoming the go-to form of digital cash. Bitcoin Hyper will revolutionize transaction speeds and drive down costs in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its deployment of a new Layer 2 chain built on the Solana Virtual Machine. As well as truly turning Bitcoin into usable digital cash, it opens up the economy of the most valuable token in crypto to the value-multiplying world of Web3, from decentralized finance to tokenization. In short, Bitcoin Hyper is putting in place a powerful and reliable programmable layer for Bitcoin, that doesn’t just reduce transaction fees to near zero and tx times sub-second, it widens the scope of what is possible for Bitcoin. In the hands of Bitcoin Hyper, Bitcoin becomes not only a store of value and means of payment but also the backbone of commercial ventures that can transform whole industries, from financial instruments to marketplaces. $HYPER – returns built on solid Bitcoin foundations To participate in the presale, connect your wallet at the Bitcoin Hyper website and purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, USDC, SOL, or a credit card. Or you can buy using Best Wallet , where the HYPER token is listed in the ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section of the app. Buying with Best Wallet makes managing and claiming your tokens easy. Bitcoin Hyper is the coin to watch this altcoin season. As crypto prices rocket, HYPER’s returns will have the added advantage of being based on the solid foundations of the Bitcoin ecosystem. A modest allocation to HYPER is likely to pay off handsomely. Stay connected with the Bitcoin Hyper community on Telegram and X . Visit the Bitcoin Hyper Token.

These are very bullish percentages, and they come as XRP wallets top 7 million , with XRP Ledger having added 840,000 new addresses in the past six months alone. It’s currently adding somewhere in the region of 7,000 new wallets daily , and given its fundamentals and the direction of the wider market, the medium- and long-term XRP price prediction looks very promising. XRP Price Prediction: 7,000 New Wallets Added Daily as Adoption Explodes – Could XRP Hit $100 Sooner Than Expected? XRP is therefore witnessing a surge in demand and adoption, and if crypto has entered another bull market, then its on-chain metrics are only going to improve over the coming weeks and months. BREAKING: #XRP Wallets Surge to 7.12 Million — that’s 840,000+ new addresses added in just 6 months! Adoption is no longer coming. It’s here. pic.twitter.com/Dad66gyloH — XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) July 11, 2025 Not only has the XRP price surged in the past day, but there have been several big XRP transfers this week, including one yesterday worth over $100 million . Larger traders and institutions are clearly buying into XRP in a big way, as we can also see from recent CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows reports . And if we look at its chart today, we see that it has decisively begun a breakout, with its indicators all flashing ‘buy.’ Not only has its RSI (yellow) risen above 70, but its moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has just turned positive. Source: TradingView What’s particularly bullish about this is that the MACD is still some way from hitting the overbought levels it witnessed in late November and January. As such, there’s plenty of time left before the current rally runs out of steam, with the XRP price potentially rising more or less consistently for the next few weeks. The longer-term picture is even more positive, given that we’re waiting on the approval of numerous XRP ETFs , which could send the altcoin flying. Based on this, the XRP price could hit $3 by the end of July, and potentially end the year at $10, if not higher. TOKEN6900 Presale Passes $300,000 As Hype for Edgy Meme Coin Grows Assuming that a fully fledged bull market is kicking off, now may be a very opportune time to diversify into newer tokens as well, given the positive volatility they can often display. This includes presale tokens, which can sometimes generate enough momentum to produce big rallies when they list for the first time. One example with a good chance of doing this is TOKEN6900 (T6900), an ERC-20 meme coin that opened its presale only a couple of weeks ago. brain made of pop rocks and mint button pic.twitter.com/NPlTUJaiIy — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 10, 2025 It has already raised more than $330,000, a reassuring sign of how popular it could become once it launches. What’s bullish about TOKEN6900 is that it’s billing itself as a pure, unadulterated meme coin, one without any pretension of ‘fundamentals’ or ‘utility.’ Its website proudly declares that it’s about “Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders,” and that it’s a “Crypto Presale Fantasy.” In other words, it will lean on marketing, hype and FOMO more than any particular use case, with the coin aiming to build an online community of champions and evangelists. Much like the popular SPX6900, it has taken on the trappings and stylings of the infamous dot-com boom, with its website and socials revolving around retro graphics. Its token, T6900, will have a max supply of 930,993,091 tokens, with holders able to stake the coin for a passive income stream. Investors can join its presale by going to the official TOKEN6900 website , where T6900 costs $0.006525.

2025-07-11T16:30:40,"Bitcoin ETF IBIT Sees Surge In AUM, Marking New Institutional Peak","Since its inception early last year, Bitcoin Spot ETFs have become a crucial part of its market dynamics. During inception, several spot BTC ETFs were launched, but BlackRock’s IBIT has turned out to be quite successful, which currently stands as the biggest BTC spot exchange product. Capital Flows Drive BlackRock Bitcoin ETF While Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) continue to record inflows, BlackRock’s BTC ETF, IBIT, is witnessing substantial growth compared to other products. Presently, the product appears to be leading the charge with a surge to new levels, surpassing other funds. In a post on the X platform, The Kobeissi Letter, a leading commentary on the global capital market, announced that the Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, has hit a new milestone in terms of assets under management. The assets under management have surged to a value of $76 billion, highlighting the quickening rate of institutional acceptance in the cryptocurrency industry. According to the Kobeissi Letter, total assets have tripled over the past 200 trading days, as per ZeroHedge. This fresh milestone by IBIT cements BlackRock’s dominant position in the broader spot BTC ETF sector. As the iShares Bitcoin Trust generates unprecedented AUM, it demonstrates the increasing belief among major investors that Bitcoin merits a crucial place at the global investment table . BlackRock’s IBIT sharp rise in AUM to a new high appears to be exceptional, as many funds took several years to experience this growth. It is worth noting that it took more than 15 years for GLD, the biggest gold ETF, to achieve the same feat. The Kobeissi Letter also reported that the IBIT’s Bitcoin holdings have increased substantially during the period. Data from the market expert shows that IBIT BTC holding has grown to over 700,000 BTC for the first time in history. Comparing this amount of Bitcoin acquired with that of MicroStrategy, a firm that is mainly recognized for its strategic accumulation of BTC, it is 100,000 BTC more than the total holdings of the company. Given the stunning growth of the IBIT, the Kobeissi Letter believes that the overall “crypto markets are making history.” More Buying Interest In BTC Than ETFs Lark Davis, a crypto expert and entrepreneur, has outlined a new trend in buying activity among institutional players. Despite the continuous capital inflows into ETFs, many investors appear to be more interested in acquiring Bitcoin directly than through ETFs. The expert revealed that BTC purchases by public businesses are outpacing those of ETFs. In addition, Davis stated that the number of Bitcoin Treasury businesses is growing every week, as institutional investors continue to hoard BTC in unprecedented quantities. Considering this mass accumulation by public institutions, the expert is confident that the market is about to go insane from here.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-ibit-surge-in-aum/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Bitcoin News|Assets Under Management|AUM|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock|btc|BTC news Bitcoin ETF|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|ETF|ETF news|GLD|gold ETF|Lark Davis|MicroStrategy|spot Bitcoin ETF|The Kobeissi Letter|ZeroHedge",cryptocompare

Risk assets rebounded after an initial tariff-induced dip in global markets. Key metrics suggest more upside movement for Bitcoin. According to data from CryptoRank, a cryptocurrency data analysis platform, Bitcoin outperformed gold and stocks in Q2 2025 despite those assets’ impressive records over the same period. Gold and the S&P 500 recorded new all-time highs during the quarter, even though the consequences of Donald Trump’s latest tariff policies threatened their growth at the beginning of the period under review. Trump’s Tariff Policies Caused a Market Crash in Q2 Trump employed a blanket approach in his tariff policies, imposing massive taxes on the country’s traditional rivals, geopolitical competitors, and allies. The new administration’s actions took many by surprise and shocked global markets.

2025-07-11T16:26:00,"Hyperliquid ($HYPE) Soars 24% to All-Time High Amid Growing Interest for DeFi Derivatives","Hyperliquid ($HYPE) recently rallied to a new all-time high of $46.22 after rising more than 10% in the past 24 hours, although it has slipped back to trade at about $45.59 at press time. Over the last week, bullish momentum lifted the token from a $37.18 trough to its recent peak of $46.22, an impressive 24% rally reflecting growing demand for DeFi derivatives on Hyperliquid’s HyperBFT network. Despite recent profit-taking, volatility remains elevated as traders eye a fresh breakout or a deeper pullback. Source: CoinGecko Hyperliquid runs its own Layer-1, bypassing gas-fee congestion while offering central-exchange speed and on-chain order books. There are 333.92 million $HYPE tokens in circulation with a market cap of about $15.2 billion, fueling deep liquidity and institutional interest. The on-chain platform currently has $463.28 million locked in bridged TVL , underscoring its scale as a decentralized perpetual exchange. In early June, Tony G Co-Investment Holdings deployed $438K into $HYPE , becoming the first public company to add it to its treasury, signaling institutional confidence. Validator staking rules now require 10,000 $HYPE self-delegation, ensuring robust network security and aligned incentives. Hype around an #Altseason has been brewing since late May, when former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes made a bold price prediction for Hyperliquid’s $HYPE token. Hayes backed legendary trader James Wynn’s massive bet on the platform, amplifying the momentum. Legendary! Top trader @JamesWynnReal 's 40x leveraged long $BTC position has exceeded 10,000 $BTC , worth $1.1B!

Bitcoin’s recent climb to become the world’s fifth-largest asset again, surpassing $2.36 trillion in market value as of July, boosts investor appetite for leverage platforms and altcoins. The rising tide has already lifted $HYPE’s 24-hour trading volume by 3.79%, setting the stage for the next breakout. $HYPE/$USDT Soars Above $45 After Parabolic Rally — Price Faces Decision Zone The 4-hour chart for $HYPE/$USDT shows a striking parabolic advance that began after a mid-range consolidation near the $37–$39 zone. $HYPE oscillated in a broad sideways channel for nearly two weeks, coiling beneath key resistance as buyers gradually absorbed supply. This slow accumulation phase created the conditions for the explosive breakout that followed. HYPE/USDT price chart, July 11 (Source: TradingView) The pivot began on July 9, where $HYPE broke above minor resistance at $39.7 with a strong bullish candle. This move was supported by increasing volume, indicating that large players were stepping in. Once $41.50 was cleared, a vertical climb ensued. $HYPE posted a series of large-bodied green candles, each one closing near the high, a clear sign of aggressive buyer control with little resistance overhead. By July 11, the price had jumped to an all-time high of $46.09, representing a nearly 20% move in less than 48 hours. One thing to note is that no significant pullbacks were observed during the rally, reinforcing the urgency behind the buying. Ideally, parabolic run-ups are bullish, but they are often followed by a cooling-off period during which the new supports can be tested. Immediate resistance lies near $46.50–$47.00, with RSI likely entering overbought territory. $HYPE traders will now be watching closely for a potential flag or consolidation range to form, which is a healthy pause that could offer continuation if demand persists. A break above $47 could open the gates toward $50 and beyond, but failure to hold above $44.80 might trigger profit-taking. Short-term support is expected near $42.50 and then $40.

2025-07-11T16:11:21,"GMX Hacker Begins Returning Siphoned $40M After White-Hat Offer","The decentralized trading platform GMX recently faced one of its most significant security breaches. An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the platform’s first version, stealing over $40 million worth of cryptocurrency. However, in a surprising turn of events, the attacker has now started returning the stolen funds . This happened after GMX offered a white-hat bounty worth $5 million and promised no legal consequences. A Costly Breach Hits GMX V1 Earlier this week, the attacker targeted GMX’s original trading system, known as GMX V1, on the Arbitrum blockchain. The hacker took advantage of a weakness in GMX’s OrderBook contract. This allowed the bad actor to change the short trading price of Bitcoin (BTC) and increase the value of the GLP token. The inflated token value was then used to cash out and make a profit. The attack affected several digital coins, including USDC, Frax, Wrapped Bitcoin, and Wrapped Ethereum. In total, the hacker stole over $40 million worth of crypto. As seen in many similar cases , GMX responded quickly to the attack. The team stopped trading and token minting on its V1 system across both the Arbitrum and Avalanche networks. It is important to note that GMX V2 and the platform’s primary token were not affected by the attack. A White-Hat Bounty Turns the Tide To reduce the damage and avoid a prolonged loss, GMX took a bold step. The GMX team sent a message to the attacker using the blockchain. They offered a 10% white-hat reward of $5 million if the stolen funds were returned within 48 hours. The team also promised not to take legal action if the attacker cooperated. Soon after, a reply came through the blockchain, saying the funds would be returned. The attacker kept that promise and sent back two large batches of money. First, $5.5 million worth of Frax was returned, followed by another $5 million. These were sent directly to the GMX deployer wallet. Soon after, the attacker also returned around 9,000 ETH, worth approximately $27 million. This brought the total amount returned close to the full sum stolen. This kind of move by GMX is not unusual in the crypto world and is often used to encourage cooperation after a significant breach. Market Reaction and Project Response After the attack, GMX’s token dropped by over 28%, hitting a low of $10.52. However, once the attacker agreed to return the funds, the price quickly bounced back and went up by more than 13%. The GMX team thanked the attacker on-chain for returning the money and started working to protect the platform going forward. To prevent such hacks from recurring, the team has permanently disabled GLP minting and redemption on Arbitrum. Affected users would be able to close their positions, and leftover funds will be used to compensate those impacted.

2025-07-11T16:09:04,"99Bitcoins Q2 Report Unveils What’s Powering the 2025 Crypto Boom","The crypto market has been on a tear in 2025, and the latest 99Bitcoins Q2 State of Crypto Market Report, authored by Manisha Mishra and sponsored by KCEX, lays it all out. The quarter saw institutional demand surge, Bitcoin ($BTC) hit a then-ATH of $111,980, and crypto hiring spike 753%. Despite the rally, the total market cap was still 12% below its $3.7 trillion peak, hinting at room to run. With stablecoin adoption booming and long-term holders stacking, Q2 may have been the real start of this cycle’s breakout. Read the full report here: State of Crypto Q2 2025 – 99Bitcoins A Record-Breaking Quarter for Bitcoin Bitcoin lit up Q2 with a 25.66% gain, smashing past resistance to hit a then-record $111,980 on May 22. That put it well ahead of gold’s 7.21% rise and most equity indices, marking a sharp reversal from Q1’s pullback. According to 99Bitcoins’ Q2 report, the rally was driven by institutional inflows, ETF demand, and growing sovereign interest, with governments now holding 2.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Meanwhile, spot ETF flows consistently outpaced miner issuance, tightening supply just as demand surged. Chris Wright of 21Shares summed it up: “We believe that Bitcoin ETFs will attract 50% more inflows this year compared to last year. This would result in net inflows of approximately $55 billion in 2025, representing an increase of around $20 billion year-over-year.” A golden cross in late May confirmed the uptrend, following a clean breakout from months of consolidation. It’s a textbook bullish structure. With price action and fundamentals in sync, Q2 marked the clearest shift yet: Bitcoin is back, but powered by institutions, not retail. Institutions Took the Wheel, Retail Turned to Altcoins According to the 99Bitcoins report, this bull run has a different driver behind the wheel. And it’s not Reddit. 9 out of 10 experts interviewed in the Q2 report said retail traders have shifted their focus to the best altcoins, chasing faster gains while institutions quietly accumulated Bitcoin. The on-chain data backs it up. Glassnode shows that 30% of $BTC’s supply is now held by centralized entities, with large players dominating inflows. Meanwhile, Google Trends reveals that retail interest in “Bitcoin” searches stayed surprisingly low throughout Q2, even as $BTC hit new highs. Confidence among long-term holders also climbed. UTXO activity dropped, and the amount of BTC in long-term storage kept rising. A sign that serious capital isn’t looking to sell anytime soon. Stablecoins and DeFi Picked Up Steam If Q2 proved anything, it’s that stablecoins aren’t just stable, they’re also scaling. The Circle IPO popped 168% on day one, marking the first stablecoin issuer to go public and signaling TradFi’s growing appetite for crypto exposure without the volatility. According to 99Bitcoins, 81% of crypto-aware SMBs now want to use stablecoins for daily ops, and the number of Fortune 500s planning to integrate them has tripled since last year. On the DeFi side, Ethereum ($ETH) held L1 dominance, Chainlink ($LINK) led dev activity, and $HYPE – the native token of Hyperliquid – saw serious traction, fueled by the DEX’s rise to 70%+ of all perp DEX volume. While others chased memes, HYPE rallied on actual utility. In short: DeFi’s still cooking, and stablecoins are fueling the fire. Memecoin Mayhem After tanking in Q1, the memecoin market bounced back slightly in Q2, though volatility stayed extreme and price action remained erratic. Q2 saw the meme coins hit new heights, with over 5.9 million new tokens launched and most of them churned out via pump.fun. It was chaotic, noisy, and pure degen energy. While most faded instantly, tokens like $FARTCOIN and $SPX kept riding the wave. That said, the surge in token activity came with a dark side: phishing and wallet-targeted hacks climbed, especially among memecoin holders. Regulatory Wins and Macro Shifts Driving Confidence If Q2 had a theme, it was relief on both the policy and economic fronts. The U.S. pulled back on crypto enforcement, scrapped IRS reporting rules for DeFi, and signaled a more constructive stance overall. Meanwhile, the Fed held rates steady for the fourth straight time, hinting at a possible cut in July. With unemployment flat and growth slowing, capital started flowing into safe-haven assets, and this time, Bitcoin was firmly on that list. The result? Confidence surged. Bitcoin ETF inflows accelerated, volatility dropped, and $BTC’s macro narrative strengthened. It’s no longer just a risk asset; it’s becoming part of the defensive playbook. Elsewhere, $XRP finally closed its long-running legal battle with the SEC, potentially clearing the runway for a new ATH later this year. What’s Next for Q3? Back in Q2, 99Bitcoins forecasted that if BTC could flip $111K–$112K resistance, the path to $120K would open, with $135K as a stretch target. Fast forward to now, and that prediction is aging well: Bitcoin is already trading at above $118K, edging toward that psychological milestone. The report also noted $BTC was holding firm above $103K support, forming a bullish structure backed by rising miner wallet balances, shrinking exchange reserves, and growing illiquid supply – all signs of confidence from long-term holders. Still, Q3 isn’t without risk. ETF inflows could slow, and macro headwinds, from global conflict to sudden rate hikes, remain on the radar. But if institutional flows stay hot and the Fed delivers a rate cut, $135K no longer feels like a moonshot. It’s just part of the next leg up. Final Thoughts: A Bull Market With Depth The 99Bitcoins Q2 report by Manisha Mishra paints a clear picture: this bull market isn’t built on retail hype. Institutions, regulatory tailwinds, and real product traction are powering it. From ETF inflows to stablecoin adoption and supply-side tightening, the signals all point toward a more mature, resilient crypto cycle. And with Bitcoin already pushing towards $120K, many of the Q2 projections are already playing out. If momentum holds, and macro conditions don’t throw a curveball, Q4 could be the real breakout.

2025-07-11T16:08:11,"U.S. stocks dip after back-to-back record closes as Trump targets Canada","Wall Street's major averages were lower on Friday as President Donald Trump slapped a 35% tariff on Canada and warned of further hikes if Ottawa retaliated. Market participants also took a bit of a breather after back-to-back record closes for the benchmark S&P 500 index ( SP500 ). The S&P ( SP500 ) was last -0.4% in midday trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) was -0.1% , and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) was -0.8% . Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. In addition, Trump said he would impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on other remaining countries. “Stocks are not quite desensitized to tariff headlines just yet. We are still seeing knee-jerk reactions to negative trade headlines. Volatility is an opportunity for investors who are still too exposed to cash,” said Michael Landsberg, CIO at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 7 basis points to 4.42%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 2 basis points to 3.91%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a new all-time high on Friday, fueled by growing institutional interest and supportive signals from the Trump administration. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget is expected to be in deficit by $50B in June versus $70.9B in June 2024. The focus will shift slightly from tariffs and trade developments to the second quarter U.S. earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from major banks.

2025-07-11T16:00:44,"Bitcoin Dominance Falls: 9 Factors To Watch For That Says The Altcoin Season Has Begun","Bitcoin’s price is holding firm despite growing chatter about the end of its market dominance. However, analysts are turning their attention not to Bitcoin’s price but to its waning market share as signs that altcoins may finally be ready to take center stage in what could become a full-blown altcoin season. A post on X has highlighted a specific breakdown structure in BTC dominance, which is linked to nine factors indicating that the altcoin season has begun. Technical Factors Showing Fall Of Bitcoin Dominance According to the analyst, Bitcoin dominance reached a peak of exactly 66% on June 27, 2025, a date he calls significant for its esoteric code 434 and its occurrence on a new moon. From a technical perspective, the 66% mark coincided precisely with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, a region many traders consider a reversal zone. More importantly, several warning signals are flashing for Bitcoin traders. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says The analyst’s post on the social media platform X features a few price charts to emphasize how the Bitcoin dominance might be fading, alongside nine factors. From a purely technical lens, the dominance chart looks increasingly exhausted. The first factor is the most recent highest monthly RSI in the history of the Bitcoin dominance chart. This event has created an overbought condition, and the next outlook is a possible crash of the RSI. The MACD, in fact, has already crossed into bearish territory. Furthermore, the histogram has turned negative, and the faster line has moved below the slower one, which is a classic signal of an impending downtrend. Another interesting factor is that Bitcoin dominance has now broken a key diagonal support line that held firm through much of 2024 and 2025, which is another possible structural breakdown. Fundamental Factors Show Strong Rotation Into Altcoin Pairs While the technical picture is deteriorating, the fundamentals are also stacking in favor of altcoins very quickly. The first fundamental factor is the importance of upcoming altcoin spot ETFs, which have the possibility to redirect institutional flows from Bitcoin into Ethereum, XRP, and others. Related Reading: Time To Forget Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance At This Level Is This Only Hope ETFs such as the Spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana ETFs could rapidly increase inflows into the rest of the crypto market, similar to how Spot Bitcoin ETFs caused massive inflows into Bitcoin. The analyst also highlighted the likelihood of upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which would tilt market conditions in favor of altcoins over Bitcoin. Momentum has also begun to shift in some trading pairs, particularly XRP/BTC and ETH/BTC, both of which are showing reversal signs from critical levels. The XRP/BTC chart displays repeated failed attempts to break above 0.0000215 BTC, a horizontal resistance that has now been tested five times on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. At the time of writing, the XRP/BTC pair has returned to this level yet again, and based on this pattern, any clean breakout here could confirm a decisive rotation into XRP. Likewise, Ethereum has begun to recover from long-term oversold conditions when measured against Bitcoin. The rounded bottom pattern forming on the ETH/BTC weekly chart shows a reversal from undervaluation, which in past cycles has caused substantial gains for Ethereum relative to BTC.

2025-07-11T15:43:56,"Bitcoin: Race To The Bottom","Summary Bitcoin has proven itself as a hedge and store of value, outperforming traditional assets during market volatility and monetary debasement. Institutional adoption is accelerating, with surveys showing a growing allocation to Bitcoin in diversified portfolios globally. The macro environment of rising debt and currency debasement makes Bitcoin the best asset to hold for the next decade. While short-term cycles matter, the real risk is not owning Bitcoin, as its long-term trend remains strongly upward. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is breaking out again, showing that it could potentially be ready for another big run-up. In the last year, Bitcoin has set itself apart from other risk assets, showing that it is in a league of its own and that it is not just a speculative bet but is increasingly being considered by the market like a hedge and store of value. I estimate Bitcoin's value based on three different approaches: Market cap, the Stock-to-Flow Model, and Technical Analysis. But while I remain bullish on Bitcoin, the four-year cycle that has played out in the past also suggests we could be getting close to a top, and investors should have an exit strategy in place once euphoria sets in. Just Buy Bitcoin The appeal for Bitcoin has never been more undeniable, and as we rally into new all-time highs, more and more people are beginning to realize this. The last few months have proven that Bitcoin is more than a speculative asset. While the major stock indexes plummeted in April, Bitcoin outperformed on the way down, and it is now outperforming on the way up. You just can't ignore the facts, and even major fund managers are being forced to admit that Bitcoin has a place in a well-diversified portfolio. A June survey found 67% of institutional investors believed digital assets had a role in a portfolio , with 69% planning to increase allocation. Another survey showed 59% of institutional investors were planning to allocate at least 5% of their portfolios towards digital assets. Race To The Bottom The evidence for owning Bitcoin is overwhelming right now, and this can be proven in just one chart. DXY (TV) The dollar has seen one of its worst six months in decades, and this is simply pricing in the reality that deficits are going to keep increasing and being monetized by the Fed. The latest Big Beautiful bill will increase the deficit by trillions Trump has officially talked about wanting a dovish Fed, and he will likely get his wish next year. More importantly, though, this is a global phenomenon. Global debt (IIF ) Global debt is 333% of GDP. This is not getting paid back with austerity. This is only getting paid back in debased currency, and the best hedge against debasement has been proven over the last few years to be Bitcoin. Debasement is going to be the defining macro factor of the next 10 years. Institutions know it, and they are gearing up for it. How High Can We Go? With the latest evidence from institutional surveys, it's clear that Bitcoin is going to make its way into most portfolios around the world. This gives us an easy way of calculating the price of Bitcoin. Let's take the survey above that suggests 5% of institutional portfolios will go into Bitcoin. That's 5% of a total global asset base of around $175 trillion as of a year ago. That's around $8.75 trillion in market cap that could flow into Bitcoin, with a maximum of 21 million in circulation. That yields a price of $416,667. With that said, this is likely a longer-term target, which could take some time to play out. More immediately, I am looking at the $150,000 area. BTC Price TA (Trendspider) This is the next key fib level from the bear market low and would complete a five-wave impulse nicely. The Real Risk Is Not Owning Bitcoin The way I see it, the real risk right now is not having any exposure to Bitcoin. Everything right now suggests it's the best asset to hold during a debasement. In fact, this is a strong argument to also hold stocks and gold. Bitcoin is likely the best option going forward since it is still in its early phase of adoption and has a much more global appeal. Does that mean we go up in a straight line? Of course not. Bitcoin, like other assets, is still subject to the business cycle. It's going to come down at some point, but the overall trend is going to be up. If you really wanted to time a short-term top, then we'd have to look at things like global liquidity trends and macro indicators like the ISM. But for now, these metrics still suggest we are going higher. Liquidity is on the up, and the economy remains strong. Risks Although I am bullish given the liquidity outlook, plenty of events could derail this. Geopolitics, a recession, or the return of inflation are all possible headwinds. Bitcoin is volatile, so investors should be ready for large corrections at any given time. Takeaway The last year has been very important for Bitcoin. It has shown, with price action, that it is a hedge against monetary debasement. Coincidentally, at the same time, the US has shown that more debt and debasement is indeed the way forward. Cash in the bank is going to lose value. The least you can do is hold financial assets like stocks. And in my view, the best thing you can do is hold Bitcoin right now.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800688-bitcoin-race-to-the-bottom?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, the two largest dollar-pegged stablecoins, each reached new record supplies this week, according to TradingView data. Since the start of July, USDC’s market cap has grown by $1.3 billion, reaching $62.8 billion, while USDT added $1.4 billion to hit nearly $160 billion. Looking further back to April, when the market hit a short-term low, the growth is even more pronounced. USDT expanded by $15.2 billion—roughly 10.5%—and USDC added $2.7 billion, or 4.6%. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with prices tied to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar. While they have been increasingly popular for payments, the asset class serves as a key source of liquidity and trading pairs on crypto exchanges. Hence, analysts often treat their growth as a proxy for fresh capital entering the broader crypto economy. Previously, periods of accelerating stablecoin growth coincided with sharp rallies in bitcoin, Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, pointed out in a chart shared on X .

Europe's securities regulator has warned cryptocurrency companies not to mislead their customers, according to a Reuters report. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has warned crypto platforms not to mislead customers about the regulatory status of their products. ESMA said some cryptoasset service providers (CASPs) offer both regulated and unregulated products, but are putting retail investors at risk by failing to clearly distinguish between their products. ESMA emphasized that firms must clearly distinguish between products that fall within the scope of MiCA and those that do not. On this point, ESMA said that having crypto asset service providers (CASPs) offer both regulated and unregulated products through the same platform “causes risks for investors” because customers may not be aware of which products are under MiCA protection. “Some CASPs may use their regulated status under MiCA as a marketing argument, leading to confusion between regulated and unregulated products and services.” Finally, ESMA also said that cryptocurrency companies should not use their regulated products as a “promotional tool” or imply that their unregulated products are within the scope of the MICA. *This is not investment advice.

Coinbase Demands Transparency After State’s Abrupt Legal Action The Washington Times reports that Coinbase has filed a lawsuit accusing Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield of suddenly changing their stance on digital assets. It is now demanding public records to understand what led to the change, and claims that the shift happened behind closed doors, with no public hearings, rulemaking, or chance for input, violating transparency rules. pic.twitter.com/siEmaP50IQ — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) July 11, 2025 “Let there be no doubt: Oregon’s lawsuit, like the SEC’s, is meritless, and Coinbase will do whatever is required to beat it,” said Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s CLO, in a previous blog post. He shared that Oregon’s Attorney General is preparing to sue Coinbase using the same outdated arguments the SEC already dropped. Grewal called the move political and harmful, saying it goes against the bipartisan efforts in Washington to create clear, fair crypto rules. Ryan VanGrack, Coinbase’s vice president of litigation, stressed that transparency is essential for good governance. He criticized Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield for pursuing a lawsuit that, according to him, benefits out-of-state law firms while hurting Oregon residents who want to trade digital assets. This comes after the Attorney General sued Coinbase in April. He claimed that the company broke the law by not registering with state and federal regulators. After the federal government dropped its case against Coinbase, Oregon filed its own lawsuit, claiming that Coinbase was illegally selling risky, unregistered crypto to people in the state. Coinbase Says Oregon Lawsuit Favors Out-of-State Law Firms Coinbase notes in its lawsuit that for years, Oregon told people that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were not covered by state rules. But suddenly, in April, the state changed its mind and filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, claiming that the company was breaking the law by not registering properly. It also points out that the state hired outside law firms that could take 20-30% of the gains if the case succeeds. Coinbase argues that no new law was passed to regulate digital currencies and says the public deserves to know why it happened. The company wants the court to force Governor Kotek to release documents explaining the change. An Untimely Move Mr Vangrack notes that Oregon is the only state suing Coinbase, and it is both untimely and inappropriate for a state to step in on something that falls under federal authority. This comes as the lawmakers from both parties are working on legislation to bring clearer regulations to better regulate the crypto industry. Congress is expected to vote next week on two key bills: the Clarity Act and the GENIUS Act, which aim to bring more transparency and rules to the digital asset industry.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-hits-back-at-oregon-over-sudden-crypto-policy-shift/,"EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-11T15:17:01,"Analyst: Skip Bitcoin FOMO, Altcoins Offer Better Gains Now","Bitcoin (BTC) has sent the crypto community into delirium, hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of almost $119,000 after brief stops around $113,000 and $116,000. However, despite the excitement, prominent analyst CrediBULL Crypto has cautioned traders not to chase the rally blindly, suggesting that the real opportunity lies in altcoins, not Bitcoin. Why BTC FOMO Could Be Costly With BTC currently over 650% above its ideal accumulation zone, CrediBULL posted a stark warning on X: “The big opportunity for gains is on ALTS even if Bitcoin is the one that is ‘leading’ this move.” He added that anyone buying the asset at this particular point should only do so for an active trade with a clear setup. “If you can’t identify a trade setup then there is no reason to buy Bitcoin at these levels as there are much better opportunities in alts from a R/R perspective at current levels.” His comments echoed a broader sentiment emerging from key market voices, including former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and YouTuber Crypto Rover, who likened the current market cycle to November 2024, when a major altcoin rally followed Bitcoin’s price surge. In a recent tweet, Hayes said he had reversed his previously bearish stance, citing Bitcoin’s strong breakout and the rising dominance of Ethereum (ETH). “Get ready for a monster alt szn,” he wrote, signaling increased institutional confidence. The crypto entrepreneur also reported that his Maelstrom Fund is ramping up altcoin exposure amid expectations of favorable political and macroeconomic shifts. Observers have described the flagship cryptocurrency’s latest move as structurally different from past bull cycles. According to CryptoQuant, it isn’t driven by speculative angst, but rather by strategic accumulation and restrained selling activity. Additionally, metrics like the MVRV ratio, currently 2.2 vs. over 2.7 in previous tops, SOPR, and MPI all hint at a sustainable rally with long-term potential. The drop in exchange balances, down over 21% in four months, also suggests that holders are in no rush to exit their positions. Altcoins on the Mend However, even with BTC in price discovery mode, Ethereum and several other altcoins are beginning to outshine it in percentage gains. ETH, for instance, is up by more than 18% in the last seven days, beating Bitcoin’s 8.9% rise in the same period. It has also reclaimed the $3,000 level and is setting its sights on $3,350–$3,500. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has pumped 23.7% across the week, reclaiming critical support at $0.64 and eyeing a return to $1. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is up nearly 19%, having set a new all-time high at $46.25, and is now targeting the $50 psychological threshold. Even Solana (SOL) is catching a bid, with prices climbing above $164 and showing potential for a rally beyond $180.

2025-07-11T15:13:42,"Bitcoin Surpasses Silver, Becomes Sixth Largest Asset in the World","Bitcoin (BTC) market capitalization has overtaken silver following the coin’s surge to a new all-time high above $118,000. According to Companies Market Cap , Bitcoin is now sitting in the sixth place among the world’s largest companies, metals, and digital assets, with a market cap of $2.34 trillion. Silver follows at spot number seven, with $2.163 trillion in market capitalization. Top assets by market cap: Source: companiesmarketcap.com Tech giants Google and Meta are behind BTC and silver, with $1.15 trillion and $1.79 trillion, respectively. Notably, Bitcoin is currently close to entering the top five assets. It has a chance to overtake Amazon as well. The massive company has a market cap of $2.37 trillion, about $3 trillion more than BTC. Meanwhile, gold still reigns supreme. The first place boasts a whopping market cap of $22.6 trillion. NVIDIA is a distant second, recording $4 trillion. Microsoft and Apple follow, standing in the $3 trillion range. Analysts have noted Bitcoin’s maturation and stability , especially for a volatile asset, during the ongoing turbulent period. Specifically, it saw significant institutional interest and was consolidating above $100,000 for days before surging to a new all-time high – all the while defying major macroeconomic uncertainty and global geopolitical tensions. Per Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at Mercuryo , BTC surged past $118,000 “amid sustained institutional demand for the biggest cryptocurrency, which has been such a driving force in this current market cycle.” He continues: “While altcoins are also in the green with Ethereum spiking past the $3,000 mark, the underlying ‘orange pill’ narrative remains steadfastly in place. Bitcoin’s growing status as a store of value is one that more and more big players and institutions are simply unable to ignore.” You may also like: Bitcoin Hits $94k ATH, Surpasses Silver to Become Seventh Largest Asset in the World Bitcoin (BTC) market capitalization overtook that of silver with the influx of institutional money into digital assets, according to this week’s Bitfinex Alpha Market Report.The exchange’s analysts remarked that last week, BTC broke past initial resistance levels and hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $93,318.Additionally, it recorded the latest ATH of $94,040 just hours before the writing of this article.Notably, the surges moved BTC’s market capitalization (counting all BTC mined... ‘We’re Only at Beginning of New Phase in This Market’ The crypto market has seen a significant surge. The market cap is up 2.8% in the last 24 hours to $3.76 trillion. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $117,884. The coin hit a new all-time high of $118,667 earlier today. The current price is also a surge from the intraday low of $110,984. Also, it is up 9.1% in a week, 7.5% in a month, and 101% in a year. Moreover, analysts and investors are waiting to see if BTC will surpass the $119,000 and $120,000 levels, which could propel it towards $130,000 . Bitpanda’s Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad argues that “we’re well on track to break through the $120,000 barrier.” Macroeconomic factors, record-high ETF inflows, and renewed confidence in digital assets drive the rally. “The crypto market tends to move in cycles, evolving segment by segment and wave by wave. It’s very possible that we’re only at the beginning of a new phase in this market,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad says. BTC is Now More in Demand Than Ever Moreover, Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen , argued that this isn’t a macro-driven rally, but an isolated event. However, recent US policy developments, “such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing, have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin.” Also, he adds, we’re seeing growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance sheet asset and strong, sustained inflows into BTC and ETH spot ETFs. While $BTC has made a new ATH above $118K, Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) remains below the euphoria zone, currently at 0.69. This cycle has seen just ~30 days above the 0.75 threshold, compared to 228 days in the previous cycle. pic.twitter.com/qFEUbmK7r3 — glassnode (@glassnode) July 11, 2025 Additionally, Zondacrypto’s CEO Przemysław Kral commented that “Bitcoin’s latest ATH further cements its growing role in the global financial system,” now being “more in demand than ever.” Factors increasing demand for Bitcoin include clearer and more favorable regulations, increased utility such as payments, and changing economic conditions, Kral says. Regulations such as the EU’s MiCA contributed significantly, he adds. But, Kral warns, “with such hype comes the need for caution. No one knows whether the price will go up or down.” James Harris, the newly appointed Group CEO of Tesseract , also notes that while “it was great to see Bitcoin decisively shatter its all-time highs” in USD terms, “they fall short versus EUR, GBP, or Gold (XAU).” That said, the continued momentum has “BTC edging closer to those benchmarks as well,” Harris says.

Now, they’re taking that expertise to Coinbase, and the implications for onchain markets could be massive. On July 11, crypto exchange Coinbase announced it had poached Opyn’s core leadership team, including CEO Andrew Leone and Head of Research Joe Clark, in a talent-focused acquisition that underscores its aggressive push into onchain finance. The move, framed by Coinbase as a way to accelerate its onchain markets strategy, brings aboard two of DeFi’s most influential derivatives architects, known for pioneering innovations like Power Perpetuals and Squeeth. While the deal doesn’t include Opyn’s underlying protocol, it marks a clear talent acquisition as Coinbase doubles down on bringing traditional market functionality onto public ledgers. You might also like: Stocks slip amid Trump’s tariff threats, Bitcoin spike buoys crypto stocks Coinbase bets big on the architects of DeFi’s derivatives revolution Unlike previous acquisitions driven by product or protocol expansion, this was a bet on people. According to Coinbase, the decision to onboard Opyn’s top minds was made under its build-buy-partner-invest framework, with the leadership team’s hybrid grasp of DeFi primitives and traditional market mechanics standing out. Leone and Clark aren’t just engineers. The two are heralded as architects of market structure, having launched some of DeFi’s most novel instruments during Opyn’s experimental run. At Coinbase, they’ll be placed within the institutional Onchain Markets division, tasked with advancing efforts like Verified Pools and contributing to broader onchain exchange infrastructure. The Opyn team’s move underscores a broader industry reckoning. After navigating regulatory scrutiny, including a 2023 CFTC settlement over unregistered trading, Leone and Clark bring hard-won experience in balancing DeFi’s permissionless ideals with compliance realities. In its announcement, Opyn framed the transition as a natural evolution, stating, “Coinbase shares our belief that the future of finance is onchain and they are committed to making that a reality.” Big news: Coinbase is acquiring Opyn’s leadership team! Opyn’s mission has been to empower others through an inclusive, fair, and open financial system. We couldn’t imagine a better place than Coinbase to carry that vision forward. We are proud of the contributions we made to… pic.twitter.com/Pw5HyUFKns — Opyn (TESTNET IS LIVE) (@opyn_) July 11, 2025 This marks Coinbase’s sixth acquisition this year, following strategic grabs like Deribit’s team in May and onchain analytics platform Spindl in January. The pattern is clear: Coinbase is assembling a war chest of niche expertise, betting that the next phase of crypto adoption hinges on seamless integration between centralized trust and decentralized efficiency. As Clark noted, their goal is to build “the connective tissue of finance on immutable public ledgers.” The implications extend beyond talent. By embedding DeFi-native thinkers like Leone and Clark into its institutional framework, Coinbase is signaling that the future of trading isn’t just onchain, it’s hybrid. For traders, that could mean deeper liquidity and novel products; for competitors, it’s a warning that the exchange isn’t ceding ground to upstarts.

His chart data shows a clear “breakout-retest” cycle that has consistently driven the price to new highs and suggests the current rally is far from over. The analysis comes as Bitcoin trades near $118,000, holding strong above a previous consolidation zone. Bitcoin’s “Breakout-Retest” Cycle The chart, which spans weekly BTC price data from early 2022 to July 2025, documents a recurring pattern. First, Bitcoin breaks through a major resistance level.

Bitcoin","New data indicates that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) long-term performance shows the S&P 500 has lost nearly all its value when measured in BTC terms. These insights emerge at a time when both asset classes are trading at new record highs. For instance, Bitcoin has reached an all-time peak of $118,000, while the S&P 500 is edging close to the 6,300 mark. By press time, the maiden cryptocurrency was trading at $117,624, having rallied over 6% in the last 24 days, while in the past week, BTC is up 8%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding their relative long-term performance, the S&P 500 priced in Bitcoin is now down 99.98% since 2012, one of the most dramatic asset revaluations in modern financial history, according to data shared by market commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter on July 11. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 measured in Bitcoin is down another 15%. Bitcoin v. S&P 500 performance. Source: Bitbo Overall, the data suggests that Bitcoin’s appreciation has been so extreme over the last decade that traditional equity benchmarks appear to have effectively gone to zero when denominated in BTC. Implications of Bitcoin’s performance against S&P 500 Critics might argue this comparison is more symbolic than practical, considering that few institutions price their portfolios in Bitcoin. However, for Bitcoin advocates, the data highlights the cryptocurrency’s feature as a scarce, decentralized asset capable of outperforming traditional financial systems over time. It is essential to note that these two assets belong to distinctly different asset classes. The S&P 500 is a diversified index of large U.S. companies, representing traditional equity ownership in the global economy. At the same time, Bitcoin is a decentralized, digital asset designed to serve as a store of value and an alternative to fiat currencies.
