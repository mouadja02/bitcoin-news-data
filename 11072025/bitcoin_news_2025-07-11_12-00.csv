2025-07-11T09:56:31,"Bitcoin Reaches $118K Milestone— Here’s What Could Drive Prices Even Higher","The post Bitcoin Reaches $118K Milestone— Here’s What Could Drive Prices Even Higher appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price has shattered its previous all-time high, soaring to $118,404 amid a wave of institutional inflows and renewed investor confidence. The breakout follows sustained accumulation, reduced exchange supply, and bullish momentum building over key resistance levels. Supportive U.S. policies, including moves toward a national Bitcoin reserve, have added fuel to the rally. Meanwhile, macroeconomic shifts like a weaker dollar and expectations of easing interest rates have strengthened Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge, setting the stage for potential continued upside. Institutional Demand Powers the Surge A major catalyst behind Bitcoin’s price explosion is the surge in institutional interest. Over the past few weeks, spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded billions in net inflows, reflecting strong demand from both retail and professional investors. Asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck have become dominant market players, adding legitimacy and driving capital into BTC. This is not only absorbing existing supply but also reducing the available float, creating a bullish supply-demand imbalance. On-chain data shows a consistent outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges, indicating that more holders are moving their assets to cold storage rather than keeping them available for trading. This pattern is consistent with long-term accumulation phases seen in previous bull runs. As the ETF narrative matures and institutional FOMO (fear of missing out) kicks in, Bitcoin’s role as a digital store of value is gaining momentum, contributing to a sustained price appreciation. Macro Tailwinds & Technical Triggers Align Global macroeconomic conditions have also played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s breakout. As central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, signal a potential shift toward interest rate cuts, investor appetite for alternative assets like Bitcoin has surged. A weakening U.S. dollar and rising concerns around long-term inflation have made BTC an attractive hedge. Simultaneously, technical price action has confirmed a strong bullish structure, with Bitcoin consistently breaking through major resistance levels, triggering liquidations of leveraged short positions. The BTC price has reached the final barrier before entering a strong discovery phase. Currently, the price trades within the discovery phase but carries the possibility of a pullback. However, a rise above the range could invalidate the bearish possibilities for a while. The RSI is yet to enter the overbought range, which suggests the token has more bullish potential. Therefore, a rise above the range may push the price to around $130K, which could be the new high for the current bull run. Collectively, recent data suggests that over $300 million worth of shorts were wiped out in a single day, amplifying the rally. Additionally, the psychological impact of reclaiming previous highs has reignited retail enthusiasm, drawing new participants into the market. The alignment of favorable macro conditions and internal market mechanics suggests that this move is not merely speculative but rather the foundation of a broader, more sustained bull cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-reaches-118k-milestone-heres-what-could-drive-prices-even-higher/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-11T09:50:35,"Trump Tariffs: Unleashing a Global Economic Challenge","The financial world is abuzz with breaking news: former U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on imported goods if he returns to office. This significant policy shift, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, citing NBC News, has sent ripples of speculation across markets. For those of us deeply invested in the cryptocurrency market , understanding the potential fallout of such a move is paramount. Will this be a catalyst for digital assets, or will it simply add to the broader economic uncertainty? Trump Tariffs: What’s on the Table? Donald Trump’s potential return to the White House brings with it a familiar, yet intensified, approach to international commerce: aggressive protectionism. The proposed blanket tariffs, ranging from 15% to 20% on all imported goods, represent a significant escalation from his previous trade policies. During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on specific goods like steel and aluminum, and engaged in a high-profile trade war with China. This new proposal, however, suggests a far broader and more sweeping application. Blanket Application: Unlike targeted tariffs, a ‘blanket’ approach means virtually all goods entering the U.S. would be subject to these new levies, regardless of their origin or type. Significant Percentage: A 15-20% tariff is substantial, designed to drastically increase the cost of foreign goods and incentivize domestic production. Economic Philosophy: This policy aligns with an ‘America First’ economic strategy, aiming to reduce trade deficits and bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The implications of such a policy are far-reaching, touching every aspect of the economy from consumer prices to corporate supply chains, and inevitably, the global financial landscape. The Broad Economic Impact: Who Pays the Price? When discussing economic impact , tariffs often lead to a complex web of consequences that extend far beyond border fees. While the stated goal of tariffs is to protect domestic industries and jobs, the reality is often more nuanced, with costs ultimately passed down to consumers and businesses alike. Potential Economic Ramifications: Inflationary Pressures: Imported goods become more expensive. U.S. businesses that rely on imported components or finished products will face higher costs, which they are likely to pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can fuel domestic inflation, eroding purchasing power. Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chains are intricately linked. Imposing blanket tariffs could force companies to re-evaluate or reconfigure their sourcing strategies, potentially leading to delays, increased operational costs, and reduced efficiency. This might encourage ‘reshoring’ but at a potentially significant short-term cost. Reduced Consumer Spending: Higher prices for goods and services, coupled with potential wage stagnation if businesses struggle, could lead to a decline in overall consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Corporate Profitability: Companies, especially those heavily reliant on international trade or imported materials, could see their profit margins squeezed. This might lead to lower earnings, impacting stock valuations and investment decisions. Job Market Shifts: While some domestic manufacturing sectors might see a boost, others reliant on affordable imports or export markets could face job losses. The overall effect on employment is often debated and highly dependent on the specific industry and market response. Who Wins and Who Loses? Potential Beneficiaries Potential Disadvantaged Certain domestic manufacturers (if they can scale up efficiently) Consumers (higher prices, reduced choice) U.S. government (tariff revenue, though often offset by economic slowdown) Import-reliant businesses (retailers, some tech firms) Sectors with strong domestic supply chains Export-oriented U.S. industries (due to retaliatory tariffs) International trading partners (reduced access to U.S. market) Navigating Global Trade: A New Era of Protectionism? The prospect of significant new import duties raises critical questions about the future of global trade . Trump’s previous tariffs sparked retaliatory measures from countries like China and the European Union, leading to a period of heightened trade tensions. A blanket tariff policy would almost certainly provoke a similar, if not more aggressive, response from major trading partners. Key Considerations for Global Trade: Retaliatory Tariffs: Other nations are highly likely to impose their own tariffs on U.S. exports, making American goods more expensive abroad and harming U.S. industries that rely on international markets (e.g., agriculture, technology). Weakening International Institutions: Such unilateral actions could further undermine the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other multilateral trade agreements, leading to a more fragmented and less predictable global trading system. Shift Towards Regionalization: Countries might increasingly look to form regional trade blocs and diversify their supply chains away from reliance on the U.S. market, accelerating a trend away from globalized production. Increased Geopolitical Tensions: Trade disputes can easily spill over into broader diplomatic and geopolitical conflicts, impacting international relations and stability. The global economy thrives on predictability and open markets. A widespread tariff regime could inject significant uncertainty, discouraging cross-border investment and innovation. How Import Duties Could Ripple Through Traditional Markets The direct consequences of these potential import duties will undoubtedly send shockwaves through traditional financial markets. Investors in stocks, bonds, and commodities will need to brace for increased volatility and re-evaluate their portfolios. Market-Specific Impacts: Stock Markets: Expect heightened volatility. Sectors heavily reliant on imported goods (e.g., retail, consumer electronics) could face headwinds due to higher costs and reduced consumer demand. Conversely, some domestic manufacturing or raw materials sectors might see initial gains, but these could be offset by broader economic slowdowns or retaliatory tariffs. Bond Markets: A ‘flight to safety’ could occur, driving demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, potentially lowering yields. However, if inflation becomes a significant concern, bond yields might rise to compensate for eroded purchasing power. Currency Markets: The U.S. Dollar (USD) might initially strengthen as capital flows into the U.S. seeking safety, or as foreign companies pay more for U.S. goods (if exports are not severely hit). However, persistent trade deficits or economic slowdowns could eventually weaken the dollar. Commodities: Prices for raw materials could fluctuate. If global economic growth slows due to trade wars, demand for industrial commodities might fall. Agricultural commodities could be particularly vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs. Investors should prepare for a period of uncertainty, with a greater emphasis on defensive assets and careful sector analysis. The Cryptocurrency Market: A Safe Haven or a Stormy Sea? Now, let’s turn our attention to what matters most to our readers: the cryptocurrency market . How might a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, leading to potential economic instability, impact digital assets? Arguments for Crypto as a Safe Haven: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate outside the traditional financial system, making them less susceptible to direct governmental policy changes or the stability of a single nation’s economy. Inflation Hedge: If widespread tariffs lead to significant inflation and devalue fiat currencies, some argue that Bitcoin, with its capped supply, could act as a hedge, similar to ‘digital gold.’ Flight to Quality: In times of global economic uncertainty and traditional market volatility, investors might seek alternative assets, potentially driving demand for cryptocurrencies. Increased Adoption: If traditional banking and payment systems become more cumbersome or expensive due to trade friction, the efficiency and borderless nature of crypto transactions could gain appeal. Arguments for Crypto Volatility and Correlation: Market Correlation: Despite its decentralized nature, the crypto market has shown increasing correlation with traditional equity markets, particularly tech stocks. A downturn in global equities could drag crypto prices down. Reduced Disposable Income: If consumers face higher prices and economic hardship, discretionary spending on speculative assets like crypto might decrease. Regulatory Scrutiny: Periods of economic stress often lead to increased regulatory scrutiny across all financial sectors, including crypto, which could introduce new uncertainties. Liquidity Concerns: In a widespread market panic, even crypto could face liquidity challenges as investors rush to cash out. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Monitor Macro Trends: Pay close attention to inflation data, interest rate decisions, and global trade developments. Diversify Wisely: Consider a balanced portfolio that includes both established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside stablecoins for capital preservation. Understand Correlations: Be aware that while crypto offers diversification benefits, it’s not entirely immune to traditional market movements. Long-Term Vision: For long-term holders, short-term volatility might present accumulation opportunities. The overall impact on crypto will likely be complex, a mix of direct and indirect effects. While its decentralized nature offers a unique appeal during economic turbulence, its increasing integration into the broader financial landscape means it won’t be entirely insulated. Challenges and Opportunities: Navigating the New Economic Landscape The potential implementation of blanket tariffs presents a dual landscape of significant challenges and emerging opportunities. The challenges are clear: increased inflation, supply chain disruptions, potential trade wars, and market volatility. Businesses will need to adapt quickly, re-evaluating sourcing strategies and potentially absorbing higher costs or passing them to consumers. However, opportunities may also arise. Domestic industries could experience a resurgence, leading to job creation in specific sectors. Innovation in supply chain management and logistics might accelerate. For the crypto world, this could be a moment for digital assets to prove their mettle as alternative stores of value or efficient cross-border payment mechanisms, especially if traditional systems face increased friction. The necessity of finding new ways to transact and store value, free from geopolitical pressures, could accelerate mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. Conclusion: Preparing for an Unpredictable Future The prospect of new Trump tariffs of 15% or 20% on imports looms large, promising to reshape the economic landscape in profound ways. From consumer prices and corporate profits to the intricate dance of global trade , the economic impact will be felt across every sector. While traditional markets brace for volatility and uncertainty, the cryptocurrency market stands at a crossroads, potentially offering a decentralized alternative or facing its own set of challenges amidst the broader economic shifts. Vigilance, adaptability, and a deep understanding of these evolving dynamics will be crucial for navigating what promises to be an unpredictable future.

2025-07-11T09:45:48,"Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: How High Will BTC Price Go?","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: How High Will BTC Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Bitcoin is currently trading at: $ 118,490.17051568 Predictions suggest BTC could reach $175K in 2025. Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is becoming aggressively bullish as in the year’s second half, July, a new ATH has been marked, smashing previous all-time highs of $112K . As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop, as it has entered a price discovery mode. This optimism has been directly fueled by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , skyrocketing institutional adoption , much clearer regulations, and unwavering political support from figures like President Trump. It’s now seen as “a hedge against inflation” more than ever, and the cryptocurrency is capturing global attention. Major players like MicroStrategy , Metaplanet , Trump Media , and several other entities are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. With the Federal Reserve hinting at future rate cuts and market enthusiasm at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $110,660.75 and $118,856.47 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin’s performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader. Iran’s defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 The Bitcoin price performance in July 2025 has been nothing short of impressive. Since the final week of June, Bitcoin has broken free from its consolidation zone, fueled by a combination of whale accumulation, increased spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On-chain data reveals a sharp increase in whale transactions especially in the $100K+ and $1M+ brackets. Spot volume also hit a 3-month high, indicating heightened market participation. These catalysts combined helped the BTC price to break above the $110,000 resistance, enter price discovery, and establish a new all-time high at $118,340. However, following a ceasefire announcement on June 23, Bitcoin rebounded quickly, signaling strong buy-the-dip behavior among investors, and now its course has once again aimed north. Also, dormant wallets coming back online also suggest broader ecosystem confidence. These older addresses that were left untouched for years HAVE recently reactivated during the current rally, pointing toward stronger belief in long-term price potential. From a technical perspective, BTC now eyes the psychological milestone of $120,000. Should the price maintain upward momentum, this level may be tested before the end of the month. However, any short-term pullback would make $110,000 a crucial support to hold. A drop below this level may validate a false breakout, potentially dragging BTC back to the $101,000 swing low support zone and final defense line stays near the $95,000 mark. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-11T09:42:11,"Peter Schiff Urges Bitcoin Holders to Sell and Buy Silver","Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff is once again sounding the alarm, telling investors to sell Bitcoin (BTC) and purchase silver. These comments come as the flagship cryptocurrency surged past $118,000, achieving a new all-time high. Schiff’s Comments In a July 10 post on X, Schiff urged BTC holders to cash in their stash and turn to silver before the metal’s next upward price movement. “With Bitcoin hitting new highs today (in dollars), it’s a great time to sell some and buy silver ahead of silver’s next big leg up,” he said. The leading crypto asset by market cap saw its price hit $118,254, marking yet another record high in 2025. Following this, the economist explained that BTC can easily crash while silver offers a more stable and undervalued alternative. He further compared the two assets, stating that silver was trading back above $37 and up almost 2% on the day, while BTC’s new high is speculative and overextended. The precious metals proponent emphasized that silver mining stocks remain underpriced despite the upward movement, suggesting the market hasn’t yet factored in their momentum. According to him, once silver breaks past the $40 level, it could accelerate quickly toward $50. He also thinks that mining stocks would catch up once this happens. Despite his warnings, BTC is still ahead of silver in terms of market value. It currently ranks sixth among global assets with a market cap of $2.20 trillion, just ahead of Google, with silver coming in at $2.007 trillion. The digital asset’s price has also continued to rally, driven by strong ETF inflows, growing corporate adoption by crypto-focused treasury firms, and an increasingly supportive regulatory environment. Crypto Community Remains Unconvinced Crypto supporters were quick to respond to Schiff’s latest commentary, with most not buying what he was selling. Their responses to his X post ranged from people asserting they would not dispose of their BTC for silver to others referencing the apparent folly of his previous remarks. One X user highlighted how the gold bug’s sentiment had gone from “Bitcoin will never hit 100k” to “even if Bitcoin keeps rising for a while…” Others pointed out the flaw in his logic, claiming that the cryptocurrency had clearly outperformed the metal. It’s not the first time Schiff has fired broadsides at Bitcoin. In the past, he has advised traders to sell all of their BTC in favor of gold mining stocks, claiming that it is a risky asset. The financial commentator is an invested critic of the digital asset, often calling it speculative and without intrinsic value, while asserting that it will collapse someday if a major economic crisis hits The post Peter Schiff Urges Bitcoin Holders to Sell and Buy Silver appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/peter-schiff-urges-bitcoin-holders-to-sell-and-buy-silver/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|MINING|FIAT","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Peter Schiff",cryptocompare

ETFs acquired $5.2 billion in Bitcoin over the past 30 days amid supply constraints. Hougan says breaking free from the $100K range has set Bitcoin up for new price discovery. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has projected Bitcoin will surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025. He has cited massive institutional demand meeting limited token supply as the primary catalyst. Hougan’s forecast arrives as Bitcoin sets a new all-time high of $118,403, surpassing previous resistance levels. Hougan attributes the current price surge to unrelenting demand from corporate buyers and exchange-traded funds rather than correlation with technology stocks or political developments. ETF data supports Hougan’s thesis with $5.2 billion in Bitcoin acquisitions over the past 30 days. This shows substantial institutional commitment to cryptocurrency exposure. These purchases by regulated investment vehicles signal mainstream financial acceptance and create persistent buying pressure.

2025-07-11T09:31:43,"Bitcoin (BTC) Surges to $118,400: How High Can the Price Climb?","The surge out of Bitcoin’s bull flag is happening. So far the price has been as high as $118,400. This may well be surpassed on Friday. Just how high can this rocketship go? S&P 500 about to break back into the long-term ascending channel? Source: TradingView At the same time that Bitcoin is bursting higher, the US stock market is paving the way. The best way to view this is via the S&P 500. After the big dip caused by the Trump tariffs, the v-shaped recovery has been nothing short of sensational. It might be today, or it could be next week, but the index looks as though it can climb back into the ascending channel which has been in force since early 2023. This is good news for $BTC given that a climbing US stock market usually coincides with similar price action for Bitcoin. Current upside pause just temporary? Source: TradingView After breaking out of the bull flag and faking out the first time, and threatening to do so a second time, the $BTC price suddenly shot skyward and reached and surpassed the all-time high at $112,000. A short period of consolidation followed in the form of a flag pennant. However, this soon broke out, and another $7,000 was soon added to the price as it hit more than $118,000. Since then, there has been a slight retracement into the $117,000s, but this does look temporary, and the price could start to spike yet again at some point during Friday. $130,000 is not out of the realms of possibility. It does need to be borne in mind that sooner or later, this upward spike will need to start calming down, and it would be healthy for the price to go sideways and perhaps down for a more extended period of time, giving the momentum indicators time to reset, as they are quite overbought now. At what point this might start to happen is unsure at this stage, and there is the possibility of more upside before gravity begins to take effect. Potential downside price targets Source: TradingView While more upside price action is probably favourite right now, it is good to look at the possibilities for potential downside. Drawing in the Fibonacci extension levels for this move, it can be seen that the deepest retracement that could be reasonably expected is to the 0.618 level. This coincides with the top corner of the bull flag, making it a good support level. It can be seen that up to now, the 0.236, the most shallow Fibonacci level, is acting as good support. At the bottom of this daily chart, the RSI indicator line has just crossed into overbought territory above 70.00. That said, it will need to get above 78.60 in order to avoid bearish divergence on this time frame. Bearish divergence needs to be annulled on weekly time frame Source: TradingView More importantly, on the weekly time frame, the indicator line for the RSI can be seen to be approaching the descending trendline (bottom of chart). This looks tricky for the bulls, and could be a rejection point. If it does break through, it will need to confirm, and then get above 88.40 in order to fully annul bearish divergence on this weekly time frame.

2025-07-11T09:15:23,"Bitcoin Primed for the Next Major Parabolic Advance, Says Crypto Analyst Kevin Svenson – Here Are His Targets","Analyst and trader Kevin Svenson believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) is primed to go higher as the flagship crypto asset sits just a few basis points below the all-time high. Svenson tells his 83,400 YouTube subscribers that whenever the S&P 500 index hits a new all-time high, Bitcoin tends to follow suit. The S&P 500 index reached a record high of 6,333 points earlier this week. “Bitcoin is now ready to play out the next major parabolic advance, the next phase of the parabolic trend… …And if the S&P is stable or trending into new all-time highs, then that will allow Bitcoin to also do the same. It gives speculators confidence to speculate into a new all-time high for Bitcoin.” After breaking out above the current all-time high of just under $112,000, Svenson says the first major target for Bitcoin is the $120,500 level. The analyst says Bitcoin could then pull back before initiating a parabolic rally. “If you take a look at the current weekly chart for Bitcoin with the parabolic trend diagram overlaid onto it, you’ll see that we are setting up for the next major parabolic advance. The next major push towards $140,000 to $150,000 is what the textbook suggests. And this could probably take months, many, many months of, you know, movement to get there.” Bitcoin is trading at $110,936 at time of writing, less than one percentage point below the all-time high of $111,814 reached in May. ?

The established four-year crypto capital rotation has escalated in the past few weeks, as observed in the notable cash inflows to the U.S. spot Ether ETFs amid rising demand for altcoins by institutional investors. Furthermore, more than a dozen spot altcoin ETFs are awaiting final decision from the U.S. SEC. As a result of the rising demand for altcoins, the TOTAL3 market cap, which excludes Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin, has broken out of a falling logarithmic trend established year-to-date (YTD).

2025-07-11T09:00:12,"Shanghai regulator eyes a yuan-based stablecoin","Crypto might still be banned in mainland China, but signs are emerging that the world’s second-largest economy isn’t staying on the sidelines forever. A Shanghai regulator reportedly held a rare meeting on stablecoins and digital currencies. This comes in when the digital assets market is rallying high, printing green indexes all around. The cumulative crypto market cap surged by almost 6% over the last day to hit $3.67 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume has now breached $230 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) made a huge comeback to mark a fresh all-time high of $118,400. Shanghai eyes stablecoins According to the report, a post on the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission’s official WeChat mentioned that the Thursday meeting brought together 60-70 officials and experts, including policy voices from Guotai Haitong Securities who presented global stablecoin developments and offered strategic policy suggestions. It is a move that marks a subtle but notable shift in tone for a country that outlawed crypto trading and mining back in 2021. The city of Shanghai is China’s financial nerve center and a frequent testing ground for pilot reforms. It added that the meeting stopped short of endorsing any change in crypto rules. However, regulator He Qing highlighted the need for “greater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies.” This approach would have been inconceivable even a year ago. Chinese tech giants like JD.com and Ant Group are reportedly preparing applications to issue yuan-backed stablecoins via Hong Kong. The landmark legislation for stablecoin licensing is expected to go live on August 1. That move is seen as a key part of Hong Kong’s effort to reposition itself as Asia’s digital asset capital. Meanwhile, the mainland’s crypto watchdogs aren’t dropping their guard. The Beijing Internet Finance Association issued a stern warning on Wednesday against stablecoin scams and unlicensed fundraising schemes. The watchdog flagged buzzwords like “DeFi,” “Web3” and “stablecoins” as red flags. They are accusing bad actors of mimicking Ponzi models to lure retail investors. “These activities can easily evolve into crimes such as illegal fundraising, financial fraud, and money laundering,” the group said. Dollar rules stablecoins Pressure is still mounting as the US dollar accounts for more than 99% global stablecoin market. However, some Chinese policymakers are increasingly uneasy about ceding control of digital trade rails to American currency-backed tokens. For exporters across China’s southern provinces, dollar stablecoins like USDT and USDC have already become a shadow settlement layer for international deals. The renminbi makes up less than 3% of global cross-border flows. A Hong Kong-issued RMB stablecoin could be Beijing’s answer to breaking the dollar’s monopoly. If green-lit, such a product would allow offshore users to transact in digital RMB tokens without the underlying currency ever leaving China. It’s a workaround that protects Beijing’s regulatory firewall while offering an alternative to the dollar. Data shows that the global stablecoin market cap stood around $262.56 billion on Friday. Tether’s USDT is leading the category with a cap of $160 billion while Circle’s USDC holds a cap of $62.8 billion. DAI is another major stablecoin in the tally with a circulation of 5.36 billion. Running the wave up, Bitcoin price surged by 6% in the last 24 hours. BTC posted a fresh ATH of above $118,400 before crawling back to the $117K zone. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 93% to hit $117.7 billion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The spot Ethereum ETF has now seen a total of $6.1 billion in inflows, and is way ahead of its eight competitors. Additionally, it was the second-best day for aggregate inflows for the products since they launched with $383 million or 129,500 ETH. We have a *new* daily inflow record for iShares Ethereum ETF… $300+mil. 2nd best day for spot eth ETFs overall since July 2024 launch. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 11, 2025 Institutional Interest in Ethereum BlackRock’s ETHA fund posted record volume over the last two days, with over $800 million each day, which is four times the average, reported Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas. “Given the price is also up, probably see some chunky flows next couple of days,” he added . Almost $900 million has entered Ethereum ETFs in just six trading days so far this month, according to Farside Investors. In total, there have been more than $5 billion in inflows since launch, despite Grayscale’s fund hemorrhaging $4.2 billion. BREAKING: ETHEREUM ETFs HAS BOUGHT 129.5K ETH WORTH $383.1 MILLION. WE ARE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/79KMoQenjV — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 11, 2025 Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also been on a roll with a whopping $1.17 billion in aggregate inflows on Thursday, the largest inflow day since early November and the second best since launch. The lion’s share went into BlackRock’s fund as usual, which saw $448.5 million in inflows, bringing its total inflow to a staggering $53.4 billion. It was a “huge volume day for IBIT,” said Balchunas, observing twice the average volume of $5 billion. “When IBIT sees big volume surges on up price days, it portends big boy flows,” he added, stating that there is a good chance that they’ll reach $1 billion over the next day or so. Financial advisors, who control an enormous amount of money, have barely even begun allocating to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, said Nate Geraci before adding: “Major platforms such as Vanguard are still gatekeeping these ETFs (which is laughable IMO). And we’re still seeing near-record inflows.” ETH Reaches $3,000 Ethereum has finally broken out of its multi-month sideways channel in a push towards the psychological $3,000 price level, reaching $3,005 at the time of writing. It is the first time the asset has been over $3,000 since early February. ETH has surged 8% on the day following a week of bullish news regarding corporate treasury adoption and stablecoin foundations for the asset.

2025-07-11T08:49:35,"Bitcoin Short-Sellers Crushed as Price Hits New ATH","Bitcoin short-sellers faced a brutal shakeout on Thursday as the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged to fresh all-time highs, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. According to CoinGlass data , crypto markets saw $1.01 billion in short positions liquidated. This included around $570 million in Bitcoin shorts and nearly $207 million in Ether shorts, as Bitcoin hit $116,500 and Ether touched $2,990 on Thursday. The surge marks Bitcoin’s second consecutive day of setting new records, with Wednesday’s peak at $112,000 being swiftly surpassed. The rally lifted the total crypto market capitalization by 6% over the past day to $3.68 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Traders React to the Massive Short Squeeze The swift upward move caught many in the market off guard. “Bears in disbelief,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher posted on X, while trader Daan Crypto Trades described the price surge as a “MASSIVE Short squeeze on BTC & ETH.” Velo, another market commentator, highlighted the scale of the liquidations, noting, “Lots of emails are being sent.” This liquidation event, while significant, was smaller than the one recorded on February 3, when over $2.24 billion in positions were wiped out amid fears of a global trade war following import tariff announcements by US President Donald Trump. Despite these past shakeouts, Thursday’s squeeze was notable for the speed at which Bitcoin moved past its previous record levels. Split Sentiment Before the Breakout Earlier in the week, analysts were divided on Bitcoin’s near-term potential to break new highs. Bitfinex analysts noted on Tuesday that BTC was showing a “lack of follow-through strength,” with bulls appearing hesitant without a clear macro catalyst, as the asset hovered around $108,500. Their report stated that traders were waiting for fresh momentum before pushing the price significantly higher. However, others, including MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, were more optimistic. “The inevitable breakout to an ATH on Bitcoin might even happen during the upcoming week,” van de Poppe predicted on June 30. For now, market participants are watching closely to see if BTC can hold above its new highs or push further. If Bitcoin retraces to Wednesday’s level of $112,000 , around $2.11 billion in long positions could be at risk of liquidation, adding another layer of tension as traders recalibrate in the face of BTC’s latest historic climb.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, led the move by setting a record. Ethereum and the other top altcoins returned notable profits in an upsurge that resembles the beginning of another bull run.

2025-07-11T08:41:10,"A Night of Records for Bitcoin! All-Time High Broken Again! What's the Target? Here Are the Details","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its rally for a second day, hitting an all-time high of $118,000. Investors in the options market are also eyeing even higher prices. Bitcoin Reaches $118,000, Options Market Focuses on $120,000 Target Open interest on the Deribit exchange is concentrated around call options at $115,000 and $120,000, while interest has also increased in long-term options due September 2025 and December 2025. These options have target prices of $140,000 and $150,000. According to data platform CoinGlass, $543 million worth of short positions were liquidated in the last hour alone, bringing the total liquidation in the last 12 hours to $762 million. Experts attribute this rise to institutional demand and positive market sentiment. Favorable funding rates in perpetual futures contracts are supporting the rise in investor sentiment. This upward trend coincides with developments such as the “Crypto Week” held in the US and many companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. Bitcoin's rally above $116,000 continues the dramatic price cycles the asset has undergone since 2009. What's notable, however, is that volatility has begun to decrease over time. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced at least four major bear markets, with average declines of 45%—similar to the price movements experienced by the Nasdaq after the Dotcom bubble in the early 2000s. The most notable decline occurred in December 2017. The price of Bitcoin fell 25% in a single day, from $20,000 to $11,500, before recovering to $12,800 by evening. However, each cycle has created higher price floors, from a low of $0.30 in 2011 to a high of over $3,000 since 2018, suggesting growing long-term confidence in Bitcoin among institutional investors. While the recent $116,000 breakout, coupled with $543 million in short liquidations, suggests the market is still vulnerable to high momentum moves, it also signals that Bitcoin is becoming a more mature and resilient asset. Bitcoin's new high is a result of growing interest not only from retail investors but also from institutional investors. According to a Coinbase survey, one-third of 250 institutional investors increased their crypto holdings in 2023, with over 60% planning to increase their holdings further in the next three years. According to research by KPMG, 50% of financial services companies now offer crypto products, with corporate crypto exposure rising from 31% in 2021 to 40% in 2023. This surge of demand is being fueled by regulated investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Such products were unavailable in previous bull cycles. This makes it easier for institutional investors, especially those with long-term investment intentions, to enter the market. Furthermore, the fact that “companies with crypto treasures” are becoming Bitcoin-indexed financial instruments by offering their shares or bonds to investors is a development parallel to corporate strategies emphasized by institutions such as EY and Fidelity. *This is not investment advice.

As XRP headlines stir up waves of uncertainty across the market, Bitcoin Solaris has fired back with one of the boldest moves in its presale journey. A 72-hour price rollback. That’s right. In a market where most coins are fumbling for direction, BTC-S just handed investors a second chance at early-stage pricing. And the timing? Surgical. XRP Rattles, But Bitcoin Solaris Roars XRP, long the topic of legal suspense and speculative optimism, finds itself in another round of media whirlwinds. The token’s reputation for fast remittances remains intact, but the rollercoaster of court updates has exhausted even its most loyal backers. While XRP’s community waits for clarity, Bitcoin Solaris is delivering action. And that’s why many are pivoting. Meet Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Engine Gaining Steam Bitcoin Solaris is not trying to outpace XRP in legal finesse. It’s sprinting toward actual usability and investor upside. The project is building a next-generation blockchain that doesn’t just promise scale, it achieves it. This isn’t another clone. BTC-S is packing serious tech: Dual-layer architecture with Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake. Blazing 10,000 TPS performance with sub-2-second finality. The upcoming Solaris Nova app is for mobile-first mining accessibility. Energy efficiency slashes power consumption by over 99 percent compared to Bitcoin. And while these are big headlines, the real story is how it translates to personal wealth creation. The mining model alone, through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, has already attracted thousands of early participants. It’s simple, adaptive, and engineered for mobile use with energy-smart algorithms that scale according to device strength. One visit to the Bitcoin Solaris mining calculator shows just how powerful this shift is for regular users. The 72-Hour Rollback: One Rare Window Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 11 of its presale. The current price? $11 per token. The launch price? $20. That’s a projected 150 percent return at minimum, assuming no post-launch upside. But for the next 72 hours, Bitcoin Solaris is initiating a Price Rollback. The token will temporarily return to $5. Not a discount. Not a bonus. A true rollback to early pricing, and only for those jumping in now. BTC-S Slashes Its Price Back to $5. Phase 11 Just Flipped the Game This move isn’t just rare. It’s almost unheard of at this stage of a presale, especially when the momentum is already building. And with over 14,150 users already onboard and more than $6.6 million raised, the window is narrow. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using wallets like Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. Buzz From the Crypto World Crypto YouTube is lighting up with reactions to Bitcoin Solaris. Several major influencers have already dropped full breakdowns on why this project could become the next big wealth creation engine. The detailed review by Crypto Show dives into how the technical architecture gives BTC-S a leg up over most L1 competitors. Crypto League called it “the smartest token rollout of the year.” Crypto Vlog focused on the Price Rollback, calling it the most aggressive reward window in recent presale history. The sentiment is spreading across platforms, with Telegram and X communities exploding in real time. Join the conversation on Telegram or follow updates on X . Security, Audits, and Peace of Mind It’s not just hype. Bitcoin Solaris has gone the distance in ensuring credibility. The project has undergone smart contract audits by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , adding another layer of investor confidence. The code is clean, secure, and fully transparent, built to last and adapt. Community-Grown Rewards: The Referral Angle Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just rewarding early adopters through price. It’s doubling down on community through its Double Rewards Referral Program . Referrers earn 5 percent commissions in BTC-S. Referred buyers get 5 percent extra tokens added to their purchase. Everything is automated and credited directly into presale accounts. This structure creates a shared win between participants and helps drive natural growth without artificial incentives. Final Verdict As XRP wrestles with headlines and legal clarity, Bitcoin Solaris is doing something far more potent. It’s a building. It’s expanding. And for the next 72 hours, it’s giving investors a rare shot at early pricing before a major exchange debut. The price rollback is not just a flash deal. It’s a signal. The market is watching. And Bitcoin Solaris is ready to lead.

The Smarter Web Company, a London-listed Bitcoin treasury company, announced on July 11 the purchase of an additional 275 Bitcoin ( BTC ). The recent acquisition was made at an average price of £79,563 ($108,182) per BTC, totaling approximately £21.88 million. With this purchase, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings have risen to 1,275 BTC, acquired at an average price of £78,516 ($106,719) per BTC, with a total investment of about £100.1 million. This latest purchase follows the company’s July 7 acquisition of 226.42 BTC, which pushed its total holdings to 1,000 BTC , marking a major milestone in its treasury strategy. At that point, the firm reported a year-to-date BTC yield of 26,242%. With the latest addition of 275 BTC, that figure has now climbed to 31,263%, as Bitcoin itself hits a new all-time high of $118,000 , with further upside momentum expected. Additionally, The Smarter Web Company reported a 30-day BTC yield of 497% and confirmed that it has roughly £31 million in cash reserves available for further Bitcoin purchases.

In April this year, the company also adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy and has since actively deployed surplus cash into Bitcoin on a rolling basis, using BTC yield to measure accretive value for shareholders. Through its “10 Year Plan,” the company aims to steadily accumulate BTC as both a hedge against currency debasement and a potential growth asset. The move comes amid growing adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, with more European firms following suit.

The research, “BTC Treasuries Uncovered: Premiums, Leverage, and the Sustainability of Proxy Exposure,” dissects the capital structures, market impact, and debt profiles of the fast-growing cohort of “Bitcoin Treasury Companies” (BTC-TCs), led by Strategy (the renamed MicroStrategy). The Impact Of Bitcoin Treasury Firms Harvey and Clemente open with a startling figure: “Bitcoin Treasury Companies have accumulated around 725,000 BTC, equivalent to 3.64 percent of the entire BTC supply.” Much of that hoard sits with Strategy’s 597,000-coin trove, but the analysts track more than a dozen follow-on players—from Marathon Digital and Metaplanet to newer entrants such as Twenty One Capital—whose combined exposure now outstrips US spot-ETF holdings by more than half. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Yet the report’s headline forecast is explicitly conditional. Keyrock’s bull case assigns a thirty-percent probability that global liquidity remains flush, institutional demand accelerates, and Bitcoin rallies fifty percent past today’s levels, “pushing BTC to over $160 k by EOY.” That outcome rests on the fragile flywheel of net-asset-value premiums: BTC-TC equities still trade, on average, at a seventy-three-percent premium to the dollar value of the coins they custody. Those premiums let boards issue new shares “accretively,” convert sentiment into fresh BTC, and—crucially—service the $33.7 billion in debt and preferred stock the sector has rung up to fund its buying binge. No company illustrates the reflexive loop better than Strategy. Since August 2020, Michael Saylor has driven Bitcoin-per-share (BPS) up eleven-fold, an annualized sixty-three-percent run rate that dwarfs the 6.7 percent CAGR needed to justify the firm’s current ninety-one-percent NAV premium. “If an investor believes that Strategy’s BPS growth rates will hold long-term,” the authors contend, “holding MSTR would be far more beneficial in BTC terms than holding spot BTC.” Still, that calculus assumes the equity premium stays afloat; if sentiment turns, dilution flips from accretive to punitive overnight. Debt maturities pose the next stress point. BTC-TCs owe a wall of convertible notes in 2027-28. Harvey and Clemente calculate that Strategy alone has issued $8.2 billion of the cohort’s $9.5 billion in debt; Marathon follows at $1.3 billion. Most instruments carry zero-to-low coupons and conversion prices well below current share levels, but a deep Bitcoin drawdown could drive equities under those strikes, forcing firms to repay in cash or refinance at far harsher terms. “Since many BTC-TC valuations are tightly correlated to Bitcoin price performance,” the authors warn, “a sharp BTC drawdown could drive down equity value, increasing the risk that conversion thresholds are breached.” Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? The report splits the universe into cash-flow-generative names such as Metaplanet, CoinShares, and Boyaa Interactive—each with eight or more quarters of runway—and capital-dependent players like Marathon, Nakamoto, and DeFi Technologies, which could face dilution above three percent per quarter merely to stay solvent if premiums persist. Should those premiums compress, equity issuance “becomes purely dilutive,” and treasury companies could be forced to sell Bitcoin, undermining the proxy thesis that justifies their existence. The Base Case Keyrock’s base case, to which it assigns the highest probability, envisions Bitcoin finishing 2025 around $135,000, with NAV premiums cooling into a thirty-to-sixty-percent range. In that environment, well-managed treasuries still out-perform spot, but the leverage trade loses its shine. The bear scenario—assigned the lowest but non-trivial odds—combines a twenty-percent Bitcoin drawdown with a glut of new treasury listings that flood the market with supply. In that world, premiums vanish, refinancing windows slam shut, and “the entire investment case for BTC-TCs comes under pressure.” Harvey and Clemente do not dismiss the BTC-TC model; rather, they frame it as a high-beta overlay that amplifies both the upside and the solvency risk inherent in Bitcoin itself. They credit Saylor’s “Bitcoin yield” thesis—using premium-funded share issuance to compound coin holdings—as a demonstrably effective strategy to date, but caution that it relies on a delicate equilibrium of bullish sentiment, cheap capital, and meticulous execution. “The premium to NAV is of the utmost importance here,” the study concludes, “assuming a BTC-TC doesn’t have a core operating business that can cover debt payments, or is entirely free of debt payments altogether.” Whether Bitcoin can sprint to $160,000 by 31 December hinges less on hash-rate projections or macro modeling than on the continued faith of equity investors willing to pay a dollar-fifty for a dollar of embedded BTC. If those investors blink—if premiums fade or convertible maturities collide with a broad risk-off shift—the leverage that has propelled treasury companies to date could flip, turning “one of the best performing equities on the planet” into the market’s most crowded exit. For now, Keyrock’s research leaves readers with a simple countdown: hold the line, and the path to price discovery remains intact; lose it, and the proxy trade could unwind long before the New Year’s fireworks. At press time, BTC traded at $117,788.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, Robinhood’s U.S. staking launch continues to push Solana. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $163.62 with an intraday gain of 3.5%.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. With the $166.56 resistance now tested, SOL could trend higher if momentum holds. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-11T08:29:39,"Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Sells $6.5M Coinbase and $5.8M Robinhood Amid Bitcoin Rally","Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sold $6.5 million worth of Coinbase Global shares and $5.8 million of Robinhood shares on Thursday, even as both stocks rose alongside bitcoin’s recent surge. Key Takeaways: Ark Invest sold $6.5 million of Coinbase and $5.8 million of Robinhood shares despite both stocks rising. Coinbase and Robinhood stocks rallied alongside bitcoin reaching a new high above $118,000. Robinhood faces regulatory scrutiny in the US amid plans to launch blockchain-based stock tokens in Europe. According to Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) filings , the fund offloaded 16,627 Coinbase shares and 58,504 Robinhood shares. It also sold roughly $1.7 million in Block Inc. stock. Coinbase’s stock climbed 4% to close at $388.96, while Robinhood gained 4.4%, finishing at $98.70. Block’s shares slipped 0.36% to $68.76. Coinbase and Robinhood Stocks Rise as Bitcoin Hits $118K The rally in Coinbase and Robinhood stocks came amid bitcoin reaching new all-time highs, hitting $118,080 early Friday — up 6.4% in 24 hours. Ethereum also jumped 8.5% to $3,011. Coinbase recently announced a partnership with Perplexity AI, an AI-driven search engine, to launch a real-time crypto data service. The move represents a growing trend of collaboration between blockchain firms and artificial intelligence companies. Meanwhile, Robinhood is engaged in discussions with European regulators regarding its tokenization initiative, which aims to offer blockchain-based stock tokens. BREAKING: Ark Invest just trimmed its crypto-related holdings! Amidst a booming crypto market, Cathie Wood's firm sold $6.5M in Coinbase ($COIN) & $5.8M in Robinhood ($HOOD) shares. Are they taking profits or rebalancing? — Chenna kesavan (@kesavantcm) July 11, 2025 However, Robinhood faces scrutiny in the U.S., as Florida’s attorney general opened an investigation into the company’s crypto division over claims it marketed itself as the “least expensive way to purchase crypto.” So far, ARK is the only major Circle investor to significantly reduce exposure post-IPO. As reported, ARK Invest begun cashing in on its stake in stablecoin issuer Circle just 11 days after the company’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The firm sold 342,658 shares of Circle (CRCL) on June 16 and another $44.7 million worth on June 17 , according to trade disclosures. Other backers, including BlackRock, reportedly eyeing a 10% stake in the company, have not disclosed any sales. Executives at Circle, however, have sold portions of their holdings. CEO Jeremy Allaire, co-founder Sean Neville, and CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen were listed in the prospectus as planning to sell 8%, 11%, and 11% of their holdings, respectively. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Drive Record Inflows Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded their second-largest daily inflow of $1.18 billion on July 10, driving Bitcoin’s price to a new high of $116,664 before briefly surpassing $118,450. The cumulative net inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs have now exceeded $51 billion, underscoring strong and sustained institutional demand. Seven out of 12 Bitcoin funds reported net inflows on the same day, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading at $448.49 million and Fidelity’s FBTC following closely with $324.34 million. Ethereum spot ETFs also posted significant inflows, totaling $383 million, marking their second-highest daily record. Ether ETFs have accumulated $5.10 billion in total net inflows so far. E Crypto analyst Rachael Lucas described this trend as a “defining moment” in the institutional adoption of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. She emphasized that the influx of capital is driven by asset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth platforms, not retail speculation, signaling a more mature and sustained phase of crypto investment.

2025-07-11T08:26:26,"AI Forecasts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for July 31, 2025","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most popular digital assets, has continued to gain attention in the cryptocurrency market. With SHIB currently trading at $0.00001354, reflecting a 14.99% increase from last week, market participants are increasingly curious about its future trajectory. To address this curiosity, we asked ChatGPT for a prediction of SHIB’s price by July 31, and the AI-powered Large Language Model (LLM) gave a detailed breakdown with optimistic projections. Projected Price Range and Most Likely Scenario According to ChatGPT, SHIB’s price by late July 2025 is projected to fall within a range of $0.0000145 to $0.0000350. The model identifies a most likely price point of $0.0000217, representing a moderate bullish case. Although this target is lower than Google Gemini’s recent forecast , its upper boundary suggests it could surpass Gemini’s target. ChatGPT explains, “This assumes SHIB continues its steady burn mechanisms , utility improvements (like Shibarium adoption), and Bitcoin leading a mild bull run in mid‑2025.” The upper boundary of the range ($0.0000350) reflects an optimistic scenario where the SHIB ecosystem achieves greater adoption and benefits from a broader altcoin rally. Conversely, the lower boundary ($0.0000145) represents a more conservative outcome, assuming limited ecosystem progress and muted market conditions. However, ChatGPT expects growth despite the outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Factors Supporting the Forecast The forecast is based on three key factors: token supply reduction, market cycle trends, and utility expansion. First, ChatGPT highlights SHIB’s ongoing burn initiatives, noting that “By mid‑2025, SHIB’s burn rate could eliminate tens of trillions of tokens if Shibarium and community burns stay consistent.” Shiba Inu recently unveiled a new mode in its Shiba Eternity game that could accelerate burns even more. However, ChatGPT cautions that burning tokens alone may not trigger extreme price movements without concurrent demand growth. Second, the timing of the next market cycle is expected to play a role. Crypto markets historically experience bullish trends following Bitcoin’s halving events. 2025 is the post-halving year, which is historically bullish for altcoins, and SHIB could ride this wave to higher targets. Third, potential utility expansion within the SHIB ecosystem could influence prices. Developments such as Shibarium, which recently hit a milestone record , the SHIB Metaverse, SHIB’s AI initiatives, and broader payment use cases are seen as catalysts for additional demand.

2025-07-11T08:17:54,"Short liquidations hit $1 billion as Bitcoin trades at $118k","Short liquidations reached over $1B as BTC charted new records above $118,000. For the year to date, this is the biggest short liquidation event, mostly affecting BTC and ETH markets. The most recent price action for BTC liquidated short positions accrued all the way to $118,000. In the past 24 hours, BTC short liquidations reached 655.46M, with remaining short liquidity all the way to $118,800. The new price record expanded the year-on-year growth, as BTC spent July 2024 with sideways trading, at around $55,000. Most of the liquidations happened late on July 10, during US trading hours. In general, traders remained more cautious in 2025, rarely causing significant liquidations. The recent rally remained mostly unaffected by the weekly options expiry on Deribit, as the contracts expired under current market prices. Short liquidations reached the highest level for 2025, with a significant batch liquidated at the $112,000 level late on Thursday. | Source: CoinGlass . The current levels of over $1B in 24 hours are an anomaly, mostly tied to the exuberant market move for BTC. Short liquidations reached over $965M, while long liquidations reached just 10% of the total. The biggest single wallet liquidation was for $88.55M on HTX. The near-vertical rally was also caused by a batch of 5,000 BTC getting liquidated on Binance. One of the big waves of liquidations happened as BTC decisively breached the previous all-time high above $112,000, liquidating up to $340M. Above those levels, traders are yet to allocate liquidity, and a short squeeze to $120,000 becomes less probable. BTC traders are rebuilding liquidity rapidly despite the liquidations, with derivative open interest back to $38B . Futures volumes for BTC remained above $59B in the past 24 hours, once again getting ahead of Ethereum (ETH) activity . BTC dominance remains near its 2021 levels at 62.6%, still getting more attention than ETH. At the same time, ETH managed to recover the $3,000 level, with $258M in short liquidations for the past 24 hours. BTC rally causes top whale liquidations For some traders, the BTC rally was nearing its end, and some of the high-profile traders reopened short positions. Both James Wynn and @qwatio , two of the most watched whales, set up short positions just before the rally. Wynn got liquidated for a small 40X leveraged short on BTC, as the leading coin did not backtrack from its peak levels. James Wynn Again 🚨 @JamesWynnReal LIQUIDATED Again , He Deposite $27,555 $USDC into Hyperliquid And Claimed $3960 Referral Reward, then went all in with 40X $BTC short Position, The Position Got fully LIQUIDATED right now 😓 pic.twitter.com/URGZe9LhGA — Mr.Bull🚀 (@Danameer12) July 11, 2025 The other whale, @qwatio, currently closed all perpetual futures positions. The Hyperliquid whale liquidations were mostly for show, as the positions were created shortly before the BTC rally. Wynn and @qwatio shorted BTC while the market still flashed a ‘greed’ indicator , turning the short positions into a publicity stunt. However, @qwatio has accrued real losses from attempts to short BTC in the past weeks, with overall losses of $16.72M . Leveraged trading becomes riskier as BTC remains in price discovery territory, aiming for milestone prices. For now, the trading profile has not shifted to extreme greed, as other days of market frenzy remain a possibility. The recent BTC trading and accumulation activity have mostly left retail behind, and reflect the decisions of institutions and whales. BTC is once again seen as a safe haven asset, though combined with the potential for unlimited upside and price discovery.

2025-07-11T08:03:08,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Back on Their Feet! But There's a Problem: ""A $5 Billion Options Earthquake Will Happen in BTC and ETH Today!""","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has been racing from record high to record high over the past two days. At this point, BTC surged above $118,000, while Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins also experienced significant gains. As the bullish mood in the market continues, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. According to data for the second week of July, $4.3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $710 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on July 11 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 1.05, the maximum loss point is $108,000 and the notional value is $4.3 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 1.11, a maximum loss point of $2,600, and a notional value of $710 million. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin's price following the $4.3 billion options expiration on July 11th. While the maximum pain point is at $108,000 for BTC and $2,600 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. Greeks.live analysts stated that the rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum in a short period of time points to a major bull market. Analysts said that with such a large short-term rally, the options market is still far from FOMO and institutional investors are hesitant to buy and consider the reality of the rally. “The smell of a major bull market, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and Ethereum briefly returning to the crucial $3,000 mark, is a rare improvement in market sentiment.

2025-07-11T07:59:35,"Bitcoin ETF inflows hit billions as BTC smashes new all-time highs","The crypto giant’s latest price surge is fueling a wave of demand and trading activity across U.S. spot exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows on July 10, 2025, according to SoSoValue data . The numbers marked the funds’ sixth consecutive day of positive flows and the largest single-day inflow in months, a level last seen in November 2024. Among the top performers was BlackRock’s IBIT, which once again led the charge with approximately $448.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely with $324.34 million, and Ark 21Shares with $268.7 million. Other issuers, including Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie, saw smaller inflows under $100 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC moved the opposite way, logging $40.2 million in outflows. You might also like: BlackRock fuels BTC stash with another $126M, closes in on Satoshi as ETF booms IBIT also led all 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in trading activity by a wide margin, pulling in $5 billion in volume, twice its daily average and up from $3.5 billion the day before. The strong influx of funds came alongside fresh momentum in Bitcoin’s price. On the same day, BTC ( BTC ) extended the upward trend it kicked off earlier in the week, shattering multiple all-time highs. Bitcoin’s price movement | Source: crypto.news Trading over $118,100 at the time of writing, the crypto market giant is up roughly 6.3% in the past 24 hours, sharpening positive investor sentiment. But what’s driving the surge? Why Bitcoin is climbing The bullish setup in BTC is powered by a mix of rising institutional interest and supportive macro conditions, reversing the bearish mood that earlier gripped the markets. More financial institutions are betting on Bitcoin’s long-term reserve value. Q2 saw over 159,100 BTC purchased across 125 public companies, which now collectively hold 847,000 bitcoins, worth just under $100 billion at current prices. Like the ETFs, these institutional inflows provide more stable momentum for Bitcoin’s performance than traditional rally drivers like retail interest and market hype. Macro economic backdrop is contributing to the rally. The U.S. economy is showing unexpected strength, with June nonfarm payrolls adding 147,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.1%. This data prompted traders to rethink the pace of Fed rate cuts, with odds of a July cut dropping to just 5%, down sharply from 24% earlier in the week, per CME FedWatch. Bitcoin’s rally also coincides with a rising stock market. The Dow Jones rose 270 points, or 0.61%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.28%, signaling broader risk appetite across markets. Analysts expect the current trend to continue and forecast that the combination of positive factors will establish a stronger foothold above $118K. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, the current move is likely just an “interim high,” echoing broader market predictions that see Bitcoin on a path toward $200,000.

The breakout comes as ETF inflows resume and institutional interest picks up, supported by the prospect of Federal Reserve rate cuts in Q3. Technicals now show BTC entering a high-momentum phase, with potential targets around $120,000 and beyond. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, Bitcoin price has cleanly broken out of a broad descending channel that held price action between $100,000 and $111,000. The breakout candle on July 10 came with strong body expansion and follow-through volume, confirming bullish intent. BTC has also reclaimed the 20/50 EMA cluster and is trading well above the Bull Market Support Band, currently near $109,250–$108,420.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.71819757 13.88% Market Cap $ 25,415,718,354.9745 Trading Volume $ 1,711,990,941.4710 Circulating Supply 35,388,198,743.3986 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 The Cardano price is trapped in a long bleeding range in the entire H1 2025, but showed signs of recovery in late June, triggered by the ceasefire in the Iran-Israel-US short-term war. Over the last 20 days, it has recovered nearly 22% from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the second week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.63 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF and global sentiment rising as BTC jumped beyond its June high. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. Moreover, in the past 30-day span, Spot volume has peaked at $1.44 billion, daily active addresses have increased, and addresses holding between “10 million ADA to 100 million ADA” coins have peaked at 13.13 billion from a low of 12.81 billion. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends.

2025-07-11T07:51:07,"New Bitcoin Record At $118K: On-Chain Clues Reveal This Rally Is Different","Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to a fresh all-time high above $ 118,000, after gaining more than 6% over the past day. Despite this, on-chain data suggests the current rally remains far from overheated and instead hints at further growth potential. Room for Further Growth During the previous peaks in March and December 2024, the MVRV ratio climbed above 2.7 as speculation intensified. The current high, on the other hand, comes with a more moderate reading of 2.2 and reflects a steadier market environment. According to CryptoQuant, UTXO data show that short-term holders (under one month) now make up just 15% of the market. This is down from 30% during previous highs, which indicates limited new capital inflows and a cautious investor profile. At the same time, the SOPR for short-term holders means that recent buyers are not aggressively selling, but are keeping sell-side activity muted. The Miner Position Index (MPI) also continues its downward trend, which points to restrained selling activity as many mining firms opt to accumulate Bitcoin rather than liquidate. Such behavior contrasts sharply with past cycles when rising prices led to rapid distribution as spot and derivatives traders rushed to exit. Instead, this rally appears to be backed by strategic adoption from nation-states and corporations, and therefore, suggests the possibility of a structurally different bull cycle. CryptoQuant went on to explain, “As a result, analyzing on-chain data today requires deeper and more contextual interpretation, rather than relying solely on repetitive historical patterns. Because this recent breakout to a new high occurred without signs of overheating, there is solid potential for further price appreciation in the mid-to-long term.” This pattern of cautious optimism extends further. Data reveals that even amid the price surge, traders remain hesitant to move coins back to exchanges. Traders Are Holding Tight Bitcoin has posted almost a 20% price rise since its June 22nd local bottom, yet traders are not rushing to move coins back onto exchanges, according to Santiment. Instead, holders continue to shift Bitcoin into self-custody wallets. In the past four months alone, exchange balances have dropped by 315,830 BTC, which is a 21% decline. The five-year picture is even more significant. Since July 2020, 1.88 million Bitcoin have moved away from exchanges, thereby reducing balances by 61%. With fewer coins on exchanges, sudden mass sell-offs become less likely. This means that long-term investors are choosing personal storage over potential short-term trades.

2025-07-11T07:47:50,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.60544982 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.60544982 6.34% Market cap $ 153,899,199,702.17 Circulating Supply 59,068,187,926.00 Trading Volume $ 7,568,153,702.7683 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction July In H1 2025, the XRP price action shifted from a decline to a consolidation phase. In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely, XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. Source: Tradingview On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC. Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . Meanwhile, another positive development in July reveals that Ripple has applied for a U.S. banking license , enhancing credibility. The market sentiment has shifted, and with a wave of optimism sweeping through in July, the upper border of the falling wedge has been breached near the key $2.40 resistance. This surge was fueled by strong momentum as Bitcoin crossed the $112,000 mark , reaching a new all-time high of $117,985. Also, a short-term golden cross has formed between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs in the XRP price chart, which signals robust momentum. As XRP crypto approaches mid-May’s peak, a break above $2.60 could ignite a rally toward $2.95 in the short term, with the potential to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. Source: Tradingview The recent 20-day momentum is supported by increasing investor interest and positive developments, leading to a rise in exchange outflows. Technical indicators on the XRP price chart reveal a spike in money inflows, pushing the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) value up to 0.19 from this week’s low of 0.04. Meanwhile, the MACD and Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms have turned bullish, suggesting a sustained short-term rally. However, caution is warranted as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 74, indicating overheated conditions. This suggests that XRP may need to consolidate to cool down before making another upward move in the short term. If XRP price fails to generate enough bullish momentum, it could retest the strong support at $2.40. A failure to hold above this level could lead to a flash crash, pushing XRP’s price lower. In the event that selling pressure resumes, the critical support at $2.10, which aligns with the 200-day EMA, becomes essential. Losing this support could result in a decline to $1.88 or even $1.63.
