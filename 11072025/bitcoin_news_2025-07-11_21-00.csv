2025-07-11T18:54:09,"What Was the Real Reason for the Recent Bitcoin Rally? Analytics Company Lays Out the Reasons in Depth","Cryptocurrency analysis firm QCP Capital has published a comprehensive market assessment following Bitcoin's all-time high. Pointing out that Bitcoin was traded at $118,000 this morning, the company stated that this level is an indicator of both enthusiasm in the market and structural solidity. According to QCP Capital, the primary macro driver behind the rise is the Trump administration's reintroduction of tariffs. The firm notes that manufacturers and exporters are accelerating imports, stockpiling, and increasing production ahead of the new tax period. This frontloading process has led to a significant expansion of trade and production credit. The report stated, ‚ÄúWhether Trump will delay implementation again remains uncertain. However, these cycles of threats and delays positively increase economic uncertainty. Business confidence and production indices remain in growth territory.‚Äù Related News: BREAKING: Highly Surprising Move from Coinbase - Official X Account Changes Profile Photo to Surprise Altcoin - Price Jumps This view is particularly supported by the rising price of copper, a leading indicator of industrial health. This commodity, nicknamed ‚ÄúDoctor Copper,‚Äù signals rising industrial demand and improving liquidity conditions. According to QCP Capital, the second key macro development driving Bitcoin's rise is the accelerating era of financial dominance in the US. The firm notes that economic activity continues to expand despite high interest rates. The US Treasury Department's ‚ÄúActivist Issuance Strategy,‚Äù which repurchases long-term debt by issuing short-term bonds, rebalances the debt structure and reduces interest rate volatility. This creates a more predictable environment for financial markets. ‚ÄúShort-term bonds are seen as almost cash equivalents. Limited long-term issuance keeps the MOVE index low and tightens credit risk premiums, supporting the gradual rise in financial assets,‚Äù the report said. Before labeling the market euphoria a ‚Äúbubble,‚Äù QCP Capital points out that it could actually be an indicator of mass adoption. With copper and global stock indices hitting records, it's natural that monetary hedges like gold and Bitcoin would similarly surge. The company noted that inflows into ETFs and public crypto treasuries are outpacing token supply and miner sales. Analysts believe indicators like STRK stock and SharpLink, which have absorbed ETH-related sales, suggest this structural demand is continuing. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T18:45:26,"Banks With One ‚ÄòDeficient‚Äô Rating Could Still Be Considered ‚ÄòWell Managed‚Äô Under New Federal Reserve Proposal","The U.S. Federal Reserve is mulling a rule change that would allow banks with one ‚Äúdeficient‚Äù rating to still be considered ‚Äúwell managed.‚Äù The Fed‚Äôs current large financial institution (LFI) rating framework includes three components: capital, liquidity and governance/controls, each of which has four potential ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1 and deficient-2. Currently, a single deficient-1 or deficient-2 score in any of the three components means a bank is no longer considered ‚Äúwell managed.‚Äù The Fed notes large banks must be ‚Äúwell managed‚Äù at each of their depository institutions to be treated as a financial holding company, which permits a firm to engage in a broader range of nonbanking activities like securities underwriting and dealing. Michelle W. Bowman, the Fed‚Äôs vice chair for supervision, says nearly two-thirds of the large financial holding companies under the LFI rating framework aren‚Äôt considered ‚Äúwell managed‚Äù in the current system, despite having capital and liquidity levels ‚Äúsubstantially above regulatory requirements.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is because the LFI framework currently assigns a firm‚Äôs ‚Äòwell-managed‚Äô status based on a single deficiency in any one rating component, rather than taking a complete look at the financial and managerial health of a firm. The proposal would generally require a deficiency in either a large bank holding company‚Äôs capital or liquidity ratings, in addition to a deficiency in its governance and controls, in order to be classified as not well-managed. In this way, the proposal would provide greater recognition of a firm‚Äôs overall condition in determining well-managed status.‚Äù Banks with a single ‚Äúdeficient-2‚Äù score, the more severe deficiency, would still not be considered ‚Äúwell managed‚Äù in the proposed new system. The Fed is currently asking for public input on the proposal.

2025-07-11T18:45:15,"First-ever pro-crypto U.S. administration: bummer or slowburner?","July 14, 2025, marks the beginning of Crypto Week in D.C. The event signals that the administration continues its work on regulating (and sometimes deregulating) the crypto space. The results of the first half of 2025 indicate little to no easy wins for the industry, but some advances in place can‚Äôt be ignored. Rare wins One of the promises Trump made during his campaign was a full pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the creator of the Silk Road marketplace. Charged with engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, money laundering, and drug trafficking, he was sentenced to life in prison in 2013 following his arrest in Manhattan. Ulbricht was among the first to create a high-scale business accepting Bitcoin, playing a major role in Bitcoin‚Äôs grassroots adoption. While Ulbricht admitted his brainchild turned out to be harmful‚Äîas it facilitated fatal overdoses for many‚Äîhe remained a symbolic hero for many early bitcoiners who believed 12 years served in prison was enough to pay for his crimes. Indeed, at the end of his first day in office, Trump signed a full, unconventional pardon for Ross, a move lauded by the crypto community. FREEDOM!!!! pic.twitter.com/itRuuyFAxe ‚Äî Free_Ross (@Free_Ross) January 22, 2025 Ross wasn‚Äôt the only one who could breathe a sigh of relief thanks to the new administration. BitMEX co-founders Arthur Hayes, Benjamin Delo, and Samuel Reed, charged with financial crimes, were pardoned too. Now, the developers of Bitcoin mixers accused of money laundering hope for a more favorable outcome , as they didn‚Äôt launder money and only created the tool used by criminals and law-abiding citizens. The pardon of early Bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver, charged with tax fraud, was reportedly discussed by Elon Musk while serving in the Department of Government Efficiency. Still, it doesn‚Äôt appear that Ver‚Äôs fate is significant for the POTUS. Read more: Trump pardons BitMEX founders, is ‚ÄòBitcoin Jesus‚Äô Roger Ver next? Once anti-crypto Gary Gensler resigned from his position as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission following Trump‚Äôs inauguration, the SEC became one of the most crypto-friendly agencies in the U.S. The agency used a combination of executive actions and guidance to create a smoother path for U.S. cryptocurrency businesses to develop in a loose and predictable legal environment. More than that, the SEC welcomed crypto business leaders and experts to help shape new industry rules. A Crypto Task Force created in January 2025 is working to provide U.S. crypto entrepreneurs and innovators with a much-needed framework. Names like Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda, and Paul S. Atkins are associated with the positive shift in the legal status of cryptocurrency. The old-fashioned application of securities laws to cryptocurrencies caused significant trouble for the industry, an approach left behind in 2025. The memecoins‚Äô status changed to ‚Äúcollectibles,‚Äù paving the way for less restrictive business in that sector. JUST IN ‚Äì üá∫üá∏ SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on regulating the Bitcoin and crypto industry: ""I'm a freedom maximalist."" pic.twitter.com/No9myXE423 ‚Äî Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) February 11, 2025 The SEC in 2025 dropped several enforcement actions started during the Gensler era. It discontinued legal battles with Coinbase, Ripple, and other key industry players. Challenges and disappointments Another of Trump‚Äôs campaign promises was the creation of a Bitcoin stockpile, which echoed Sen. Cynthia Lummis‚Äô plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Many failed to realize how different these two plans were. Trump‚Äôs vision, which materialized on March 6, 2025, via executive order, meant the creation of a Bitcoin stockpile composed of seized bitcoins held by the U.S. government (around 200,000 BTC). The reserve may be topped up through budget-neutral methods. Lummis‚Äô plan (and respective bill) proposed the U.S. purchase one million bitcoins over five years. The crypto community lauded this plan, but it did not come to fruition. Instead, Trump‚Äôs version was seen as a disappointment by some, as it simply rebranded seized bitcoins as a ‚Äúreserve.‚Äù So government cant buy but only steal crypto ü§î ‚Äî Dapp Centre (@degenlifer) March 7, 2025 On top of that, Trump‚Äôs order stipulated that an audit of U.S. Bitcoin holdings would be carried out. The audit was due in April, but there have been no updates on the results. Trump opposed work on central bank digital currencies, citing privacy concerns and expressing preference for stablecoins issued by private companies rather than government institutions. However, he did emphasize the need for clearer regulation of stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, is intended to shape this framework. Some believed it would be adopted in the spring, but the legislation took longer to finalize. Although the GENIUS Act was conceived as a bipartisan effort, during House discussions, Democrats suddenly pushed to include clauses restricting sitting U.S. presidents and other top officials and their families from participating in the cryptocurrency business. While they did not succeed, the bill‚Äôs adoption was delayed. Read more: GENIUS Act could bring trillions in institutional crypto capital: experts weigh in The president‚Äôs family‚Äôs involvement in the crypto industry is a concern shared by both Trump‚Äôs critics and some supporters. Trump, his wife Melania, and his sons Eric and Donald are reportedly behind ventures such as World Liberty Finance, memecoins Official Trump and Melania, the mining company American Bitcoin , and other ventures, using their influence as a privilege in the sector. Bloomberg estimates that Trump‚Äôs crypto gains reach $620 million at a minimum. Democrats continue their efforts to dismantle Trump‚Äôs crypto empire. How have the Trump Administration‚Äôs efforts in crypto regulations already influenced the industry? According to Carter Razink , co-founder of the company building stablecoin-backed rewards Spree Finance , the current influence can be described as having both hard and soft impacts. The hard impact is pro-crypto legislation such as the GENIUS Act, which gives stablecoins a definitive, trillion-dollar regulatory runway. The soft impact is that founders no longer fear ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0‚Äù-style debanking‚Äîbuilding the future of finance on U.S. soil now feels safe and even encouraged. Raznik says: ‚ÄúTogether, these forces recalibrate the risk profile for digital-asset startups and tilt the scales back toward American innovation. As history shows, when the U.S. hosts the tech giants, it gains disproportionate geopolitical clout. Pairing that technology scale with financial leverage positions America to dominate the next wave of financial technology. We‚Äôre already seeing this unfold at Spree Finance, where on-chain stablecoins power rewards programs that work and feel like airline miles or credit card points. The more usable and well-regulated these stablecoins become, the more they‚Äôll bridge traditional finance and the next generation of digital money.‚Äù You might also like: U.S. Senate passes landmark Genius Act, aiming to bring clarity in stablecoin regulation",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/first-ever-pro-crypto-u-s-administration-bummer-or-slowburner/,"REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|EXCHANGE","Feature|Cynthia Lummis|Donald Trump|politics|Regulation|Roger Ver|Stablecoin|Strategic Bitcoin reserve",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T18:41:59,"Binance Helped Trump-Linked Crypto Firm Before Founder Changpeng Zhao Sought Pardon: Report","The world‚Äôs largest digital asset exchange by trading volume may have played a larger role in the development of World Liberty Financial‚Äôs stablecoin USD1 than previously known. According to a Bloomberg report citing unnamed sources, Binance wrote the code for World Liberty Financial‚Äôs USD1 stablecoin smart contract. Once coded and promoted, Binance also made stablecoin available for a $2 billion transaction, completed in USD1. According to Bloomberg, approximately 90% of all USD1 is still in Binance-controlled wallets. USD1 launched in March 2025. Two months later, during a podcast interview, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who was convicted in 2023 of failing to maintain proper anti-money-laundering standards at Binance and has already served a short prison term, confirmed that he had applied for a presidential pardon . The news spurred three US senators to write a letter to the White House seeking answers: ‚ÄúWe write to request information about reports that Changpeng ‚ÄòCZ‚Äô Zhao, founder and majority owner of cryptocurrency exchange Binance, is seeking a pardon from President Trump. Just weeks ago, Binance, Emirati firm MGX, and World Liberty Financial (WLF)‚Äîa cryptocurrency company financially linked to President Trump and his family‚Äîannounced a $2 billion deal involving USD1, WLF‚Äôs stablecoin. The convergence of Mr. Zhao‚Äôs pardon application and Binance‚Äôs financial entanglements with the President‚Äôs family presents urgent concerns regarding the integrity of our justice system‚Ä¶ Though he stepped down from his role as CEO after pleading guilty to these charges, Mr. Zhao still owns 90% of the company.‚Äù According to a World Liberty Financial spokesperson, Bloomberg‚Äôs reporting is ‚Äúfactually deficient and designed to further a political agenda.‚Äù A Binance spokesperson reiterated that CZ is no longer the exchange‚Äôs CEO.

2025-07-11T18:40:26,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Monumental Leap: Reclaiming Fifth Spot Among Global Assets","In a truly electrifying development for the digital asset world, Bitcoin market cap has once again made headlines, soaring past Amazon to reclaim its coveted fifth position among the world‚Äôs largest assets by market capitalization. This isn‚Äôt just a number; it‚Äôs a powerful statement, underscoring the growing influence and undeniable momentum of the world‚Äôs premier cryptocurrency. For the first time since May 9, Bitcoin (BTC) has ascended to this elite tier, signaling a significant shift in the global financial landscape. Currently, BTC is trading at an impressive $118,671, reflecting a robust 6.76% increase over the past 24 hours, and boasting a colossal market cap of $2.36 trillion, as reported by CoinMarketCap. This incredible resurgence prompts us to delve deeper into what fuels such a meteoric rise and what it signifies for the future of finance. What Propelled Bitcoin‚Äôs Astounding Ascent in Global Assets? The journey of Bitcoin market cap to reclaim its spot among top global assets is a testament to a confluence of factors, each playing a crucial role in its recent trajectory. This isn‚Äôt a singular event but rather the culmination of sustained interest, evolving regulatory landscapes, and increasing institutional adoption. Let‚Äôs break down the key drivers: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States have been a game-changer. These investment vehicles provide traditional investors with an accessible and regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. The consistent inflows into these ETFs have provided a significant demand shock, absorbing large amounts of BTC from the market. Halving Narrative and Scarcity: The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs quadrennial halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, continues to build a strong narrative around scarcity. This programmed supply shock historically precedes bull runs, and investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on the expected price appreciation. Macroeconomic Factors: Lingering inflation concerns and a search for alternative store-of-value assets have pushed investors towards Bitcoin. In an era of quantitative easing and depreciating fiat currencies, Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against economic uncertainties. Increasing Institutional Adoption: Beyond ETFs, major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. This institutional validation lends credibility and stability to the asset class, moving it further into the mainstream. This remarkable climb in global assets highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs growing maturity and its undeniable presence on the world stage, challenging traditional financial paradigms. Understanding the Significance: Bitcoin vs. Traditional Giants To truly grasp the magnitude of Bitcoin‚Äôs achievement, it‚Äôs essential to put its market cap into perspective against other leading global assets . Surpassing Amazon, a tech behemoth with diverse revenue streams and a long-standing presence in global commerce, is no small feat. This comparison isn‚Äôt just about market value; it‚Äôs about the fundamental nature of these assets. While Amazon represents a centralized, innovative company driven by consumer demand and technological advancements, Bitcoin is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency, a protocol, and a network. Its value is derived from its network effect, security, scarcity, and utility as a censorship-resistant medium of exchange and store of value. The fact that an intangible, decentralized digital asset can command such a significant valuation, surpassing established corporate giants, speaks volumes about the ongoing financial revolution. It signals a growing recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate, powerful, and potentially transformative asset class. Analyzing the Current BTC Price and Market Dynamics The recent surge in BTC price to over $118,000, coupled with its $2.36 trillion market cap, reflects robust investor confidence and strong buying pressure. This isn‚Äôt just speculative fervor; it‚Äôs backed by fundamental shifts in market dynamics. The demand side, particularly from institutional vehicles like ETFs, has been consistently strong. On the supply side, the upcoming halving further constrains the flow of new Bitcoin, creating an imbalance that naturally pushes prices higher. Furthermore, on-chain metrics reveal a healthy market. Long-term holders continue to accumulate, indicating a belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs future appreciation rather than short-term profit-taking. Exchange reserves of Bitcoin are decreasing, suggesting that fewer BTC are available for immediate sale, which further supports price appreciation. The volume across major exchanges also remains high, indicating active participation from both retail and institutional investors. This period of significant price discovery is characterized by: Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and market depth contribute to more efficient price discovery and reduced volatility swings, making the market more attractive to larger players. Positive Sentiment: News of Bitcoin‚Äôs market cap milestone creates a positive feedback loop, attracting more attention and capital from new investors. Network Effect Reinforcement: As more individuals and entities adopt Bitcoin, its utility and value proposition strengthen, further solidifying its position. The current BTC price action is a clear indicator that the market is repricing Bitcoin, acknowledging its growing importance in the global financial ecosystem. The Accelerating Pace of Cryptocurrency Growth Bitcoin‚Äôs journey to the top five is emblematic of the broader phenomenon of cryptocurrency growth . While Bitcoin leads the charge, the entire digital asset ecosystem is expanding at an unprecedented pace. We are witnessing innovation across various sectors, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and the emergence of new blockchain technologies. This growth is fueled by: Technological Advancements: Continuous improvements in blockchain scalability, security, and interoperability are making cryptocurrencies more efficient and user-friendly. Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, increasing regulatory clarity in major jurisdictions is providing a more stable environment for businesses and investors to operate within the crypto space. Global Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies offer financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations worldwide, fostering financial inclusion on a global scale. Web3 and Metaverse Development: The vision of a decentralized internet (Web3) and immersive virtual worlds (metaverse) heavily relies on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, driving further innovation and adoption. The sustained momentum in cryptocurrency growth suggests that digital assets are not just a passing fad but a foundational element of the future economy. Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the entire market, and its current success is a beacon for the industry as a whole. Is Bitcoin Truly the New Digital Gold? The narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold has gained significant traction, especially in light of its recent performance and its position among top global assets . Just as gold has served as a traditional store of value for millennia, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a modern-day equivalent, offering unique advantages in the digital age. Here‚Äôs why this comparison holds weight: Feature Gold Bitcoin Scarcity Finite supply, difficult to extract Fixed supply (21 million coins), programmed halving Durability Physical, does not corrode Digital, indestructible on the blockchain Divisibility Can be melted, but less practical Highly divisible (to 8 decimal places) Portability Heavy, difficult to transport large amounts Easily transferable across borders with internet Verifiability Requires assaying to confirm purity Cryptographically verifiable, transparent ledger Censorship Resistance Can be confiscated by governments Highly resistant to censorship or seizure While traditional gold has its merits, Bitcoin‚Äôs digital nature offers unparalleled portability, divisibility, and resistance to censorship. In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, these attributes make Bitcoin a compelling alternative for preserving wealth. Its recent climb in market cap reinforces the idea that institutional and retail investors alike are beginning to embrace Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate, long-term store of value, solidifying its role as digital gold for the 21st century. Challenges and What Lies Ahead for Bitcoin While the recent milestones are undoubtedly impressive, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the inherent volatility and potential challenges that lie ahead for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency market is known for its dramatic price swings, and while the long-term trend has been upward, short-term corrections are always a possibility. Regulatory uncertainty, though improving, remains a factor, as different countries adopt varying stances on digital assets. Furthermore, competition from other cryptocurrencies and evolving technological landscapes could also present challenges. However, the future outlook for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly positive. Its fundamental properties ‚Äì decentralization, scarcity, and a robust network ‚Äì continue to strengthen. As global economies grapple with inflation and geopolitical instability, Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a neutral, borderless asset is likely to grow. Continued institutional adoption, further innovation in the blockchain space, and increasing mainstream understanding will likely propel Bitcoin to even greater heights, potentially challenging even larger global assets in the years to come. Actionable Insights for Investors For those looking to navigate the exciting world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand Bitcoin‚Äôs technology, its value proposition, and the risks involved. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate volatility and build a position over time. Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin‚Äôs history is marked by significant volatility. A long-term investment horizon often yields the best results, allowing you to ride out short-term fluctuations. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is powerful, it‚Äôs wise to diversify across different asset classes and even within the crypto space to manage risk. Secure Your Assets: If you hold Bitcoin directly, use secure wallets (hardware wallets are highly recommended) and practice strong security habits. A Lasting Impression: Bitcoin‚Äôs Enduring Legacy Bitcoin‚Äôs reclamation of the fifth spot among global assets is far more than a fleeting market cap milestone; it‚Äôs a profound declaration of its enduring power and its burgeoning role in the future of finance. This achievement solidifies its position not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate, transformative force that is reshaping how we perceive value, ownership, and financial freedom. As cryptocurrency growth continues to accelerate, Bitcoin stands as a beacon of innovation, a testament to the power of decentralization, and an increasingly vital component of a diversified investment portfolio. Its journey from an obscure digital experiment to a trillion-dollar asset, challenging the dominance of traditional giants, is a compelling narrative that continues to unfold, promising an exciting and potentially revolutionary future for global finance.

The token is now in presale, currently in stage 5 at $0.03. Over 65% of the phase has already been sold. Mutuum Finance has over $12 million raised with over 13,000 investors already. As Bitcoin‚Äôs whales tinker at the top, it‚Äôs MUTM‚Äôs cohesive roadmap, spanning presale traction, protocol utility, security credentials, and community incentives, that is stealing the spotlight this July. Bitcoin Inches Toward Key Levels, But Eyes Shift Toward Market Movers Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover near $108,300, stabilizing after whale wallets pushed fresh accumulation over the past week. While some analysts point to a possible 30% rally if BTC breaks above the $110K‚Äì$112K resistance zone, price momentum has cooled slightly despite over $50 billion in spot ETF inflows this year. The lack of a decisive breakout leaves BTC in a wait-and-watch phase, especially as legacy holders move dormant coins, adding caution to the bullish narrative. As Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory hangs in the balance, investor focus this July is beginning to pivot toward emerging assets like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which are showing stronger technical momentum and on-chain growth. Fast-Moving Support Fuels $12M Raise for Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has attracted more than 13,000 investors with a raise of more than $12 million.

This is one more step confirming that Mutuum is a project with proactive safety attitude and its commitment towards establishing the environment favorable to the finances that can be trusted. While Bitcoin (BTC) inches toward a possible 30% breakout, it‚Äôs Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that‚Äôs commanding real momentum this July. With over $12 million raised, more than 13,000 investors, and Stage 5 already 65% sold out, the project‚Äôs traction is undeniable.

But it never hurts to lock in some profit at new highs. In October 2017 , a biotech diagnostic company named Bioptix rebranded to Riot Blockchain. The stock doubled. That entity is currently known as Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ); a survivor of the 2017 'race to be a blockchain company' trend that saw numerous publicly traded entities abruptly projecting a loose connection to a trendy market idea. Not to be outdone by RIOT, it was December 2017 when a company called Long Island Iced Tea Corp. (LTEA) made headlines for changing its name to 'Long Blockchain Corp.' Shares of that stock more than tripled. That entity is now defunct. Not only that, but 'Long Blockchain Corp' proved to be a marvelous sell signal during that cycle: Data by YCharts Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) had peaked just four days prior to Long Blockchain Corp's name change announcement and proceeded to fall by over 85% over the next twelve months. Why do I share this story? Because nobody rings a bell at the top, but there will always be signs for those willing to decode them. That, and I'd imagine a good portion of today's crypto bulls weren't investing in stocks or paying attention to coins during the 2017 run. I was and I find what we're experiencing in the market today to be an uncomfortable reminder of the hysteria of that time. 'Treasury' is The New 'Blockchain' Are Bitcoin miners pivoting to high-performance computing and AI? That's so 2024. 2025 is about K-pop companies and struggling mining outfits flipping to Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) and Solana USD ( SOL-USD ) Treasury businesses. Such is the case with BIT Mining Limited ( BTCM ). A company that now plans to pivot operations to a Solana Treasury company . Following the company's detail-starved press release, the stock closed higher by more than 150% on over 160 million shares traded on July 10th. Not bad for a ticker that had a 30-day average share volume of just 64k the day prior. BTCM is just the latest example of a small-cap company attempting to generate unjustified buying of its stock using crypto as a hype engine. But I won't just pick on BTCM, we've been seeing this for months: Upexi, Inc. ( UPXI ), DeFi Development Corp. ( DFDV ), and Sol Strategies Inc. ( CYFRF ) with Solana. SharpLink Gaming, Inc. ( SBET ), BTCS Inc. ( BTCS ), and Bit Digital, Inc. ( BTBT ) with Ethereum. Metaplanet Inc. ( MTPLF ), GameStop Corp. ( GME ), Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. ( DJT ), and too many other companies to list with Bitcoin. Even Bitcoin miners have been issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin‚Äîan asset that they're in the business of selling. But there's an old principle that generally works in business; when everyone is doing it, it stops working. Are we at the point where 'everyone' is buying crypto to juice stock market returns? Of course not. But we're quite clearly experiencing a phenomenon that hearkens back to the 'blockchain' moment in 2017 or the 'dot com' bubble before that. And while there will no doubt be some who believe Bitcoin is a special unicorn, immune from a downturn in digital assets; it won't be. Just as it wasn't in 2017. Cycle Top Indicators There are various metrics we can consider when we're trying to figure out when it's the right time to start lightening up a BTC position. One metric that I like a lot is the holders who are in/out of the money at any given time. Of course, at all-time highs, you're going to have a lot of winners‚Äîand we certainly do today: BTC, In/Out of Money Trend (IntoTheBlock) But I think the reason why this chart above is helpful is that it can give us a sense of cycle maturity. When I look at the holders in the money staying above 90% for most of the last 15 months, it seems quite similar to the 2017 bull run to me. Where the 2021 bull cycle ended with an explosive double-top, the 2024/5 vintage has been more of a grind with several multi-month consolidation periods along the way‚Äîjust like 2017. A metric that is looking quite similar to the 2021 run is the miner's volume share: Miners Volume Share (IntoTheBlock) This is the percentage of on-chain volume derived from miner addresses. At present, this figure has fallen to 4.3%. A sign of a healthy network with robust usage would actually be one where miner volume continues to go down over time. Yet, monthly transactions and volume in recent months have been well below last year's highs. This is likely an indication that miners are simply HODLing to a larger degree than they were when the miner volume share was higher. But again, the last cycle showed an aggressive rally to a marginal nominal new high. That action was accompanied by a collapse in the miner volume share. We're starting to see that again now. Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score (CoinGlass) Some of the other metrics that are worth considering for Bitcoin cyclical indications are the Pi Cycle Top Indicator, MVRV Ratios, and the Mayer Multiple. I've covered these in past articles and am showing the MVRV Z-score in the chart above. This is important; none of these metrics are currently indicating a sell signal . In fact, some of them might even be foreshadowing a BTC price closer to $150k. Maybe Bitcoin will get there, maybe it won't. We'll find out. What I do want to share is the Euphoria Zone chart from well-regarded Bitcoin analyst James Check: Bitcoin Euphoria Zone (CheckOnChain) We are not currently in a ""Euphoria Zone,"" which is triggered when the MVRV gets overheated. But we have seen two distinct Euphoria Zones already this cycle, three if you count the all-time high that happened in early 2024 just before the official halving event. We commonly get several of these Euphoria Zones during a cycle. It's certainly possible we get another one this year, but I'm personally not expecting a long drawn-out one in the event we get it. Price Action I'm going to share two price charts that I think will be quick and easy to understand. The first is the weekly: Bitcoin Weekly Chart (TrendSpider) While there's a clear RSI divergence to be aware of here, I actually think this chart looks pretty good. All major MAs are headed higher, the coin is leaving the station as far as the 8-week MA is concerned. The weekly implies higher prices in my view. But this isn't the only time frame to consider. I'm far less convinced about the monthly: Bitcoin Monthly Chart (TrendSpider) In this chart, I've connected the peaks from the last two cycles to estimate a rough trend resistance. We're there. To be sure, Bitcoin is attempting to break out above it. But we've seen a similar attempt failed in the past‚ÄîApril 2021 being a good example. Again, we have RSI divergences. And even the volume trend looks underwhelming. My chart is showing Kraken volume rather than Binance, but most exchanges have volume generally declining. Blockchain.com aggregates volume from multiple exchanges. It speaks for itself: 30-Day Average Exchange Volume (Blockchain.com) We have a coin price ripping higher while exchange volume is collapsing. We've seen this before and it foretells a nearing peak. Closing Thought Am I saying sell all your coins today? Absolutely not. You could actually talk me into Bitcoin being at the beginning of a halving cycle blow-off phase that could realistically take it to $125-150k in the weeks/months ahead. I share all of these charts and past signals as a reminder; history doesn't repeat but it rhymes. The behaviors we're seeing in today's equity market are highly reminiscent of what we observed back in 2017. Locking in wins can be difficult at all-time highs. For me, I think there is enough in the data to justify locking in a portion of this win. To be sure, I'm still very much long Bitcoin both on-chain and through the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ), but I've now taken some of it off at $118k BTC.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800727-amid-fresh-bitcoin-all-time-highs-bearish-signals-are-mounting?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE","ETH-USD|SOL-USD|BTCM|BTC-USD",cryptocompare

The token that once attracted millions of followers now trades at $0.465 , dangerously close to its all-time low of $0.400 . Even the recent Pi2Day celebration failed to inject momentum into the struggling altcoin, which has suffered a devastating 26.4% decline over the past two weeks.

The cryptocurrency has established a negative correlation of -0.27 with Bitcoin, meaning it moves in the opposite direction to the market leader. Technical Outlook: Pi Network Still Bearish ‚Äì But a Breakout Could Flip the Script Pi Network remains locked in a firm downtrend, trading within a descending channel that has defined price action since its post-launch peak. Each rally attempt has failed at the upper boundary of the channel, reinforcing it as a strong resistance zone.

Despite that, the RSI has climbed to 55.46 ‚Äì a neutral but improving signal that could indicate momentum is starting to shift. While the current setup still leans bearish, a confirmed breakout above the descending channel could trigger a sharp reversal.

Market participants also took a bit of a breather after back-to-back record closes for the benchmark S&P 500 index ( SP500 ). The S&P ( SP500 ) was last -0.3% in afternoon trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) was flat, and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) was last -0.6% . Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond.

In addition, Trump said he would impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on other remaining countries. ‚ÄúStocks are not quite desensitized to tariff headlines just yet. We are still seeing knee-jerk reactions to negative trade headlines.

The flagship coin surged over 3.8 percent in the past 24 hours to reach a new all-time high (ATH) of about $118,885, which was set during the mid-London session on Friday, July 11. Following the sustained bullish sentiment, heavy crypto liquidations, amounting to over $1.2 billion, were recorded in the past 24 hours. Out of the entire crypto liquidations today, short trades amounted to over $1 billion, whereby BTC‚Äôs share was around $567 million. As Coinpedia had previously reported, Bitcoin‚Äôs cumulative short liquidation leveraged trades entered at around $112k amounted to $12 billion. With Bitcoin price having surged above $118k, a short squeeze has been triggered and the sellers have now turned bullish. Top Reasons Why Bitcoin Price Has More Upside Momentum Bitcoin will continue to experience bullish sentiment in the coming months, largely fueled by rising demand from institutional investors. For instance, the U.S. spot BTC ETFs recorded the highest cash inflow, of about $1.18 billion in the past few months. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT has led in the net Daily Cash Inflow, whereby it currently has more than $80 billion in net cash under management. According to data compiled by BitcoinTreasuries , Strategy and Metaplanet have continued to lead dozens of companies holding BTC in their respective treasuries. BTC price will continue to experience bullish sentiment fueled by the growing global money supply. Furthermore, more countries are forming alliances to ditch the U.S. dollar, as observed with the BRICS movement, thus weakening the greenback amid its ongoing depreciation. How to Trade Crypto Summer During a crypto summer, almost the entire crypto market experiences bullish sentiment fueled by sustained optimism and growth. Capital rotation happens from the largest crypto projects to the smallest by market cap. From a technical analysis standpoint, considering oversold crypto tokens, including memecoin, with immense potential to disrupt the web3 space will likely offer higher returns. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market has a similar vibe in 2025 to the crypto summer of 2017, which resulted in one of the largest bull runs ever recorded.

He also revealed that Ethereum (ETH) began to follow with potential outperformance, and markets began pricing in a Trump administration‚Äôs readiness to ease trade tensions. From Bearish to Bullish This pivot follows Hayes‚Äô prior cautious stance, which was rooted in concerns about a Treasury General Account (TGA) refill draining liquidity. In his previous essay, Hayes explained that the US Treasury Secretary, whom he calls ‚ÄúThe Big Bessent Cock (BBC),‚Äù faces an impossible task: funding ballooning deficits without causing a bond market revolt. To manage this, the government is turning to innovative liquidity engineering, including stablecoin adoption by ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù (TBTF) banks, which could unlock up to $6.8 trillion in T-bill buying power. Hayes also noted that if the Fed stops paying interest on reserves, it could unleash another $3.3 trillion, bringing the total potential liquidity injection to $10.1 trillion. He argued this approach was the modern replacement for QE, by maintaining equity markets and crypto afloat despite the Fed‚Äôs tightening posture. The exec warned that the TGA refill could briefly interrupt crypto‚Äôs bull momentum. Despite this, Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience in busting through resistance while Ethereum appears to be positioning for a ‚Äúmonster alt season.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrontloading Ahead of Trump Tariffs‚Äù Adding to this backdrop, QCP Capital, in its latest analysis, also identified frontloading ahead of potential Trump tariffs as a key macro driver.

2025-07-11T18:10:58,"BITU: Should You Buy This Leveraged ETF With Bitcoin At All-Time High?","Summary BITU is a 2x leveraged Bitcoin ETF best suited for active traders aiming to time short-term market moves, not long-term investors. Despite Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs, BITU underperformed YTD due to volatility and the inherent risks of leveraged ETFs, including value decay. I remain very bullish on Bitcoin long term but would avoid entering BITU at current levels, preferring to hold Bitcoin directly instead. My hold rating on BITU reflects its high risk, underperformance in volatile markets, and suitability only for tactical, short-term trades. I last covered the Proshares Ultra Bitcoin ETF ( BITU ) in December 2024 , arguing how this is an ETF only suitable for active traders. Today, I am revisiting this ETF and asking myself a different question: with Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) hitting new all-time highs, would it make sense for a risk-prone investor to enter a trade in BITU to maximize future gains? BITU: Performance Since My Last Coverage In December, at the time of my last BITU coverage, Bitcoin was worth ~$101,000 per coin. At the time of writing, after some volatility and correcting down to the mid-80Ks, Bitcoin hit a new ATH of ~$119,000 per coin. So, how did BITU perform? In line with what I described in my last coverage, BITU underperformed its underlying crypto asset YTD by almost 20%, as the table below shows. BITU vs. IBIT; YTD (Seeking Alpha) This underperformance happened by design. BITU, like all leveraged ETFs, faces challenges during volatile periods. Its high leverage magnifies both profits and losses, making recovery from steep declines difficult. When the underlying index falls sharply, the daily rebalancing needed to sustain 2x leverage gradually reduces the ETF's value, leading to underperformance compared to the unleveraged index, even if the market later reaches new all-time highs. This is exactly what happened YTD, with Bitcoin suffering a steep decline in price around the end of April and BITU not managing to recover yet , even as Bitcoin hit new ATHs. BITU: ETF Profile and Evolution The BITU ETF is a leveraged fund that ‚Äúseeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times (2x) the daily performance of the Bloomberg Bitcoin Index.‚Äù Rather than directly owning Bitcoin, BITU employs financial tools like swaps to track and double Bitcoin‚Äôs daily price changes. This approach shields BITU from custodian risks faced by standard Bitcoin ETFs. However, it carries counterparty risk, as the fund depends on instruments issued by financial entities, such as investment banks, which are among the swap providers for the fund. Like every leveraged fund, BITU charges a hefty 0.95% expense ratio (which I find reasonable given the nature of the fund and cost of leverage). BITU also has good liquidity metrics, with a Bid/Ask spread currently at 0.04%, significantly less than the 0.06% that it registered in December at the time of my last coverage. I see this as a positive development in the context of the objective of the fund. It means, in my opinion, that active traders are using BITU consistently , improving its liquidity. BITU‚Äôs AUMs are just slightly above what they were in December. They increased by $50 million, equivalent to ~4% of the $1.26 Bln AUM figure. Timing the Bitcoin Market With BITU: Not for Everyone I think the only sensible way to use leveraged ETFs is by holding them short-term when trying to time the market. This is a concept I described in my previous work on Seeking Alpha, including in my recent coverage of a semiconductor leveraged fund that may be a good play in case of a new AI Wave . BITU is no exception. Traders who believe we are on the cusp of a sustained Bitcoin bull run in the upcoming months may want to consider entering at this point in time to maximize their gains. Personally, I am a long-time Bitcoin bull. Having recently covered my thoughts on Bitcoin developing as a global reserve asset based on on-chain data , my bull case remains that of Bitcoin maturing into an asset that rivals gold in market capitalization. I have a target of roughly $750,000 per Bitcoin. However, I also refrain from short-term Bitcoin predictions, and I do not actively trade it. I do believe that we may see further volatility ahead before Bitcoin actually matures into a reserve asset. In fact, I believe it may take longer than many expect to get there, as institutions will take time to actually adopt a prominent ‚Äúholding behavior‚Äù. This is again something readers can see in my previous Bitcoin work , and that I won‚Äôt cover in more detail in this article. In a scenario where I was forced to only be exposed to Bitcoin with leveraged products, today I would wait. While I am not using Technical Analysis to predict short-term Bitcoin movements, I do like the ‚ÄúFear and Greed Index ‚Äù as a gauge of short-term price movement. This is an index that measures investor sentiment, using factors like volatility and trading volume on a 0‚Äì100 scale. Low scores (0‚Äì25) reflect fear, indicating caution, while high scores (75‚Äì100) show greed, pointing at overconfidence. Fear & Greed Index, BTC (Coin Market Cap) The Index is currently signalling the beginning of a new ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù phase , with the previous ‚ÄúFear‚Äù phase in March, which corresponded to the bottom of Bitcoin in the mid $80Ks. Based on this index, I do expect the bull run to continue for the immediate future (we are still only at the beginning of a greed phase). But I would still not take the risk of entering BITU now. In conclusion, I would tread carefully and only enter a trade in BITU now if I were an active trader convinced we were going to see new ATHs in the upcoming weeks and months. Risks of Leveraged ETFs The main risk of BITU, as a 2X leveraged fund, is that of underperformance of its underlying asset (Bitcoin) in case of volatility. In my past article on BITU, I explained this risk with an example, which I report here below: ‚Äì Assume a 2x leveraged ETF based on an asset worth $100. ‚Äì A -5% move in the underlying asset results in a -10% move for the ETF, reducing its value to $90. ‚Äì To recover to $100, the ETF needs to gain more than 10% because it‚Äôs now starting from a lower base. ‚Äì If the underlying asset recovers to $100 with a +5.26% move, the leveraged ETF will only gain +10.52%, bringing it to $99.47, not $100. This illustrates the fundamental issue with a fund like BITU. Other risks include its hefty expense ratio (should investors hold it for longer periods of time) and generally the higher volatility of the fund. Conclusion When investing, as the old adage goes, one should try to ‚Äú Buy Low, Sell High ‚Äù. Of course, this is easier said than done, which is why for most investors (me included) a long-term hold approach is preferable. Personally, I would not enter a 2X leveraged position in Bitcoin via BITU as the cryptocurrency reaches new ATHs. I would rather simply hold Bitcoin long term (which is exactly what I am doing). If I really were to use a leveraged product like BITU, I would prefer to do so when fear hits the crypto market rather than when we are entering a new greed phase. However, some people may disagree, and based on their own assessment (including Technical Analysis or other data points), they may believe we are on the verge of repeatedly seeing new ATHs. For these investors, entering BITU today could actually make sense as it maximizes their exposure and potential gains. My final ‚Äú hold ‚Äù rating for BITU does not reflect bearishness towards Bitcoin (on the contrary, I am very bullish on Bitcoin long term ), but rather the peculiar, leveraged nature of this fund and its objectives.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800722-bitu-should-you-buy-this-leveraged-etf-with-bitcoin-at-all-time-high?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT","BITU",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T18:10:34,"Bitcoin Price: Analyst Predicts Astounding $150K Target Within Months","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with anticipation as leading voices weigh in on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential trajectory. Fresh insights from a prominent crypto analyst suggest that the king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC), could be on the verge of an astonishing surge, potentially hitting the $150,000 mark in the coming months. This bold BTC prediction is rooted in a fascinating market phenomenon: the parabolic trend . Understanding Kevin Svenson‚Äôs Astounding Bitcoin Price Outlook In a recent captivating YouTube broadcast, renowned crypto analyst Kevin Svenson shared his compelling analysis, indicating that Bitcoin is currently exhibiting a distinct parabolic trend . This pattern, often seen in assets undergoing rapid acceleration, significantly heightens the probability of a sustained upward movement. Svenson‚Äôs insights, highlighted by The Daily Hodl, point to a critical correlation: Bitcoin‚Äôs tendency to mirror the S&P 500 index when it achieves new all-time highs. Svenson emphasized that the current rally is not merely a fleeting bounce but appears to be the genesis of a structural uptrend designed to unfold over several months. This long-term perspective differentiates his analysis from short-term market fluctuations, offering a more robust framework for understanding Bitcoin‚Äôs potential growth. The analyst‚Äôs detailed examination of BTC‚Äôs weekly chart, combined with the classic parabolic trend diagram, underpins his projection for the Bitcoin price to enter the ambitious zone ranging from $140,000 to $150,000 in the foreseeable future. What is a Parabolic Trend and Why Does it Matter for BTC Prediction? A parabolic trend in financial markets refers to a chart pattern where the price of an asset experiences increasingly rapid gains, forming a steep, upward-curving trajectory that resembles a parabola. This indicates strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum. For a crypto analyst like Kevin Svenson, identifying such a trend in Bitcoin‚Äôs chart is a significant signal for several reasons: Accelerated Growth: It suggests that the rate of price increase is not only positive but is also accelerating, leading to exponential gains. Investor Enthusiasm: Parabolic moves often coincide with heightened investor interest and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), driving more capital into the asset. Breakout Potential: Once a parabolic trend is confirmed, it often precedes significant price breakouts to new all-time highs. Market Psychology: The visual nature of the curve can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, as more investors notice the rapid rise and jump in. The correlation Svenson draws with the S&P 500 is also crucial. Historically, when traditional markets like the S&P 500 reach new peaks, it often signals a broader risk-on environment, where investors are more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin. This macroeconomic backdrop provides a fertile ground for Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory, bolstering the $150K BTC prediction . Beyond the Parabolic Trend: Other Factors Fueling Bitcoin‚Äôs Ascent While the parabolic trend is a compelling technical indicator, several fundamental factors also contribute to a bullish Bitcoin price outlook and support such ambitious targets: Bitcoin Halving Event: The quadrennial halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, historically leading to significant price appreciation in the months following the event. This supply shock, combined with steady or increasing demand, creates upward price pressure. Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds are now gaining easier, regulated access to Bitcoin, driving substantial demand. Macroeconomic Landscape: As central banks globally navigate inflation and interest rate policies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against traditional financial instability or as a digital store of value, akin to ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô Growing Retail Interest: Renewed positive sentiment, driven by price surges and mainstream media coverage, often reignites interest from individual investors, adding to the buying volume. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including advancements in scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, enhances its utility and efficiency, making it more attractive for wider adoption. Navigating the Path to $150K: Challenges and Opportunities for Bitcoin Investors While the BTC prediction of $150,000 is exciting, it‚Äôs essential for investors to understand the inherent volatility and potential challenges in the cryptocurrency market. Even with a strong parabolic trend , market corrections can be sharp and sudden. A seasoned crypto analyst would always advise caution and due diligence. What are the Potential Hurdles on the Road to $150K? Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulations in different jurisdictions can introduce market volatility and impact investor sentiment. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Unexpected global economic downturns, severe recessions, or significant shifts in monetary policy could dampen risk appetite across all asset classes, including Bitcoin. Market Manipulation: Despite increasing market maturity, the crypto space can still be susceptible to large-scale market movements influenced by whales or coordinated actions. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events, such as major security breaches or technological vulnerabilities, could temporarily erode confidence in the digital asset space. Actionable Insights for Investors Considering the Bitcoin Price Surge: For those looking to capitalize on the potential Bitcoin price surge, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Do not solely rely on single analyst predictions. Diversify your information sources and understand the underlying technology and market dynamics. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk assets, and significant price swings are common. Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility. Long-Term Vision: While a $150K target within months suggests rapid growth, Bitcoin‚Äôs history is characterized by cycles. A long-term investment horizon often yields better results. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, technological developments, and regulatory changes. Follow reputable analysts and news outlets. Security First: Ensure your Bitcoin holdings are stored securely, preferably in a hardware wallet, to protect against hacks and theft. The Future of Bitcoin: A Glimpse into the Next Frontier The convergence of technical indicators like the parabolic trend and strong fundamental drivers paints a compelling picture for Bitcoin‚Äôs immediate future. Kevin Svenson‚Äôs $150,000 BTC prediction , while ambitious, is grounded in observable market behavior and historical precedents. As the digital asset landscape continues to evolve, Bitcoin remains at the forefront, captivating investors and analysts alike with its potential for unprecedented growth. Whether Bitcoin reaches this astounding target within months or takes a little longer, the underlying trend of increasing adoption, technological innovation, and its growing role in the global financial system suggests a bright future. The journey to $150,000, if it materializes, will undoubtedly be a testament to Bitcoin‚Äôs resilience and its enduring appeal as a revolutionary asset.

2025-07-11T18:05:32,"‚ÄòThis Could Very Well Be the Ultimate Bull Trap‚Äô ‚Äì Trader Issues Urgent Crypto Warning As Bitcoin Blasts Past $118,000","An analyst who became popular after accurately calling the 2022 crypto meltdown is warning that Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) explosive move this week may be a bull trap. Pseudonymous analyst Capo tells his 970,500 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may suddenly correct after printing a new all-time high (ATH) of about $118,700 on Thursday. A bull trap is a false signal that indicates that the bearish trend is over, but then the price abruptly reverses course and witnesses a deeper drawdown. ‚ÄúThis could very well be the ultimate bull trap. Staying cautious.‚Äù Capo says that the broader crypto market looks primed to potentially form a bull trap as well, as alts have yet to print bullish higher high price patterns. He also expects another black swan event, a rare and unanticipated event that catalyzes a massive market meltdown. ‚ÄúMay was the local top for the market, with altcoins down 30%-50% from there. We‚Äôve already seen a form of Black Swan with the Middle East conflict escalation, but I‚Äôm expecting another one. So far, this is still a lower high for alts, even if Bitcoin is making new ATHs due to buying pressure from institutional strategic reserves. In any case, invalidation levels are clear, and they haven‚Äôt been hit. Most altcoins remain in a clear downtrend, and some have even made new ATLs (all-time lows). The only crypto asset that has truly had a bull market is BTC, with a few other exceptions.‚Äù Capo also tells his 128,307 subscribers on the instant messaging platform Telegram that the TOTAL2 chart, which tracks the market cap of all crypto assets excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, is not yet invalidating a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern (H&S) on the three-day timeframe. A head-and-shoulders pattern typically suggests that an asset is losing momentum and could reverse its uptrend if the price breaks below the structure‚Äôs support. ‚ÄúDespite BTC reaching a new ATH, altcoins remain at a clear resistance. Something feels very off. I don‚Äôt trust this move.‚Äù Source: Capo/Telegram At time of writing, TOTAL2 is trading for $1.31 trillion. Lastly, Capo says Bitcoin may be forming a blow-off top, a chart pattern in technical analysis showing a sudden rise in price that is followed by a sharp decline. Source: Capo/Telegram Looking at his chart, Capo suggests Bitcoin may correct to the $64,000 range. Bitcoin is trading for $117,317 at time of writing, up 5.4% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-11T18:02:44,"Is PUMP The Best Crypto to Buy Now - Pump.fun ICO Starts July 12","The crypto market has entered a phase of euphoric buying again, as Bitcoin‚Äôs rally to an all-time high near $119,000 and Ethereum‚Äôs surge past $3,000 have rekindled investor enthusiasm across the board. This sudden upward momentum has created a sense of collective bullishness, with altcoins and smaller tokens beginning to attract significant attention. Into this environment steps PUMP, the soon-to-launch native token of Pump.fun, the popular Solana-based meme coin platform. The timing couldn‚Äôt be better either. Set to debut on July 12, the PUMP ICO has already caught the eye of traders and enthusiasts who see it as one of the most exciting meme coin launches of the year, marking an inflection point for the sector. PUMP Token Launch And How It Could Change the Meme Coin Space Pump.fun has become a key platform within the Solana ecosystem by offering something few others manage: a place where anyone can create, launch, and trade meme coins with minimal friction. Its interface allows users to issue tokens tied to trending topics, memes, or ideas, and it takes a small share of the transaction flow. This model has led to an explosion in daily token launches, placing Pump.fun at the center of Solana‚Äôs meme coin surge since early 2024. the $PUMP public sale is only two days away!to participate, make sure to verify yourself using the link in the next tweet or on one of our participating exchange‚Äôs sitesfor more info üëáüèª pic.twitter.com/AN1iEsPC2O ‚Äî pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) July 10, 2025 Now, with the launch of its native PUMP token on July 12, the project is taking a step toward expanding its vision. As per the team behind Pump.fun, the project aims to create a decentralized social platform that moves beyond simple engagement numbers and instead links attention to monetary advantages. By distributing 33% of the total token supply through the ICO at $0.004, and keeping all tokens unlocked from day one, the project opens the door to active trading and community participation from the start. Welcome to the bull market. Even the top losers are all in positive gain.ETH will head to $4000 soon and you should only do one thing which is picking the right alts. pic.twitter.com/RpFXiWP6Q1 ‚Äî Foxi ü¶ä (@Foxi_xyz) July 11, 2025 However, what makes the timing significant is the current market backdrop. Bitcoin‚Äôs climb to nearly $119,000 and Ethereum‚Äôs move past $3,000 have strengthened crypto‚Äôs position as a permanent fixture in the financial world, even for the naysayers now. In moments like this, attention often turns to smaller tokens, especially within the meme coin sector, as traders seek newer, high-potential opportunities. The arrival of PUMP during such a period raises the possibility of energy across the meme coin market. Importantly, it also highlights that this is an environment where investors may look not just at hype-driven coins but also at projects with meaningful ideas and design behind them. Besides PUMP, These Could Be the Best Crypto to Buy Now Token 6900 Token 6900 operates within its own carefully crafted ecosystem, designed to offer participatory mechanics for degen crypto investors that go far beyond the usual meme coin formula. While most projects today rely solely on speculative bursts, Token 6900 brings its community directly into the evolution of its growth using a degen design element. These kinds of projects were some of the top gainers in the last bull run, and with the current price surge being seen across top cryptos and funds flowing into altcoins as well, it may not be surprising to see this meme coin also record some sharing of these investments. The project has already been endorsed by top crypto YouTubers like ClayBro and many others. With recent market conditions driving increased attention to altcoins, Token 6900 benefits from this growth not because it follows trends but because it offers something structurally different. Where most tokens fade after initial hype, Token 6900 has structured mechanisms that keep engagement continuous and layered. Its presence in the current climate, where projects like PUMP are drawing new eyes to meme coin platforms, gives it the opportunity to attract those looking for projects where value does not end at price charts. By combining cultural awareness with technical design, Token 6900 builds a space that is both playful and deeply interactive, marking it as a project that invites long-term exploration rather than short-term speculation. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper approaches the challenge of Bitcoin scalability with a clear intent to improve transaction flow while staying rooted in simplicity. Its Layer 2 framework integrates seamlessly with Bitcoin, creating a system where small, rapid transfers become accessible without the cost and delay of mainnet settlements. More than just adding speed, Bitcoin Hyper introduces adaptive rewards for participants who help secure the network‚Äôs performance, creating a shared responsibility model that encourages participation at all levels. In a market where Bitcoin‚Äôs new record highs are confirming its role as a core asset, Bitcoin Hyper adds a necessary dimension, which is usability. As capital floods into flagship assets, attention inevitably turns to projects that can extend their functionality. Bitcoin Hyper serves this need, offering a direct path for Bitcoin to move beyond long-term holding and into everyday use, from micropayments to decentralized applications. What makes Bitcoin Hyper even more appealing right now is its relevance to the broader environment. While meme coin platforms like Pump.fun capture cultural momentum, Bitcoin Hyper offers a technical counterpart that reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs presence across both store-of-value and utility-driven segments. This combination of purpose and timing places it among the projects worth watching closely in the months ahead.

2025-07-11T18:00:39,"Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout","Shiba Inu (SHIB) might be on the verge of a powerful rally, according to crypto analyst MasterAnanda, who believes the popular meme coin could climb more than 1,500% in this cycle. The analyst predicts SHIB may cancel another zero and reach a new all-time high if a few key levels are cleared. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops ‚Äì Bullish Setup Takes Shape Signs Of A Possible Reversal SHIB has been stuck in a downtrend since March 2024. It peaked at $0.000045 before sliding back to close that month at $0.000030. Since then, the coin has moved within a descending triangle pattern, bouncing around the base while facing strong bearish pressure. However, something may be changing. SHIB has just printed a fully green weekly candle and gained 15% over the past seven days. According to analysts, this is one of the most bullish weekly moves since early May, when the token jumped 25%. Despite the optimism, SHIB remains below its 200-day moving average, which sits at $0.000016. That‚Äôs around 19% higher than its current price of $0.000013. Analysts see this as a critical level the token must beat to confirm a long-term bullish trend. Bullish Price Targets Appear On The Chart MasterAnanda believes SHIB will break above the triangle and make a run toward $0.000032, aligning with the 0.50 Fibonacci retracement level. If that plays out, the analyst sees a further move to $0.000067, then to $0.00010, which would represent a new all-time high. From there, two more possible targets have emerged using Fibonacci extensions: $0.00017 and $0.00022. Those would mark gains of 1,180% and 1,529%, respectively. While ambitious, other analysts have also supported a similar price path based on the same descending triangle breakout. Shiba Inu Sentiment Mixed As Greed Index Climbs Although bullish targets are grabbing headlines, market sentiment is still uncertain. Based on recent data, SHIB recorded green days on just 13 out of the last 30, and showed 4.25% price volatility. The current reading for sentiment is ‚ÄúNeutral‚Äù and the Fear & Greed Index stands at 69, which is in the ‚ÄúGreed‚Äù category. Price prediction tools indicate that SHIB could increase 27% to August 10, 2025, at about $0.000017. That will bring it nearer to its MA-200, but still far from the lofty targets being predicted by some analysts. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason SHIB holders are now waiting to see what‚Äôs next.

2025-07-11T18:00:37,"Bitcoin Holdings: ANAP‚Äôs Remarkable Ambition to Accumulate 1,000 BTC by August","In a move that‚Äôs sending ripples through the digital asset world, Japanese fashion company ANAP has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to cryptocurrency, significantly boosting its Bitcoin holdings . This bold decision positions ANAP as a notable player in the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption, signaling a deeper conviction in the future of decentralized finance. Are we witnessing the dawn of a new era where companies actively integrate digital assets into their core financial strategies? ANAP‚Äôs Ambitious BTC Accumulation : A Bold Statement According to insights shared by @btcNLNico on X, ANAP recently added a substantial 28.74 BTC to its reserves, pushing its total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 229.23 BTC. This isn‚Äôt just a casual purchase; it‚Äôs part of a publicly declared, ambitious plan. The company has previously articulated its intention to accumulate over 1,000 BTC for long-term holding by August. This aggressive BTC accumulation target is a clear indicator of ANAP‚Äôs strategic vision, highlighting their belief in Bitcoin as a robust asset class. This level of commitment from a non-traditional tech company like ANAP raises several interesting questions: Strategic Vision: What long-term benefits does ANAP foresee from such significant Bitcoin exposure? Market Confidence: Does this reflect growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs stability and growth potential? Pioneering Spirit: Is ANAP setting a precedent for other fashion or consumer goods companies to follow suit? Why ANAP‚Äôs Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Matters ANAP‚Äôs decision to aggressively increase its Bitcoin holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a statement about their innovative corporate Bitcoin strategy . In an increasingly volatile global economy, companies are seeking alternative ways to preserve and grow capital. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô offers a compelling hedge against inflation and a potential store of value, independent of traditional financial systems. For a fashion company, this move might seem unconventional, but it aligns with a broader trend seen across various industries. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously led the charge, demonstrating how a substantial allocation to Bitcoin can become a core part of a treasury management strategy. ANAP‚Äôs move suggests a sophisticated understanding of the digital asset landscape and a willingness to embrace new paradigms for financial resilience and growth. Understanding ANAP‚Äôs Strategic Crypto Investment What drives ANAP , a Japanese fashion company, to make such a significant crypto investment ? It‚Äôs likely a multi-faceted approach. Beyond the potential for capital appreciation, holding Bitcoin can offer: Diversification: Reducing reliance on traditional fiat currencies and volatile stock markets. Innovation Image: Positioning the company as forward-thinking and tech-savvy, appealing to a younger, digitally native consumer base. Long-Term Value: A belief that Bitcoin, with its finite supply and growing adoption, will continue to appreciate in value over time. This move by ANAP could inspire other companies, particularly those looking to enhance their brand image as innovators, to explore similar avenues of crypto investment . It signals a shift from viewing cryptocurrencies purely as speculative assets to recognizing them as legitimate components of a robust corporate treasury. The Broader Impact of Growing Bitcoin Holdings The continued growth of corporate Bitcoin holdings , exemplified by ANAP, has significant implications for the wider cryptocurrency market. Each company that adds Bitcoin to its balance sheet contributes to: Increased Legitimacy: Reinforcing Bitcoin‚Äôs status as a credible and investable asset class. Reduced Volatility: As more ‚Äòstrong hands‚Äô (long-term holders like corporations) accumulate BTC, it can potentially reduce market volatility. Supply Shock: With a finite supply, increased corporate demand could lead to a supply squeeze, potentially driving up prices in the long run. ANAP‚Äôs ambitious target of 1,000 BTC by August, if achieved, would make it a substantial corporate holder, adding significant buying pressure and further validating Bitcoin‚Äôs role in the global financial landscape. This ongoing BTC accumulation by corporations is a powerful testament to the digital asset‚Äôs enduring appeal and growing institutional acceptance. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Crypto Investment ANAP‚Äôs aggressive crypto investment strategy serves as a compelling case study for the evolving landscape of corporate finance.

Fibonacci extension levels now indicate an ambitious $4 target, with trading volume returning to the market amid Bitcoin‚Äôs historic price highs. Currently trading at $0.199 after experiencing a minor pullback, DOGE maintains a 10% daily gain while extending its weekly performance to 19.61%. $7.6 Billion Futures Bet on Dogecoin Rally As Analysts Agree DOGE is Primed for 2000% Breakout One of the most remarkable aspects of this rally is Dogecoin‚Äôs consistent trading volume, which has surpassed that of higher-ranked cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) . For perspective, DOGE recorded over $2.5 billion in trading volume with a market capitalization of $29.8 billion, while BNB generated $2.3 billion in volume despite its substantially larger $95.8 billion market cap.

In the futures market, over $7.6 billion has been traded within the past 24 hours, with positions betting on DOGE‚Äôs continued ascent. Source: Coinglass Open interest for Dogecoin remains decidedly positive, with approximately $2.7 billion in capital backing the meme coin over the last 24 hours. This heightened level of interest has prompted seasoned investors and analysts to believe Dogecoin can revisit its $0.7376 all-time high, achieved in 2021.

One of the movement‚Äôs most prominent long-term supporters is Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk, who has consistently advocated for the cryptocurrency. In April 2021, following Dogecoin‚Äôs historic highs, Musk posted that ‚ÄúSpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon,‚Äù referencing the popular crypto slang ‚Äúto the moon.‚Äù A year later, the SpaceX founder reaffirmed his commitment to supporting Dogecoin‚Äôs growth.

This bullish breakout is reinforced by a rising RSI, which has crossed above the 70 level, indicating strong buying pressure and potential for continued upward movement. Source: TradingView Additionally, the MACD histogram has turned positive, further supporting the bullish momentum thesis. Price currently hovers around $0.1985 and appears positioned to target the next key resistance zone near $0.30. Should momentum persist, DOGE could rally toward the $0.43‚Äì$0.45 region, which represents a previous high. A continuation beyond that level opens the path for a move toward $0.50 and eventually $0.58, aligning with the projected trajectory analysis. A short-term pullback may occur around $0.30 before the uptrend resumes, but the overall structure remains decidedly bullish.

Stating that a bigger bull run is ahead of us and calling the next phase a ‚Äúgigachad bull run,‚Äù Charles Hoskinson claimed that Bitcoin could reach $250,000. The Cardano founder claimed that Bitcoin's rise will be driven by the approval of two important bills: the GENIUS Stablecoin Act and the CLARITY Act. These bills aim to create a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoin and digital asset regulation. If passed, these bills could finally end the rivalry between the SEC and CFTC and provide cryptocurrency companies with a clear legal path forward. Hoskinson said that creating a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector will increase institutional adoption and bring trillions of capital that have been sitting on the sidelines into Bitcoin and altcoins. ‚ÄúI said the Gigachad bull run is coming.

2025-07-11T17:30:39,"Explosive OKX USDT Savings Rate: Unlocking Bull Market Potential","Are you ready for a fascinating dive into the world of cryptocurrency yields? Imagine waking up to find that the interest rate on your stablecoin savings has skyrocketed from a respectable 5% to an astonishing 53%. This isn‚Äôt a fantasy; it‚Äôs exactly what happened recently with the OKX USDT Simple Earn flexible savings product, sending ripples of excitement and speculation across the crypto community. Such a dramatic surge in the USDT savings rate is more than just an anomaly; many seasoned observers are pointing to it as a powerful indicator, potentially signaling the dawn of a new crypto bull market . What Triggered This Unprecedented OKX USDT Rate Spike? The crypto world thrives on volatility and opportunity, and the recent surge in OKX‚Äôs flexible savings product for USDT is a prime example. According to insights shared by Wu Blockchain on X, the interest rate for OKX USDT Simple Earn briefly jumped from its usual 5% to an incredible 53%. This wasn‚Äôt a sustained rate, but even a temporary spike of this magnitude demands attention. Wu Blockchain highlighted a crucial historical pattern: sharp increases in OKX‚Äôs Simple Earn rates have almost exclusively occurred during periods of intense market activity, typically associated with bull markets. This isn‚Äôt the first time we‚Äôve seen such a phenomenon. For instance, on November 10, 2024, the rate soared to 44% when Bitcoin experienced a significant rally, opening at $76,775 and closing at $80,474, as reported by Yahoo Finance data. These instances suggest a strong correlation between high stablecoin yields and burgeoning market confidence. Understanding OKX Simple Earn and Its Mechanics Before we delve deeper into the implications, let‚Äôs clarify what Simple Earn is. It‚Äôs a product offered by OKX that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings, including stablecoins like USDT. The ‚Äòflexible‚Äô aspect means users can deposit and withdraw their funds at any time, offering liquidity, unlike fixed-term products. The interest rates are dynamic, fluctuating based on market demand for borrowing the underlying assets. So, why would the demand for borrowing USDT suddenly spike to justify a 53% APY? Several factors could contribute: High Leverage Demand: During a bull run, traders often borrow stablecoins like USDT to open leveraged long positions on volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, anticipating further price increases. This increased borrowing demand drives up interest rates. Arbitrage Opportunities: Significant price discrepancies across different exchanges can lead to a surge in demand for stablecoins for arbitrage strategies, where traders profit from these price differences. Liquidity Needs: Exchanges might face temporary liquidity crunches for USDT due to massive trading volumes or large withdrawals, leading them to offer higher rates to attract deposits. Derivatives Market Activity: A booming derivatives market, especially perpetual futures, can create a strong demand for stablecoin collateral, pushing up borrowing costs. Is This the Definitive Crypto Bull Market Signal We‚Äôve Been Waiting For? The connection between surging USDT savings rate s and a crypto bull market is more than just anecdotal. It‚Äôs rooted in the fundamental economics of supply and demand within the crypto ecosystem. When confidence is high and asset prices are climbing, the appetite for risk increases. Traders want to maximize their exposure, and borrowing stablecoins to do so becomes a common strategy, even at elevated interest rates. Let‚Äôs consider the historical context: Date of Rate Spike OKX USDT Rate Bitcoin Price Action (Approx.) Market Sentiment Recent Spike 53% (briefly) Strong upward momentum Highly optimistic, ‚Äòfear of missing out‚Äô (FOMO) Nov 10, 2024 44% Opened $76,775, Closed $80,474 Building bullish sentiment Previous Bull Cycles Elevated rates (variable) Consistent rallies Widespread euphoria The direct correlation between these rate spikes and significant movements in Bitcoin price surge data, particularly its upward trajectory, strengthens the argument. It suggests that institutional and retail investors alike are actively seeking capital to participate in the rally, driving up the cost of borrowing stablecoins. While one indicator is rarely enough to confirm a bull market, this OKX USDT rate surge, coupled with the observed Bitcoin price surge , paints a compelling picture. It aligns with other common bull market signals such as: Increased trading volumes across major exchanges. Positive funding rates in perpetual futures markets. Mainstream media attention on crypto. Growing institutional investment. How Can Investors Leverage High USDT Savings Rates? For investors holding stablecoins, a soaring USDT savings rate presents an incredible opportunity for passive income. Even if the 53% rate was brief, the fact that rates can reach such levels, even temporarily, means that keeping an eye on these flexible earn products can be highly rewarding. It allows you to earn substantial returns on assets that are typically used to preserve capital and hedge against volatility. However, it‚Äôs crucial to approach these opportunities with a clear understanding of the benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: High Passive Income: Earning double-digit, or even triple-digit, APYs on a stablecoin is exceptionally rare in traditional finance. Capital Preservation: USDT is pegged to the US dollar, offering a degree of stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive option for parking funds while still earning yield. Flexibility: Products like OKX Simple Earn allow for easy deposit and withdrawal, giving users control over their funds. Challenges and Risks: Rate Volatility: Flexible rates can drop as quickly as they rise. The 53% was temporary, and rates can revert to lower levels. Platform Risk: While OKX is a major exchange, all centralized platforms carry some level of counterparty risk, including potential hacks or operational issues. Stablecoin De-peg Risk: Though rare for major stablecoins like USDT, there‚Äôs always a minimal risk of the stablecoin losing its peg to the underlying fiat currency. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto lending and yield products is still evolving, which could impact offerings in the future. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Given the signals and opportunities, how can you position yourself effectively? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Yield Products Actively: Keep a close watch on flexible earn products on major exchanges like OKX. Set up alerts for significant rate changes. Diversify Your Stablecoin Holdings: Don‚Äôt put all your stablecoin eggs in one basket. Consider holding a mix of USDT, USDC, and other reputable stablecoins across different platforms. Understand the Product: Before participating, fully understand the terms and conditions of any yield product. Is it flexible or fixed? What are the withdrawal fees or lock-up periods? Assess Risk Tolerance: High yields often come with higher risk. Only allocate funds you are comfortable with, especially in a volatile market. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, analysts, and on-chain data to gauge overall market sentiment and potential shifts towards a crypto bull market . The dramatic spike in OKX USDT rates is a compelling event that adds another layer to the ongoing discussion about the next major bull run. While not a standalone confirmation, it certainly aligns with the kind of market behavior typically observed when momentum is building. For those looking to capitalize, understanding the mechanics of these high yields and managing associated risks will be key to navigating what could be an exciting period for the crypto market. The confluence of a surging USDT savings rate and a strong Bitcoin price surge offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential for significant gains. As the market continues to evolve, staying vigilant and informed will empower you to make strategic decisions and potentially unlock substantial opportunities within the burgeoning digital asset space.

According to insights from TradingShot , this latest surge resembles previous upward trends recorded at the end of 2023. In those earlier instances, Bitcoin underwent a sharp correction of approximately 32% over 112 days before rebounding strongly by around 91.12%. Notably, this upward momentum has typically been supported by the one-week 50-period moving average ( MA ), as pointed out in a TradingView post on July 11. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The current rally, which began on April 7, 2025, appears to be following a similar path. If things unfold as they did before, the analyst noted that the market could see Bitcoin climb to just above $140,000. TradingShot also identified that a breakthrough from a bull flag pattern, formed between mid-May and June, has sparked this new surge. To this end, the outlook suggested that the maiden cryptocurrency might hit $140,000 as early as August 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs short-term target Another analyst, Ted Pillows, shared a similar optimistic view. In an X post on July 10, he mentioned that Bitcoin could very well reach $120,000 in the short term. He connected this growth to patterns known as Wyckoff Accumulation, noting that the increase in the global M2 money supply is a key factor driving this rally. Pillows explained how Bitcoin‚Äôs movements align with the stages of Wyckoff‚Äôs model: it goes through an accumulation phase, then a spring, followed by a successful test, and finally a sign of strength that leads to the breakout. $BTC hit a new ATH today.

This usually indicates that investors are moving tokens to self-custodial wallets, holding them for the long run. The overall Aave network total value locked has spiked since the start of July, reaching $28.9 billion from $25 billion in June. Its TVL overtook last year‚Äôs December highs of $22 billion already in April of 2025. This consistent growth suggests rising adoption for this Ethereum (ETH) based DeFi lending protocol.

2025-07-11T17:22:26,"Bitcoin's Historic $117K Breakthrough: Why This Could Be Just the Beginning of a Multi-Year Bull Run and Which Altcoin Will Lead It?","Bitcoin has surged to an unprecedented $117K , igniting excitement in the crypto community. This milestone could mark the start of a prolonged bull market. The focus now shifts to identifying which altcoin might spearhead this growth phase. This article delves into the potential candidates primed for significant gains in the coming years. Jupiter's Market Outlook: From Recovery Glimpse to Critical Levels JUP performance saw a decline of just over 1% in the last month, while the six-month performance recorded a drop of 39.68%. A recent weekly rebound of nearly 7% suggests short-term recovery within a trading range of $0.337 to $0.573. Price movement during these periods highlights significant volatility, with a dominant bearish influence evident in the longer view despite some recent positive momentum. Current price action is confined between firm support near $0.21 and initial resistance at $0.69, with secondary resistance around $0.92. The market shows mixed signals as short-term gains confront a broader bearish trend, creating a balance between bulls and bears. An RSI near 60 suggests slight buying interest, yet ongoing caution is warranted given the significant six-month decline. Trading ideas focus on monitoring activity around the $0.21 support for potential bounce entries, while a break above $0.69 could signal further upward movement. Sei Coin Shows Recovery After Extended Downturn SEI surged by over 56% in the last month, contrasting with a 16% decline over the past six months. Recent performance includes a nearly 20% rise in one week, indicating renewed trader interest. The price action has been volatile, featuring bursts of rallying followed by cautious retreats, reflecting mixed market sentiment among altcoins. Current price action centers around a range of $0.18 to $0.36, with key technical levels attracting attention. Nearest resistance at $0.44 is crucial for bulls aiming for further gains, while support at $0.08 offers a safety net for buyers. A second resistance at $0.61 warrants close observation for signs of strength or weakness. Although bulls seem dominant, the lack of a clear trend necessitates careful trading. Strategies include accumulating within the current range and preparing for potential breakouts above $0.44 while monitoring for shifts in momentum near support levels. Ondo: Mixed Signals Amid Short-Term Recovery and Long-Term Decline Last month ONDO saw almost no change with a modest 0.15% gain while the six-month period revealed a clear 29.26% drop. Weekly results, however, spiked with a 12.96% increase, hinting at brief investor optimism. Price levels have trended within a narrow band recently, even as the longer view exposes caution among market participants. Limited monthly movement contrasts with the sharper downturn over six months, suggesting that immediate sentiment may lean toward recovery, but the overall trend remains weak due to prolonged selling pressure. Current trading levels for Ondo show a confined range between $0.62 and $0.92, with resistance at $1.07 and support at $0.47. The coin demonstrates short-term momentum with a 12.96% increase over the past week, while the one-month price change remains nearly flat at 0.15%. Slight bullish signals from the momentum indicator and Awesome Oscillator suggest building buying pressure, but the market has not reached extreme conditions. There is a mild uptrend, and bulls might target the first resistance on moves upward, while bears could use the $0.47 support level to exert pressure if prices decline. Traders should focus on moves between these levels, watching for breaks and consolidating strategies accordingly. Conclusion The breakthrough signals the start of a long-term upward movement. With Bitcoin leading, attention turns to promising altcoins. JUP , SEI , and ONDO show potential to capitalize on this bullish market. Their unique features and solid developments position them as frontrunners. This period of growth offers significant opportunities for these coins to advance and capture interest.

2025-07-11T17:21:30,"Best Altcoins to Watch as Trump Eyes Quick Crypto Win with Stablecoin Bill","Is the US finally ready to publish its first-ever major piece of crypto legislation? President Donald Trump urged House Republicans to swiftly pass the Senate-approved stablecoin bill ‚Äì officially the GENIUS Act ‚Äì signaling an imminent White House signing that would usher in the first comprehensive federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. And if the bill passes, it could set the stage for key altcoins ‚Äì non-Bitcoin cryptos ‚Äì to surge and deliver big wins to their investors. A Clean Pass in the House? Both publicly and behind the scenes, Trump has been calling on the House GOP to adopt a ‚Äòclean‚Äô version of the GENIUS Act , without amendments that might slow or derail action. The Senate already passed the bill 68-30, indicating strong bipartisan support. A quick House vote this week would position Trump to sign the bill into law in short order; any major changes would require another Senate vote. The Guide and Establish National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) aims to address longstanding calls for clear crypto oversight. It establishes strict standards for stablecoin issuers, including reserve backing, auditing, and transparency, and sets up a regulatory framework involving both federal oversight and state-level supervision. The Act won bipartisan approval in mid-June. It represents one of the most significant crypto policy achievements by legislators to date, and with Trump‚Äôs endorsement, advocates hope momentum will now carry it through the House. GENIUS ‚Äì Part of a Broader Strategy Trump‚Äôs signature could act as a powerful endorsement for both stablecoins (cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the value of a stable asset, like the US dollar) and crypto in general, helping secure mainstream acceptance. Crypto enthusiasts and industry experts see the move as a clear signal that the US is open for crypto business. This legislation ties into Trump‚Äôs larger crypto agenda, which includes a suite of executive actions earlier this year: Creating a strategic US Bitcoin reserve Disbanding crypto enforcement teams Directing federal agencies to audit digital holdings Empowering bank participation in crypto The GENIUS Act could lock this agenda into law, cementing regulatory clarity. And with regulation would almost certainly come a wave in investor interest and renewed momentum. Bitcoin just set a new all-time-high at $118, so any additional positivity could be pouring fuel on a Bitcoin explosion. These three altcoins could heat up fast. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) ‚Äì Sniff Out Fast-Moving Meme Coin Targets for Max Gains Meme coins offer a unique opportunity. Thousands launch daily, many delivering significant returns. But most investors miss these opportunities ‚Äì after all, countless meme coins come and go, often unseen on platforms like Telegram. Snorter Token ($SNORT) changes the game entirely. With its powerful Snorter Bot, investors can easily identify promising meme coins before they go mainstream. This specialized trading bot scans Telegram to pinpoint low-cap Solana-based meme coins poised for explosive growth. When it finds the right opportunities, traders can leverage Snorter‚Äôs automated sniping tools and lightning-fast transaction speeds to seize the best chances. Holding $SNORT tokens grants investors exclusive early access to these hidden gems, putting them ahead of the broader market. Snorter Token also offers the benefits of the Solana blockchain, including minimal trading fees, alongside built-in safeguards against front-running and MEV attacks. Key features of the Snorter Bot include: Rapid and secure token swaps Automated sniping capabilities Protection against rugpulls and honeypots Integrated copy trading Advanced limit orders Interest in the $SNORT presale is surging, with over $1.7M already raised. Investors can currently secure tokens for just $0.0979, but this opportunity won‚Äôt last long. Learn exactly how to buy Snorter Token ‚Äì and what it is ‚Äì by checking out our detailed guides. Visit the Snorter Token ($SNORT) presale page for more information. 2. Cardano ($ADA) ‚Äì Former Ethereum-Killer, Now Altcoin Powerhouse The Cardano Foundation, brains behind the 10th-largest crypto by market cap, is currently sitting on $659M in assets as of the end of 2024. Staking generated an additional 17.1M $ADA tokens last year, delivering major returns to token holders. That, and Bitcoin‚Äôs upwards pull, helps explain Cardano‚Äôs recent performance. $ADA is up nearly 20% in the past 24 hours, and over 31% in the past week. While once positioned as a so-called ‚ÄòEthereum-killer,‚Äô the Cardano blockchain has grown into its own DeFi powerhouse. Last month, Charles Hoskinson ‚Äì one of Cardano‚Äôs founders ‚Äì proposed that the Foundation convert $100M of $ADA into Bitcoin to begin its own $BTC treasury. While that hasn‚Äôt happened yet, Cardano certainly has the assets to make it happen ‚Äì and that could propel $ADA‚Äôs price even higher. 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ‚Äì The Token To Unleash Bitcoin‚Äôs True Power As Hoskinson‚Äôs proposed Cardano treasury indicates, Bitcoin treasuries are all the rage, even at all-time-high prices. But is Bitcoin really the smartest crypto play? Or is there a Bitcoin upgrade lurking around the corner ‚Äì one with the potential to unlock all of Bitcoin‚Äôs buying power across the entire crypto ecosystem? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, could potentially be an even better play for long-term investors. Tokens are available for only $0.012225, meaning there‚Äôs incredible potential for growth once the presale ends. Bitcoin Hyper leverages Bitcoin Canonical Bridge and the power of the Bitcoin Relay Program on the SVM ( Solana Virtual Machine ) to unlock full DeFi and zero-knowledge (ZK) applications for Bitcoin.

Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale for all the latest information. Only a GENIUS Will Know What Happens Next The House votes on the version of the GENIUS Act endorsed by Trump. If it passes cleanly, Trump expects to sign the bill into law ASAP.

2025-07-11T17:20:39,"Bitcoin‚Äôs Alarming Shift: Retail Holdings Plummet on Centralized Exchanges","The world of Bitcoin is always in motion, and recent data points to a significant, perhaps alarming, shift in who holds the digital gold. Are you a retail investor in Bitcoin? Then you‚Äôll want to pay close attention to this evolving narrative. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X has highlighted a compelling trend: the share of retail BTC holdings is steadily decreasing. This isn‚Äôt just a minor fluctuation; it‚Äôs a profound change that could redefine the market‚Äôs dynamics and investor strategies. Are Retail BTC Holdings Really Shrinking? Unveiling a Crucial Market Shift The numbers speak volumes. According to the analysis, the total Bitcoin balance across centralized exchanges (CEXs) has plummeted to approximately 2.4 million BTC. This represents a substantial decline of more than 360,000 BTC since the start of the current year, a reduction estimated to be worth around $42.8 billion at recent market prices. This significant outflow from CEXs, particularly concerning the retail segment, suggests a deeper transformation in how Bitcoin is being held and utilized. For years, centralized exchanges have been the primary gateway for millions of retail investors to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin. They offered convenience, liquidity, and a relatively straightforward user experience. However, this recent data indicates that a considerable portion of retail BTC holdings is moving off these platforms. This shift isn‚Äôt uniform across the board, but the overall trend is clear: the collective Bitcoin stash of smaller, individual investors on exchanges is diminishing. What does this mean for the everyday investor? It signals a maturing market where custody preferences are evolving, and perhaps, where the lines between retail and institutional participation are blurring. The implications for market liquidity, price discovery, and even regulatory oversight are profound. Understanding the Bitcoin Decline on Centralized Exchanges: What‚Äôs Driving It? The observed Bitcoin decline on centralized exchanges isn‚Äôt a singular phenomenon; it‚Äôs likely a confluence of several powerful trends reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the bigger picture: Shift to Self-Custody: A growing number of Bitcoin holders are embracing the mantra of ‚Äònot your keys, not your coin.‚Äô Concerns over exchange security breaches, regulatory uncertainties, and the desire for true ownership are prompting many to move their BTC into hardware wallets or other self-custody solutions. This empowers individuals with complete control over their assets, reducing reliance on third-party custodians. Institutional Accumulation: As Bitcoin gains legitimacy, institutional players like asset managers, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are entering the market. These large entities often acquire Bitcoin through over-the-counter (OTC) desks or dedicated institutional platforms, bypassing retail-focused centralized exchanges entirely. Their accumulation doesn‚Äôt show up in CEX retail balances, yet it absorbs significant supply. Regulatory Scrutiny and Compliance: Increased regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges, including stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, might deter some users who prefer more privacy or find the verification processes cumbersome. This could push certain retail participants to alternative, less regulated avenues or simply off-exchange. Emergence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and DEXs: While not a direct cause of CEX outflows, the rise of decentralized finance protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offers alternative avenues for trading, lending, and earning yield on Bitcoin (often wrapped Bitcoin, or WBTC). This provides options beyond traditional centralized platforms, potentially diverting activity. Maturity of the Asset: Bitcoin is increasingly seen less as a purely speculative asset for quick gains and more as a long-term store of value or a hedge against inflation. Investors with a long-term conviction are more likely to move their holdings off trading platforms and into secure cold storage, reducing the liquid supply on exchanges. This multi-faceted Bitcoin decline on CEXs reflects a maturing ecosystem where various forces are at play, each contributing to the evolving distribution of Bitcoin ownership. The Evolving Role of Centralized Exchanges in a Maturing Market For a long time, centralized exchanges were synonymous with cryptocurrency trading. They served as the primary on-ramps and off-ramps for fiat currency, providing liquidity and a user-friendly interface for new entrants. However, the market has evolved significantly, and with it, the role of these exchanges is undergoing a profound transformation. In the early days, CEXs were often the only practical way for individuals to access Bitcoin. They facilitated price discovery and provided the necessary infrastructure for a nascent market. Today, while still critical, they face new challenges and opportunities. Security breaches, though less frequent now, have historically eroded trust. Regulatory frameworks are tightening globally, imposing new compliance burdens and sometimes limiting services in certain regions. Furthermore, the growth of self-custody solutions, institutional trading desks, and decentralized alternatives means that CEXs are no longer the sole arbiters of crypto activity. They must innovate to remain competitive and relevant. This often involves offering a wider range of services beyond simple spot trading, such as staking, lending, derivatives, and specialized yield products. The future of centralized exchanges hinges on their ability to adapt to a more sophisticated user base and a highly dynamic regulatory and technological environment. What Does a Lower BTC Balance on CEXs Signify for Bitcoin‚Äôs Future? A shrinking BTC balance on centralized exchanges is more than just a data point; it‚Äôs a significant indicator with several interpretations for Bitcoin‚Äôs future trajectory. It suggests a fundamental shift in market structure and investor behavior: Reduced Retail Speculation: Fewer Bitcoins held on exchanges could imply a decrease in the immediate availability for speculative day trading by retail investors. This doesn‚Äôt mean retail interest is waning entirely, but rather that their approach to holding Bitcoin might be shifting from short-term trading to long-term investment. Increased Long-Term Conviction: When investors move their Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage, it typically signifies a strong long-term conviction. They are not planning to sell in the near future and are prioritizing security and self-sovereignty. This ‚Äòhodling‚Äô mentality can contribute to a more stable market base. Institutionalization: The decline in CEX balances often correlates with an increase in institutional activity. As large funds and corporations accumulate Bitcoin, they tend to do so through private deals or specialized custodians, keeping their holdings off the public order books of retail exchanges. This further cements Bitcoin‚Äôs status as an institutional-grade asset. Potential for Supply Shock: A lower liquid supply of Bitcoin on exchanges can amplify price movements. If demand surges while available supply for immediate trading is limited, it could lead to more volatile price swings, potentially to the upside. This concept is often referred to as a ‚Äòsupply shock.‚Äô Ultimately, a decreasing BTC balance on centralized exchanges points towards a maturing asset class. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its early, highly speculative phase and is being increasingly held for its fundamental value and long-term potential, rather than purely for short-term trading opportunities. OKX‚Äôs Strategic Play: A Glimmer of Hope Amidst the Outflows? Amidst the general trend of outflows from centralized exchanges, OKX stands out as an interesting exception. In the past 24 hours (at the time of the analyst‚Äôs report), it was the only exchange among the top five by BTC holdings to record a net inflow. This counter-trend movement is likely linked to the introduction of OKX‚Äôs BTC Yield+ product, a strategic offering designed to attract and retain Bitcoin holders. The BTC Yield+ product aims to address several key concerns for investors: Capital Preservation: The product is designed with mechanisms to preserve the principal investment, a crucial factor for risk-averse investors. Interest Returns: It offers interest returns on deposited Bitcoin, providing a passive income stream for holders who might otherwise simply hold their BTC idly in a wallet. Flexible Deposits and Withdrawals: The flexibility to deposit and withdraw funds as needed makes it attractive to those who want to earn yield without locking up their assets for extended periods. OKX ‚Äòs success with this product highlights a potential pathway for centralized exchanges to adapt to the evolving market. By offering innovative, yield-generating products that cater to the desire for passive income while mitigating perceived risks, exchanges can still attract significant capital. This demonstrates that while some investors are moving to self-custody, others are willing to keep their Bitcoin on exchanges if compelling, secure, and flexible earning opportunities are available. This strategic move by OKX could set a precedent for how other exchanges approach user retention and asset management in a competitive and maturing market. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor The shifting landscape of Bitcoin holdings presents both challenges and opportunities for retail investors. To navigate this evolving market effectively, consider these actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Custody Strategy: Understand the pros and cons of self-custody versus using centralized exchanges. For long-term holdings, a hardware wallet offers superior security. For active trading or yield-earning opportunities, CEXs might still be suitable, but choose reputable platforms with strong security track records. Diversify Your Investment Approach: Beyond simply buying and holding spot Bitcoin, explore various strategies. This could include participating in yield-generating products like OKX‚Äôs BTC Yield+, exploring DeFi protocols (with thorough due diligence), or even considering Bitcoin-backed loans if it aligns with your financial goals. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is constantly changing. Keep abreast of new laws and guidelines in your jurisdiction, as they can impact how you can hold, trade, and use your Bitcoin. Perform Due Diligence on Yield Products: While attractive, yield products come with their own set of risks, including smart contract risk, counterparty risk, and impermanent loss in some DeFi scenarios. Always research the product, the platform, and the underlying mechanisms before committing your funds. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: The trend of Bitcoin moving off exchanges into cold storage suggests a market that is increasingly focused on long-term value rather than short-term speculation. Aligning your strategy with this long-term view can help you weather market volatility and capitalize on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential as a store of value. By understanding these market shifts and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can position yourself to thrive in Bitcoin‚Äôs dynamic ecosystem. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin‚Äôs Evolving Landscape The analysis revealing a significant decline in retail BTC holdings on centralized exchanges underscores a critical phase in Bitcoin‚Äôs journey. It‚Äôs a clear signal that the market is maturing, with investors increasingly opting for self-custody or seeking out innovative products that offer yield without compromising on capital preservation. This shift away from traditional exchange-based holding by retail participants, coupled with growing institutional interest, paints a picture of a Bitcoin ecosystem that is becoming more sophisticated and diversified. While this trend presents challenges for centralized exchanges, it also spurs innovation, as exemplified by OKX‚Äôs successful BTC Yield+ product. For investors, understanding these evolving dynamics is not just academic; it‚Äôs essential for making informed decisions about how to secure, manage, and grow their Bitcoin investments in a landscape that is constantly redefining itself.

NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE today announced the closing of a $8 million Series A funding round led by Fulgur Ventures. The capital will fast-track the expansion of a Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure that merges regulated issuance with seamless trading for retail and institutional clients worldwide. Early access to NEXPLACE is now available ‚Äî users can join the waitlist here . NEXBRIDGE will use the proceeds to launch new digital assets and pursue additional listings across licensed exchanges. NEXPLACE will accelerate development and go-to-market execution ahead of its H2 2025 launch, while advancing further licensing efforts in key jurisdictions. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE currently operate as separate entities, but share the same shareholder group and strategic roadmap‚Äî with plans to consolidate under a single holding once the necessary corporate and jurisdictional steps are completed. ‚ÄúOur vision for BitcoinFi is simple: bring the safeguards of traditional capital markets onto Bitcoin rails and make digital assets accessible with 24/7 efficiency‚Äî through compliant, global infrastructure,‚Äù said Michele Crivelli, Founder & CEO of both companies. Today we focus on secure access to familiar exposures like bonds or equities‚Äîmade available through NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, with our own platform built to evolve and unlock advanced features over time. Tomorrow, we‚Äôll enable businesses to raise capital on-chain through native, regulated digital instruments designed to move funds directly to the issuer, without traditional intermediaries.‚Äù A new on-chain market architecture NEXBRIDGE issues regulated digital assets backed by real underlying value, offering both familiar exposures and new formats for accessing them. In November 2024, NEXBRIDGE launched USTBL‚Äîthe first public, regulated digital asset backed by U.S. Treasury Bills and issued on Bitcoin infrastructure via the Liquid Network. Initially listed on Bitfinex Securities, USTBL is now preparing to expand across additional licensed exchanges. Following this, El Salvador‚Äôs digital‚Äëasset regulator (CNAD) approved a broader range of products‚Äîspanning from single-stock exposures to multi-asset strategies‚Äîset to launch on NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, including through NEXBRIDGE‚Äôs own OTC desk. NEXPLACE, licensed as a Digital Asset Service Provider, offers a unified venue for trading a wide range of digital assets‚Äîfrom native cryptocurrencies and utility tokens to asset-linked instruments. Advanced features‚Äîsuch as using eligible tokenized assets as collateral for derivatives‚Äîwill be gradually rolled out following launch. Unlike models where tokenized assets are mere digital wrappers of off-chain products, NEXBRIDGE issues digital assets that are regulated at the token level. Each issuance is formally approved by CNAD, receives a unique instrument identifier, and includes public disclosures such as proof-of-reserve attestations and a dedicated termsheet detailing key information. In this model, transparency and regulatory oversight apply directly to the digital asset users hold and trade‚Äînot just to the structure behind it. While initial distribution will occur primarily via NEXPLACE, the infrastructure is designed for openness. NEXBRIDGE‚Äôs regulatory architecture allows its assets to be listed on other licensed trading venues‚Äîensuring portability. This dual model bridges two worlds: providing secure, regulated access to digital markets for global users‚Äîespecially those in fast-growing emerging economies‚Äîwhile giving institutions a simplified interface to manage both crypto and asset-linked positions with full transparency. ‚ÄúThis raise helps us unlock a new generation of asset-linked digital products‚Äîespecially for users in markets where access to dollar-based exposure has been limited,‚Äù Crivelli added. ‚ÄúEach token we issue is directly regulated, with its own public termsheet, governance, and oversight‚Äîrather than being a passive mirror of an off-chain asset. That‚Äôs a structural shift - and a foundation we can build on.‚Äù Strategic alignment and investor support Fulgur Ventures, the lead investor, supports Bitcoin‚Äënative infrastructure with real‚Äëworld applications. ‚ÄúBitcoin continues to establish itself as a unique, scarce digital asset‚Äînow increasingly relevant to institutional finance,‚Äù said Oleg Mikhalsky, Partner at Fulgur Ventures. ‚ÄúTraditional financial institutions are beginning to recognize Bitcoin not only as a store of value but also as a settlement layer for both monetary transactions and tokenized instruments. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE demonstrate a meaningful, real-world use case enabled by the Liquid Network that reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs role in capital markets‚Äîa development Fulgur is proud to support.‚Äù Blockstream ‚Äî the Bitcoin infrastructure firm behind the Liquid Network layer-2 that powers asset issuance and settlement ‚Äî emphasized the partnership‚Äôs strategic potential. ‚ÄúBy powering NEXBRIDGE‚Äôs digital asset issuance and NEXPLACE‚Äôs trading platform with the Liquid Network, we‚Äôre helping shape a new generation of capital markets‚Äîanchored to Bitcoin‚Äôs security, built for global scale, said Adam Back, Co‚Äëfounder & CEO of Blockstream.
