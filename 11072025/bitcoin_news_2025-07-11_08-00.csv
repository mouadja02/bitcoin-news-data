This came as bitcoin’s price surge kept going in the past 12 hours or so, hitting a fresh all-time high above $117,000. James Wynn’s $BTC short position got fully liquidated in less than 12 hours, resulting in another loss of $27,921.63! https://t.co/205yuTcrz1 pic.twitter.com/AyVORksque — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 11, 2025 What’s particularly interesting about today’s liquidation is the amount of time BTC needed to prove the naysayer wrong – under 12 hours. Wynn opened the trade yesterday on Hyperliquid by depositing almost $28,000 and claimed a referral bonus of over $3,950. However, this is far from the first instance where Wynn’s known wallet has been wrecked. As previously reported , some of his most painful losses resulted in multi-million-dollar wipeouts, which raised multiple questions within the community, including from Arthur Hayes. Bitcoin’s price pumps over the past 36-48 hours, in which the asset flew from under $108,000 to a new all-time high of over $117,000 earlier today, has left other short whales in limbo as well. Recall that this one was wrecked for more than $51 million during the initial surge. Lookonchain, though, reported another one, who is currently down by more than $10 million on their short position but deposited another $5.5 million USDC to Hyperliquid to avoid liquidations. Whale 0x5D2F is down over $10M on a 1,135 $BTC ($132.65M) short position. To avoid liquidation, he deposited another 5.5M $USDC into Hyperliquid.

2025-07-11T05:21:52,"Altcoin Mania Incoming: Bitcoin Confirms Breakout, XRP Price Targets $3","The post Altcoin Mania Incoming: Bitcoin Confirms Breakout, XRP Price Targets $3 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is rising again as Bitcoin’s price surged from $113,000 to $117,000 in a single day, currently hovering around $116,000. This fresh breakout hints at the possible start of a new bull rally, with analysts expecting more gains ahead. As always, market volatility is expected, with price swings and retests of support levels. But the overall trend is clearly bullish. Despite months of market fears like tariffs, war news, and regulatory crackdowns, on-chain data and market charts have consistently supported that a bull market was still intact, and it’s now showing on the price charts. Not just Bitcoin, but altcoins are waking up too. Ethereum has crossed $2,900, up 14% this week. XRP surged to $2.57, gaining 13%, while Solana rose to $164, up 8% in seven days. This pattern follows the typical bull market cycle where liquidity rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins after BTC makes strong moves. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? In technical terms, Bitcoin has also broken out of major resistance areas on multiple charts, including a long-standing descending channel and a bullish cup-and-handle pattern on the 3-day chart. If this breakout holds, it could set Bitcoin on a path toward $150,000 in the coming months. According to the analysis, the current market structure is holding up well. Key support is sitting at around $112,100, and as long as Bitcoin stays above this level, the upward momentum is expected to continue. A dip below this price would shift attention to lower support areas, including the $107,300 range. While a short-term pullback could happen, strong rallies like this tend to surprise on the upside. Bitcoin’s recent climb past its earlier resistance levels signals that the market could still have room to run. Global liquidity is also on the rise, stock markets like the S&P 500 are hitting new all-time highs, and the U.S. dollar is weakening, a combination historically favorable for crypto.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-mania-incoming-bitcoin-confirms-breakout-xrp-price-targets-3/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|XRP","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T05:15:25,"BTC breakout gives $230K target, MUTM becomes the top crypto to buy","Bitcoin’s recent surge is capturing attention in the crypto market. The BTC price is forming a classic cup-and-handle pattern, signaling a potential climb to $230,000 if it breaks key resistance levels. The current bullish momentum reflects growing confidence among investors, driven by favorable global economic conditions. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a top crypto to buy, with its presale in Phase 5 drawing over 13,000 holders. Having raised 12,000,000 and sold over 580 million tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling opportunity. Its current price of $0.03 ensures a guaranteed 100% return at the $0.06 launch. This positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a standout in the crypto investment space. Bitcoin’s path to $230K Bitcoin is performing well on crypto charts, and analysts cite its cup-and-handle formation as among its major boosters. This technical formation may indicate that the prices will experience a breakout, and thus prices may upsurge to an estimated $230,000. Hodlers of the cryptocurrency are optimistic with the recent cryptocurrency prices fluctuating around the levels of $107,000. Busting the resistance at this point may trigger a significant uptrend. Besides, institutional interest is on the rise in the crypto market, which contributed to Bitcoin going up. However, retail investors are also seeking affordable entries. This shift is directing attention to promising projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Consequently, investors are diversifying, balancing Bitcoin’s growth with emerging tokens offering high returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale surges Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing through Phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, with tokens priced at $0.03. This marks a 200% increase from the first phase’s $0.01. Over 65% of Phase 5 is filled, signaling the window to buy at this price is closing fast. Phase 6 will raise the price to $0.035, a 16.7% jump. Buying now locks in a 100% return at the $0.06 launch, based on tokenomics. Furthermore, projections suggest a post-launch value of $3 in 2025, offering a 9,900% return. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised 12,000,000 and sold over 580 million tokens, attracting 13,000 holders since the presale began. Innovative lending fuels Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending model, blending peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer systems. Users retain full asset ownership, ensuring flexibility and security. The peer-to-contract system uses smart contracts for automated, market-responsive lending. Conversely, peer-to-peer lending allows direct, customizable transactions. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, resistant to depegging, enhancing transaction reliability. The team has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK, rewarding discoveries across critical, major, minor, and low tiers. This strengthens trust in the platform. Community rewards drive engagement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is boosting participation with a $100,000 giveaway , splitting $10,000 in tokens among 10 winners. Entry requires a $50 presale investment and completing simple quests. Additionally, a new dashboard rewards the top 50 holders with bonus tokens, fostering community loyalty. These initiatives highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s focus on user engagement. Furthermore, its lending model and stablecoin development position it for long-term growth. Investors are drawn to its practical utility, making it a top choice in crypto investment. The project’s transparency and security further enhance its appeal. Riding the crypto wave Bitcoin’s potential climb to $230,000 underscores the crypto market’s dynamic nature, with crypto prices reflecting strong momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a good crypto to buy with a low token entry price or 0.03 USD and a guaranteed 100 percent return on launch. Its unique lending and its strong security, and community rewards are an attractive option. As Phase 5 nears completion, investors should act swiftly to secure tokens before the price rises.

2025-07-11T05:12:54,"Will Crypto Markets Keep Surging When $4B Bitcoin Options Expire Today?","Around 36,800 Bitcoin options contracts will expire on Friday, July 11, and they have a notional value of roughly $4 billion. This event is larger than last week’s expiry but unlikely to be enough to influence spot markets, which have performed better towards the end of the week. US President Trump’s tariff deadline came and went with tariffs imposed on countries that did not make a prior deal with Uncle Sam. As predicted , Bitcoin reached an all-time high and has moved into new price discovery. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.94, meaning that there are slightly more calls expiring than put contracts. There is also a max pain point of $107,000, around $9,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $120,000, with almost $2 billion at this strike price. There is also $1.8 billion OI at $115,000 and $1.7 billion OI at $140,000 as bullish speculators load up on contracts.

However, these comments were before Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $117,000. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 238,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $609 million, a max pain point of $2,550, and a put/call ratio of 1.04. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $4.6 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have surged 4% over the past 24 hours to reach $3.7 trillion total capitalization, the highest level since January. The move has been driven by Bitcoin, which surged to an all-time high of over $117,300 following a 5.5% daily gain during late trading on Thursday. The asset is now trading in new price discovery, having broken out of its two-month sideways channel. Ethereum has also broken out with a 6.5% daily surge to come just shy of $3,000. The asset was trading at a five-month high of $3,000 at the time of writing during the Friday morning Asian session. The altcoins were all in the green with larger gains for Dogecoin, Cardano, Sui, and Hedera.

2025-07-11T05:09:02,"Why the Ethereum Foundation Sold 1,210 ETH Today?","The post Why the Ethereum Foundation Sold 1,210 ETH Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Ethereum Foundation sold 1,210 ETH for approximately $3.5 million in USDC via Uniswap V4, with the transaction averaging $2,889.50 per ETH. This sale follows a recent series of fund movements, during which approximately 21,000 ETH were consolidated into a multisig wallet over the past month. From this wallet, 7,000 ETH was further distributed, including today’s sale from a secondary address. The transaction, tracked live via Lookonchain, adds a real-time layer of insight into the Foundation’s treasury operations. A wallet linked to the #EthereumFoundation sold 1,210 $ETH for 3.5M $USDC at an average price of ~$2,890 over the past 6 hours. https://t.co/2srVIybEGt pic.twitter.com/ez1k5Q6uT1 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 11, 2025 Strategic Reallocation, Not Panic This sale appears to align with the Foundation’s long-standing practice of measured asset management, likely aimed at funding development, grants, and ecosystem initiatives. Rather than flooding the market or creating panic, these controlled offloads are meant to support operational expenses transparently. Despite occasional calls for ETH to be staked or funneled into DeFi, the Foundation maintains a neutral stance that prioritizes long-term project health and flexibility. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum ETF Inflows Cross $320M, Is a Major ETH Price Rally Ahead? , Price Action and Whale Accumulation Ethereum price recently touched $3,000 before pulling back, establishing key support near $2,750. Notably, while the Foundation is selling, other players are buying heavily. Over $358 million in ETH has been scooped up by whales and institutional wallets in the past 24 hours, signaling growing confidence from the smart money side of the market. Rising TVL, Falling Fees Even though the Ethereum network is being used more, with total value locked (TVL) rising from $50 billion to $73 billion in just three months, this hasn’t boosted demand for ETH itself. Moreover, the network fees have dropped 22% in the last month. Hence, Lower fees mean less ETH is burned, which weakens its appeal as a deflationary asset. This drop in fee revenue may be one reason the Foundation chose to sell today. Overall, today’s ETH sale by the Ethereum Foundation looks more like routine treasury management than anything negative. With institutions still buying and Ethereum gaining more real-world use, the overall outlook remains strong, even as on-chain demand takes a breather. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum’s price is up today due to several converging factors: massive institutional demand flowing into spot Ethereum ETFs (like BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust), a structural squeeze in circulating supply from staking and token burns, and a broader surge in the crypto market following Bitcoin’s new all-time highs. What is the Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies. It was founded in 2014 and is based in Switzerland. Its mission is to allocate resources to critical projects, advocate for Ethereum, and foster a decentralized, open-source ecosystem without controlling the network itself.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-the-ethereum-foundation-sold-1210-eth-today/,"ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

The launch created massive interest online and raised over $10 million in sales. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back In ‘Retesting Phase’ After Key Level Reclaim – The Calm Before The Storm? Snoop Dogg’s Telegram Drop Raises $12 Million On Wednesday, Snoop Dogg launched digital collectibles on Telegram, igniting an NFT frenzy on the platform. The collection offered unique NFTs inspired by the rapper’s style, including multiple marijuana-themed collectibles, anthropomorphic beagles, and vintage cars. The drop is part of Telegram’s Collectible Gifts, unique works of art on the platform that can be displayed on profiles and have special attributes. As the website explains, the collectibles can be transferred between users or auctioned on NFT marketplaces. Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, revealed that the Snoop Dogg drop sold out in 30 minutes, selling 996,000 NFTs for $12 million, adding that “Blockchain minting and the secondary market go live in 21 days. It’s going to be wild.” Last week, Durov shared that the 4th of July-themed Gifts also sold out within minutes, with over 800,000 collectibles selling in 10 minutes. Amid the collectibles’ launch, the rapper promoted it alongside a new track titled “Gifts” on his official Telegram Channel. He shared the link to the song’s music video and tagged Durov’s Telegram channel, saying, “time to drop it like it’s hot.” In the track, Snoop Dogg shouts out Toncoin (TON), the native token of the TON Blockchain, and Telegram. “Plug in my phone, get dressed, and then I plot my play / Critical existence, digital resistance / Shifted, gifted, and lifted / (…) / Stickers and games on Telegram, guess it’s coming soon / My privacy is not for sale,” some of the lyrics read. Notably, this isn’t the rapper’s first NFT venture, as he entered the space when the sector first gained mainstream popularity in 2021 and dropped collections in 2022 and 2023. NFT Mania Making A Comeback? On X, NFT lead at the TON blockchain, Zenith highlighted the drop’s success, as some of the supply gifts sold out in less than 2 minutes. He explained that Telegram gifts have had a peak market capitalization of over $200 million and a trading volume of $122 million since their launch. According to the post, the first OG collection, the Plush Pepe, now has a floor price of 4,200 TON, worth $11,886. “They are NFT Collectibles that are on the TON Blockchain and inside of Telegram!” he noted. To Zenith, this could be the start of a new NFT narrative, adding that they “would not be surprised if other famous brands or web3 IPs would want to launch some gifts too!” However, they pointed out that it could also mean nothing for the sector. In a recent report, DappRadar shared that Q2 data revealed new narratives are emerging, while old ones are “making a comeback.” The report claims that “NFTs are becoming more affordable, but the interest hasn’t disappeared. On the contrary, it’s shifting in nature,” a trend the platform’s analysts have been observing “for a while.” Related Reading: Solana Ready For $160 Reclaim? Analysts Say Breakout Is A Matter Of Time Notably, NFT trading volume dropped by 45% in Q2, but sales increased by 78%.

2025-07-11T05:00:46,"ESMA Puts Malta’s Crypto Oversight Under the Microscope—Is MiCA at Risk?","The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has placed Malta’s cryptocurrency licensing framework under review, raising concerns about how the island nation’s financial watchdog authorizes crypto asset service providers (CASPs). The evaluation, published Thursday, centers on the conduct of Malta’s Financial Services Authority (MFSA) and its processes under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which officially took effect across the EU in June 2024. Scrutiny Over Authorization Standards ESMA’s Peer Review Committee (PRC) conducted a targeted assessment of MFSA’s authorization of an unnamed CASP, identifying areas where the regulator fell short. While the MFSA was found to have adequate staffing and technical infrastructure, the review noted that it only “partially met expectations” during the approval process. The European watchdog emphasized that the concerns extended beyond Malta, urging all EU national competent authorities (NCAs) to align their oversight mechanisms to ensure consistency across jurisdictions under MiCA’s unified regulatory regime. The peer review into Malta’s supervisory practices stemmed from a decision by ESMA’s Board of Supervisors (BoS) in April 2025. It followed earlier steps taken in December 2024 when the BoS and the European Banking Authority adopted a harmonized approach for overseeing CASP authorizations under MiCA. According to the ESMA report, although the review targeted one country, its intent is to foster regulatory convergence throughout the EU as MiCA implementation ramps up. The PRC analyzed three key dimensions of Malta’s crypto regulation : supervisory structure and staffing, authorization processes, and post-licensing supervisory measures. The MFSA was praised for having a sufficient level of expertise and resources to support CASP supervision. However, ESMA’s report pointed to gaps in how the agency handled material issues during the authorization stage. It recommended that MFSA improve its ability to assess unresolved or underexamined issues that could emerge after approval. Calls for Convergence Across EU Supervisors The ESMA report points out the importance of regulatory consistency, especially as new crypto businesses seek licensure under MiCA. In particular, the PRC cautioned that national regulators must adapt quickly to growing application volumes and the evolving risk profiles of CASPs. “Due to the novelty and nature of these types of entities as well as the inherent risks of their business model, the PRC recommends to all NCAs…to pay particular attention to certain aspects of the authorization,” the committee stated. While Malta has historically positioned itself as a crypto-friendly jurisdiction within the EU, the ESMA’s review illustrates the shifting expectations facing all member states. With MiCA designed to eliminate regulatory arbitrage and create a level playing field, NCAs will need to align not just their licensing processes, but also their supervisory capacity and enforcement strategies. Moving forward, regulatory coordination and transparency will likely become core benchmarks for assessing the effectiveness of national crypto oversight.

Bitcoin’s consolidation around the upper boundary of its previously broken range at $108,355 ended on Wednesday, paving the way for a sharp move higher. The rally was mirrored by Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), both of which broke through key resistance levels, reinforcing the broader strength across the top cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, both major cryptocurrencies were trading over 6% higher. The overall crypto market was up around 5% to trade at $3.64 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance is around 64%. As bullish structures continue to form, traders are positioning for further upside, with sentiment turning increasingly optimistic. The surge also triggered the largest wave of liquidations in years, underscoring the abrupt shift in market momentum. The Bitcoin rally: where is BTC going? The cryptocurrency is now up approximately 24% year-to-date, with analysts setting their sights on $130,000 as the next major resistance. According to 10X Research, the latest breakout was driven by a decisive shift in market structure toward a bullish trend. Bitcoin has reached 10X Research’s July price target of $116,000, a level the firm projected based on seasonal trends pointing to a 9% rally. 10x Research @10x_Research · Follow The Quiet Bitcoin Signal That Triggered $1 Billion in Crypto LiquidationsActionable Market InsightsWhy this report mattersBitcoin just hit our July price target ($116,000)—but what’s unfolding beneath the surface is even more critical. A fresh uptrend signal has 8:07 am · 11 Jul 2025 3 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply While 10X had previously expected a broader consolidation through the summer, its outlook turned more bullish in recent weeks as upside positioning remained limited, setting the stage for a sharp move higher. According to the firm, a fresh trading signal was triggered as Bitcoin made a new short-term high, indicating that the rally could extend further. Historically, such signals have produced a median gain of 20%, with six out of ten instances delivering positive returns. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could climb as high as $133,000 by September, as per the research firm. Crypto liquidations surge More than $1.14 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass, marking one of the most significant shakeouts in recent months. Short traders bore the brunt of the losses, accounting for nearly $1.02 billion of the total. Bitcoin alone was responsible for over half of the liquidations, with $591 million in positions wiped out. Ethereum followed with $241 million in liquidations, while other major tokens—including Hyperliquid, Solana, and XRP—also experienced sharp losses. ETH and XRP eye key targets Ethereum rebounded after finding support near the $2,461 daily level last week, rallying 10% to close above its resistance at $2,724 on Wednesday. The upward momentum continued with a 6.59% gain on Thursday, bringing the price to retest the key psychological level of $3,000. As of Friday, ETH is hovering around $2,970. A daily close above $3,000 could pave the way for a move toward the next resistance level at $3,730. US spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows of $383 million on Thursday, marking five consecutive days of positive flows. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw the biggest inflow at around $300.9 million. Ripple (XRP) extended its recovery on Friday, reaching highs of around $2.59. According to data from Glassnode, the number of addresses on the XRP Ledger has steadily increased over the past two years, now averaging 7.3 million—up from 6.3 million at the start of the year and 5.7 million as of July 10, 2024. The ongoing growth in network activity, coupled with recent price momentum, suggests XRP may have the potential to accelerate its uptrend, with a short-term target above the $3.00 mark.

Called the Crypto Blue Chip ETF, the fund will track cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cronos, and now XRP. XRP Price Prediction Since the announcement, XRP’s price has surged. In the last 24 hours alone, it’s up 6%, currently trading at $2.57, and eyeing the $2.60 mark next. The breakout has opened doors for a fresh rally, with targets at $2.67 and beyond in the coming days or weeks. On the charts, analysts are spotting bullish signs. In fact, XRP has officially broken out of a major resistance zone between $2.31 and $2.36, a level that had capped its price for weeks. The breakout suggests that XRP is moving out of its long sideways range and could be gearing up for a stronger rally. If XRP can clear short-term hurdles around $2.44, it could continue climbing towards its next important resistance between $2.60 and $2.65. On the downside, any pullback might find support around the old resistance zone at $2.31 to $2.36, now expected to act as a safety net for prices. Can XRP Hit New All-Time-Highs? XRP is currently in the middle of a third wave rally, a phase typically known for strong upward moves. If this momentum continues, XRP could eventually eye $3.30, $5.00, and possibly even higher levels like $9.81 in the longer term, though that would require very bullish market conditions. In the short term, if prices face a pullback, key support levels to watch are around $2.25–$2.36.

2025-07-11T03:52:22,"FETH: The Ethereum Hype Has Merit","Summary Ethereum has underperformed Bitcoin significantly since the launch of spot ETH ETFs in the US, declining 22% versus Bitcoin's 64% gain. Despite Ethereum's lagging price action, some investors and companies, like Bit Digital, are making sizable bets on ETH over BTC. There is some merit to the recent hype surrounding ETH given stablecoin footprint, stablecoin transfer volume, and tokenized asset trends. The Fidelity Ethereum ETF is my preferred ETH-proxy due to its reasonable fee and custody self-reliance. As we approach a full year with spot Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) ETFs in the United States, the price performance of the underlying asset has utterly disappointed against that of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Data by YCharts In fact, since the launch of spot ETH funds in the US, Ethereum has actually declined by nearly 22% while Bitcoin has grown by close to 64% and just made yet another all time high mark just under $114k per coin. In spite of that, with the 'Bitcoin Treasury' narrative in the public markets getting increasingly crowded and competitive, big bets are being made on Ethereum - most notably from SharpLink Gaming ( SBET ) back in May as well as from Bit Digital ( BTBT ) more recently; the latter being a company that I hold and have covered roughly a dozen times through the years. Is the Ethereum Treasury flavor of 2025's crypto capital raise bonanza warranted on any fundamental justification? This article covering the Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ) will aim to assess if it's finally time to long ETH and its many proxies rather than the Bitcoin-adjacent products and equities that have done so well year to date. Year To Date Capital Flows Versus ETH Market Dominance 2025 has been good for Digital Asset investment products. The asset class is running on twelve consecutive weeks of positive net flows and is coming in at just under $19 billion in net investment demand year to date: Asset (mil$) MTD Flows YTD Flows AUM Bitcoin $719 $15,719 $164,182 Ethereum $202 $3,086 $15,864 Multi-asset -$10.7 $60 $4,103 Solana ( SOL-USD ) $21.6 $113 $1,436 XRP ( XRP-USD ) $10.6 $335 $1,409 Total $947 $18,962 $188,156 BTC Dominance 75.9% 82.9% 87.3% ETH Dominance 21.3% 16.3% 8.4% Source: CoinShares/Bloomberg, as of July 4th Ethereum's share of this net flow is interesting. While BTC is still clearly driving the bus in the industry, ETH has started to take a larger share this year and this summer. Of the total $188.2 billion in AUM, ETH claims just an 8.4% share of the market. ETH Dominance (CoinMarketCap) This is somewhat in line with the 9% share of total digital asset market capitalization shown in the chart above. Yet, there is a clear change happening. Year to date, ETH is pulling in 16.3% of net flow and 21.3% through the first few days of July. That's a small sample size, to be sure, but similar to the 23% share exhibited during the month of June. The point is, digital asset investors and corporate treasury stewards are increasingly betting on ETH. Why? Is There Justification For ETH Excitement? From a raw activity standpoint, Ethereum is still far from what I'd call irrational exuberance. Metrics like daily active addresses or monthly transactions show generally positive trends over the last year. That said, fees are a big part of this ecosystem, and Ethereum generated $39.1 million in monthly fees in June. While that was actually ahead of Solana for the first time since December, June fees were still well below the highs of last year and not even remotely close to the highs from the prior bull cycle. Monthly Fee Trend By Chain (Artemis) That said, Ethereum is still seeing growth in key areas. For instance, in the all-important stablecoin segment of the market, Ethereum has the largest share of any blockchain network and continues to see growth in monthly transfer volume: Monthly Ethereum Stablecoin Transfer Volume (Artemis) June marked the fourth consecutive month where Ethereum processed at least $1 trillion in stablecoin transfers. Though Base ( COIN ) actually beat Ethereum in the metric during the month, Ethereum beat Solana, Base, and Tron ( TRX-USD ) in stablecoin transfer volume in 3 of the last 4 months. Asset tokenization is an area that has been generating some headlines lately with Hester Peirce of the SEC recently insinuating that tokenized stocks are indeed still securities. Ethereum does not have a large share of the $427 million tokenized stocks market cap, but it is crushing the competition in tokenized treasuries: Tokenized Treasuries (RWA.xyz) As of article submission, the total market cap of tokenized treasury products across all blockchains is $7.5 billion. Of that number, Ethereum has a commanding 77% share of the market and is by far the largest recipient of BlackRock's ( BLK ) Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL-USD) with $2.6 billion of that $2.8 billion product. My personal view is we are still in the early stages of asset tokenization. It's something that I wrote about specifically pertaining to Ethereum exactly two years ago, and it's terrific to see the thesis beginning to take shape. FETH Is Still A Solid Choice For ETH Exposure I wrote about the Fidelity Ethereum ETF back when it launched in 2024 and have not updated my view since. I still like this fund, and it's my primary vector for ETH exposure at this point in time. Fund Details Ticker FETH Inception 07/22/2024 Expense Ratio 0.25% AUM $1.45B Source: Grayscale Fidelity's ETH product is not the cheapest at 0.25%, though it is very much in line with the market. It isn't the largest fund by AUM at $1.45 billion. But it is the only fund that self-manages the ETH assets rather than relying on Coinbase ( COIN ) for custody services. This minimizes third-party risk and potentially keeps fees lower longer term should Coinbase ever decide to raise the price on custody. Most importantly, the fund performs in line with the market. Data by YCharts I don't see much of a downside in picking FETH over something like ETHA, despite the large AUM disparity. If anything, I think giving away a couple bps is worth the third-party risk minimization. Risks To FETH and ETH In many ways, what we're witnessing in the market today could be a sign of very late-cycle behavior. Not just for equities but for digital assets as well. The proliferation of public companies looking to raise capital with the promise of scaling digital asset treasuries could certainly be viewed as an alarming trend. The masters of this craft over in Tysons Corner, Virginia, are actually experiencing compression in mNAV: MSTR mNAV 1yr (StrategyTracker) Strategy ( MSTR ) currently has an mNAV multiple of 1.9x. This is closer to a 1 year low than a 1 year high and perhaps an indication that the appetite for any and all equity premiums over digital asset values isn't actually limitless after all. Just because buying Bitcoin at any price has worked so well for the MSTR, it does not mean every company that buys BTC, ETH, or SOL will be able to generate the same positive flywheel that Strategy just pulled off over the last 28 months. So if one is buying ETH under the assumption that an ETH-based Strategy-type actor will emerge and pump everyone's bags, I wouldn't hold my breath. Final Takeaways Despite what I view to be fairly obvious risks, longing Ethereum and products like FETH could well provide long-term gains in an environment where tokenization takes a larger share of global assets. Ethereum is the top network for stablecoins and tokenized treasuries. It's still home to several of the top protocols in DeFi, like AAVE ( AAVE-USD ) and Uniswap ( UNI-USD ). And it could certainly benefit from taking a larger share of tokenized stocks should Ethereum prove to be the winning network as far as TradFi actors like Blackrock are concerned. Until there is a viable staking ETF in the US market, FETH is still my preferred long-ETH product for long-term investors.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800529-feth-the-ethereum-hype-has-merit?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING","ETH-USD|FETH",cryptocompare

The latest rally caught traders off guard and triggered the highest wave of liquidations in years, signaling a powerful shift in momentum. As of 1:20 am ET, Bitcoin had broken past the earlier high of $113,734 set just hours prior. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is now up roughly 24% year-to-date, with analysts eyeing $130,000 as the next key level. The latest price spike came as market structure turned decisively bullish, according to 10X Research. Traders Rush to Reposition After Quiet Volatility Triggers Bullish Setup In a note to clients, the firm said a short-term breakout signal had been triggered, historically followed by median gains of 20%. That would imply a price target near $133,000 by September. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is now in the ""Greed"" zone after $BTC hit a new ATH earlier today. Where do you stand on the scale? pic.twitter.com/c4LkrLF1fH — CoinGecko (@coingecko) July 11, 2025 “Our trading signals indicate that this short-term breakout carries a 60% probability of further upside over the next two months,” Markus Thielen, founder of 10X, told Cryptonews. Behind the scenes, the landscape has been quietly shifting. Implied volatility recently hit its lowest levels in months, giving traders cheap access to upside bets. At the same time, many had been underexposed following June’s options expiry, leading to a scramble to reposition. Over $1B in Short Positions Liquidated as Bitcoin Blasts Higher Adding fuel to the rally, over $1.14b in leveraged positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours alone, according to data from CoinGlass . Of that, nearly $1.02b came from short traders. Bitcoin accounted for more than half of the total carnage, with $599m in liquidations. Ethereum saw $243m wiped out, while smaller tokens like Hyperliquid, Solana and XRP also saw heavy losses. Source: Coinglass Trump Policies, $15B in ETF Buys Add Fuel to Bitcoin’s Fire This new wave of volatility comes as Trump’s crypto-friendly policies gain traction. In March, the president signed an executive order to establish a national crypto reserve. His administration has since appointed pro-crypto voices to key positions, including SEC’s Paul Atkins and AI policy lead David Sacks. Meanwhile, Trump-linked businesses are deepening their involvement. Trump Media & Technology Group recently filed to launch a crypto ETF that would hold multiple tokens, including Bitcoin. With steady ETF demand, easing macro conditions and regulatory tailwinds, many traders now see this breakout as the start of a broader uptrend. “Bitcoin may be transitioning into a higher trading range,” said Thielen. “Since mid-April, Bitcoin ETFs have bought $15b worth of BTC and they are causing prices to rally.” As crypto markets heat up once again, all eyes are on next week’s US CPI print and the start of “Crypto Week” in Washington, both of which could offer fresh catalysts, or risks, for the world’s most closely watched digital asset.

2025-07-11T03:34:59,"Rare Flip: Ethereum’s $62.1B Futures Volume Tops Bitcoin’s $61.7B","In a rare but potentially telling market shift, Ethereum futures volume overtook Bitcoin’s over a 24-hour period, recording $62.1 billion compared to BTC’s $61.7 billion on July 10. This reversal, highlighted by market analytics platform Glassnode, may suggest a subtle but meaningful rotation in trader sentiment. While the OG cryptocurrency remains the market leader in price and dominance, Ethereum’s uptick could point to growing confidence in its ecosystem. Catalysts Driving the Ethereum Surge Several converging factors could explain this sudden dominance, including growing institutional confidence in the second-largest crypto by market cap, as evidenced by Bit Digital’s recent move to convert its entire $173 million BTC treasury into Ethereum. We also recently saw deep-pocketed investors scoop up 200,000 ETH worth more than half a billion dollars over a two-day period. Not only did they boost their collective holdings to 22% of ETH’s supply, but they also indicated their long-term conviction in the asset. Additionally, there’s anticipation building around potential approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of staking within spot Ethereum ETFs. According to K33 Research, this could push up the price of ETH far more significantly than has been done by technical upgrades to the network. And while Bitcoin may have reached a new all-time high (ATH) past $113,000, the flip arrived just as ETH recorded a sizable uptick of its own, hitting $2,810 at one point, to move closer to a key resistance level not breached since February. Analysts like Daan Crypto Trades argue that a break above $2,800 could trigger liquidations that would ignite “a lot of momentum,” which might see Ethereum reach $3,000 and beyond. Market Mechanics Interestingly, during BTC’s run to the new ATH, Glassnode observed a curious shift in the structure of the futures market. In late June, rising Bitcoin prices were met with declining open interest, possibly indicating short squeezes; however, this time, open interest went up alongside BTC’s price, suggesting fresh long positions were entering the market. Despite Ethereum’s strong showing, caution remains warranted. Bitcoin still commands a greater share of institutional products and remains the macro barometer for crypto.

2025-07-11T03:28:46,"Crypto Scammer’s Sentence Jumps from 18 Months to 12 Years in $20M Fraud Case","A man convicted in a $22 million crypto fraud scheme saw his prison sentence sharply increased after failing to repay the money he owed his victim. Nicholas Truglia, 27, who was initially sentenced to 18 months, received a new 12-year sentence on Thursday in a New York federal court. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ordered the increase after ruling that Truglia had willfully ignored his obligation to pay back nearly $20.4 million in restitution. “You paid not a cent, not one cent,” Judge Hellerstein told Truglia during the hearing. The judge further ordered an added 3-month supervised release while noting Truglia’s lifestyle. “You didn’t have a job, but you lived in splendor,” Judge Hellerstein said. Judge Slams Crypto Fraudster’s Lavish Lifestyle in SIM-Swap Sentencing According to the report from Bloomberg, Truglia’s legal team argued the new sentence was unlawful. His attorney, Mark Gombiner, said in court that the punishment was “an extraordinary abuse of discretion” and confirmed plans to appeal. #breaking for real: Hacker Truglia sentenced to 12 years, more than double the guideline of 51 to 63 months, for not paying his $20 million restitution. Video of him speaking behind a mask cited and used. Appeal to follow – but remand to Marshals about to occur https://t.co/tWBdzgd4zT — Inner City Press (@innercitypress) July 10, 2025 Arrested in the California Bay Area in 2018, Truglia pleaded guilty in 2021 to participating in a scheme that involved hijacking a victim’s phone number through SIM swapping and draining their crypto accounts. The hackers exploited a telecom employee to gain control of Michael Terpin’s phone number. Terpin, a blockchain investor and CEO of Transform Group, suffered a loss of $24 million due to this scheme. Notably, Truglia was tasked with converting stolen cryptocurrency into Bitcoin. In 2019, Terpin filed a civil lawsuit for $75 million against the scammer and was awarded the full amount in damages by the court. That same year, he also took legal action against AT&T, his wireless carrier at the time, filing a $224 million lawsuit for their negligence. Their failure to secure his cell phone allowed the hackers to compromise it, resulting in his loss. At the time of his initial sentencing, prosecutors revealed that Truglia held more than $50 million in assets, including cryptocurrency, luxury goods, and fine art. Gombiner told the court that his client had turned over all assets he could access, including funds from a Wells Fargo account. Truglia claimed that much of his wealth remained locked in an inaccessible Bitcoin wallet. He told the judge he would repay the victim if he could access the funds. Terpin, who joined the hearing by phone, rejected that explanation, calling it “a giant smoke screen.” U.S. Ramps Up Enforcement as Crypto Crimes Lead to Decades-Long Sentences In the U.S., crypto crimes continue to result in severe penalties. On May 23, Trung Nguyen, a Massachusetts man who ran an unlicensed cash-to-Bitcoin business, was sentenced to six years in federal prison . His company, disguised as a vending machine operator, processed over $1 million in illicit cash, including funds for a known methamphetamine dealer. Nguyen, who used the alias “DCS420,” was convicted in 2024 for money laundering and failing to register with FinCEN. Just two weeks earlier, on May 9, Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa received a 30-year sentence for sending crypto to ISIS operatives . U.S. prosecutors revealed that between 2019 and 2022, Chhipa funneled more than $185,000 to the terrorist group, funding fighters and prison escapes. A federal judge sentenced Chhipa to over 30 years for funding ISIS through cryptocurrency, supporting fighter salaries, and prison breaks. #DOJ #CryptoCrime https://t.co/74BdhgaEjh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 His use of burner phones and fake identities ultimately failed to hide his tracks. He was caught attempting to flee and intercepted on an Interpol notice. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Justice is pushing for a 20-year sentence for Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius. Prosecutors say Mashinsky’s fraudulent practices cost investors $550 million, describing his actions as deliberate and self-serving. Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky was sentenced to 12 years in prison for defrauding investors with false promises of high crypto returns. #Celsius #AlexMashinsky https://t.co/R4syyDiKaU — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 9, 2025 He pled guilty in late 2024 after Celsius collapsed in mid-2022, freezing $4.7 billion in customer funds.

2025-07-11T02:00:26,"Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal?","Altcoins have endured years of underperformance as Bitcoin continues to dominate the crypto market. Despite several short-lived rallies, most altcoins remain far below their previous highs, weighed down by investor skepticism and capital concentration in BTC. However, there are signs that sentiment might be shifting. In recent days, strong altcoins have started to recover, showing resilience as broader market conditions improve. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops – Bullish Setup Takes Shape Top analyst Carl Runefelt shared a technical setup revealing that the altcoin market is now bouncing off a major support zone. This move has sparked fresh debates among traders and investors. Is this the start of a long-awaited altseason, or merely a temporary relief bounce before further downside? The bounce comes as macroeconomic uncertainty begins to fade and liquidity returns to the crypto market. Still, key resistance levels remain untouched for many projects, and overall confidence in altcoins hasn’t fully returned. While the current setup is promising, confirmation will depend on whether this rally can break above critical levels and sustain higher prices. Altcoins Eye A Breakout As Ethereum Holds The Key Altcoins remain nearly 50% below their all-time highs, but sentiment is beginning to shift. Bulls are preparing for an expansive move across the board, with growing anticipation that a breakout could materialize once Ethereum clears its current resistance zone. Since early May, ETH has been trading in a well-defined consolidation range, and altcoins have mirrored this sideways behavior, struggling to gain momentum without a clear signal from the market’s second-largest asset. Carl Runefelt recently shared insights suggesting that the altcoin market is showing signs of life. By analyzing the TOTAL3 chart—which tracks the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum—Runefelt highlights that altcoins are bouncing off key support in BTC terms. This bounce could indicate the beginning of a recovery rally, especially if capital rotation from BTC into altcoins accelerates in the coming sessions. Historically, altcoins thrive when Ethereum leads the charge. A confirmed breakout above the $2,800 resistance zone could ignite broad participation and kickstart a new altseason. The current market structure suggests that many investors are positioning early, anticipating that macroeconomic clarity and market stability will fuel risk-on behavior. However, the rally is not yet confirmed. Bulls still need Ethereum to break out decisively and sustain momentum above recent highs. If that happens, many oversold altcoins could see sharp recoveries and set the stage for a broader market expansion. For now, patience and timing remain key as traders watch ETH and TOTAL3 closely for signals of the next leg up. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Action Signals Momentum Shift: BTC Sleeps And ETH Moves TOTAL3 Chart Shows Key Rebound From Macro Support The TOTAL3 chart, which measures the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is showing early signs of recovery after a sustained period of weakness. As of now, the chart reflects a bounce from the $830 billion level, which aligns closely with the 100-week simple moving average (SMA), currently acting as dynamic support. This level has historically served as a critical pivot zone, especially in mid-cycle consolidations. The market cap sits near $875 billion, still over 40% below the previous cycle’s peak, but with bullish momentum building. The recent weekly candle has posted a strong green body, suggesting renewed interest in the altcoin segment. Volume has also picked up, showing growing confidence among participants as many altcoins recover from deeply oversold conditions. Related Reading: ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise Technically, this bounce could signal the beginning of a new macro leg higher, especially if the 50-week SMA is reclaimed and price holds above $900 billion. The overall structure remains constructive, with higher lows forming since late 2022 and price compressing into a potential breakout formation.

2025-07-11T01:22:10,"Bitcoin crosses $117K as Ether hits $3,000 and XRP surges by 5%","Bitcoin is now sitting above $117,000 for the first time in its history, rising more than 60% since its lowest point in April. The exact figure? $117,080. Ether touched $3,000, before rebounding slightly to $2,800 at press time. Meanwhile, XRP surged by 5% to $2.6. This rally is happening while the U.S. Dollar saw its steepest six-month fall since 1973, dropping nearly 11% amid a simultaneous rally in tech stocks, led by Nvidia, which just became the first company ever to hit $4 trillion. The timing of Bitcoin’s price actions lines up exactly with new warnings about U.S. debt, fiscal chaos, and an economy that’s clearly slipping. In early April 2025, Bitcoin had been sinking as markets braced for another global trade war. On April 9th, the White House hit pause on tariffs, giving a 90-day delay. That was the same day Bitcoin bottomed. Then on April 20th, without a single headline moving markets, Bitcoin suddenly shot up, and didn’t stop. Something deeper was driving the rebound. The U.S. government just raised the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, bringing it to $41.1 trillion. Right now, the national debt is hovering around $37 trillion. If things stay on track, the ceiling will be maxed out again in under three years. That’s the real issue spooking the market. Elon exits DOGE as Bitcoin spikes On April 22nd, Elon Musk announced he was stepping down from the Department of Government Efficiency, also called DOGE. That announcement came just two days after the rally began, and the timing matched too perfectly to ignore. The market read it as a sign that the fiscal picture in Washington was even worse than expected. Elon’s exit was quickly followed by an open fight between him and President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House after the 2024 election. But that clash wasn’t just personal. It was political, and it came as Trump pushed Congress to pass what he called the “Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB). The bill is projected to add $5.5 trillion to the national debt if made permanent. As talk of the bill intensified, Bitcoin climbed even faster. The full timeline shows how closely Bitcoin tracked the bill’s progress. On June 22nd, Bitcoin briefly dipped into its $100,000 support. But by July 1st, as analysts increased the odds of the OBBB passing, the price started to rise again. On July 3rd, the House approved the bill. And by July 4th, Trump had signed it into law. That same week, Bitcoin passed $117,000, while the U.S. Dollar Index dropped to levels not seen since March 2022. That’s not the only sign of trouble. In the first half of 2025, the dollar dropped 10.8%, its worst performance to start a year since 1973. Even during the inflation panic of 1986, the dollar didn’t fall this fast. And the drop is continuing despite Trump’s ongoing tariff campaign. The administration has been sending out “tariff letters” and escalating pressure on foreign trade partners. Normally, that kind of aggression should boost the dollar. But that’s not what’s happening. Elon launched his new “America Party” a few days ago. When asked on X if the party would support Bitcoin, Elon didn’t dodge. “Fiat is hopeless, so yes,” he said. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has taken a hard line. The latest FOMC minutes show that several members see no rate cuts coming in 2025. The official stance has been “wait and see” for months, meaning interest rates will likely stay higher for longer. That, too, should support the dollar. But the opposite is playing out. The greenback keeps sinking, and that has everything to do with the debt crisis.

2025-07-11T00:30:38,"Bitcoin Uptrend Intact, But Binance Activity Warns Of Short-Term Pullback","Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high (ATH) yesterday, climbing to $111,999 on Binance exchange before dipping slightly to around $110,000 at the time of writing. While the broader trend remains bullish, some analysts now anticipate a short-term pullback. Bitcoin Remains Bullish But Some Pullback Expected According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, early warning signs suggest that BTC may face a brief correction. The analyst noted that if momentum doesn’t pick up soon, Bitcoin could struggle to maintain its bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top Binance taker buy/sell volume has shown a noticeable spike in aggressive buy orders – usually a bullish signal – but sell volume has also risen in tandem, effectively absorbing most of the demand. Despite this uptick in buy volume, BTC’s price has not responded proportionally, suggesting distribution or selling pressure. For the uninitiated, Binance taker buy/sell volume measures the amount of aggressive buying versus selling on the exchange using market orders. A higher taker buy volume indicates strong buyer interest, while higher taker sell volume signals stronger selling pressure. In addition, Binance open interest has surged during the recent price rally, signalling an influx of leveraged positions. While rising open interest can support further gains, the subdued price reaction raises concerns about Bitcoin’s short-term strength. Meanwhile, funding rates have stayed mostly neutral throughout the rally. However, the most recent push to a new ATH saw BTC’s funding rates turn slightly positive, hinting at increasing long exposure and renewed bullish sentiment. The breakout also triggered significant short liquidations, likely fuelling a short squeeze. Data from Coinglass shows that over the past 24 hours, $521 million in positions were liquidated – $448 million of which were shorts. Market Needs A Breather Before Climbing Higher Concluding, the CryptoQuant contributor noted that despite the emerging signs of caution, Bitcoin’s overall bullish structure remains intact. However, the market is now seeing the early signs of a potential short-term pullback, especially due to the spike-driven nature of the move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Realized Dominance Signals Weak Hands Capitulating, Strong Hands Rising Other analysts share a similar outlook for BTC. For example, crypto analyst Christian Chifoi suggested that the current price action may be a deceptive move designed to trap bullish traders – potentially pushing BTC down to $97,000 before the final rally begins. That said, the recent weakness observed in the US Dollar Index (DXY) has fuelled hopes for a capital reallocation to alternative assets, including BTC. At press time, BTC trades at $110,885, up 1.1% in the past 24 hours.
