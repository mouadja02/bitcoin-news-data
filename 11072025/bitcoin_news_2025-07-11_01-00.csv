2025-07-10T22:50:20,"Cryptocurrency Market: Trump Hails Booming Growth Amidst Economic Optimism","In a surprising and impactful statement, former U.S. President Donald Trump recently shared his positive outlook on the financial landscape, specifically highlighting the impressive performance of the Cryptocurrency Market . His remarks, made on Truth Social, signaled a notable shift in rhetoric from his past skepticism, now praising both stock and crypto markets for reaching unprecedented highs. This isn’t just about market numbers; it’s about a prominent political figure acknowledging a burgeoning asset class, prompting many to wonder: What does this mean for the future of digital assets and the broader economy? Donald Trump Crypto Stance: A Surprising Endorsement? For years, Donald Trump held a cautious, if not outright skeptical, view on cryptocurrencies. His past comments often expressed concerns about their volatility and potential use in illicit activities. However, his recent statement, where he declared cryptocurrencies are “soaring through the roof,” marks a significant departure. This shift in perspective is not merely a casual observation; it reflects a growing recognition of crypto’s mainstream adoption and increasing market capitalization. Past Skepticism: Previously, Trump voiced doubts about Bitcoin’s legitimacy, preferring the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. Current Praise: His latest comments indicate an acknowledgment of crypto’s undeniable market performance and perhaps its growing political relevance. Political Calculus: As the U.S. heads into an election year, a more open stance on crypto could be an attempt to appeal to a younger, tech-savvy voter base increasingly engaged with digital assets. This endorsement from such a high-profile figure could lend further credibility to the digital asset space, potentially encouraging more traditional investors and institutions to consider its opportunities. The Booming Cryptocurrency Market: What’s Driving the Momentum? Trump’s observation that the Cryptocurrency Market is “soaring through the roof” is certainly backed by recent performance. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and numerous altcoins have seen substantial gains, pushing the total crypto market capitalization to multi-year highs. Several factors are contributing to this remarkable surge: Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset, leading to significant institutional inflows. Bitcoin Halving Event: The quadrennial Bitcoin halving, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoins, historically precedes bull runs, creating anticipation and driving demand. Institutional Adoption: More large corporations and financial institutions are exploring blockchain technology and incorporating digital assets into their strategies, signaling long-term confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Expectations of potential interest rate cuts by central banks, including the Federal Reserve, make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies more attractive as yields on traditional investments might decrease. This confluence of events has created a powerful tailwind for the crypto space, transforming it from a niche interest into a significant component of the global financial conversation. Federal Reserve Rates and Trump’s Economic Vision: A Call for Lower Costs? A key part of Trump’s recent remarks was his insistence that the Federal Reserve Rates should be lowered. He argued that the current economic strength of the U.S. warrants a more accommodative monetary policy, implying that lower rates would further fuel growth and reflect the robust economic conditions. This stance aligns with his previous presidency, where he frequently urged the Fed to cut rates. The Federal Reserve uses interest rates as a primary tool to manage inflation and economic growth. Higher rates tend to cool down an overheating economy by making borrowing more expensive, while lower rates stimulate spending and investment. Trump’s argument suggests that the economy is strong enough to handle lower rates without triggering runaway inflation, thereby reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Lower interest rates typically have a ripple effect across markets: Stock Market: Can benefit from cheaper borrowing for companies and increased consumer spending. Bond Market: Bond yields tend to fall, making other investments more attractive. Cryptocurrency Market: Often seen as a risk-on asset, crypto could benefit from a flight from traditional savings accounts and a general increase in liquidity seeking higher returns. This push for lower rates underscores a fundamental debate about the Fed’s independence and its role in shaping the nation’s economic trajectory. US Economic Strength: Is the Foundation Truly Solid? Trump’s statements consistently emphasize the undeniable US Economic Strength and its global dominance. He highlighted impressive economic indicators, asserting that the U.S. must maintain its leading position on the world stage. This narrative of a thriving economy is central to his political messaging. Indeed, recent economic data has shown resilience, with strong employment numbers, robust GDP growth, and moderating inflation. However, the interpretation of these figures often varies: Proponents’ View: Point to low unemployment, consumer spending, and innovation as signs of a healthy, dynamic economy. Critics’ View: Raise concerns about lingering inflation, national debt, and potential future slowdowns, suggesting that the strength might be unevenly distributed or temporary. Regardless of the nuanced perspectives, the perception of a strong economy often translates into investor confidence, which can positively impact both traditional and emerging markets like cryptocurrencies. Nvidia Stock and Market Performance: Beyond Crypto’s Horizon Beyond his comments on crypto, Trump specifically called out the phenomenal performance of Nvidia Stock , noting its 47% rise since his tariffs were imposed. Nvidia, a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs), has become a bellwether for the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Its chips are crucial for training AI models, making it a pivotal player in the tech sector’s explosive growth. Nvidia’s success is indicative of broader trends in the stock market, particularly the outperformance of tech giants. This growth reflects: AI Revolution: The immense demand for computing power to fuel AI development. Semiconductor Dominance: Nvidia’s strong position in the chip manufacturing ecosystem. Market Concentration: The increasing influence of a few mega-cap tech companies on overall market performance. Trump’s mention of tariffs in relation to Nvidia’s rise also subtly ties into his trade policy stance, suggesting that his protectionist measures have contributed to domestic economic success. This highlights how interconnected global trade policies, technological advancements, and market performance truly are. What Does This Mean for You: Actionable Insights for Investors Donald Trump’s recent comments, while political in nature, carry weight for investors navigating the complex financial landscape. His acknowledgment of the Cryptocurrency Market ‘s ascent, coupled with his economic outlook, provides several key takeaways: Increased Legitimacy for Crypto: High-profile political endorsements, even indirect ones, can help push cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream, potentially attracting more institutional and retail capital. Watch the Fed: The ongoing debate around Federal Reserve rates will continue to be a critical factor influencing all asset classes. Investors should monitor the Fed’s signals for potential shifts in monetary policy. Diversification is Key: While specific sectors like AI (exemplified by Nvidia) and crypto are seeing rapid growth, a diversified portfolio remains crucial to mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Political rhetoric, economic data, and technological advancements are constantly shaping market dynamics. Staying updated on these interconnected factors is essential for informed decision-making. For those considering dipping their toes into the crypto waters, remember that while the market is booming, it remains inherently volatile. Research, understanding your risk tolerance, and perhaps consulting with a financial advisor are always recommended. Conclusion: Navigating the Future of Finance Donald Trump’s recent remarks serve as a powerful reminder of the evolving financial world. His acknowledgment of the soaring Cryptocurrency Market and his strong stance on Federal Reserve Rates reflect a broader narrative of economic change and ambition. Whether one agrees with his political views or economic prescriptions, his comments underscore the undeniable rise of digital assets and the persistent focus on maintaining robust US Economic Strength . As we continue to witness the rapid growth of sectors like AI, exemplified by Nvidia Stock , the interplay between technology, politics, and finance will undoubtedly shape the investment landscape for years to come. Staying agile, informed, and strategic will be paramount for anyone looking to thrive in this dynamic environment.

2025-07-10T22:31:49,"Trump is close to his first major crypto policy win","Next week, President Donald Trump could achieve his first landmark legislative win in crypto policy as House Republicans advance a Senate-passed bill to set formal guidelines for stablecoins. Lawmakers in the House will cast their votes at the beginning of next week on the Senate’s “GENIUS Act,” according to Politico . This move will introduce the nation’s inaugural regulatory structure for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to the dollar. That legislation earned bipartisan approval in the Senate last month and is likely to be the first crypto law Congress passes. Should the president sign the measure, the crypto industry may enjoy a significant boost after years of seeking broader acceptance. Advocates contend that explicit federal authorization and a purpose-built rulebook for stablecoins will spur wider use and prompt mainstream financial institutions to explore digital assets. The new law could also prove advantageous to the president’s family since last year, his sons launched a venture that issues stablecoin. Alongside the stablecoin bill, the House also plans to vote next week on an extensive revision of crypto oversight that would split responsibility between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. A third proposal to prohibit any U.S. central bank digital currency will also be on the table. House ends push to combine crypto bills The House Rules Committee will meet on Monday at 4 p.m. to examine all three measures, potentially clearing the way for a floor vote by Tuesday. These votes will end the House GOP’s effort to bundle all three crypto bills into one package to pressure the Senate. Instead, Senate Republicans, backed by Trump, ran a public campaign that successfully passed the standalone GENIUS Act. Leading Senate GOP figures have vowed to address an independent market structure bill in September. Earlier, President Trump proudly claimed that cryptocurrency has “soared ‘through the roof!’” under his leadership, crediting his tariff strategy and economic agenda for fueling the digital‐asset rally. While House leaders intend to forward the Senate’s stablecoin legislation to the president unchanged, they continue to press for tweaks. A revised draft of the broader market-structure proposal, released Thursday by House Financial Services Chair French Hill, incorporates an amendment section for the GENIUS Act . Proposed adjustments include updated accounting protocols, permission for commodity-backed stablecoins, and stronger issuance oversight requiring both private and public nonfinancial entities to secure approval from a designated review committee before launching a stablecoin Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-10T22:23:16,"Crypto Q2 Returns Beat Stocks by 3x – Why Smart Money Says the Bull Run Has Already Begun","Key Takeaways: The crypto market delivered a 21.72% return in Q2, tripling S&P 500 gains. Retail interest shifted toward altcoins, while institutions increased Bitcoin exposure and technical indicators and macro shifts fueled Bitcoin’s Q2 rally. Spot ETFs continue to accumulate BTC, altering supply dynamics. Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies extended gains through Q2, with the total crypto market delivering a 21.72% return, according to a report published by 99Bitcoins on July 10. The report noted this outperformance followed an 18% decline in Q1, suggesting renewed investor confidence. In comparison, the broader S&P 500 rose 7.37%, while the S&P 500 Information Technology sector added 18.4%. Crypto Performance Outpaces Stocks in Q2 “Unlike past bull markets, retail investors showed less interest in Bitcoin this time. In fact, out of 10 experts 99Bitcoins spoke to, 9 said that retail traders were shifting their attention to altcoins,” the report wrote. “Bitcoin, on the other hand, seems to be turning into a favorite among institutions, though many fiduciaries have yet to enter the market,” the said the report. Bitcoin’s rally accelerated in April, breaking out of a downtrend and forming a pattern of higher highs and lows on the daily chart. It treated the $92,000–$96,000 range as a support zone and attempted to push past $112,000, according to the report. In addition, trading volumes also rose, and the 50-day moving average crossed above the 200-day, forming a golden cross. Sentiment was supported by macro policy. The report linked April’s momentum to a 90-day pause on tariffs by the Trump administration, while expectations of rate cuts in Q3 continued to support market activity into June. Among altcoins, Solana gained traction among developers seeking lower costs than Ethereum. Cardano saw progress in real-world asset applications and partnerships. XRP ended a five-year legal dispute with the SEC, a move expected to support wider use, according to the report. Bitcoin Q3 Prediction: $120,000 Incoming? “Historically, Bitcoin’s largest price surges have occurred six to 12 months after a halving event. In both 2017 and 2020, these rallies were fueled by factors like retail enthusiasm and favorable monetary policies,” the report stated. Bitcoin ended Q2 near $110,000, while ETFs collectively held 6.35% of its market cap. The report predicted this percentage may rise further in Q3, pending policy clarity and macroeconomic trends. “A 10x gain this time might not be possible. Based on past trends, a move that doubles or triples Bitcoin’s previous all-time-high of $69,000 is well within reach,” the report wrote. While institutional interest is increasing, the evolving structure of crypto markets is also reshaping how capital flows. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold a growing share of circulating supply, act as daily buyers regardless of market volatility. This mechanic introduces a steady absorption of new issuance, reducing available float and amplifying any demand-side shocks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What sectors outside tech are watching crypto’s recent outperformance? Asset managers in energy and commodities are evaluating crypto as a diversification tool, especially during periods of dollar volatility or geopolitical stress. How are pension funds reacting to growing ETF participation? Some pension funds have begun exploratory reviews of Bitcoin ETFs, though most remain constrained by internal policy or fiduciary duty guidelines that restrict crypto exposure. Are derivative markets reflecting the same bullish outlook? Not entirely. While spot prices rose, options data shows a skew toward shorter-term bets, suggesting traders are hedging against volatility rather than pricing in sustained upside.

2025-07-10T22:22:08,"Over $500,000 in Crypto Donations Raised For Texas Flood Relief Efforts","The July 4 weekend floods that devastated Central Texas have taken over one hundred lives at the time of writing. AccuWeather has further reported that the floods have caused an estimated $18 to $22 billion in total damage and economic loss. While search and rescue efforts remain ongoing, a number of organizations are accepting donations to help with relief efforts. The Giving Block and Crypto For Charity Accept Crypto Donations It’s also notable that crypto donations are being accepted through The Giving Block and Crypto For Charity. Benjamin Pousty, chief operating officer of The Giving Block, told Cryptonews that several of the organization’s nonprofit clients are on the ground in Central Texas providing critical support to communities impacted by the floods. “These include World Central Kitchen, Direct Relief and World Vision,” Pousty said. He elaborated that donors can make crypto donations through the Texas Flood Emergency Response Fundraiser page. Pousty pointed out that donors can easily give crypto, stock, donor advised fund (DAF), or card donations directly to specific organizations through The Giving Block donation forms. “The donations are being used to support the incredible disaster relief work these organizations are providing. Additionally, all the donations received are being matched 1:1 through July 31 to double the impact,” Pousty said. We’ve launched the Texas Flood Emergency Response Fundraiser to support communities devastated by catastrophic flooding in Texas. All donations are matched 1:1 through July 31st by @rookisaacman , Executive Chairman at @Shift4 , up to $500,000. Let’s raise $1 Million together.… — The Giving Block (@TheGivingBlock) July 8, 2025 Crypto for Charity is also enabling crypto donations for Texas-based organizations. For instance, Austin Pets Alive has rescued hundreds of animals from the impacted flood areas across Central Texas. The Austin-based animal shelter told Cryptonews that crypto donations are being accepted for flood relief and can be made via the Crypto for Charity website .

(@austinpetsalive) July 4, 2025 A Goal To Raise $1 Million for Texas Flood Relief The Giving Block’s campaign launched on July 7 with a goal of raising $1 million. Pousty shared that The Giving Block has already passed its halfway mark, raising over $525,000 at the time of writing. “What makes this effort especially impactful is the $500,000 donation match pledged by Jared Isaacman, executive chairman of Shift4, The Giving Block’s parent company. It’s a great example of how crypto philanthropy can quickly mobilize resources and scale generosity,” Pousty added. In regards to which cryptocurrency is being most donated, Pousty shared that this particular campaign has seen the highest volume of donations in Ethereum ( ETH ), followed closely by Bitcoin ( BTC ). This has been especially beneficial as the price of Bitcoin has hit a new all-time high . “These are consistently the most popular cryptocurrencies among donors on our platform due to their liquidity and broad recognition, making them ideal for impactful, time-sensitive giving,” Pousty said. Crypto Donations Gain Traction It shouldn’t come as a surprise that crypto donations are being accepted for disaster relief efforts . Recent findings from Nonprofit Pro show that $2 billion in cryptocurrency has been donated globally since last year. The report notes that this trend is being driven by both a surge in donor interest in crypto, along with a growing openness among nonprofits to accepting digital assets. A report from The Giving Block further found that 70% of Forbes’ Top 100 charities now accept crypto donations, up 25% from 2024. It’s also stated that the average crypto donation in 2024 was $10,978.28, representing a 386% increase from 2023. Source: The Giving Block Moreover, Texas’ recent addition of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) demonstrates the state’s crypto friendly nature. This may help encourage Texas organizations seeking relief efforts to accept crypto donations. Benefits of Crypto Donations It’s also important to point out the benefits of giving back in cryptocurrency. According to Pousty, crypto donations are uniquely positioned to provide fast, borderless support in times of crisis. “They allow people around the world to contribute instantly to relief efforts – something that’s critical in the aftermath of a disaster like the Texas floods,” he said. Jacob Ortiz Hansen, CEO of Web3 finance company KyneSys Labs, further told Cryptonews that crypto donations offer speed, transparency, and borderless access to aid – all of which are essential in disaster scenarios where time and trust are critical. “In traditional systems, there are delays due to banking hours, wire approval processes, know-your-customer bottlenecks, and international transfer restrictions. Crypto bypasses all of that,” Ortiz Hansen remarked. For example, KyneSys Labs aims to enable crypto donations via a project called ‘Demos,” which is currently in a testing phase. Ortiz Hansen explained that Demos will feature a smart routing feature across different blockchain networks “Demos Pay will allow recipients to accept any crypto token from any chain and route it instantly into a preferred stablecoin or on-chain format,” he said. “That means a shelter in Texas could receive ETH, SOL, USDC, or MATIC and use these funds immediately without worrying about chain compatibility or having to use a specific wallet.” Pousty further remarked that crypto donations often come with major tax advantages for donors . Nonprofit organizations accepting crypto also benefit, as this type of fundraising presents an opportunity to increase impact. “For instance, access to a young, generous donor audience and large donations that can be particularly powerful during emergency campaigns like this one often come with crypto donations,” he said. The Future of Crypto Donations While cryptocurrency giving is still a relatively new concept, Pousty believes that more donors will participate moving forward. “ The Giving Block has processed a record amount of crypto donations for the thousands of charitable organizations we support over the past 12 months, and 2025 is on pace to be our biggest year yet,” he said. Although notable, a number of factors will have an impact on the future of crypto donations. According to The Giving Block’s 2025 crypto philanthropy report, crypto donations are shaped by external factors such as macro-level trends and regulatory shifts. The report notes: “Factors, like crypto market performance and economic conditions, are beyond our control, but nonprofits can still take proactive steps to strengthen their digital presence, refine their appeals strategy, and enhance the donor experience.” Pousty remains hopeful, though. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s new ATH , combined with funding and staff cuts at organizations, make crypto donations a valuable and innovative tool for raising funds.

2025-07-10T22:00:44,"Rising Bets On Ethereum: Futures Open Interest Jumps To Fresh Multi-Month High","Bullish sentiment is noticeably returning to the crypto market once again, and Ethereum has made a remarkable upward move. With the fresh wave of optimism, ETH’s price has reclaimed the key $2,700 mark, which has captured investors’ attention. While prices have strongly increased, recent reports reveal that ETH’s open interest also witnessed a notable uptick. Traders Are Doubling Down On Ethereum Ethereum’s price appears to have regained upside traction, and its derivatives market is heating up. This notable uptick in the derivatives market is attributed to a recent surge in ETH’s Futures Open Interest (OI) to new multi-month highs. Glassnode, a popular on-chain analytics and financial platform, in a post on X highlighted that Ethereum CME Futures open interest has increased to $3.27 billion. ETH CME futures open interest’s rise to this figure marks its highest level since February 2 this year. This notable expansion in futures is a clear indication that investors and traders are ramping up their bets on the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency . It also demonstrates a renewed capacity for speculation and an increasing level of assurance on ETH’s short-term prospects. According to the on-chain platform, this indicates a definite improvement in institutional standing, as price and demand are increasing simultaneously. As ETH’s price action levels off following recent volatility, increasing open interest implies that market players are setting themselves up for potentially big moves in the future. Such a positive advancement could further bolster the general attitude toward Ethereum and its future performance. A Persistent Decrease In ETH Exchange Reserve While ETH bullish momentum builds , it is being met with robust confidence from investors from all crypto exchanges, solidifying the current upward trend. BlackMen, a market expert, has reported a positive action among ETH investors on crypto exchanges. After examining the Ethereum Exchange Reserves metric, the expert stated that the amount of ETH in exchanges is rapidly decreasing. Such a decline in exchange reserves highlights the increasing inclination of investors to move their ETH to decentralized platforms or long-term safekeeping. Investors are also locking their Ethereum in staking, which keeps it in the system, and this rate is getting close to all-time highs. This pattern is often classified as a bullish indication, indicating that holders are less likely to sell and more optimistic about ETH’s prospects . BlackMen stated that these developments are typically the precursor to bull runs that begin quietly, not hype or coincidence, noting that a slight hype could occur after August. The expert’s claims may imply that the ongoing bull market cycle still has room to extend .

2025-07-10T22:00:36,"Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype—$4.4B Inflows Back The Move","Bitcoin has set a new all-time high (ATH) above $112,000, and if on-chain data is to go by, there is some real conviction behind the move. Bitcoin Realized Cap Shows ATH Breakout Not Just Speculative In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the “Realized Cap” of Bitcoin. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates the asset’s total value by assuming that the ‘true’ value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum’s Correlation Is Fading This is different from the methodology that the usual market cap employs, where all tokens part of the supply are assigned the same value: the current Bitcoin spot price. The last transaction of any token is likely to represent the last time that it changed hands on the network, so the price at that time could be considered as its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all coins, its value essentially represents a net cost basis for the entire supply. In other words, the model can be looked at as a measure of the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the cryptocurrency. In contrast, the market cap is the value that the holders are carrying in the present. During the past day, the Bitcoin market cap saw a surge as the spot price set a new record. But what about the Realized Cap? “Unlike market cap, Realized Cap reflects actual capital inflows – only rising when coins move at higher prices,” notes the analytics firm. Here is the chart shared by Glassnode, showing whether or not real capital inflows occurred for Bitcoin with this rally: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Realized Cap has been following an upward trajectory for a while now, suggesting capital inflows have been coming into the asset. With the latest price surge, too, the metric has seen a leg up, corresponding to a whopping $4.4 billion flowing into the coin. “The $4.4B jump as $BTC broke a new ATH above $112K confirms real conviction behind the move, not just speculative markup,” explains the analytics firm. In some other news, the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio is currently sitting around the 2.25 mark, as CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr has pointed out in an X post. The MVRV Ratio measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and Realized Cap. From the chart, it’s visible that BTC encountered resistance the last few times the metric hit a value around 2.75.

Right now, the 2.75 level corresponds to a spot price of $130,900. “This will essentially be the first selling pressure point,” says the analyst.

With this latest move, BTC is up 4.6% in the past 24 hours and more than 5.5% over the past seven days with a massive $50 billion daily trading volume. Source: TradingView The move comes at the expense of short traders, who lost a combined total of around $940 million in the past day, according to data from Coinglass. This has caused a massive short squeeze, which is a common term used to describe a situation where short traders get liquidated and, as they do, this pushes the price upwards even further. At the time of this writing, the total liquidations are at about $1 billion and 94% of that accounts for sellers, which is pretty indicative of the absolute domination by the buyers. The rest of the market is also charting considerable gains – ETH is approaching $3,000, XRP is trading close to $2.6, while the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is almost $3.7 trillion.

Schiff warned investors who saw this rise as an opportunity, arguing that Bitcoin did not offer a basic business model. “The logic behind Bitcoin or Ethereum treasury companies is to exploit naive investors who are willing to buy shares of companies with no real business model at higher premiums,” Schiff said in his statement. But those who aim to profit from this speculation are likewise “fools themselves,” according to Schiff.

Even if Bitcoin continues to rise for a while, silver is likely to rise even higher. Furthermore, while Bitcoin could easily crash, the downside risk in silver is quite limited.” However, despite all his hostility towards BTC, Schiff recently sold an NFT collection of his own on the Bitcoin network.

2025-07-10T21:00:21,"XRP Flashes Signal That Last Time Preceded A 464% Rally, Analyst Says","In a new video released June 9, crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK issued a extremely bullish XRP update, citing a convergence of technical signals that he believes could set the stage for a powerful upward move. Drawing parallels to previous market cycles, the analyst points to the reappearance of a signal that once preceded a 464% rally in XRP, and says this may mark the beginning of a similar explosive breakout. XRP Breakout Confirmed? Yesterday, XRP recorded its highest 4-hour close since May 23, breaking out of a prolonged range. The token has entered what he called a “dense area of liquidity,” an important technical zone that has historically preceded impulsive price action. In a notable divergence from typical market dynamics, XRP is leading Bitcoin, rather than following it. “XRP is currently leading Bitcoin on this move,” he said. “Something I’ve been calling for a while is for XRP to lead alts and lead a potential alt season.” CryptoInsightUK sees further confirmation in Bitcoin’s setup. BTC is still consolidating but pushing above the $111,000 liquidity zone. A move into that zone, he said, would “give us confluence that the price action XRP’s displaying is not a fakeout.” Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP’s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated Structurally, XRP’s trend remains intact. Despite recent pullbacks, the token has maintained its higher-low formation, a signal of technical strength. More importantly, XRP/BTC is beginning to show momentum reversal. “We’ve just had the highest 4-hour close since the 24th of May. This is showing the momentum to the downside is waning.” He highlights a specific line on the XRP/BTC chart referenced by fellow analyst Credible Crypto as the “Gandalf line”—a level that has acted as a pivot point for years. XRP has now closed above it on the 4-hour chart. “We’ve wicked into it, bounced off it. We lose it, we get pushed down hard. We break it, we normally really go for it.” Zooming out, he points to the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) on XRP’s price chart. If the current weekly candle closes above the RSI’s simple moving average, it would be the first time since XRP’s breakout off the lows—an event that previously triggered a 464% move to $2.70. “If we get the bullish cross close… 464% from this [level] would take us to $13.05,” he explained. “I think we’re going to about $12 on this push.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% “Moonshot” For XRP Price If This Line Breaks Moreover, the analyst anticipates a 325% move in XRP/BTC based on historical ratios and a potential surge in XRP dominance toward 14%, with an even more aggressive Elliott Wave count pointing to a possible move to 20% dominance. “We’ve completed a Wyckoff accumulation. We’re in the sign of strength phase. Last point support… we’re going into phase E,” he said, referencing classical technical accumulation structures. Still, despite the bullish setup, the analyst made clear he plans to de-risk between $8 and $13, emphasizing capital preservation after a potential 20x move from 50 cents. “The risk-to-reward on the downside is just too large at that point,” he noted. “Even if it goes significantly higher… anyone who’s done a 20x on something should be taking some money off the table.” He concluded the analysis with cautious optimism: “Don’t start counting your Lambos yet, but also probably start scrolling the magazine.” For now, all eyes are on XRP’s price action and Bitcoin’s staying power above $111,000. If both confirm, as he put it: “It’s game on.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.44.

2025-07-10T20:53:58,"Bitcoin price prediction July 2025: Will BTC hit new all-time highs this summer?","Bitcoin – the OG of all cryptocurrencies – kicked off the whole crypto revolution and still leads the pack. It sets the pace for the entire market. About a month and a half ago, at the end of May 2025, BTC hit a fresh all-time high, just shy of $112,000. Since then, it hasn’t dipped below the $100K mark. So, what’s next for BTC in July? Is Bitcoin a good investment? Where’s the price headed, what should we expect, and what are the key factors that could drive it up (or down)? Let’s break it all down in our Bitcoin price prediction for July 2025. Table of Contents BTC price factors for July Bitcoin crypto price prediction: general outlook Bitcoin price prediction: July 2025 BTC price factors for July Institutional demand continues to be one of the biggest drivers for Bitcoin ( BTC ) this month. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing massive inflows helping stabilize demand and reduce volatility. The Trump administration is showing strong support for the crypto space, nominating pro-crypto figures to top regulatory roles at the SEC and CFTC. Meanwhile, BTC recently broke through a key resistance at $108,000, opening the door to a move toward the $110K-$115K zone. Strong bids and limit orders around $100K-$103K are providing a solid price floor and adding to market stability. Momentum is also being fueled by fresh corporate interest. Trump Media’s application to list a Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF is currently under SEC review. And just announced , France-based Sequans Communications closed a $384 million private placement backed by over 40 institutional investors — with most of the capital going straight into Bitcoin. It’s the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin play since Michael Saylor’s bold move in 2020. His firm now holds 597,325 BTC, worth over $64 billion, with $22 billion in unrealized gains. So, what can we expect from BTC in July? Will Bitcoin go up or down? Bitcoin crypto price prediction: general outlook As of today, July 10, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at around $113K. Over the past 24 hours, it’s up 2.4%, and it’s gained about 3.41% over the last week. BTC 1-day chart, July 2025 | Source: crypto.news But here’s where things get interesting : Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands — which track price volatility — are the tightest they’ve been in over a year. That kind of squeeze usually means a big move is coming. And given the overall bullish momentum in the market, most signs are pointing to an upside breakout. Analysts are watching this setup closely. Similar squeezes in the past (like back in early 2024) led to major rallies — one of them saw BTC jump over 70%. If we see a clean breakout above $110K, it could open the door for a run toward $115K, or even higher. Some more aggressive forecasts are throwing around numbers like $150K-$190K if momentum really kicks in. So while price action’s been calm lately, this could just be the calm before the storm. You might also like: Analysis: Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands squeeze hints at bullish breakout What does the Bitcoin price prediction for July 2025 look like according to analytical sites? Bitcoin price prediction: July 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Bitcoin coin price prediction, BTC could keep moving up this month, with a potential 7.64% gain that might push it to a new all-time high of $117.3K by August 6. The BTC price prediction for July 8 is also looking pretty bullish — 24 technical indicators are pointing to a possible rebound, while only 4 are flashing warning signs. According to DigitalCoinPrice’s Bitcoin price forecast, BTC might see a 2.52% bump by the end of July, which would put it around $111.76K. Wallet Investor’s BTC projections are also looking upbeat — they think Bitcoin could hit a high of $120.98K by early August. Should you invest in Bitcoin? With everything going on — strong institutional inflows, bullish technicals, and supportive policy moves — expectations for BTC this month are looking pretty solid. It’s holding above $100K, eyeing a breakout, and most forecasts point toward more upside, with targets as high as $117K-$121K by early August. Of course, it’s still crypto — nothing’s guaranteed. But if you’re thinking about getting in or adding to your stack, the outlook for July looks promising. Just stay smart, don’t FOMO, and keep an eye on the charts.

2025-07-10T20:30:33,"CONY: High Yield Has Offset Price Declines But More Downside Possible","Summary I maintain a hold rating on CONY due to Coinbase and Bitcoin trading near all-time highs, increasing risk of a pullback. CONY offers massive distributions (currently ~73% yield), but suffers from significant price decay and capped upside potential. The fund’s synthetic option strategy generates income but exposes investors to greater downside risk and underperforms COIN over time. CONY’s tax-efficient distributions and potential for 'house money' status favor patient, income-focused investors, but long-term growth is limited. Overview I've covered a ton of different YieldMax products over the last few months but YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) is unique to me because it's the first option ETF I've managed to achieve house money status on. When I previously covered CONY, I issued a hold rating because I was becoming cautious on a shift in the momentum of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). However, Bitcoin just recently crossed $112,000 for the first time this week so perhaps my cautionary approach was not well timed. Now that I've held CONY for over a year, I wanted to revisit the ETF to provide some updated insights into its performance, distribution utility, and overall health. Looking at the performance over the last twelve months, we can see that CONY's price has deteriorated by nearly 50%. The fund's poor price resilience is something that I wish could be improved going forward and I hope that management finds a way to soften the downside risk. When including all distributions that were paid out to shareholders, the total return sits around 28.5% over the same period. This positive return can be attributed to the large starting dividend yield of approximately 73% . New distributions are announced every four weeks so the estimated yield can be different by the time you read this article. Data by YCharts Since my last coverage, there have been a lot of positive catalysts for Coinbase ( COIN ). For example, the company was added to the S&P 500 index and experienced several other favorable events that can drive revenues higher. As a result, I believe that CONY will be able to continue efficiently harnessing COIN's volatility and rewarding shareholders with large distributions. As Bitcoin becomes less volatile over time, this may smooth out the price of COIN and CONY as well. However, there are some downsides to CONY that I believe can be improved. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying fund strategy that the ETF implements to generate its distributions. Fund Strategy If you aren't familiar with the fund, CONY operates as a synthetic option ETF that aims to deliver large distributions from the premiums it collects on its underlying option strategy. The fund is capable of harnessing the underlying volatility of Coinbase to execute options. The term 'synthetic' simply means that CONY doesn't actually own any underlying common shares of COIN, so it is writing options against an asset that it doesn't actually own. This can significantly increase the risk profile of CONY because the fund can see much larger price losses compared to what COIN actually experiences. If we look at the holdings below, we can see that CONY doesn't have common shares of COIN listed. Instead, the fund is backed by treasuries and there are several different options listed. Since CONY doesn't actually own any underlying shares, it implements a creative approach to provide investors with a daily price change that mimics the movements of Coinbase. This is achieved by simultaneously purchasing ATM (at-the-money) call options and selling put options to replicate the daily price movement of COIN. In order to generate the option premiums that are used to fuel distributions, CONY sells OTM (out-of-the-money) call options that typically have a strike price somewhere between 0% to 15% above the current market price of COIN. The summary prospectus has a helpful breakdown that highlights all of the option strategies that the fund uses. CONY Holdings (Seeking Alpha) Despite using an OTM option strategy, CONY is likely to alwaysunderperform COIN from a price perspective. This is because the upside price momentum is capped at the selected strike price. Additionally, the upside is capped but the downside is not, so CONY will feel the full impact of price declines. This is my least favorite aspect of YieldMax funds because you are usually better off simply owning the underlying stock, rather than focusing on income. Looking at the chart below, we can see how Coinbase is up over 372% since CONY's inception. Meanwhile, CONY's price is down over 51.6% since its inception. Data by YCharts Performance & Risks: The Early Advantage CONY has an inception dating back to August 2023, and has a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. Looking at the performance since inception, CONY has been able to provide a total return of over 172%, which includes all distributions that were paid out to shareholders. Unfortunately, the price has deteriorated by more than 51.6% over the same time frame. The significant price deterioration really limits the appeal of the fund but this is just the risk that investors must be aware of when it comes to these single-stock synthetic option ETFs. Data by YCharts Looking at the total return comparison between CONY and COIN below, we can see that common shares of Coinbase has provided a total return of over 372%. In this context, CONY's total return of 172% no longer seems that impressive since it was severely outperformed by the common shares. CONY essentially captured less than 50% of COIN's total return but to CONY's credit, COIN experienced a significant rise from ~$80 per share up to ~$373 per share over this period. This sort of price growth is unusual and CONY's documents clearly lays out that it will experience a capped upside so there shouldn't be any surprises here. Coinbase also had a few different catalysts to help drive the price significantly higher over the last few months. Some of the notable catalysts include: Inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Coinbase secured MiCA license to offer crypto services in EU. Coinbase to deploy USDC stablecoin as collateral in US futures trading. US Senate passes stablecoin legislation . Data by YCharts The unfortunately truth is that nearly all the YieldMax funds eventually suffer from the same fate and this is my main issue. The large distributions and capped upside potential makes it very unlikely for these funds to ever experience large price swings upward over time. No matter what the catalyst is, many of these funds will never experience price gains. Just as an example, here are some different YieldMax ETFs and their respective price change since inception. YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF ( APLY ) YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF ( TSLY ) YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NVDY ) YieldMax META Option Income Strategy ETF ( FBY ) As we can see below, all of these funds have seen their price deteriorate over time. Nvidia ( NVDA ) recently became the first company to be valued at over $4T but that milestone is not reflected in the YieldMax fund. Meta Platforms ( META ) currently trades near its all time high, but that is also not reflected in the YieldMax fund. Data by YCharts The reality is that the investors that were able to best capitalize on these YieldMax funds were able to capitalize on the first movers advantage. If you initiated a position in these funds shortly after inception, you probably performed the best. However, that is simply because you would have allowed more time to receive distributions that can offset these declines. After all, CONY offers a massive distribution rate of nearly 73%. So technically, investors should be able to collect back their initial investment within a year and a half. 73% x 1.5 years = 109% in distributions return to shareholders. So despite all its flaws, I believe that patience and time can offset these large declines. A fund like CONY becomes more forgiving the longer you hold it. I went back and calculated all distributions that have been paid out to shareholders over the fund's lifetime. The fund launched at a share price of $20. When including all distributions paid since inception, we can see how early investors would now be sitting at 'house money' status. House money refers to the cross point where you receive more in distributions than what you paid per share. 2023 - $4.7479 in total distributions 2024 - $20.2980 in total distributions 2025 - $4.8392 in total distributions YTD Grand Total: $29.8851 Once you cross into house money status, you've essentially recovered your initial investment back through dividends. Therefore, your risk is significantly reduced going forward since you've now recovered your initial investment but you still hold the shares that pay you distributions every four weeks. However, Coinbase and Bitcoin now trades within territory of both their respective all time highs. A significant downward retraction from the highs will cause CONY's price to retract even further. Data by YCharts Dividend Utility As of the most recently declared distribution of $0.5354, the current distribution rate is about 73% annually. A new payout is declared every four weeks, so the estimated yield can be a lot different based on the time you are reading this. Looking at the dividend payout history below, you'll see one of the biggest issues I have with YieldMax funds. As the price and underlying NAV declines, so do the payouts. In CONY's prime, the largest payout was nearly $2.8 per share. Now that the price has fallen to its current range, I do not see the payouts ever returning to those levels. CONY Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) However, I wanted to specifically talk about the tax-efficiency of the distributions and how the ETF is flexible in terms of what accounts it can be utilized within. If you haven't already, I would highly recommend using the contact form on YieldMax's site and requesting to get added to their distribution list. This is the most accurate way to get the updated distribution every Wednesday for the different YieldMax funds. In the distribution table they provide, there is a column for ROC (return of capital). YieldMax Return of capital distributions aren't classified as income, and therefore aren't taxed as such. Instead, a return of capital distribution reduces an investor's cost basis and allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale. Just for an example, let's imagine that you buy into a stock at $20 per share and it pays you a $2 per share dividend using return of capital. Instead of being taxed on that $2 per share dividend, your cost basis would be reduced to $18 per share. So with CONY, you are technically able to hold onto a long-term position until your cost basis reaches $0. At that point, all distributions received would be classified as long-term capital gains. The use of return of capital can be controversial because investors can interpret this as your own capital being paid back to you. However, this isn't necessarily the case all of the time. If YieldMax has a successful period of generating premiums with options, the distributions are still fueled by the premiums. The label of return of capital is simply a tax classification. Therefore, a position in CONY can be efficiently utilized within a regular brokerage account, which increases its overall flexibility. However, it should be noted that there are still portions of the distributions that are funded by net investment income, which has the least favorable tax treatment. Unfortunately, there's no clear way to know how much of the distribution will be taxable until your brokerage releases tax documents at the end of the year. Takeaway In conclusion, I maintain a hold rating on CONY at this time due to Coinbase and Bitcoin both trading near all time highs. I anticipate that a pullback in Coinbase would cause CONY's price to see a deeper downward move over the short term. The distributions can be tax-efficient and the fund becomes more forgiving the longer you hold it. Despite the tax-efficient distributions that can be received from the fund, I really dislike the continued price decay over time. CONY has been one of the least price resilient funds compared to its peers. If you don't have a specific need for income, I wouldn't suggest a position in CONY since it caps the upside price potential. If you are long on Coinbase, it would be much better to hold the underlying shares instead.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800388-cony-high-yield-has-offset-price-declines-but-more-downside-possible?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|BTC|REGULATION","BTC-USD|COIN|CONY",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T20:08:33,"Solana price prediction this week: can $160 spark the next leg up?","A clean break above $160 could confirm Solana’s bullish reversal, but resistance remains stiff. With trading volume up 19%, ETF momentum rekindling, institutional capital pouring in, and staking demand rising, the odds of a breakout are improving. The question is whether SOL can sustain the momentum. On July 10, Solana ( SOL ) surged over 4%, climbing from an intraday low of $153 to reach $159.60 by press time, marking one of the token’s strongest single-day moves in recent weeks. The uptick came amid a sharp rise in market activity, with 24-hour trading volume jumping 19% to nearly $4.9 billion, suggesting that traders are positioning for a potential breakout. Beyond the charts, institutional interest in Solana is heating up, adding fresh weight to a potential bullish scenario as smaller cryptocurrencies rally on the back of Bitcoin’s sprint to a new all-time high. You might also like: Sui price rally gains steam after a highly bullish Grayscale report Institutional pressure builds as SOL tests critical levels Despite this week’s move, Solana remains significantly below its January peak near $294. Trading nearly 46% beneath its all-time high, the token has struggled to reclaim momentum above key resistance zones for much of the year. Like most altcoins, SOL felt pressure from regulatory uncertainty and investor preference for Bitcoin ETFs. But Solana has also faced internal challenges, network outages, decentralization concerns, and growing competition from rival smart contract platforms. These factors have held the token back. Until now. The tide appears to be turning. DeFi Dev Corp, which recently increased its holdings to over 846,000 SOL (worth more than $133 million), has emerged as one of the most visible corporate buyers, signaling conviction in Solana’s long-term potential. BIT Mining’s recent $300 million pivot into Solana is another major vote of confidence. Unlike passive accumulation, these firms are actively staking, validating, and integrating into the Solana ecosystem, a level of engagement that the market is watching closely. Meanwhile, the ETF drumbeat has returned with force. While the SEC’s recent request for revisions to Solana ETF filings might seem like a setback, analysts like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart still peg approval odds at 95% by October. Here are mine and @EricBalchunas ' most recent odds on spot crypto ETF approvals by the end of 2025. We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025. pic.twitter.com/H3pxJhqMy3 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2025 The very prospect of a Solana ETF has already shifted sentiment. SOL is now included in the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF’s portfolio, holding an 8% allocation alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Then there’s Solana’s on-chain renaissance. Robinhood’s rollout of SOL staking in the U.S. brings the token directly into retail investor pipelines, just as interest in passive yield strategies rebounds. Solana’s booming network activity, coupled with staking-enabled platforms and streamlined integrations, is starting to chip away at Ethereum’s dominance in the proof-of-stake economy. The verdict: breaking out or faking out? Solana’s price path to $200 hinges on two factors: a decisive break above $160 and sustained institutional inflows. The technical setup is primed: rising volume, bullish chart patterns, and a clear resistance level to conquer. But the real fuel comes from the fundamentals: staking demand, ETF speculation, and a wave of institutional adoption that’s harder to dismiss as fleeting hype. If SOL price flips $160 into support, the next targets are clear: $180 first, then $200. But if resistance holds, expect consolidation between $140 and $160 until the next catalyst emerges. Either way, Solana isn’t just riding Bitcoin’s coattails anymore. The token carving its own path, and this week could determine whether that path leads to a summer rally or another false start.

2025-07-10T20:07:07,"Developers Clarify the Reason Behind the Significant Price Drop in an Altcoin – Did They Sell Their Tokens?","Following the 41% sudden drop in the SOON token on July 5, 2025, the team behind the project released a detailed analysis report. The report stated that the incident was a coordinated market manipulation and that official market makers and foundation wallets had nothing to do with the attack. According to a preliminary report published by the SOON team, the attack occurred between 4:00 PM and 9:00 PM on July 5th. During this period, 22 million SOON tokens, withdrawn from Bitget, were systematically sold on exchanges like Bithumb, Upbit, Gate, and others. At the same time, significant profits were made from the price drop through short positions opened on platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX. This aggressive selling drove the SOON price from $0.22 to $0.13. SOON price has still not fully recovered despite the overall market rally after the recent crash. Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks All-Time High Again — Here's Why and What Analysts Think Will Happen Next In-depth analysis noted that these transactions resulted in funding rates in derivatives markets falling by as much as -500% to -600%.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 550,400 subscribers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin bull market could end in two or three months if history repeats itself. According to the pseudonymous analyst, the Bitcoin bull market typically hits the peak around 518 to 546 days after the halving, suggesting it could occur between mid-September and mid-October. The fourth Bitcoin halving took place in April 2024. On what is in store for Bitcoin’s price over the coming weeks and months, the widely followed analyst says , “If Bitcoin really does have two to three months left in its Bull Market… Then this current period truly is the calm before the storm.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,386 at time of writing. Rekt Capital further says that even if the bull market extends beyond October, trying to capture the potential gains would be a high-risk and low-reward endeavor. “The risk versus reward of that upside will likely not be worth heavy participation. Is it worth capturing an additional +20 – 30% uptrend while risking a -60 to -70% Bear Market?” On altcoins, the widely followed analyst says they could enjoy a rally once Bitcoin rises above the current all-time high of just under $112,000. “When Bitcoin broke out into Price Discovery Uptrend 1 in November 2024… Altcoins rallied exponentially during that time.

2025-07-10T19:59:44,"Bitcoin has broken $114,000 for the first time, with traders now betting on a $120,000 target","Bitcoin just smashed past $114,000, and traders on Deribit are already piling into contracts that bet it’ll hit $120,000 before the month ends. The bets didn’t come out of nowhere. Open interest has surged around strike prices of $115K and $120K, with longer-term options aiming even higher to $140K in September, $150K by December. This all unfolded as Bitcoin logged its second day of a record-breaking rally. The trigger? A combination of institutional demand and political expectations. Bitcoin is already up 20% this year. That’s alongside the S&P 500, which has soared 30% from its April lows. Both charts are pointing straight up. Shorts liquidated as traders crowd into bullish positions Deribit isn’t the only place traders are showing their hands. Chris Newhouse, head of research at Ergonia, a DeFi trading firm, said the breakout followed the biggest short liquidation event since May 7. “Yesterday’s move to all-time highs came after the largest short liquidation event since May 7th, with approximately $447 million in positions liquidated,” Chris said . Bears had built up too much exposure, and the market punished them. The wipeout slowed down slightly afterward. When Bitcoin crossed $112K on Wednesday, it triggered a wave of panic covering. But in the following 12 hours, only $76.5 million in liquidations took place—down sharply from the day before. Those numbers came from Coinglass, which tracks exchange activity. Traders who bet against the rally were forced out, and the rest leaned even harder into the upside. The funding rate for Bitcoin perpetuals is still positive. That matters because it shows traders are paying to stay long, literally. It’s one of the clearest signs that bullish bets are dominating the futures market. No hesitation. People are riding this. Trump’s comments and corporate demand lift confidence The rally on Thursday had an extra kick. Donald Trump went on Truth Social and dropped a series of pro-crypto posts. Coming from the sitting president, it only added to the already bullish tone. Investors are banking on his administration to ease the pressure on crypto regulation, and his public stance is feeding that narrative. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, the CSO and co-founder of Ledn, said the rally is also being driven by corporate buyers. A wave of crypto treasury companies is loading Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. These firms are selling shares or issuing debt to get the funds, trying to turn themselves into Bitcoin proxies for public markets. “Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high on the back of relentless demand from investors and corporations,” Mauricio said. This is all happening while tensions rise globally. Trump’s administration is preparing tariffs set to drop in August, adding more stress to an already tense trade environment. But Roshan Roberts, CEO of OKX US, said Bitcoin isn’t flinching. “As trade tensions flare and altcoins stumble, institutions are treating BTC as a macro hedge and a maturing asset class. July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it,” Roshan said. Prediction markets are buying into that view. Polymarket currently gives Bitcoin a 76% chance of hitting $115,000 by the end of July. With equities roaring, again, S&P 500 up 30% from April, risk assets have momentum on their side. But in crypto, it’s Bitcoin that’s leading the charge.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 139,600 followers on the social media platform X that Pudgy Penguin ( PENGU ), the native asset of a non-fungible token (NFT) collection with the same name, appears ready to skyrocket aided by the launch of its upcoming exchange-traded fund (ETF). “Slap yourself if you are sleeping on PENGU. This is a textbook bullish retest. $0.060 by August is just the start. Once the ETF gets approved, who knows how far this can go.” Source: Ali Martinez/X PENGU is trading for $0.019 at time of writing, a 31.4% increase during the last 24 hours. A rise to Martinez’s target would represent a 216% gain for the asset. Moving on to the popular meme asset DOGE, Martinez says that every time it forms a specific pattern, its price tends to rise. The analyst says he envisions the dog-themed digital asset rising to between $0.20 and $0.25. “Every time Dogecoin forms this pattern, price takes off. Right now, Dogecoin is sitting at the bottom of a parallel channel. A buying spike here could send Dogecoin to $0.20 and maybe even $0.25.” DOGE is trading for $0.179 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Concluding his analysis with the smart contract platform Solana, Martinez notes that the asset has broken through its resistance zone and is on its way to a price tag of $164 by the end of the week. “Solana is forming a symmetrical triangle, and an 8% move could be next. A close above $153 could send Solana above $164.” SOL is trading for $156 at time of writing, a 1.6% gain on the day.

In plain terms: if tax hits, BTC may need to be sold. pic.twitter.com/6ENYrQhhTf — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 10, 2025 That boost to paper profits carries a downside. Starting in 2026, the U.S. will slap a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) on companies with over $1 billion in adjusted income, potentially crystallizing billions in tax bills on gains the company hasn’t sold. Strategy once reported Bitcoin at purchase cost, shielding those sky‑high gains from its income statement. Now, every uptick in Bitcoin’s price inflates taxable income, whether the company moves a single coin or not. In practical terms, Saylor’s empire could face a multi‑billion‑dollar tax hit, even if its Bitcoin stash stays untouched. A thread on X (formerly Twitter) by analytics firm CryptoQuant, posted Thursday, July 10, 2025, summarized the risk in stark terms. “The company might owe cash taxes on unrealized BTC gains,” the firm wrote, adding that Strategy’s own disclosures admit it may need to liquidate some of its Bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity to meet those obligations. Strategy’s tax exposure is a head-on collision with a cash flow gap Strategy’s own filings admit that its software business doesn’t generate enough cash to cover these new obligations. The company already carries $8.2 billion in convertible debt and $3.4 billion in preferred stock, which together demand well over $350 million a year in interest and dividends. If cash from operations falls short, Strategy may need to borrow more, tap equity markets, or, contrary to its long‑held vow, sell Bitcoin. Indeed, the company spells it out unflinchingly: “We may need to liquidate some of our bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity securities to raise cash sufficient to satisfy our tax obligations.” This raises a key question: if the company cannot raise new capital through debt or equity issuance, will it be forced to tap into its Bitcoin reserves? Yes, they've sold BTC before. Despite the “we never sell” meme… 📉 They sold BTC in Q4 2022 (as disclosed in prior SEC filings). A reminder: nothing is off the table if liquidity is tight. pic.twitter.com/xdiaYOQ0Kr — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 10, 2025 Custodial risk is another issue outside Saylor’s control Strategy acknowledged that even its custodial arrangements for Bitcoin may not be bulletproof. If a custodian fails, they may not be able to access their Bitcoin, as the company warned that its tokens could be treated as part of the custodian’s estate, effectively rendering Strategy a general unsecured creditor. To its credit, Strategy has been transparent in outlining these threats. “This is not intended to spread fear, uncertainty, or doubt,” CryptoQuant wrote in its final post on the topic. “It simply summarizes what’s written by Strategy themselves in their official SEC filing.” Strategy’s bitcoin holdings represent roughly 3% of the token’s total circulating supply. Any move under distress, whether to cover taxes or obligations, could considerably impact the market. For now, Strategy remains one of the largest and boldest corporate holders of Bitcoin. But the company’s own documents suggest that it understands that its Satoshi-centric model, while immensely profitable on paper, is also vulnerable. However, if anyone has the answers to these doubts, it’s probably Saylor.
