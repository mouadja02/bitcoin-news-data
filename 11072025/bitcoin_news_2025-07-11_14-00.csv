2025-07-11T11:45:12,"Up to $22,500 per Participant To Be Handed Out as US County Greenlights Guaranteed Income Pilot Program: Report","A guaranteed income pilot program is launching in one US county to help those already enrolled in government aid programs pay for basic needs. Contra Costa County in California will provide 178 people with up to $1,250 per month for 18 months, reports CBS News. The program has just been approved by the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors, which previously allocated $3.25 million in county funds and another $1 million in state funds for the effort. The program will be administered by the county’s Employment and Human Services Department. Those eligible are from four specific populations: youth transitioning out of foster care, families with young children experiencing financial hardship, low-income seniors and people on probation returning to the community after incarceration. Participants also need to be enrolled in county-sponsored programs to be eligible, such as CalWORKs. The first payments are expected to go out on January 15th. Says Marla Stuart, director of the county’s Employment and Human Services Department, “I think you can provide the most, the largest percent of the budget, to the benefits themselves if you don’t have to invest in administrative overhead, advertising, applications, determining eligibility and then managing the case throughout the period.” Board chair Candace Andersen says the program is a pilot that may result in an expanded effort, noting there are more than 300,000 people in Contra Costa County on some form of government assistance. “Most pilots are put in place to say, ‘Hey, does this work? Should we then expand it into a bigger program that might help even more people?’ And that’s what this is.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-11T11:40:20,"Phenomenal Growth: US Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows Soar to $383.1M, Marking Fifth Straight Day of Positive Momentum","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs continue their impressive run, recording a staggering total net inflow of $383.1 million on July 10. This significant milestone marks the fifth consecutive day of positive flows, signaling robust and growing interest from institutional investors in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. What does this sustained influx of capital mean for the future of digital assets and how are these Ethereum ETF inflows reshaping the investment landscape? Unpacking the Surge: Why Ethereum ETF Inflows Matter The consistent positive flows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs are more than just numbers; they represent a pivotal shift in how traditional finance views and engages with cryptocurrencies. A spot ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the underlying asset – in this case, Ethereum – without directly owning it. This simplifies access, enhances liquidity, and provides a regulated investment vehicle, making it highly attractive to institutional players who might otherwise be hesitant to navigate the complexities of direct crypto ownership. For Ethereum, these inflows signify several critical points: Mainstream Validation: The approval and subsequent success of spot Ethereum ETFs lend significant credibility to Ethereum as an asset class, moving it further into the mainstream financial ecosystem. Increased Liquidity: With more capital flowing in, the market depth for Ethereum increases, potentially leading to more stable price discovery and reduced volatility over time. Broader Investor Base: ETFs open the doors to a wider range of investors, including those in traditional retirement accounts and brokerage platforms, who previously had limited direct access to crypto. Who’s Leading the Charge? A Deep Dive into BlackRock’s Dominance While multiple players are vying for market share, one name stands out prominently in the recent wave of inflows: BlackRock . The world’s largest asset manager, through its ETHA ETF, led the pack with an astounding $300.9 million in inflows on July 10 alone. This figure underscores BlackRock’s significant influence and its strategic positioning within the nascent crypto ETF market. Here’s a breakdown of the top performers on July 10, according to data from Farside Investors: ETF Name Ticker Net Inflows (July 10) BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETHA $300.9 million Fidelity Wise Origin Ethereum Fund FETH $37.3 million Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust Mini ETH $20.7 million Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE $18.9 million Bitwise Ethereum ETF ETHW $3.2 million VanEck Ethereum Trust ETHV $2.1 million The substantial lead by BlackRock’s ETHA highlights the immense trust and capital that institutional investors are willing to place in established financial giants when entering the crypto space. Their entry not only brings significant capital but also sophisticated risk management and compliance frameworks, which are crucial for the long-term maturation of the crypto market. The Bigger Picture: What Do These Institutional Investments Signal? The consistent positive flows into Ethereum ETFs are a strong indicator of growing institutional confidence in digital assets beyond Bitcoin. For years, Bitcoin has been the primary gateway for traditional finance into crypto, largely due to its first-mover advantage and perceived store-of-value properties. However, Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, its role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and its upcoming scaling solutions, make it an increasingly attractive asset. These institutional investments signal a few key trends: Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: Institutions are looking to diversify their crypto exposure, recognizing Ethereum’s unique value proposition and its potential for significant growth. Long-Term Bullish Sentiment: Sustained inflows suggest that these are not short-term speculative plays but rather long-term strategic allocations, indicating a bullish outlook on Ethereum’s future. Maturation of the Crypto Market: The ability to launch and successfully operate such financial products signifies the increasing maturity and regulatory acceptance of the crypto market as a whole. This trend mirrors the success seen with spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, which brought billions into the crypto market and contributed to Bitcoin’s rally. The expectation is that Ethereum ETFs could follow a similar trajectory, attracting a new wave of capital and further integrating crypto into global finance. Navigating the Market: The Impact on Ethereum Price Action While direct correlation is complex, sustained Ethereum ETF inflows are generally viewed as a positive catalyst for Ethereum price action . Increased demand from institutional buyers, coupled with the removal of ETH from the open market to back the ETFs, can exert upward pressure on the asset’s price. As more capital flows into these regulated products, the supply available on exchanges for retail trading might decrease, potentially leading to price appreciation. However, it’s important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and broader market sentiment. While the ETF inflows provide a strong fundamental tailwind, investors should remain aware of market volatility and conduct their own due diligence. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto ETFs and Beyond The success of spot Bitcoin and now Ethereum ETFs sets a powerful precedent for the future of crypto ETFs . It opens up the possibility for other major altcoins to eventually have their own spot ETF products, further legitimizing the broader digital asset space. This institutional embrace could lead to: Enhanced Market Stability: As more institutional capital enters, the market could become less susceptible to extreme retail-driven volatility. Increased Innovation: Greater mainstream adoption and investment can spur further innovation within the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Broader Adoption: ETFs simplify access, making crypto investments more appealing and accessible to a wider demographic of investors globally. The journey of crypto ETFs is still in its early stages, but the recent inflows demonstrate a clear appetite from sophisticated investors. This sustained interest could pave the way for a new era of growth and integration for digital assets within the global financial system. In conclusion, the impressive $383.1 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on July 10, marking the fifth consecutive day of positive flows, is a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum. Led by BlackRock’s significant contributions, these inflows are not just about capital; they signify mainstream validation, increased liquidity, and a broadening investor base. As institutional investments continue to pour in, they are poised to significantly impact Ethereum price action and reshape the landscape of crypto ETFs , propelling the entire digital asset market towards a more integrated and mature future. This ongoing trend underscores the exciting potential of Ethereum and its pivotal role in the evolving financial ecosystem.

2025-07-11T11:35:22,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – July 11, 2025","The crypto market is up today, for the third day in a row. 99 of the top 100 coins per market cap have appreciated over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has increased by 1.3% to $3.73 trillion, which is a significant increase from yesterday’s $3.45 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $231 billion, up from $128 billion a day before. TLDR: The crypto market rising, with the market cap hitting $3.73 trillion; 99 of the top 100 coins are green; BTC recorded a new ATH, now trading at $117,586, and ETH hit the $3,000 mark; BTC has seen 62 days of price stability in six-figure territory; Market sentiment entered greed territory; Both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs saw the second-highest inflows since launch; ”The medium- and long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly positive.” Crypto Winners & Losers The crypto market has continued the green streak for the third day, as all top 10 coins per market cap rise as well. Bitcoin (BTC) has done it – it broke its previous all-time high. The coin jumped 5.6% in a day, currently trading at $117,586. Moreover, Ethereum (ETH) is the category’s second-best performer. It appreciated by 6.5%, currently changing hands at $2,986. Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 8.9% is the highest increase among the top 10. Its price is now $0.1965. Moreover, only one of the top 100 coins is red today. Monero (XMR) fell 0.7% to $325. On the other side, a dozen coins recorded double-digit rises. Two of these have increases of over 20%. Ethena (ENA) rose by 20.7% to the price of $0.347, while Sei (SEI) is up 20.6% to $0.3183. Meanwhile, $1.25 billion in leveraged positions have been liquidated in 24 hours, according to CoinGlass . Short traders account for $1.1 billion. Moreover, of the total amount, Bitcoin accounted for $658.43 million and Ethereum for $250.89 million. Source: CoinGlass Notably, the dollar is seeing its worst performance since 1973. This is actively fueling risk assets, including crypto. ‘Outlook for Bitcoin Remains Overwhelmingly Positive’ Gadi Chait, Head of Investment at Xapo Bank , commented that since 8 May, Bitcoin has ended every day above $100,000. “That’s 62 days of price stability in six-figure territory,” Chait says. “For an asset once defined by volatility, this price consolidation over a significant period of time shows that Bitcoin is maturing.” And this week, BTC surged to an ATH, reflecting robust institutional demand and macroeconomic tailwinds, he adds. “Under the surface, institutional accumulation is at fever pitch.” Also, the stability and institutional inflow held firm through major macroeconomic uncertainty and global geopolitical tensions. This is “a test that many other so-called ‘volatile assets’ would struggle to pass,” Chait argues. Moreover, James Toledano, Chief Operating Officer at Unity Wallet , adds that the price surge seems to be driven by a confluence of macroeconomic optimism and significant institutional activity. The latter comes in the form of ETF inflows and sovereign and corporate balance sheet allocations. Additionally, there’s the talk of an incoming US Federal Reserve rate cuts. Furthermore, Toledano argues that the situation could turn bad for the traditional economy, benefiting digital assets. “The US has a major debt crisis, and the interest payments on this debt is the largest budget line-item,” he says. Also, the dollar is weakening, and bond markets are experiencing sell-offs. “A reckoning is surely coming, but this may be good for the strongest crypto assets as capital takes flight seeking a new home,” Toledano writes. Meanwhile, Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler , argues that a decisive breakout and sustained move above $112,000 for BTC “could trigger a sharp upward rally, potentially targeting the $130,000 range before entering a new consolidation phase at historically unprecedented levels.” He adds that “the potential for such a move is underpinned by a broadly supportive macro backdrop,” as well as tightening BTC supply dynamics. However, there are some near-term risks. This includes an evolving political and economic backdrop, particularly trade tensions. “That said, the medium- and long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains overwhelmingly positive,” Lienkha continues. “Institutional adoption continues to deepen, the integration of crypto into traditional financial systems is accelerating, and the macro narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against monetary debasement remains intact. Additionally, regulatory clarity is gradually improving in key markets, further legitimizing digital assets as a core component of diversified portfolios.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $117,586. The coin hit a new all-time high of $118,254 just an hour prior to this writing. This was also a surge from the intraday low of $98,974. The price is up 8.1% in a week, 7.6% in a month, and 103% in a year. Now, analysts and investors alike are waiting to see if BTC will surpass the $119,000 and $120,000 levels. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,986. It managed to finally surpass the $3,000 mark again, reaching $3,019 earlier this morning (UTC). It pulled back slightly, but analysts argue that it may rise further. Overall, it’s up 17.1% in a week and 7.4% in a month. It fell 3.5% in a year. We’re now looking at $2,950-$3,050 as key support levels. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment also surged and entered greed territory. The Fear and Greed Index jumped from 58 yesterday to 67 today . This is the highest it’s been in a month. It also signals caution to investors. While this is not extreme green, the level suggests potential overconfidence. It may result in FOMO (fear of missing out) and, subsequently, inflated prices. Furthermore, on 10 July, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a massive jump. They saw inflows of $1.18 billion , compared to $218.04 million on 9 July. This is the second-highest amount ever, the highest being $1.38 billion in November 2024. BlackRock’s share is $448.49 million. It’s followed by Grayscale’s $324.34 million, as well as Ark & 21Shares’ $268.7 million. On the same day, US ETH ETFs saw significant inflows of $383.1 million . This is the highest amount in six months. It is second only to the all-time high of $428.44 million seen in December 2024. Of this amount, BlackRock took in $300.93 million, while Fidelity saw $37.28 million. Meanwhile, institutions and corporations are still entering the crypto space, and increasingly so. One of the latest is NRW.BANK , a German state-owned development bank. It has recently issued a €100 million ($116.7 million) blockchain-based bond on the Polygon network.

2025-07-11T11:30:34,"Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Net Worth Climbs to $10B After SEC Settlement","The post Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Net Worth Climbs to $10B After SEC Settlement appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the cryptocurrency industry reshapes global finance, few leaders have made as profound an impact as Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs. With an estimated net worth between $9 to $10 billion, largely driven by his 6.3% equity stake and significant XRP holdings, Garlinghouse has helped Ripple evolve from a blockchain startup into a powerhouse of fintech innovation. He became a defining figure in crypto regulation, especially through Ripple’s high-stakes legal battle with the U.S. SEC, while also promoting Ripple’s vision for an “internet of value.” From Kansas to Silicon Valley: A Vision Takes Root Born in Topeka, Kansas in 1971, Garlinghouse’s early love for computing led him to pursue economics in college, followed by an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1997. In a 2016 interview, he recalled how his desire to “change the world” took him to Silicon Valley during the early internet boom. He held executive roles at Dialpad, AOL, and Yahoo!, where his 2006 memo—dubbed the “Peanut Butter Manifesto”—criticized Yahoo!’s scattered priorities. The bold critique cemented his reputation as a strategic leader unafraid to challenge the status quo. Leading Ripple’s Blockchain Breakthrough Garlinghouse joined Ripple Labs in 2015 and became CEO a year later. Under his leadership, Ripple pushed for global adoption of XRP as a bridge asset for fast, low-cost cross-border payments. He helped strike major partnerships with financial giants like Santander and SBI Holdings, positioning Ripple as a core player in next-gen financial infrastructure. In a recent CNBC interview , Garlinghouse emphasized the goal: “We harness the advantages of crypto, such as quicker and more affordable transactions, and integrate it into traditional finance.” Ripple’s growing influence in the global remittance and banking sector has also boosted his personal net worth, which, according to Charles Gasparino (Fox Business), crossed $10 billion as of March 2025. The Ripple vs. SEC Saga: A Defining Battle Garlinghouse’s legacy is closely tied to Ripple’s fight with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2020 , the SEC alleged that Ripple, Garlinghouse, and co-founder Chris Larsen raised $1.3 billion through unregistered XRP sales. Garlinghouse pushed back hard, calling the lawsuit a case of regulatory overreach. He maintained that XRP is a currency, not a security. The case reached a turning point on May 8, 2025, when Ripple and the executives agreed to a $50 million settlement —a fraction of the original demand. They also jointly requested the court to dissolve the injunction and release funds previously held in escrow. Although formal approval from the court is pending, the move marked a landmark moment for crypto regulation and corporate accountability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple News Today- Will BlackRock File XRP ETF? , Advocating for Crypto Clarity During a U.S. Senate hearing on July 9, 2025, Garlinghouse made a strong case for crypto-friendly legislation. He warned that the lack of clear rules was pushing innovation and jobs overseas and urged lawmakers to emulate regulatory frameworks like those in the U.K. and EU. He called for practical, consumer-protective laws that foster growth and trust in the crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A $10B Legacy Still in the Making Brad Garlinghouse’s journey—from Kansas to the heart of Silicon Valley to leading Ripple through legal and regulatory minefields—reflects vision, courage, and persistence. With Ripple’s global influence still expanding and regulations slowly evolving, his mission to build an internet of value is far from over. Whether it’s battling regulators, building fintech rails, or shaping policy, Garlinghouse has become a central figure in blockchain’s journey into the mainstream. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T11:30:27,"Dogecoin Chart Is ‘One Of The Best’ In Crypto—$1 Remains Likely: Analyst","Dogecoin hovered near $0.20 on Friday, nursing a weekly gain of about 17 percent and a 24-hour trading volume above $2 billion as traders digested a late-June livestream by technical analyst Kevin, who argued that the meme-coin’s structure “has to be one of the best-looking altcoin charts out there.” Dogecoin Double Bottom Could Trigger $1 During the one-hour session Kevin highlighted a textbook double-bottom that printed on Dogecoin’s weekly chart exactly at the confluence of the 200-week simple and exponential moving averages, the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the 2023–2025 advance, and a long-term up-trend line dating back to the 2022 bear-market trough. Entering at that zone, he said, “the risk-reward here is phenomenal,” noting that a tight stop just below the cluster implied limited downside while upside targets stretched toward the previous cycle’s highs. Kevin told viewers the weekly momentum profile supports a larger breakout. Money-flow on Market Cipher is curling higher for the first time in more than a year; the MACD is preparing to cross bullish from a higher low; and the stochastic RSI has turned up from mid-range. On the monthly chart, relative strength continues to print higher highs and higher lows, and the stock-RSI “is hanging on, ready to push back up,” he said, adding that the entire structure “looks freakin’ great” for a sustained move once Bitcoin clears its own resistance band near $116,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It’s No Meme His price map for the coming months begins with a purple resistance box between $0.94 and $1.31—the 2021 peak plus the 1.618 extension of the 2022–24 base. “I’d be pretty shocked if Dogecoin can’t at least tag 94 cents,” Kevin said, stressing that a decisive break of a dollar would likely attract a new wave of retail traders and algorithmic trend-followers. He stopped short of offering an end-of-cycle target, but insisted “$1 remains likely,” conditional on Bitcoin extending toward the $150,000 region and—crucially—on macro tail-winds such as an end to quantitative tightening by the Federal Reserve. Even so, Kevin warned against complacency. Dogecoin’s intraday spike coincided with Bitcoin’s test of a major Fib cluster at $116,000, while USDT dominance hit golden-pocket support—levels that could spark a near-term cooldown. “Don’t be fooled by green candles,” he said, reminding viewers that meme-coins “can get crushed even in bull markets” and advising strict risk management: take partial profits after big thrusts, move stops to break-even, and “rinse and repeat.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Resistance Walls Ahead: Analyst Flags 3 Key Levels Beyond pure chart work, Kevin framed Dogecoin as a perpetual beneficiary of retail psychology. “You can walk into any gas station and someone owns Doge,” he quipped. “It’s the retail darling—it always will be—especially when new money shows up with deeper pockets than last time.” For now, price action is validating that thesis. If the double-bottom holds and macro conditions align, the analyst argues, Dogecoin could once again headline the next alt-season—this time with a dollar tag that traders in the last cycle could only meme about. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.1978.

2025-07-11T11:30:24,"Russia elevates AI over Bitcoin with impending ban on data center mining","Anticipating growing demand for computing power to meet the needs of digitalization and artificial intelligence, Russia is now going to ban cryptocurrency mining in data centers. Provisions prohibiting the mining of digital coins at such facilities have been added to a bill, drafted on President Putin’s order, which aims to expand Russia’s capabilities to process big data and generate AI. Russian government to ban crypto miners from data centers Authorities in Russia plan to ban the mining of cryptocurrencies in data processing centers (DPCs). The main motive behind the move is to prevent Bitcoin miners from claiming the benefits intended to boost Moscow’s potential in the AI race, such as access to cheap power. Amendments to that end have been added to a draft law dedicated to prioritizing the development of data centers. The changes have been made ahead of its second reading in the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, media reports revealed this week. The bill introduces new provisions to several laws that lawmakers have already finalized, the business news outlet RBC unveiled in a post, quoting a representative of the Office of the Chief of Staff of the Russian Government and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Grigorenko, who oversees the regulatory effort. The updated legislation now defines DPCs as communication facilities. These will be listed in a special register maintained by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media of the Russian Federation. Registered data centers will be prohibited from hosting crypto mining infrastructure and carrying out mining activities, the article detailed. The Duma is expected to vote on the proposal by the end of this month, the source familiar with the process told the publication. According to the official, DPCs will be offered discounted electricity rates to lower their operational costs, as well as quick connection to the power grid to bypass bureaucratic hurdles – benefits that have been denied to crypto mining firms since Moscow legalized their business last year. Digitalization and the development of artificial intelligence (AI) involve storing and processing huge amounts of data, and in order to effectively do that, it’s necessary to increase the number and capacity of data centers, the government representative explained, elaborating: “Transparent and understandable regulation is the first step. We will legislatively establish that a data center is a communications facility, not just a server room. Clear rules will create basis for additional support measures.” Russia may be turning on cryptocurrency miners The preferential treatment of data centers comes on the order of Vladimir Putin, who instructed the government to work out ways to support the sector back in 2020. The draft law was submitted to the Duma the following year and passed on first reading in 2022. The crypto mining industry, however, which was regulated with a law signed by the Russian President in 2024, has seen quite a different attitude from both federal and local authorities. Since the ruling in 2024, activity has been banned in about a dozen territories, from the Far East to occupied Ukraine. Addressing participants in a development forum last week, Putin justified the mining restrictions, which will be in place for the next six years in some corners of his vast country, with the need to wisely exploit Russia’s resources. Quoted by the Kremlin’s press service, he explained: “We were recently happy we had a surplus of electricity in some regions. But they began actively mining there, and governors started complaining to me … We had to make certain decisions.” Cryptocurrency miners taking advantage of low, often subsidized electricity rates in places like the Siberian Oblast of Irkutsk have been blamed for turning energy surpluses into power deficits. Although some prohibition requests from regional officials have been turned down by the executive arm in Moscow, citing the risk of declining budget receipts and energy revenues . The government’s latest move against the mining business in Russia, which aims to solve another shortage, that of computing power, is likely to create more issues. For example, the largest data center in the Irkutsk region is run by the mining giant BitRiver. If the law is adopted in its current form, it’s likely to hurt not just the mining sector, but also the DPC industry, according to blockchain, energy and digital finance analyst Oleg Ogienko. Speaking to the local information portal IrCity, he noted that a number of data center operators have mining hardware installed at their sites and predicted that the new rules will result in financial losses for these companies.

2025-07-11T11:28:01,"Crypto ETFs Attract Billions as Prices Hit New Highs","These impressive inflows were fueled by surging investor demand and record-breaking price moves. Bitcoin soared to a new high, which triggered over $1 billion in short liquidations across the crypto market. Accumulation by long-term holders also reached a yearly high, signaling strong bullish sentiment. Analysts suggest the rally may continue, supported by supply-demand imbalances, rising realized cap, and bullish technical patterns. Bitcoin and Ether ETFs See Massive Inflows Bitcoin and Ethereum investors funneled massive amounts into crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Thursday, which made it the second-largest daily inflows for both asset classes since their respective spot ETF launches. US spot Bitcoin ETFs pulled in a total of $1.17 billion, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) attracting $448 million and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund accounting for $324 million, according to data from Farside Investors . Bitcoin ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) These near-record inflows accompanied a surge in Bitcoin’s price, which reached a new high of $113,800 and continued to rally into Friday. The only larger daily inflow came on Nov. 7, 2024, which coincided with Donald Trump’s US presidential election victory, when Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.37 billion in inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw robust activity after drawing $383.1 million in net inflows — their second-largest daily intake ever. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) was the standout performer, and recorded a record $300.9 million in net inflows on Thursday alone. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) Despite the strong demand, financial advisors from traditional platforms are still hesitant. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, pointed out in an X post that major firms like Vanguard are still restricting access to these ETFs, creating a barrier for adoption. The appetite for these ETFs is now outpacing the issuance of the underlying assets. Data from Ultra Sound Money revealed that Ethereum’s net issuance over the past 24 hours was 2,110 ETH, worth around $6.33 million. This figure was dwarfed by the $383.1 million that was funneled into Ethereum ETFs that same day. Bitcoin is witnessing a similar dynamic. Galaxy Research reported that in 2025 alone, US spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased $28.22 billion worth of BTC, while miners have only produced $7.85 billion worth of new supply. This growing imbalance could support higher prices in the long run. Bitcoin Shorts Crushed It was not only crypto ETFs that set new records thanks to the crypto market rally. Bitcoin short-sellers faced a huge blow on Thursday after the cryptocurrency soared to fresh all-time highs. This triggered over $1 billion in liquidations across the crypto market in 24 hours. According to data from CoinGlass , more than $1 billion in short positions were wiped out, which affected 232,149 traders. Of this, approximately $678 million came from Bitcoin shorts, while $258 million were Ethereum-related. The sharp move took place after Bitcoin’s breakout to a new record price on Thursday. 24 hour liquidation heatmap (Source: GoinGlass ) Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher commented “Bears in disbelief” in an X post, while Daan Crypto Trades called it a “MASSIVE Short squeeze on BTC & ETH.” Market observer Velo added, “Lots of emails are being sent,” alluding to the wave of forced liquidations hitting traders. The overall crypto market cap surged 6.38% over the past day, reaching $3.68 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap . Although some analysts were very doubtful earlier in the week about Bitcoin pushing to new highs, Thursday’s explosive move left many surprised. The liquidation event ranks among the largest in recent history, though it still trails the $2.24 billion wiped out on Feb. 3, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs that raised fears of a global trade war. BTC Accumulation Hints at More Upside Bitcoin surged to $113,800 on Thursday as demand from long-term accumulation addresses spiked. According to CryptoQuant , these accumulation addresses held 248,000 BTC on Wednesday—which was a new yearly high and a 71% increase in 30-day demand since June 22. The last time accumulation reached this level was in December of 2024, when Bitcoin was trading at $97,000 and the all-time high of 278,000 BTC was recorded. The current uptick in demand despite higher prices suggests that confidence among strategic buyers is quite strong. Bitcoin demand from accumulator addresses (Source: CryptoQuant ) Demand momentum also sharply rebounded after previously dipping to 2024 Q4 lows. While cumulative demand, which includes selling pressure, is negative, its recent recovery points to buyers starting to regain some control. This shift implies that there is a foundational bullish interest in Bitcoin, with strategic accumulation outweighing short-term profit-taking behavior. Market analyst Axel Adler Jr. pointed to the MVRV ratio as a key indicator to watch for potential profit-taking. When the MVRV hits 2.75, it typically signals an inflection point where investors begin to distribute holdings. Currently, this threshold aligns with a Bitcoin price of $130,900—around 17% higher than Thursday’s peak. This indicates that the rally may still have room to run before profit-taking begins. Supporting this outlook, Glassnode reported a $4.4 billion increase in Bitcoin’s realized cap as the price surpassed $113,000. Unlike market cap, realized cap only rises when coins are moved at higher prices. This means that fresh capital is entering the market rather than simply driving speculative gains. Boosting the bullish sentiment even more, Milk Road co-founder Kyle Reidhead reaffirmed his $150,000 price target for Bitcoin, due to a bullish cup and handle pattern seen last month. His post on X after Bitcoin’s move above $112,000 reflects the broader confidence that the current rally could extend before encountering major resistance or correction.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9904/crypto-et-fs-attract-billions-as-prices-hit-new-highs,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ETH|BUSINESS","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T11:27:25,"Crypto-Stealing Malware Surges as Scammers Impersonate AI, Web3 Startups — Here’s the Catch","A new wave of sophisticated crypto-stealing malware is spreading across the internet as scammers create fake AI, gaming, and Web3 startups to lure victims into downloading malicious software. Cybersecurity firm Darktrace has raised the alarm, detailing how these campaigns operate through elaborate social engineering tactics that exploit trust in digital startups. Attackers are setting up fake companies with convincing websites, social media profiles, GitHub repositories, white papers, and even fake team pages on platforms like Notion. Many of the sites also appear to be linked to verified or compromised X (formerly Twitter) accounts to appear more legitimate. The fake accounts often post software updates, blog content, and product announcements to maintain the illusion of authenticity. “Threat actors are going to great lengths to make these fake startups look real,” the firm stated, adding that the scam has already impacted users globally. Victims are often contacted directly on platforms like X, Telegram, or Discord, with the impersonators presenting themselves as employees of the fake firms, offering cryptocurrency in exchange for testing their software. Users are then given a registration code and directed to download malware-infected applications from professional-looking websites. Source: Darktrace Darktrace Warns of Advanced Malware Campaign Targeting Crypto Users One of the identified schemes involved a fake blockchain game called “Eternal Decay,” which used altered images to claim conference participation and listed fake investors. Gameplay images were also lifted from another game called “Zombie Within.” Other noted fake startups include names like Pollens AI, Swox, and Buzzu, with nearly identical branding and codebases. MY WALLET GOT DRAINED LAST NIGHT This is not a stunt or a click bait but legit, I got scammed yesterday of 0.4Sol (130,000naira) and here is how it happened. It cost me 0.4 sol in loss to learn this and I don’t want anyone to fall victim to this so please repost for more… pic.twitter.com/x5h7yGjlan — Prymex.eth (@EmekaOghali) May 30, 2025 According to Darktrace, the malware, targeting both Windows and macOS users, is capable of stealing crypto wallet credentials and personal information, using tools like the Realst and Atomic Stealer malware families. Darktrace technical analysis shows that on Windows, the attackers use Electron-based apps to perform system profiling, download malicious files, and execute them quietly. Source: Darktrace On macOS, a disguised DMG file installs the Atomic Stealer , which collects browser data, wallet credentials, and other sensitive files before sending them to attacker-controlled servers. Source: Darktrace Darktrace noted that the malware includes advanced evasion techniques, such as stolen software signing certificates, obfuscation, and persistent background execution to avoid detection. “This is one of the more elaborate and persistent social engineering campaigns we’ve seen targeting the crypto space,” said a Darktrace researcher familiar with the investigation. “They’re building out fake companies with all the digital trimmings — even fake merchandise stores and doctored company registrations — just to get users to download malware,” they added. Notably, Darktrace believes the tactics resemble those previously linked to a malware group known as “CrazyEvil,” identified by Recorded Future earlier this year. That group was known for targeting crypto users and developers through fake projects and social engineering techniques. While it’s unclear whether CrazyEvil is directly responsible for this campaign, the tactics appear consistent. Darktrace warned that the threat actors are using newer variants of malware and more elaborate deception methods to lure victims. Malware Campaigns and Credential Breaches Fuel 2025 Crypto Crime Surge The rise in crypto-targeted scams hasn’t slowed down, and now, a wave of highly coordinated malware and credential breaches is pushing 2025 toward record-breaking crypto losses. According to Kaspersky’s Financial Cyberthreats report , crypto phishing detections have surged 83.4% year-over-year, while mobile banking Trojan attacks have increased 3.6x. In contrast, traditional banking malware has declined, indicating a shift in attacker priorities from fiat systems to crypto wallets. One of the most alarming developments is “SparkKitty,” a sophisticated mobile malware strain active since February 2024. Notably, the tool, which was disguised as TikTok mods or crypto apps, has infiltrated Google Play and the App Store, bypassing security checks to steal seed phrases stored in user photo galleries . @kaspersky discovers SparkKitty malware stealing crypto seed phrase screenshots from iOS and Android using OCR technology after successfully infiltrating official app stores. #Malware #Crypto https://t.co/2oMOhyN1g3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 24, 2025 SparkKitty, an evolution of the earlier SparkCat campaign, uses OCR technology to scan screenshots of wallet credentials from infected devices. Meanwhile, in May, cybersecurity analysts traced malware back to Procolored , a Chinese printer manufacturer. The printer’s official drivers carried a crypto-stealing remote access trojan, replacing copied wallet addresses with those of attackers. ALERT: Chinese printer firm Procolored shipped malware in official drivers. Over 9.3 BTC stolen. Company blames USB error. #CyberSecurity #Bitcoin #Procolored https://t.co/Wb9q7DXL4X — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 19, 2025 The scheme went undetected for six months, resulting in the theft of 9.3 BTC, worth nearly $1 million. Adding to the threat, a massive data breach uncovered by Cybernews revealed over 16 billion login credentials , many collected via infostealer malware. The breach included sensitive access data from platforms like Telegram, GitHub, and Apple, escalating risks for crypto users managing assets online. Combined with CertiK’s estimate of $2.2 billion lost to crypto attacks in H1 2025 , these incidents indicate the growing sophistication of cybercrime targeting digital assets.

A new report by asset manager VanEck has cast a spotlight on what many are calling excessive pay packages, primarily equity-based, at a time when the industry is still navigating volatile market conditions. This isn’t just about a few extra zeros; it’s about corporate governance, investor trust, and the long-term sustainability of the crypto sector. What Did the VanEck Research Uncover About Crypto Executive Pay? According to comprehensive VanEck research , the landscape of crypto executive pay within U.S.-listed Bitcoin mining companies has seen a staggering increase. The study meticulously examined the compensation structures across eight major players in the American Bitcoin mining scene: Bit Digital, Cipher Mining, CleanSpark, Core Scientific, Hut 8, MARA Holdings, Riot Platforms, and TeraWulf. The findings are stark and paint a clear picture of escalating executive rewards. Here’s a snapshot of the key revelations from VanEck’s deep dive: Dramatic Increase: The average compensation for executives at these companies nearly doubled in just one year. From an average of $6.6 million in 2023 , this figure surged to an astonishing $14.4 million in 2024 . This exponential growth is particularly noteworthy given the nascent stage of the industry compared to more established sectors. Equity-Heavy Packages: A significant portion, if not the majority, of this compensation is tied to equity, meaning stock options and shares. While equity-based pay is common in growth industries, its sheer volume here is a point of contention. It often aligns executive interests with shareholder value, but when it becomes disproportionate, it can backfire. Outpacing Traditional Sectors: The report highlights that these compensation levels are considerably higher than those observed in conventional industries like energy and technology. This comparison raises questions about the justification for such elevated pay in a sector that, despite its potential, still faces significant operational and market risks. Low Shareholder Approval: Perhaps the most telling metric from the VanEck study is the lukewarm reception from shareholders themselves. These “aggressive compensation packages” have garnered an approval rate of only 64%. In the world of corporate governance, anything below 70-80% is generally considered a strong signal of shareholder discontent . This low approval rating underscores a significant disconnect between company boards and their investors. The implications of these findings extend beyond just financial figures; they touch upon the very principles of fair compensation and corporate responsibility within the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Why Are Shareholders Expressing Such Strong Discontent? The wave of shareholder discontent sweeping through the boardrooms of Bitcoin mining companies isn’t arbitrary; it stems from several core concerns that challenge the perceived fairness and strategic alignment of executive pay. When executives are paid excessively, especially when it seems disconnected from the company’s performance or broader market conditions, investors naturally question the prudence of such decisions. Here are some of the primary reasons for the growing pushback: Performance vs. Pay Disparity: Shareholders expect executive pay to be closely linked to company performance. If a company’s stock price is stagnant, or even declining, while executive compensation skyrockets, it creates a significant misalignment. Investors want to see their investments grow, and if executive wealth grows disproportionately, it eroding trust. Dilution Concerns: Since a large portion of the compensation is equity-based, it often involves issuing new shares or stock options. This can lead to the dilution of existing shareholder value. Every new share issued means a smaller slice of the pie for current investors, making them wary of large equity grants that don’t seem to offer commensurate returns. Industry Maturity and Risk: While the crypto industry is innovative, it’s also highly volatile and still maturing. Investors might argue that the risks associated with investing in Bitcoin mining companies are not adequately reflected in the “guaranteed” high pay of executives. In more mature industries, compensation often stabilizes as growth opportunities become clearer and risks are better understood. Perception of Greed: In any industry, when executive pay reaches levels significantly higher than peers or what is considered reasonable, it can lead to a public perception of corporate greed. This not only damages the company’s reputation but can also deter potential investors who are looking for well-governed, ethically run businesses. Lack of Transparency: Sometimes, the sheer complexity of executive compensation packages makes it difficult for average shareholders to understand the full scope of what executives are receiving. A lack of clear, transparent reporting can fuel suspicion and frustration, leading to lower approval rates. These factors combine to create a powerful impetus for shareholders to vote against compensation proposals, signaling a clear demand for more responsible and justifiable remuneration practices. How Does Crypto Executive Pay Compare to Other Sectors? One of the most compelling aspects of the VanEck research is its comparison of crypto executive pay to compensation in other established industries. This comparative analysis provides crucial context and highlights why the figures for Bitcoin mining companies are causing such a stir. Traditionally, high-growth tech companies might offer competitive packages, but the current levels in crypto appear to be in a league of their own. Let’s consider some comparisons: Industry/Sector Average CEO Compensation (Approx. 2023-2024) Key Characteristics U.S. Bitcoin Mining Companies $14.4 million (2024) High growth potential, significant volatility, relatively nascent industry, equity-heavy pay. S&P 500 Companies (General) $16-20 million (Median for larger companies) Mature, diversified, often includes long-term incentives and performance bonuses. Energy Sector (Traditional Oil & Gas) $10-15 million Established, capital-intensive, subject to commodity price fluctuations, often with performance-based incentives. Technology Sector (Non-FAANG) $8-15 million Innovation-driven, often equity-heavy, but typically linked to clear product milestones or user growth. Note: Compensation figures can vary widely based on company size, performance, and specific roles. The figures above are approximate averages for comparison purposes based on general market data and the VanEck report. While some large-cap tech giants (like FAANG companies) might see CEO compensation exceeding $50 million, these are typically established, global behemoths with trillions in market cap. The average for most other tech and energy companies, as indicated in the table, tends to be lower than what VanEck found for Bitcoin mining executives. This disparity fuels the narrative that the pay is out of step with the industry’s current stage of development and risk profile, further exacerbating shareholder discontent . What Are the Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry? The issue of excessive executive compensation within Bitcoin mining companies isn’t just an internal squabble between boards and shareholders; it carries significant implications for the broader crypto industry’s reputation and its path toward mainstream acceptance. How these companies manage their corporate governance can set precedents for the entire digital asset ecosystem. Here’s why this matters beyond the balance sheets: Investor Confidence: For the crypto industry to attract more institutional and retail investment, it needs to demonstrate maturity and sound governance. High executive pay that seems unjustified can deter potential investors, making the sector appear less professional or even exploitative. Regulatory Scrutiny: As the crypto space increasingly comes under the regulatory microscope, issues like executive compensation can draw unwanted attention. Regulators might view such practices as signs of poor internal controls or a lack of accountability, potentially leading to stricter oversight. Talent Attraction and Retention: While high pay might attract some, a perception of unfairness can also lead to internal morale issues or make it harder to attract diverse talent who prioritize ethical corporate practices. It can also create an “us vs. them” mentality between leadership and the wider workforce. Public Perception of Crypto: The narrative around cryptocurrency often battles accusations of being a “wild west” or a haven for quick riches. Instances of excessive executive pay reinforce these negative stereotypes, making it harder for the industry to build trust with the general public and policymakers. Sustainability of Business Models: If a significant portion of a company’s resources is being allocated to executive pay rather than re-investment in operations, innovation, or shareholder returns, it raises questions about the long-term sustainability of the business model. This is particularly critical for capital-intensive operations like Bitcoin mining. Addressing shareholder discontent over executive pay is crucial for the crypto industry to mature, gain credibility, and ultimately achieve its full potential as a legitimate and respected financial and technological sector. Moving Forward: Addressing Shareholder Concerns and Building Trust The strong signals of shareholder discontent highlighted by the VanEck research present a critical juncture for Bitcoin mining companies . Ignoring these concerns could lead to further investor backlash, proxy battles, and a damaged reputation. Instead, this situation offers an opportunity for companies to reassess their strategies and foster greater transparency and accountability regarding executive compensation . What steps can be taken to address these issues and rebuild trust? For Companies: Review Compensation Structures: Boards should re-evaluate their executive pay models to ensure they are truly performance-based and aligned with long-term shareholder value. This might involve setting clearer, more ambitious performance metrics that justify high payouts. Increase Transparency: Provide more detailed and easily understandable breakdowns of executive compensation. Explain the rationale behind the packages, how they link to company strategy, and why they are considered appropriate. Engage with Shareholders: Proactively engage in dialogue with institutional and retail shareholders to understand their concerns and incorporate feedback into future compensation decisions. This can prevent proxy fights and build goodwill. Benchmark Responsibly: While it’s important to attract top talent, companies should benchmark executive pay against a broader, more relevant peer group, considering the industry’s maturity and risk profile, rather than solely focusing on the highest earners. Consider Clawback Provisions: Implement or strengthen clawback provisions that allow companies to recover executive bonuses or equity grants if financial results are later restated due to misconduct or if performance targets are not genuinely met. For Shareholders: Exercise Voting Rights: Shareholders should actively participate in annual general meetings and vote on compensation proposals. A united front can send a strong message to management. Form Shareholder Coalitions: Small individual shareholders can amplify their voice by forming groups or collaborating with institutional investors who share similar concerns. Demand Clear Metrics: Push for clearer, quantifiable performance metrics tied to executive pay, ensuring that compensation is truly earned through tangible achievements that benefit the company and its investors. Support Shareholder Proposals: Advocate for or submit shareholder proposals that address governance issues, including executive pay limits or independent compensation committee oversight. By taking these proactive measures, Bitcoin mining companies can demonstrate a commitment to sound corporate governance, strengthen investor relations, and pave the way for a more stable and respected future for crypto executive pay and the industry as a whole. Conclusion: A Call for Balance in the Bitcoin Mining Executive Pay Landscape The recent findings from VanEck research regarding the dramatic increase in executive compensation at Bitcoin mining companies , coupled with significant shareholder discontent , serve as a critical wake-up call for the burgeoning crypto industry. While attracting top talent is undoubtedly important for innovation and growth, the current trajectory of crypto executive pay appears to be out of sync with investor expectations and industry realities. The pushback from shareholders is not merely about penny-pinching; it’s a fundamental demand for greater accountability, transparency, and a more equitable distribution of rewards. For the crypto sector to truly mature and gain widespread trust, its corporate governance practices must evolve to match the professionalism expected of any major industry. By addressing these concerns proactively, fostering open dialogue, and implementing compensation structures that genuinely align executive incentives with long-term shareholder value and company performance, Bitcoin mining companies can navigate this challenge and solidify their position as responsible players in the global financial landscape. This is an opportunity to set a new standard for corporate integrity in the digital age.

2025-07-11T11:20:13,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Rise, Recording Second-Highest ETF Inflows in History! Details Here","Bitcoin and Ethereum investors flocked heavily to spot ETFs on Thursday, recording the second-largest daily net inflow in the funds' history. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Had Their Second Biggest Inflow Day of All Time Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total of $1.17 billion in inflows. $448 million of this came from BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and $324 million from Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund. These strong inflows followed a record high of $113,800 for Bitcoin. This figure marked the second-highest daily inflow in ETF history, following the record $1.37 billion inflow on November 7, 2024. That record came after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. Ethereum ETFs Also Near Record Ethereum spot ETFs also saw net inflows of $383.1 million on the same day, marking the second-highest daily inflow for Ether funds in history. The bulk of this inflow came from BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA), which broke its own record with $300.9 million. This demand for ETFs significantly outpaces the new supply of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the market. While Ethereum’s net supply in the last 24 hours was 2,110 ETH (approximately $6.33 million), $383.1 million worth of ETH inflows into spot ETFs occurred in the same period. Through 2025, institutional investment firm Strategy purchased $28.22 billion worth of BTC through US spot Bitcoin ETFs. During the same period, Bitcoin miners produced only $7.85 billion worth of new BTC. This data suggests that ETFs are overwhelmingly absorbing the Bitcoin supply. NovaDius Wealth Management President Nate Geraci, speaking on X today, emphasized that these strong inflows occurred despite the fact that many traditional financial advisors still do not offer these ETFs to their clients. “Major platforms like Vanguard are still limiting access to these ETFs,” Geraci said, noting that institutional investors are driving demand despite these limitations. This institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs is interpreted as an indication that crypto assets are no longer merely speculative investment vehicles but are beginning to be accepted as strong alternative assets in the macroeconomic environment. *This is not investment advice.

He sees the upcoming “Crypto Week” in the U.S., beginning July 14, as an epic moment for the industry. Meanwhile, Crypto markets are buzzing with fresh energy as total capitalization surged past $3.65 trillion, marking a solid 5.24% gain in just 24 hours. Trading activity is booming too, with volumes jumping over 47% to hit $208 billion, a clear sign that buyers are back in force. Despite the Fear & Greed Index sitting at a steady 67, market momentum is tipping in favor of the bulls. “Gigachad Bull Run” Fueled by Legislation Calling the next phase a “gigachad bull run,” Hoskinson believes regulatory clarity from two major bills, the GENIUS Stablecoin Act and the CLARITY Act , could ignite a new wave of capital inflow. These bills aim to create a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and digital asset regulation. If passed, they could finally end the turf war between the SEC and CFTC and give crypto companies a clear legal path forward. Hoskinson sees this as a gateway for institutional adoption, with trillions in capital waiting on the sidelines. President Donald Trump has already expressed support, and the GENIUS Act has passed the Senate majority. Now, eyes are on the House. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Top $1 Billion as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High , Dollar Weakens, Crypto Confidence Grows At the same time, the macro backdrop is aligning with crypto’s rise. The U.S. dollar is weakening despite no rate cuts, with national debt now approaching $41.1 trillion. Investor trust in Fiat is eroding, and figures like Elon Musk are leaning toward Bitcoin as an alternative store of value . Musk’s recent comments on Bitcoin as the future of money further reflect this growing sentiment. Trillions Waiting to Enter the Market Hoskinson’s renewed confidence in the $250K target is echoed by others. Analysts point to over $7 trillion in money market funds, suggesting this capital could pivot to scarce assets like Bitcoin. Joe Burnett even sees BTC hitting $1 million by 2030 , while ARK Invest projects a wide range from $500,000 to $2.4 million. As legislative clarity nears, voices from Coinbase to Ripple agree that regulation will be the launchpad for crypto’s next big phase. With “Crypto Week” just days away, Bitcoin’s bullish case is stronger than ever. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The U.S. House of Representatives has designated July 14-18 as “Crypto Week.” During this period, lawmakers are expected to vote on key bills like the GENIUS Stablecoin Act and the CLARITY Act, aiming to establish a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins and digital asset regulation. How will the GENIUS Stablecoin Act and CLARITY Act impact crypto? These two major bills aim to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins and digital assets, respectively. If passed, they could end the SEC-CFTC turf war, offering crypto companies a clear legal path. Hoskinson believes this will be a gateway for trillions in institutional capital to enter the market. How does a weakening U.S. dollar benefit Bitcoin and crypto? A weakening U.S. dollar, despite no rate cuts, and rising national debt are eroding investor trust in fiat currency.

2025-07-11T11:02:42,"Bitcoin takes over from gold - Is This the Permanent Shift?","When gold had its spell in the sun it was just about the only asset that was thriving, as US stocks took a big knock, and Bitcoin all but went into hibernation. However, it appears that the tables have turned. Stocks have made a v-shaped recovery, and Bitcoin is having something akin to a moon launch. Expect Bitcoin to make a new high against gold, and for this outperformance to continue longer term. Most of Wall Street still does not know what Bitcoin is One or two of the more traditional analysts have been talking up gold for some while now, saying that not only could it continue to outperform the US stock market, but that it would outperform Bitcoin into the bargain. In fact, Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone went on record several times in the Wolf of All Streets podcast , saying that he expected Bitcoin to go to $10,000. He made the observation that Bitcoin was still below the price of gold in 2021, and that it was now likely to decrease further against the shiny yellow metal. Can $BTC take out the 41-ounce gold all-time high? Source: TradingView The weekly chart for Bitcoin/Gold reveals that $BTC is still below those 2021 highs. That said, this week’s surge has taken BTC/XAU beyond the tops of the 2021 candle bodies, and it might be expected that not only will those highs be overtaken, but also the 41-ounce all-time high. The measured move of the bull flag is to just below 38 ounces. The bulls will need to keep the price above the resistance band at the end of this week, thereby flipping it into support. Bullish weekly gold chart Source: TradingView Looking at the purely gold chart on the weekly time frame, it must be noted that it is very positive indeed. The price has maintained above the ascending channel, which is incredibly bullish. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is shaping for a cross up of the blue (fast) line above the orange (slow) line. This will add upside price momentum to gold as it gets above the 20.00 level. $BTC price spike not slowing down yet Source: TradingView That said, the price chart that looks the best of all is arguably that of $BTC. The spike up over the last three days does not appear to be slowing down yet, and even though $BTC is quite overbought now, there could be enough in the tank via short squeezes and investor hype to take the price to $120,000, or even $130,000 before the next cooling down period. Both Bitcoin and gold are great assets for your portfolio Both Bitcoin and gold are great assets to hold in any portfolio, now and into the future. Yes, $BTC is likely to outperform gold going forward, given its limited supply and the fact that it is a tenth of the size of the market capitalization of gold. That said, they are both hard money assets, and both promise protection from the ravages of government-controlled fiat currencies.

2025-07-11T11:00:23,"Analyst Presents What a Long Term Chart to the End of Bull Market Look Like","In response to a prompt from fellow analyst Mark, macro strategist CrediBULL Crypto has unveiled his bold vision for how the current crypto bull market could unfold. Shared via X, his long-term chart outlines a projected path to the top of the cycle, highlighting a parabolic expansion phase that could define the coming years for digital assets. Momentum Builds Across the Crypto Market CrediBULL’s chart comes as the broader crypto market accelerates with renewed strength. As of report time, Bitcoin is trading at $118,500.16, having shattered previous all-time highs and cementing its leadership role in the bull cycle. The total crypto market cap has now reached approximately $3.5 trillion, underscoring strong capital inflows across the board. Ethereum (ETH) has reclaimed ground above $3,000, driven by sustained ETF demand and institutional interest. XRP, meanwhile, is gaining rapid traction , currently trading at $2.60 after a 6% rally, with price action now approaching a key resistance zone between $2.69 and $2.71. This level is widely viewed as a critical threshold that, if broken, could open the door to new macro highs. https://t.co/ggo5mI28ag pic.twitter.com/rdVYCemZMA — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 11, 2025 Technically, XRP has confirmed a golden cross, with the 100-day moving average crossing above the 200-day, a historically bullish pattern. Bollinger Bands are expanding, signaling volatility expansion, and large holders have resumed accumulation, reinforcing confidence in a sustained move. A Macro Blueprint: Wave 3 in Motion? CrediBULL Crypto’s chart outlines what many technical analysts recognize as Elliott Wave 3, the most powerful leg of a bull cycle. His projection suggests the market has completed its multi-year consolidation and is now entering a phase of explosive growth. Though he avoids assigning specific targets, the structure implies potential moves toward $180,000–$200,000 for Bitcoin, five-digit levels for Ethereum, and double-digit valuations for altcoins like XRP. His vision is not about short-term price action, but rather a multi-year expansion, the kind that historically reshapes investor expectations and market leadership across crypto. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Catalysts Fueling the Rally Several fundamental factors are supporting this bullish outlook. The U.S. Federal Reserve is signaling possible interest rate cuts by Q4 2025, which could inject fresh liquidity into risk markets. Simultaneously, stablecoin supply is growing again, indicating that capital is flowing back into the system. Crypto ETFs now hold more than $80 billion in assets under management, showing continued institutional appetite. In addition, the TOTAL3 index, which tracks the altcoin market excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, has broken out of a multi-year downtrend, a key signal of an impending altcoin surge. The Early Stages of Something Bigger CrediBULL Crypto’s chart may be speculative, but it’s grounded in familiar historical patterns. With Bitcoin now at $118,500.16, Ethereum regaining momentum, and altcoins like XRP flashing major bullish signals , the ingredients for a full-scale crypto rally appear to be falling into place. If current trends continue and macro conditions align, we may be witnessing the early stages of a market expansion that could surpass even the 2017 and 2021 bull runs, one that redefines what’s possible for digital assets in the years to come.

2025-07-11T10:51:03,"Here’s Why This XRP Pump Is Nothing Serious","Discussions around the market-wide run triggered by Bitcoin have led to suggestions that XRP boasts a more natural pump without external factors. Notably, Bitcoin recently soared past a new all-time high, climbing above $118,000 during an ongoing market rally. However, as the price climbs, discussions around what's fueling the surge have emerged, especially after Tether minted another $1 billion worth of USDT. XRP Rally More Organic?For context, the fresh capital injection came just as Bitcoin picked up steam. On-chain tracker Whale Alert first flagged the mint, triggering reactions within crypto circles. Interestingly, this mint came seven days after a previous 1 billion USDT capital injection on July 3.Shortly after the latest mint, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino provided clarifications. He said it served to replenish inventory on the Tron network. According to him, the tokens haven't entered circulation yet and will only come into use when needed for new issuance or chain swaps.Despite the explanation, the timing has triggered suspicions. Critics have pointed out how similar events in the past often lined up with sudden Bitcoin price jumps. Some also claim Tether initiates these mints from ""thin air"" and pushes the capital to Bitcoin.Now, commentators within the XRP community took this cue to draw a line between the two assets. They argue that while Bitcoin's gains might come from fresh liquidity brought in through USDT, XRP's rally looks more natural and driven by actual market demand. Notably, over the past few days, market watchers have called attention to a massive increase in trading activity on Upbit, South Korea's largest exchange, leading to a surge in volume and netflows. Some questioned why these metrics did not translate to a surge in XRP price at the time. Today, the growing demand appears to be contributing to XRP's price uptrend, but only after the BTC price rises and altcoins follow.In the last seven days, Bitcoin has gained 8%. Meanwhile, XRP jumped by a stronger 13.62% within the same time frame. Since the start of the month, XRP has climbed 15.37%, while Bitcoin rose 10%. Although XRP hasn't hit new record highs, its recent growth appears consistent and, to some, less driven by external factors.Connection Between USDT Mints and Bitcoin RalliesThe connection between USDT mints and Bitcoin rallies isn't new. On May 21, 2025, Tether minted $2 billion in USDT . The next day, Bitcoin's price hit a then-record high of $111,000. Notably, market watchers called attention to the correlation.Also, analysts at Blockchain Research Lab found that Bitcoin often rises between 0.4% and 0.8% within 30 minutes of a large USDT mint. These jumps occur more frequently when on-chain alert services highlight transactions and spark FOMO across social media. Meanwhile, a 2018 study by two American university professors also highlighted this link. Their research found that Tether often issued new USDT after market drops, and those coins regularly flowed into Bitcoin. However, market analysts believe these Tether mints merely inject liquidity . They argue that once USDT hits exchanges, traders can use it to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which increases buying pressure and supports rising prices, as in the case of XRP. The mere announcement of a mint often boosts confidence and encourages early buying, and as a result of the BTC rise, XRP is up 8% in 24 hours. Meanwhile, other top crypto assets have joined the market run. For instance, Ethereum has rallied 8.24% over the past day, while Solana and Dogecoin have increased by 4.5% and 10.5%, respectively.BNB appears to have lagged with a mild 2.84% increase within the same timeframe. However, Cardano takes the lead, up 15% during this period.Nonetheless, others disagree. Some critics question whether Tether fully backs every USDT with real-world reserves. They believe that if Tether prints stablecoins without proper support, it could inflate Bitcoin's price unfairly and lead to instability.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/11/heres-why-this-xrp-pump-is-nothing-serious/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-why-this-xrp-pump-is-nothing-serious,"USDT|BTC|XRP|TRADING|MARKET","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

Same is true for XRP. — Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) July 7, 2025 Bitcoin last traded at $3,000 in December 2018 and briefly maintained similar prices through early 2019. Since then, the asset has climbed to a peak of $118,000, representing a return of approximately 3,700%. Steingraber shared that if he had paid attention to the skeptics back then, he would have missed out on the gains entirely. Drawing Parallels Between Bitcoin Then and XRP Now In his message, Steingraber made it clear that he believes XRP is now in a phase similar to where Bitcoin was during its earlier years. “I bought all my Bitcoin at $3,000. I wouldn’t have done that if I listened to naysayers,” he wrote. He further remarked, “Same is true for XRP.” The implication is that XRP, like Bitcoin before it, could offer substantial returns to those who invest before the mainstream narrative shifts. The post reflects a broader belief held by many XRP supporters. They argue that XRP’s value proposition is still intact and that its long-term potential is underestimated by the market due to current sentiment and legal hurdles. While the coin has remained below its all-time high for nearly eight years, some holders maintain that the market is undervaluing it significantly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism Persists, but So Does Belief Despite enthusiasm within the XRP community, the token’s price performance over the years has disappointed some investors. Since the time Bitcoin stood at $3,000, XRP was priced around $0.28. Its gains since then amount to roughly an 11X return, which falls short compared to Bitcoin’s 37X increase. This contrast has led some to question whether XRP can still deliver the kind of returns early Bitcoin investors enjoyed. However, supporters continue to point to the unique factors that have affected XRP’s trajectory. Chief among them is the long-standing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which some believe suppressed the coin’s growth. With that lawsuit now concluded, advocates argue that XRP is in a better position to attract broader interest and investment. Voices Within the Community Urge Patience Others in the XRP space have echoed Steingraber’s outlook. Crypto educator Edoardo Farina recently claimed that XRP could experience a surge in demand once Ripple announces a clear plan for the tokens currently held in escrow. According to Farina, investors who wait until then to take positions may end up buying at much higher prices. Influencer Coach JV has also weighed in, suggesting that XRP is poised to benefit from what he describes as one of the most significant wealth transfers in modern financial history. Caution or Conviction? For many investors, the core question remains: When will XRP realize the growth its advocates foresee? While early Bitcoin adopters have already reaped large profits, XRP holders continue to wait for similar results. Yet individuals like Steingraber continue to urge patience, maintaining that dismissing XRP now could mirror the same mistake people made when they overlooked Bitcoin at $3,000.

ProShares’ Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP) was recently added to the DTCC product list, and Truth Social’s ‘ Crypto Blue Chip ETF ’ filing also includes XRP. Multiple XRP-related ETF proposals are now awaiting review, with key decision dates lined up in July, starting July 14 with ProShares’ trio of futures ETFs, followed by leveraged and volatility-focused funds later in the month. Ripple XRP – Growing Institutional Demand Interest from institutions is already picking up. The Teucrium 2X Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP), which launched in April, has consistently attracted weekly inflows and is nearing $160 million in assets despite a high 1.89% expense ratio. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025) , JPMorgan analysts predict a spot XRP ETF could receive approval later this year and may draw up to $8 billion in its first year, potentially boosting XRP’s price significantly. The SEC is currently reviewing over ten spot XRP ETF applications, with final decisions expected in October. If approved, these ETFs could open the doors to greater institutional access and boost overall market demand for XRP. What’s Next for XRP Price? Currently, XRP is trading near $2.58. A push above $2.60 could open the door to $3. Analyst Javon Marks sees potential for a rally toward $9.63 if momentum holds. However, a drop below $2.50 could lead to support retests at $2.40 or $2.30. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Over the past two days, BTC ( BTC ) has surged roughly 6%, reaching six consecutive all-time highs after breaking through the $110,000 range to a new milestone at $118,668 on July 11. According to data from crypto.news, the token has gone up by 6.8%. On July 10, BTC crossed $113,800, marking its second ATH in less than 24 hours, driven by strong institutional flows and a risk-on market mood. Before that, BTC hit major resistance range at $111,250 after a bullish expansion on the market.

Following the historic pattern that showed July would bring strong gains for BTC. “If historical seasonality holds, Bitcoin could be poised for another move higher — potentially reaching $116,000 in the coming weeks,” said the on-chain analysis firm in its report . The ongoing rally is mostly fueled by expectations of Fed rate cuts, increased inflows into spot BTC ETFs, and broader regulatory tailwinds, with analysts projecting BTC may test $120,000 before month-end. n addition, the market environment, which is buoyed by equity highs and “risk-on” flows, paired with technical breakouts, has amplified the move. Although this also sets the stage for BTC testing the $120,000 resistance zone before potentially extending toward the $130,000 to $140,000 range.

2025-07-11T10:30:38,"Bitcoin (BTC) Madness, Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, and More: Bits Recap","TL;DR BTC reached a new historic peak, with indicators signaling more upside potential. XRP confirmed a multi-year triangle breakout, while analysts predict a push to $3 or a fresh ATH. ETH climbed over 20% in a week, with some industry participants envisioning a pump to $4,000. First Time in History The primary cryptocurrency remains on the crest of the wave, with its price exploding to a new all-time high of over $118,000 just a few hours ago. Moreover, several indicators suggest that bitcoin (BTC) has more room for growth. During previous peaks in 2024, for instance, the asset’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio spiked beyond 2.7, while it currently stands at around 2.35. BTC MVRV, Source: CryptoQuant Furthermore, CryptoQuant revealed that the short-term holder spent output profit ratio (SOPR) does not show signs of “aggressive” profit-taking, resulting in minimal sell pressure from such investors. The diminishing amount of BTC stored on crypto exchanges also indicates a similar thing. Over the last several months, investors have gradually shifted assets from centralized platforms to self-custody methods, as shown in the chart below. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Somewhat expected, the crypto community is full of members envisioning further gains for BTC. X user Captain Faibik claimed the bulls are “in complete control,” predicting a rise to $126,000. OxNobler, who previously forecasted that the “real bull run” would start on July 10, thinks the “super-cycle is here” and argued that the valuation could explode to $300,000. XRP Pumping, too Ripple’s cross-border token has followed the green wave in the crypto market, rising to a two-month high of $2.60. Furthermore, its price appears to have confirmed a breakout from a multi-year symmetrical triangle that formed between 2018 and 2024, which could be a precursor to additional solid gains. X user Cryptoinsightuk assumed that a rise above the resistance level of $2.60 could open the door to an ascent toward $3 and then a new all-time high. At the same time, though, investors should keep an eye on some important metrics that suggest a short-term correction is not out of the cards. An example is XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has soared to 85, or extremely overbought territory. XRP RSI, Source: CryptoWaves How About ETH? The world’s largest altcoin has posted an impressive price increase of almost 20% over the past week, currently trading well above $3,000. ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko According to numerous analysts, the rally is far from being over. X user Cipher X does not expect any “major correction” until $3,300-$3,400, whereas Ted suggested that ETH’s next stop is $4,000. However, there are also some warning signals. As CryptoPotato reported , the Ethereum Foundation offloaded 1,210 ETH for 3.5 million USDC at an average price of approximately $2,890. The entity’s past sell-offs have become part of crypto’s folklore, with some noting that these actions have often preceded notable price pullbacks. There have been exceptions, of course. In November of last year, the Ethereum Foundation initiated another selling spree, but the asset’s price continued its uptrend and topped $4,000 in December.

2025-07-11T10:30:16,"Cardano Ramps Up LATAM Expansion Through New IOG–TxPipe Deal","Input Output Global (IOG), the research-engineering company behind Cardano, has signed a strategic partnership with Buenos Aires-based software house TxPipe to “attract, train, and support the next generation of blockchain developers” in Argentina and across Latin America, according to a 10 July press release . The agreement places TxPipe in charge of recurring hackathons, workshops, and meet-ups at IOG’s recently opened Buenos Aires office, using the company’s TX3 developer toolkit to onboard engineers to the Cardano ecosystem. IOG will provide the venue, logistical backing, and promotional reach, while both firms commit to co-hosting community events that also spotlight Midnight, IOG’s privacy-focused protocol. Cardano Makes Its Move In Latin America Charles Hoskinson, IOG’s chief executive, framed the collaboration as an investment in local talent: “We are thrilled to partner with TxPipe. Their team represents the best of what Argentina’s developer community has to offer, and together we are building a foundation for long-term ecosystem growth. Our collaboration also fulfills the broader vision of making IO Buenos Aires a crypto hub.” Santiago Carmuega, TxPipe’s co-founder, echoed the sentiment: “This partnership shows what’s possible when mission-aligned teams come together. We’re excited to help shape the future of crypto in Latin America.” The cadence of activity is set at one event every four to six weeks, with TxPipe supplying instructors and curriculum while IOG supplies space and operational support. Both companies argue that Argentina’s combination of skilled developers, culture of digital experimentation, and high cryptocurrency adoption—fueled in part by persistent inflation—makes the country a natural hub for Cardano-centred innovation. “Argentina stands out as a strategic choice for long-term Web3 investment and ecosystem growth. With a highly skilled developer base, a strong culture of digital experimentation, and ongoing economic challenges, the country presents ideal conditions for the advancement of IO’s decentralized technologies. It also ranks among the world’s leaders in cryptocurrency adoption, as citizens and residents increasingly turn to digital assets for everyday transactions and to navigate inflation,” the press release states. The partnership follows IOG’s formal inauguration of its Buenos Aires office on 21 May 2025. Notably, IOG has been nurturing technical talent in the country for some time. In September 2024 the company’s education team delivered a two-week Cardano developer course at the National Technological University (UTN) in Buenos Aires, describing it as a “momentous” hands-on programme that deepened ties with the local community. The project has also gained visibility at the highest political levels. Last September Hoskinson met with President Javier Milei during Tech Forum Argentina to discuss blockchain’s role in economic reform. With the TxPipe partnership now operational, IOG is amplifying a strategy that combines bricks-and-mortar presence, formal education, and community-driven events to entrench Cardano’s developer base in Latin America , beginning with Argentina.

It rose more than 4% to around $113,700, before easing back. A key long-term factor behind this is the Trump Administration’s friendlier regulatory approach to Bitcoin and other cryptos. That’s driving an increasing amount of institutional, corporate, and “mainstream money” into the asset class. The result is a flood of money heading into alternative stores of value of all types. That includes gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies. By Mike Larson Stocks? They recently hit all-time highs. Gold? It recently hit all-time highs (so did copper). Now, it’s Bitcoin’s turn! The benchmark cryptocurrency just blew through its old high yesterday. It rose more than 4% to around $113,700, before easing back, as you can see in the MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Bitcoin (YTD Chart) What “caused” the breakout? Nothing specific to the day itself. But a key long-term factor is the Trump Administration’s friendlier regulatory approach to Bitcoin and other cryptos. That’s driving an increasing amount of institutional, corporate, and “mainstream money” into the asset class. Other drivers include: The falling US dollar. It just suffered its worst first-half decline since 1973. Trump’s trade and tariff policies. They’re upending decades-long economic and financial market relationships. US moves to seize foreign assets, particularly Russian assets after the Ukraine invasion, are leading unfriendly and other wary nations to steer money away from US markets. Increasing bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. As of yesterday, rate futures markets were pricing in a 67% chance the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point at its September policy meeting. Four more cuts could follow over the next year. The result is a flood of money heading into alternative stores of value of all types. That includes gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies. My advice? Don’t fight the powerful flood of money into alternatives. Embrace it.

2025-07-11T10:22:40,"Bitcoin Expert Confirms XRP Forces Its Way into the BTC Conversations as Demand for XRP Is Real","Tim Kotzman, host of The Bitcoin Treasuries Podcast, recently shared an unexpected observation that the media won’t stop asking about XRP. This came during a recent interview with Ben Werkman, CIO at Swan Bitcoin. Despite his Bitcoin-first stance, Kotzman noted that conversations with journalists and financial media consistently veer toward the XRP token. ""On the media side, it has to be controversial. They’re always interrupting, they're always asking about XRP,"" Kotzman said.This recurring media interest suggests that XRP is a digital asset commanding growing attention across financial sectors.Mainstream Media Shifting Focus Toward XRPWhile Bitcoin often dominates headlines, XRP continues to make its way into the spotlight. Media outlets, even when hosting staunch Bitcoin supporters, are increasingly seeing mentions of XRP cropping up. Its role in global finance raises questions, prompts opinions, and sparks discussions about its long-term potential.For instance, media personality and DDTG Global founder Dave Portnoy shared at CoinDesk’s 2025 Consensus conference his bullish stance on XRP. He compared its potential to Bitcoin’s early days and remarked that he sees XRP potentially becoming the next Bitcoin. Hence, he maintains exposure to XRP alongside his Bitcoin portfolio and others.Separately, Bitcoin advocate Ian Carroll, host of The Carroll Show, shared at the Bitcoin 2025 conference that he’s learning about XRP. He admitted he hasn’t done deep research on XRP’s use cases or technology, but he’s gradually gaining knowledge about XRP.On FOX Business News months ago, portfolio manager Adam Johnson discussed how using cryptocurrency as a bridge currency could cut capital requirements for cross-border transfers in half, highlighting XRP’s potential role. Johnson noted the financial industry hasn’t fully embraced this yet but expects adoption soon. The XRP community, including expert Linda Jones, reacted enthusiastically, celebrating the recognition.Essentially, these remarks confirm that media interactions frequently turn to XRP, despite their Bitcoin-centered focus. This trend reflects a broader curiosity from traditional finance players and journalists, many of whom are now taking XRP more seriously.Beyond Media BuzzMeanwhile, beyond media buzz, XRP is seeing real interest from Wall Street. Trillion-dollar asset manager Franklin Templeton plans to offer shares of XRP spot ETFs by the end of this year, pending approval from the SEC. Multi-billion-dollar asset managers like Grayscale and Bitwise are pursuing similar initiatives. At the same time, multiple ETFs for XRP futures are live, with more set to launch this month.Teucrium CEO Sal Gilbertie explained in a Bloomberg interview that the company launched a 2X Leveraged XRP ETF due to a strong belief in XRP’s real-world utility and solid development team. Teucrium has filed for an inverse product, signaling continued confidence in XRP’s growth potential. According to the CEO, the company does not launch funds unless it truly believes in the asset and just needs to expand.Aside from the ETF front, XRP is also seeing surging demand from firms seeking to hold the coin on their balance sheets. At least eight firms have announced plans for such acquisitions, disclosing purchases up to $1 billion to fund XRP treasuries. These moves confirm increased interest and demand for XRP.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/11/bitcoin-expert-confirms-xrp-forces-its-way-into-the-btc-conversations-as-demand-for-xrp-is-real/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-expert-confirms-xrp-forces-its-way-into-the-btc-conversations-as-demand-for-xrp-is-real,"XRP|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|RESEARCH","Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today",cryptocompare

Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin’s Resilience: Exploring Its Potential in Today’s Market Bitcoin is the first and most famous cryptocurrency. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a way to send money without banks. Instead of physical coins, it uses a network of computers worldwide. These computers keep a shared record of all transactions, called a distributed ledger. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve puzzles and earn bitcoins. This system aims to be secure and prevent fraud. Every four years, the reward for miners is cut in half, known as “halving.” This limits the total number of bitcoins to 21 million. Bitcoin’s technology could change how we handle money. By cutting out banks, it provides a decentralized way to transfer value. Today, Bitcoin remains a leader among cryptocurrencies. Its limited supply and halving events can boost demand. Compared to other coins, it has the biggest network and acceptance. Market trends show Bitcoin often sets the pace in crypto. While prices can swing, many view it as digital gold. In the current market cycle, its strength and position make it worth watching. Ethereum’s Next Big Move: Is It the Crypto to Watch Right Now? Ethereum has been shaking up the crypto world since 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a bustling ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). It’s known for innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon, which make transactions faster and cheaper. In 2022, Ethereum made a big shift to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, making it more energy-efficient. The upcoming sharding phase aims to boost its speed and lower costs even more. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers it all, used for transactions, rewarding those who stake their coins, and as a valuable asset in its own right. Looking at market trends, Ethereum’s future seems promising. Predictions suggest its price could soar as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, even the estimated low is $2,700.31, showing solid potential. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum stands out for its strong technology and constant improvements. With the Bitcoin halving cycles in mind, the crypto market might be gearing up for significant growth. Ethereum’s advancements and commitment to efficiency make it an attractive option in today’s market. Its focus on making things faster and cheaper could keep it at the forefront of the crypto scene. Solana’s SOL Coin: Speeding Ahead in the Crypto Race Solana is a rising star in the world of blockchain platforms. It focuses on scalability, offering a base for decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana sets itself apart with its speedy transactions and flexible development options. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana’s native cryptocurrency. SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of Solana lies in its high-capacity network that doesn’t rely on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it appealing for developers looking to build high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL looks attractive due to its technological advantages and growing adoption. While Ethereum struggles with high fees and slower speeds, Solana offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative. As more projects and investors turn to Solana, SOL could continue to gain value, making it a coin to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion Although BTC, ETH, and SOL are performing well, XYZVerse’s pioneering memecoin unites sports fans across disciplines, aiming for 20,000% growth in the current bull market.

2025-07-11T10:22:06,"Arthur Hayes signals start of ‘monster alt season’ as markets flip bullish","Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes was bearish on BTC, but with the ongoing market rally, his tune is changing. In a July 11 X post, Hayes called Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) breakout to new all-time highs a key turning point. The former BitMEX CEO had recently warned that the U.S. Treasury’s efforts to rebuild its cash balance at the Fed, known as the TGA refill, could pressure risk assets by draining liquidity from the market, dampening short-term sentiment. However, the crypto market’s sharp move higher this week appears to have invalidated those fears. “I was slightly bearish in my last essay due to TGA refill. What changed? $BTC busted through ATH on good volume,” he wrote. I was slightly bearish in my last essay due to TGA refill. What changed? $BTC busted through ATH on good volume $ETH is following and will outperform, get ready for a monster alt szn. Mrkt thinks Trump will TACO on tariffs, so fuck it: @MaelstromFund is backing up the truck! — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 11, 2025 While BTC led the breakout, Hayes expects Ethereum ( ETH ) to take the lead from here, aligning with the asset’s steady climb over the past few days. Historically, such momentum often precedes capital rotation into altcoins, prompting the former executive to add that the long-awaited altcoin season is near. “Get ready for a monster alt szn,” Hayes said. Another factor driving his outlook is improving macro sentiment. He noted that markets expect President Trump to ease tariffs, which could support global trade and boost overall market performance. The former BitMEX CEO previously said in May that BTC must cross the $110,000 mark for the altcoin season to truly kick off, and predicted the breakout to occur around June or early Q3. With that breakout now confirmed, he believes the next phase of the cycle is underway. You might also like: Bitcoin ETF inflows hit billions as BTC smashes new all-time highs Long-term, Hayes has always been bullish on Bitcoin’s future. He expects BTC to reach around $250,000 by the end of the year and sees a possible path to $1 million by the end of Trump’s current term in 2028. Hayes’ altseason forecast is already playing out, with momentum building across the market. Several assets such as SEI ( SEI ), SUI ( SUI ), and HBAR ( HBAR ) have jumped between 10% and 20% over the past 24 hours, with more than 98% of altcoins already outperforming Bitcoin in the ongoing rally. While the Altcoin Season Index from CMC still leans toward Bitcoin dominance, sitting at 30/100, some analysts say the tide is already turning and that a much bigger season for the asset class is already underway. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to shatter records throughout the day, trading at an all-time high of over $118,500 at the time of writing.

2025-07-11T10:21:20,"Ethena jumps 25% on Upbit listing announcement, eyes a move towards $0.46","Ethena price jumped 25% on the Upbit listing announcement, edging closer to the top of its trading range and targeting a potential breakout above $0.46. Ethena ( ENA ) price is up 25% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.37, with trading volume surging over 300%. With this surge, ENA price has now broken above the upper trendline resistance of a descending triangle pattern that had been forming since mid-May. The descending triangle, typically a bearish continuation pattern, has instead resolved to the upside — a bullish signal made more convincing by explosive volume that accompanied the breakout. The breakout followed a rebound from what appears to be the bottom of a months-long consolidation range between $0.24 and $0.46. If ENA can successfully reclaim and hold the ~$0.30 zone on a retest of the breakout level, it could lay the foundation for further upside towards the top of that range. Source: TradingView You might also like: Ethena stalls below key level as 40M ENA token unlock approaches The current rally appears to be driven by today’s listing on South Korea’s largest exchange by trading volume, Upbit, which added Ethena trading pairs for KRW, Bitcoin ( BTC ), and Tether ( USDT ). This follows Upbit’s recent listing of Hyperlane ( HYPER ), which has seen a 100%+ surge in a single day after the listing, and Babylon (BABY) tokens. ENA’s price rally is also likely buyoed by the broader crypto market surge, with Bitcoin breaking above $118,000 and setting a new all-time high . Ethena’s ability to hold the lower horizontal support since early April is notable, especially amid regular token unlocks . The latest unlock released over 171 million ENA tokens worth over $63 million, representing 2.7% of circulating supply. Prior to that, in June, Ethena had a massive cliff unlock of 212.5 million tokens, representing 3.72% of its unlockable supply. However, the relatively horizontal support at ~$0.24 still didn’t budge. Looking ahead, traders should watch for ENA’s ability to maintain support around $0.30 on retest of the breakout level, as holding this level could confirm momentum for a sustained move toward the $0.46 resistance and beyond.

2025-07-11T10:20:20,"Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 30: Is Bitcoin Dominance the New Reality for Crypto?","The cryptocurrency world is constantly shifting, and understanding these shifts is crucial for any investor. Currently, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at a critical juncture, signaling a period where Bitcoin’s performance is outshining the rest of the digital asset landscape. What does an index reading of 30 truly mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate the evolving crypto market ? What is the Altcoin Season Index and How Does It Define Seasons? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), is a widely referenced metric that helps investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and performance dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. As of July 11, 00:30 UTC, the index registered 30, a slight increase from the previous day but still firmly within the realm of what’s known as Bitcoin Season . This index is designed to provide a clear snapshot of market dominance. Here’s how it works: Scope: It evaluates the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. This focus ensures a clear picture of speculative asset performance. Altcoin Season Threshold: For the market to officially enter Altcoin Season , a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This signifies broad-based strength across the altcoin sector. Bitcoin Season Threshold: Conversely, when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in Bitcoin Season . This indicates that capital is consolidating around Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is acting as a safe haven or primary driver of market movements. Index Range: The index itself scores from 1 to 100, providing a granular view of where the market stands on the spectrum between full Bitcoin dominance and rampant altcoin outperformance. Understanding these thresholds is vital. An index of 30, as we see now, clearly points to Bitcoin’s current ascendancy, suggesting that most altcoins are struggling to keep pace with the king cryptocurrency. Decoding Bitcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market When the Altcoin Season Index dips to levels like 30, it unequivocally signals a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly drives this phenomenon, and what are its implications for the broader crypto market ? Bitcoin Season often emerges during periods of market uncertainty or when institutional capital flows primarily into Bitcoin. Several factors contribute to this dominance: Flight to Safety: In volatile or uncertain macroeconomic environments, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset within the crypto space compared to the more speculative altcoins. Its larger market cap, longer track record, and perceived store-of-value narrative make it a preferred choice. Institutional Interest: Major institutional players and corporations often gain exposure to the crypto space primarily through Bitcoin due to its liquidity and established regulatory pathways (e.g., Bitcoin ETFs). This concentrated demand can pull capital away from altcoins. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s programmatic supply reductions (halvings) historically precede significant price appreciation, leading to increased focus and investment in BTC. The anticipation and realization of these events can trigger a Bitcoin-centric rally. Reduced Risk Appetite: When overall market sentiment is cautious, investors tend to reduce exposure to higher-risk assets like many altcoins, opting for Bitcoin’s relative stability. During a Bitcoin Season , you’ll typically observe Bitcoin’s price holding strong or appreciating, while many altcoins either stagnate or decline against BTC. This doesn’t mean altcoins can’t have individual rallies, but broadly, they struggle to outperform Bitcoin’s percentage gains over a sustained period. Historical Perspective: We’ve seen periods of strong Bitcoin dominance following major market corrections or during accumulation phases prior to significant bull runs. These periods are crucial for Bitcoin to consolidate its position and attract new capital before it potentially spills over into the altcoin market. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Spotting Emerging Cryptocurrency Trends The burning question on many investors’ minds is: When will the pendulum swing back towards Altcoin Season ? While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin dominance, understanding the triggers for a shift is key to identifying emerging cryptocurrency trends . What Triggers Altcoin Season? Altcoin Season typically doesn’t just happen overnight. It’s often the result of a confluence of factors: Bitcoin Stability or Sideways Movement: A common precursor is when Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or enters a consolidation phase after a significant rally. This allows capital that flowed into BTC to look for higher returns in altcoins. Capital Rotation: As Bitcoin’s gains slow, investors often rotate profits from BTC into altcoins, seeking higher percentage returns. This “risk-on” appetite fuels altcoin rallies. New Narratives and Technological Breakthroughs: The emergence of compelling new blockchain technologies, DeFi innovations, NFTs, GameFi, or other strong narratives can draw significant attention and capital into specific altcoin sectors, sparking broader interest. Increased Retail Participation: Altcoin seasons are often characterized by heightened retail investor interest and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), as smaller, lesser-known coins show parabolic gains. Improved Macroeconomic Conditions: A generally positive global economic outlook can increase investor confidence across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, leading to greater risk-taking. Benefits of Altcoin Season: Explosive Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can offer significantly higher percentage returns than Bitcoin during these periods. Diversification: A healthy altcoin market allows investors to diversify their portfolios beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Innovation Showcase: Altcoin season often highlights the innovative spirit of the crypto space, bringing attention to new projects and technologies. Challenges and Risks: Extreme Volatility: While offering high rewards, altcoins are notoriously volatile, with prices capable of crashing just as quickly as they rise. Increased Scam Risk: Periods of heightened speculation also attract bad actors, leading to more rug pulls, pump-and-dump schemes, and fraudulent projects. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins can suffer from low liquidity, making it difficult to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. Spotting these emerging cryptocurrency trends requires diligent research, staying updated on project developments, and understanding market sentiment beyond just price charts. Navigating the Current Crypto Market: Strategies for Bitcoin Season Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 30, we are clearly in a period where Bitcoin Season reigns supreme. How can investors best position themselves and manage their portfolios during this phase of the crypto market ? Strategies for a Bitcoin-Dominant Market: During Bitcoin Season , a focus on accumulation and risk management is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, a Bitcoin Season presents an opportunity to accumulate more BTC, especially if altcoins are underperforming. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be an effective strategy here. Research and Identify Future Altcoin Gems: Use this period of relative altcoin quietness to conduct thorough research. Look for projects with strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and solid communities. These could be the outperformers when Altcoin Season eventually returns. Stablecoin Parking: For those who prefer to wait out volatility or are unsure about current market direction, parking funds in stablecoins can preserve capital until clearer opportunities arise. Risk Management and Portfolio Rebalancing: Review your portfolio’s exposure to altcoins. If you’ve been heavily invested in altcoins that are now underperforming, consider rebalancing to reduce risk. This might involve selling some altcoins for BTC or stablecoins. Focus on Education: Use this time to deepen your understanding of blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other emerging sectors. Knowledge is power, especially in a rapidly evolving market. Preparing for the Next Altcoin Season: While we are in Bitcoin Season , smart investors are always looking ahead. When the signs of an impending Altcoin Season begin to appear (e.g., Bitcoin dominance falling, strong performance from a broad range of altcoins against BTC), you might consider: Strategic Altcoin Allocation: Gradually reallocate a portion of your portfolio into carefully researched altcoins. Profit-Taking Strategies: Have a plan for taking profits as altcoins rise, especially given their volatility. Staying Agile: The crypto market moves fast. Be prepared to adapt your strategies as new cryptocurrency trends emerge. The key is not to be caught off guard. Understanding the current market phase allows for proactive, rather than reactive, decision-making. Is the Altcoin Season Index a Crystal Ball for Cryptocurrency Trends? The Altcoin Season Index offers a valuable snapshot of the crypto market , but is it a definitive predictor of future cryptocurrency trends ? While highly useful, it’s important to understand its limitations. Strengths of the Index: Simplicity and Clarity: It provides a straightforward, easy-to-understand metric for the overall health of the altcoin market relative to Bitcoin. Data-Driven: Based on verifiable price data from CoinMarketCap, it offers an objective assessment. Widely Recognized: Its prominence makes it a common language for discussing market cycles among crypto enthusiasts and analysts. Limitations and Nuances: Backward-Looking: The 90-day lookback period means the index reflects past performance, not necessarily immediate future movements. It confirms a trend rather than predicting its inception. Top 100 Bias: While covering a significant portion of the market, it doesn’t account for the performance of smaller, micro-cap altcoins, which can sometimes lead rallies. Market Cap Differences: A 10% gain for a large-cap altcoin is very different from a 10% gain for a micro-cap, yet the index treats them equally in terms of “outperformance.” Not a Guarantee: The index is an indicator, not a guarantee. Even in Bitcoin Season, individual altcoins can perform well due to specific news or developments. Conversely, a high index doesn’t mean every altcoin will pump. Excludes Stablecoins: While logical for measuring speculative performance, it means the index doesn’t capture the significant role stablecoins play in capital flows and market sentiment. Therefore, while the Altcoin Season Index is an excellent tool for understanding the current market phase, it should be used in conjunction with other technical analysis, fundamental research, and broader macroeconomic indicators to form a comprehensive view of cryptocurrency trends . It helps answer “where are we now?” more than “where are we going next?” Conclusion The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 30 clearly places the crypto market in a dominant Bitcoin Season . This period, characterized by Bitcoin’s outperformance, presents unique opportunities and challenges for investors. While altcoins may be taking a backseat, this is a crucial time for strategic accumulation, diligent research into future projects, and robust risk management. Understanding these cyclical shifts – from Bitcoin Season to Altcoin Season and back – is fundamental to navigating the volatile world of digital assets. By staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index and other key cryptocurrency trends , investors can make more informed decisions, position their portfolios effectively, and potentially capitalize on the next major market move.

2025-07-11T10:19:18,"Bloomberg Terminal Switches Bitcoin Price Scale to Show BTC in Millions, Is Something Brewing?","Discussions around Bitcoin reaching million-dollar valuations are becoming more predominant, and even the Bloomberg Terminal is redressing its price scale to align with this. For context, Bloomberg Terminal is an institution-grade system that provides real-time financial data and analytical tools for professional market users. Interestingly, the industry-standard financial tool appears to be super bullish on Bitcoin’s price, as seen in its recent price scaling.Jacquelyn Melinek, the founder of Token Relations, highlighted that the Bloomberg Terminal now scales Bitcoin’s price in millions. To some, this may mean nothing, but to so many others like her, its meaning goes beyond just a scaling switch.Bitcoin to Millions?Notably, Bitcoin broke a new all-time high of $118,404 today, hitting new highs for the third consecutive day now. On other platforms like TradingView, it trades at $118,090 at the time of writing. But on the Bloomberg Terminal, Bitcoin’s spot price (XBT) is trading at $0.118M. Bitcoin Price | Bloomberg Terminal This does not go without notice, as it brings the vibes of a million-dollar valuation for Bitcoin to life. Furthermore, it not only highlights a tone switch from skepticism to belief but also brings to the notice of institutions using the platform that Bitcoin could attain the price level in the future.Notably, this scale switch has excited the cryptocurrency community. “Bloomberg knows precisely what’s coming sooner,” a user stated. Others also shared that it is a sign, and the million-dollar valuation is inevitable.This bullish perspective also aligns with the perspective of industry leaders, who have reacted to Bitcoin's persistent price upsurge. For context, Binance’s Changpeng Zhao called the current price a dip, suggesting that prices have further unprecedented prices to conquer.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1943569289308459283He noted that mathematical numbers have no limit, and governments would continue to print fiat. On the other hand, Bitcoin has a limited cap, a premise for more upside.Timeline for Bitcoin to Reach $1MBitcoin to $1 million is a common price expectation among most market users. Analysts and enthusiasts have drummed this target so much that it no longer rings a bell. Nonetheless, the 746% price mark from the current standing will be a notable milestone for the pioneering cryptocurrency, once perceived as a bubble.Top market participants have predicted the timeline for Bitcoin to reach $1 million. For instance, Zhao projected that BTC will attain the price mark this cycle. He noted that an extended bull cycle would ensure Bitcoin hits between $500,000 and $1 million.Brandon Green also shares a similar sentiment, suggesting the bull cycle would extend to 2026 or 2027. During this market phase, he predicted that Bitcoin would reach $1 million, specifically in late 2026 or early 2027.Meanwhile, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million by 2030 . In view of this price explosion, he had incessantly advocated exposure to Bitcoin.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/11/bloomberg-terminal-switches-bitcoin-price-scale-to-show-btc-in-millions-is-something-brewing/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bloomberg-terminal-switches-bitcoin-price-scale-to-show-btc-in-millions-is-something-brewing,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BNB","Market|Bitcoin Price Prediction|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T10:16:13,"Cardano price prediction: How high can ADA get this month?","Cardano price staged a strong rally on Friday, reaching its highest level since June 11. It has jumped in the last four consecutive days, mirroring the performance of the broader crypto market. This article explores what to expect in the coming weeks. Cardano price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the ADA price bottomed at $0.5085 and then bounced back. Its lowest level this week coincided with the lowest point in April this year, meaning that it has formed a double-bottom pattern. A double bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. It has now moved above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). More technical indicators point to more gains in the coming weeks. For example, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has continued rising as it remains above 20. The token has moved above the Ichimoku cloud and the Supertrend. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for Cardano is bullish, with the next point to watch being at $0.8360, the neckline of the double-bottom pattern. A move above that resistance level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $1. A move below the support level at $0.60 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Cardano price chart | Source: TradingView Why ADA price is surging There are a few reasons why Cardano price is in a strong bull run. First, the rally has coincided with the ongoing Bitcoin price surge . Bitcoin soared to $118,000 for the first ever, and analysts expect the trend to continue. Bitcoin has soared because of the rising demand from American investors, who have piled into their ETFs. Cumulative ETF inflows soared to a record high of over $50 billion, with the IBIT ETF’s assets jumping to over $80 billion. This trend means that this fund will soon surpass the 20-year-old GLD ETF . Cardano price has also jumped as data points to a rebound of some of its assets. For example, Snek, the biggest meme coin in the ecosystem has continued soaring this week, with its market capitalization jumping to over $200 million. More data shows that the decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in Cardano has jumped to the highest point in over a week. Still, Cardano’s ecosystem is significantly smaller than other blockchains. Further, there are signs that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the spot ADA ETFs later this year. Such a move will lead to more inflows in the coming months. For example, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs inflows have jumped sharply in the past few months. Cardano’s futures open interest has continued rising, a sign of rising demand among investors. Meanwhile, Cardano is preparing the upcoming Glacier airdrop, where its holders will receive NIGHT tokens.

2025-07-11T10:03:14,"Australia’s Tasmania Joins Nationwide Crackdown on Crypto ATMs as Scam Losses Hit $1.6 Million","Tasmania has become the latest Australian state to intensify efforts against crypto ATM scams after police revealed that the top 15 crypto ATM users in the region lost a combined AUD 2.5 million (around USD 1.6 million) to fraudsters. Key Takeaways: Tasmania cracks down on crypto ATM scams after top users lost AUD 2.5 million to fraudsters. Scammers pressure victims to use crypto ATMs once banks flag suspicious transactions. Australia’s crypto ATM network has surged to nearly 1,900 machines, making it the third-largest globally. Nearly a quarter of that amount, approximately AUD 592,000, was deposited directly into cryptocurrency ATMs, according to Tasmania Police Cyber Investigations . The move follows a national enforcement initiative led by the Australian Federal Police and the financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC, aimed at curbing criminal exploitation of crypto ATMs across the country. Scammers Push Victims to Use Crypto ATMs in Tasmania Detectives report that scammers often pressure victims into using crypto ATMs after traditional financial institutions flag suspicious transactions. “Victims are being manipulated, intimidated, and pressured into investing in fake investment and romance scams,” said Detective Sergeant Paul Turner. He warned that many of these scams involve large sums and can have devastating long-term effects on victims, including financial ruin and dependence on government support. “If you are asked to deposit cash into a cryptocurrency ATM by someone you’ve never met in person, or the offer comes with a high-pressure deadline or urgent tone, then it is likely a scam,” Turner said. AUSTRAC has recently introduced new rules and transaction limits for crypto ATM operators, effective June 3, to better fight scams. Crypto also remains a top priority for the agency heading into 2025. Tasmania’s crypto ATM network has grown rapidly, from just one machine in 2021 to over 20 today. Coin ATM Radar data confirms 24 machines in the state. Where in the world is #Bitcoin most accessible? Here are the top countries with the most Bitcoin ATMs: USA – 30,780 Canada – 3,062 Australia – 1,389 Spain – 276 Poland – 219 Slovenia – 80 #Crypto adoption is on the rise! pic.twitter.com/sleyKOqkc5 — Biconomy.com (@BiconomyCom) June 16, 2025 Nationwide, Australia ranks third globally for Bitcoin and crypto ATMs, trailing only the US and Canada, with nearly 1,900 units, up sharply from 67 a year ago. Major operators include Localcoin, Coinflip, and Bitcoin Depot. More Countries Clamp Down on Crypto ATMs Internationally, authorities are also cracking down on crypto ATM misuse. Last week, New Zealand banned crypto ATMs and restricted international cash transfers to combat money laundering. In Australia, AUSTRAC recently introduced stricter rules for crypto ATM operators, including tighter cash limits and monitoring. Last month, the regulator refused to renew the registration of a local crypto ATM operator , Harro’s Empires. The agency placed operating conditions, including transaction limits, on them. In the US, Spokane, Washington, has banned crypto ATMs entirely , citing their use in scams targeting vulnerable residents. Lawmakers in the US Senate are also attempting to tighten laws on a state and local level, with one attempt led by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin. He has introduced the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act, which would bring in legislative measures designed to protect the public — while attempting to limit inconvenience for law-abiding users. New users would be prevented from spending more than $2,000 a day at one of these machines, rising to $10,000 in a 14-day period.
