2025-07-11T13:50:15,"Bitcoin Investment: Remixpoint’s Strategic Acquisition Amplifies BTC Holdings to 1,168.28","In the dynamic world of digital assets, corporate moves often signal broader market trends. A recent development that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community is the Japanese energy consulting firm Remixpoint’s latest foray into the Bitcoin market. This strategic acquisition is more than just a purchase; it underscores a growing confidence among traditional businesses in the long-term viability and value of digital assets. Remixpoint, already a notable player in the corporate crypto space, has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to its Bitcoin investment strategy, solidifying its position as a significant corporate holder of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Why is Remixpoint BTC Investment a Game Changer? Remixpoint’s decision to purchase an additional 116.72 BTC is not an isolated event but a continuation of a well-defined corporate strategy. This latest acquisition brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,168.28 BTC, as reported by Odaily. For a company primarily known for energy consulting, this substantial commitment to Bitcoin speaks volumes about their outlook on the future of finance and technology. What makes Remixpoint’s move particularly significant? Strategic Diversification: It highlights a trend where companies are looking beyond traditional assets for treasury management, seeking hedges against inflation and alternative growth opportunities. Early Adoption Credibility: Remixpoint was an early corporate adopter of Bitcoin, and their continued accumulation lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for institutional portfolios. Influence in Japan: As a Japanese firm, their actions can influence other businesses in a country known for its cautious yet progressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Long-Term Vision: Accumulating Bitcoin, especially during market fluctuations, suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition rather than short-term speculation. This ongoing accumulation by Remixpoint is a clear signal to the market that a well-researched and disciplined approach to Bitcoin can be integrated into a company’s financial framework. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Remixpoint is certainly not alone in its pursuit of Bitcoin. Over the past few years, a discernible trend has emerged: publicly traded companies, private enterprises, and even investment funds are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This phenomenon has transformed Bitcoin from a niche digital currency into a recognized corporate treasury asset. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) have pioneered this movement, each with their unique motivations: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often viewed as a scarce asset, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power. Growth Potential: Companies see the potential for significant appreciation, viewing Bitcoin as a high-growth asset that can enhance shareholder value over time. Technological Alignment: For tech-forward companies, holding Bitcoin aligns with their innovative ethos and positions them at the forefront of financial technology. Treasury Management: Diversifying cash reserves away from low-yield traditional instruments into a potentially higher-yielding, uncorrelated asset. While the motivations vary, the underlying theme is a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable component of a modern corporate treasury strategy. The transparency of these holdings, often disclosed in financial reports, adds a layer of institutional validation to the cryptocurrency market. Understanding Bitcoin Investment Strategies for Corporations For corporations considering a dive into Bitcoin, the strategy extends beyond a simple purchase. It involves a comprehensive understanding of the asset, its risks, and its potential rewards. Remixpoint’s consistent accumulation points to a disciplined approach that other firms can learn from. Key aspects of a corporate Bitcoin investment strategy include: Risk Assessment and Management: Bitcoin’s volatility is a primary concern. Companies must establish clear risk tolerance levels, potentially hedging strategies, and robust internal controls to manage exposure. Custody Solutions: Secure storage of Bitcoin is paramount. This often involves engaging institutional-grade custodians that offer cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and robust security protocols. Regulatory and Accounting Considerations: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape and understanding the accounting treatment of Bitcoin (e.g., as an intangible asset) are crucial. This requires expert legal and accounting advice. Board and Shareholder Approval: Such a significant strategic shift often requires buy-in from the board of directors and clear communication with shareholders about the rationale and benefits. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Objectives: Is the Bitcoin held as a long-term treasury asset, or is there a component for active trading? Remixpoint’s consistent additions suggest a long-term holding strategy. A well-thought-out strategy minimizes potential pitfalls and maximizes the benefits of integrating Bitcoin into a corporate balance sheet. It’s not just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about building a resilient and future-proof financial framework. What Does This Mean for Japanese Bitcoin Adoption ? Japan has a unique relationship with cryptocurrency. It was one of the first countries to recognize Bitcoin as legal property and has a well-developed regulatory framework. However, corporate adoption, especially among traditional firms, has been somewhat slower compared to other regions like North America. Remixpoint’s continued and significant Bitcoin investment sends a strong signal within Japan: Building Trust: A reputable energy consulting firm embracing Bitcoin can help build trust and familiarity among other Japanese businesses and the general public, potentially easing skepticism. Setting a Precedent: Remixpoint’s success and transparency with its Bitcoin holdings could encourage other Japanese companies to explore similar strategies, fostering broader corporate adoption. Regulatory Confidence: The fact that a Japanese company is making such large-scale investments within the existing regulatory framework might indirectly affirm the robustness of Japan’s crypto regulations. Innovation Hub: It reinforces Japan’s position as an innovation hub, willing to embrace new technologies and financial paradigms, even in traditional sectors. While one company’s actions don’t define an entire nation’s trajectory, Remixpoint’s consistent moves are undoubtedly a positive indicator for the future of Bitcoin and digital assets in Japan’s corporate landscape. The Future of Corporate BTC Investment Strategy The trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings is likely to continue evolving. As more companies become comfortable with the asset class, we might see increasingly sophisticated strategies emerge. These could include: Broader Asset Classes: Companies might expand beyond Bitcoin to include other major cryptocurrencies or even tokenized assets as part of their treasury. Integrated Crypto Operations: Beyond just holding, companies might start integrating crypto payments, blockchain-based supply chains, or even decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols into their core operations. Enhanced Reporting and Transparency: As regulations mature, there will likely be clearer guidelines for reporting and auditing crypto assets, leading to greater transparency. ESG Considerations: With growing concerns about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, companies might increasingly consider the environmental impact of their Bitcoin holdings, potentially favoring greener mining initiatives. Remixpoint’s proactive stance exemplifies a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance. Their ongoing commitment to Bitcoin is not just about accumulating an asset; it’s about positioning the company for a future where digital assets play a central role in the global economy. This strategic vision, coupled with disciplined execution, sets a compelling example for businesses worldwide contemplating their own journey into the crypto realm. A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future Remixpoint’s latest acquisition of 116.72 BTC, pushing their total holdings to over 1,168 BTC, is a significant event that resonates far beyond the confines of their balance sheet. It is a powerful testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic asset for corporate treasuries. This move by a Japanese energy consulting firm underscores the global nature of Bitcoin adoption and its increasing integration into traditional financial strategies. As more companies like Remixpoint embrace Bitcoin, the landscape of corporate finance is undeniably shifting, paving the way for a more digitally-native and decentralized economic future. Their consistent and expanding Bitcoin investment strategy serves as a beacon, highlighting the potential for long-term value creation and diversification in an ever-evolving market.

2025-07-11T13:30:04,"Bitcoin Rally: Unveiling the Next Explosive Phase","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! Bitcoin has once again defied expectations, smashing through previous all-time highs and sending ripples of excitement across the globe. But hold on a second – if you think this Bitcoin rally is just another fleeting speculative bubble, you might be missing the bigger picture. This isn’t your typical retail-driven frenzy; something fundamentally different is unfolding, suggesting that the most exciting chapters of this journey are still unwritten. Decoding the Current Bitcoin Rally: Why It’s Different In a recent and insightful update, crypto services provider Matrixport highlighted a crucial distinction about the current Bitcoin rally . Unlike the euphoric surges of 2017 or 2021, where leverage and rampant retail speculation often fueled parabolic climbs (and subsequent corrections), this ascent is remarkably grounded. We’re seeing: Minimal Leverage: The market isn’t overheated with excessive borrowed funds, which typically makes rallies fragile. Limited Retail Speculation: While retail interest is growing, it’s not the primary driver. This suggests a more organic, less volatile growth trajectory. Strong Spot ETF Inflows: A relentless stream of capital is pouring in from newly launched exchange-traded funds. Rising Institutional Demand: Major players, from hedge funds to asset managers, are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin. This unique confluence of factors paints a picture of a more mature, robust market. It’s not just about price action; it’s about a structural shift in how Bitcoin is perceived and adopted globally. The foundations for sustained growth appear stronger than ever, signaling that this Bitcoin rally has deeper roots and potentially much further to run. The Unstoppable Force: Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Perhaps the single most impactful catalyst for Bitcoin’s recent surge has been the monumental success of the Spot Bitcoin ETF s in the United States. Since their approval, these investment vehicles have become a magnet for capital, providing a regulated, accessible, and familiar gateway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Consider the sheer volume: major players like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have seen unprecedented inflows, quickly accumulating hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins. This isn’t just new money entering the ecosystem; it’s a fundamental re-allocation of capital from traditional finance into digital assets. The demand from these ETFs is so significant that it often outpaces the daily supply of newly mined Bitcoin, creating a supply-demand imbalance that naturally pushes prices higher. This sustained buying pressure from the Spot Bitcoin ETF s acts as a powerful tailwind, providing a consistent bid for Bitcoin that was largely absent in previous cycles. It’s a clear signal that Bitcoin is transitioning from a niche asset to a mainstream investment vehicle. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Demand: A Paradigm Shift? Beyond the direct impact of ETFs, the broader trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin demand is arguably the most significant long-term driver. For years, Bitcoin was primarily a retail phenomenon, dismissed by traditional finance as too volatile or speculative. That narrative has dramatically shifted. Today, major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are actively exploring or already holding Bitcoin as part of their diversified portfolios. Why this change? Institutions are recognizing Bitcoin’s unique properties: Digital Gold: A hedge against inflation and currency debasement, especially in an era of unprecedented global debt. Portfolio Diversification: Its low correlation with traditional assets makes it an attractive addition for risk management. Technological Innovation: A bet on the future of decentralized finance and digital economies. This surge in institutional Bitcoin demand is not merely about speculation; it’s about strategic long-term allocation. These are not weak hands looking for quick profits; they are sophisticated investors building positions with a multi-year horizon. This fundamental shift lends unprecedented legitimacy and stability to the market, laying the groundwork for a truly global, institutionalized asset class. Unveiling Unpriced Catalysts: What Drives Bitcoin Price Prediction? While the current drivers are strong, Matrixport’s report emphasizes that several significant bullish catalysts remain largely ‘unpriced’ by the market. This means their potential positive impact hasn’t been fully factored into the current Bitcoin price prediction , suggesting further upside as they gain traction. What are these hidden gems? Mounting Political Pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve: The political landscape often influences monetary policy. As economic pressures mount, there could be increased calls for the Federal Reserve to ease its stance, potentially through interest rate cuts or more accommodative policies. Such moves typically boost risk assets like Bitcoin, making it more attractive relative to traditional investments. The Potential Passage of the GENIUS Act: While specific details about a ‘GENIUS Act’ in relation to crypto aren’t widely publicized, in the context of bullish catalysts, it likely refers to hypothetical, forward-looking legislation that could be highly favorable to the crypto industry. This could involve clearer regulatory frameworks, tax incentives for digital asset adoption, or government support for blockchain innovation. Any significant positive legislative development would provide immense clarity and confidence, unlocking further institutional investment and adoption, thereby positively impacting the Bitcoin price prediction . Historically Strong July Seasonality: The crypto market, like traditional markets, sometimes exhibits seasonal patterns. Historically, July has shown a tendency for positive price action for Bitcoin. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, this historical trend adds another layer of potential tailwind, especially when combined with stronger fundamental drivers. These unpriced catalysts represent potential ‘surprise’ upsides that could propel Bitcoin into new territories, adding fuel to the ongoing rally and shaping future Bitcoin price prediction models. Navigating the Crypto Market Outlook: Are Traders Underexposed? Despite Bitcoin’s impressive breakout to new all-time highs, a fascinating aspect highlighted by Matrixport is that most traders remain underexposed. This means a significant portion of the market, including both institutional and retail participants, has not yet fully committed to the current uptrend. What does this imply for the overall crypto market outlook ? Room for Further Upside: If a large segment of traders is still on the sidelines, there’s a substantial pool of capital waiting to enter the market. As prices continue to rise and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) sets in, this sidelined capital could flood in, pushing Bitcoin even higher. Reduced Risk of Immediate Overheating: Unlike rallies driven by speculative frenzy, the current ‘underexposure’ suggests that the market isn’t yet in a state of irrational exuberance, providing a healthier environment for sustained growth. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio: Given this optimistic crypto market outlook , what should investors consider? Assess Your Exposure: Honestly evaluate if your current portfolio allocation aligns with your long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Are you truly prepared for potential further upside? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those looking to increase exposure, DCA remains a prudent strategy to mitigate volatility and build a position over time. Stay Informed on Catalysts: Keep a close eye on developments related to Fed policy, regulatory news, and market sentiment, as these could accelerate the ‘unpriced’ catalysts. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, always adhere to sound risk management principles. Only invest what you can afford to lose and understand the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the outlook for the Bitcoin rally appears robust, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential headwinds. Regulatory uncertainty, though improving, can still introduce volatility. Macroeconomic shifts, unexpected geopolitical events, or significant profit-taking by large holders could temporarily dampen enthusiasm. However, the underlying narrative of increasing institutional adoption and a more mature market structure suggests that any dips may be seen as buying opportunities rather than signs of a prolonged downturn. The fundamental drivers indicate a resilient path forward. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin The current Bitcoin rally is not just another surge; it’s a testament to the asset’s evolving maturity and growing acceptance in mainstream finance. Driven by unprecedented Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and burgeoning institutional Bitcoin demand, this rally stands on far more solid ground than its predecessors. With significant unpriced catalysts like shifting political pressures, potential legislative tailwinds, and historical seasonal trends still on the horizon, the stage is set for Bitcoin to continue its remarkable ascent. The market’s current underexposure only reinforces the potential for further upside, suggesting that the journey towards wider adoption and higher valuations is far from over. This is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, marking its undeniable transition into a truly global, institutional-grade asset.

Litecoin historic price sentiment Litecoin Price History: Source CoinStats Litecoin traded between $1 and $5 in its early years before surging to over $300 during the crypto bubble of late 2017 to early 2018. In 2021, Litecoin hit an all-time high of $412.96 early in the year but dropped significantly, closing at $144.56 by the end of the year. In 2022, Litecoin experienced significant losses, dropping below $45 mid-year. However, it managed to outperform the broader market despite a nearly 55% decline overall. 2023 saw high volatility for Litecoin, peaking at $114.50 in July but declining sharply due to market pressures, ending the year at $72.80 with a modest 7% rise despite underperforming the broader market. In 2024, Litecoin started the year around $68.20, climbed to $102.40 in April, and then fell below $80. After further declines in May and June, it dropped to $49 in August before rebounding to $70. By November, Litecoin surged past $100 and attempted to hold above $140 in December. In January 2025, the price of Litecoin surged to $140. However, the LTC price crashed in February as it dropped toward the low of $80. In March, the price of LTC consolidated below $90 after failing to break the $100 resistance. By the end of April, LTC price surged toward the $88 but struggled to maintain that level in early May.

2025-07-11T13:23:51,"Top Crypto That Will Pump Hard if Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Its ATH Soon","The post Top Crypto That Will Pump Hard if Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Its ATH Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If Bitcoin is about to explode past its all-time high, it won’t just be BTC making headlines, a select few altcoins are perfectly positioned to ride the wave. New DeFi coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the pack. This under-the-radar gem is gaining momentum fast, and investors are already calling it one of the top tokens to grab before July ends. The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 65% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12. million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,000 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. Mutuum Finance could 100x if Bitcoin breaks its ATH. BTC on the Brink: The Trigger for the Next Altcoin Surge? As of now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $108,723, just shy of its all-time high of $111,970 reached in May 2025. The price action has been consolidating beneath major resistance, with increasing volume suggesting a breakout could be imminent. A confirmed move above its ATH would not only validate bullish sentiment but also historically acts as a catalyst for altcoin rallies. During previous cycles, BTC breakouts have triggered sharp inflows into mid- and low-cap tokens as traders rotate profits down the chain. If Bitcoin flips this level into support, it could unlock a high-volatility environment, one where fast-moving projects like Mutuum Finance are poised to benefit from the spillover momentum. Mutuum Presale Powers Past $12M as Hype Accelerates The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13,000 investors and has raised more than $12 million. Investors have picked up more than 65% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. Innovating DeFi: How Mutuum Finance Is Reshaping Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like meme coins. If Bitcoin (BTC) breaks its all-time high of $111,970, the biggest winners may not be BTC holders, but early backers of fast-moving altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $12 million raised, more than 13,000 investors, and 65% of Phase 5 already sold out, Mutuum is quickly cementing itself as a top crypto contender for 2025. Investors buying in now at $0.03 are guaranteed a 100% ROI upon listing, with even Phase 6 offering a solid 16.67% gain over current prices. Built on a revolutionary dual lending model and backed by a $100K giveaway and leaderboard rewards system, Mutuum is more than hype, it’s real DeFi innovation.

2025-07-11T13:18:37,"Arthur Hayes Predicts Monster Altcoin Season as Bitcoin Hits New ATH","The post Arthur Hayes Predicts Monster Altcoin Season as Bitcoin Hits New ATH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes makes a bold prediction: a “monster altseason” is on the horizon. With Bitcoin soaring past $118,000 and Ethereum closing in on the $3,000 mark, Hayes believes a powerful rally across altcoins is imminent. Arthur Hayes Flips Bullish as Bitcoin Breaks Out Initially cautious due to the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) restocking plan, Hayes has now shifted his stance. In a recent post on X, he wrote , “BTC busted through ATH on good volume, ETH is following and will outperform — get ready for a monster alt szn.” Previously, he warned that the TGA’s $850 billion refill target could drain liquidity from the market. However, with Bitcoin breaking new highs and Ethereum gaining strength , Hayes now views this as a short-term hurdle. Ethereum to $10,000? Hayes Thinks It’s Possible Hayes believes Ethereum is poised to outperform, potentially reaching $10,000, driven by increasing corporate adoption and strong on-chain metrics. With ETH gaining institutional interest and showing signs of bullish divergence, the setup for an explosive rally looks more probable than ever. The Stablecoin Liquidity Bazooka In his blog post “ Quid Pro Stablecoin ,” Hayes argues that bank-issued stablecoins could unlock $6.8 trillion in liquidity, acting as a “liquidity bazooka” for the U.S. Treasury. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are expected to accelerate this stablecoin adoption. While the TGA refill may temporarily tighten liquidity, Hayes sees it as a blip in a larger bullish cycle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025) , Altcoin Season Coming Soon? Currently, the Altcoin Season Index is at 30/100 — far from confirming a full-blown altseason. Still, Hayes stands by his earlier May prediction that a summer rally would unfold. He sees growing momentum and believes the breakout in BTC and ETH will soon spread to major altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche. Adding fuel to the fire, Hayes mentioned the Maelstrom Fund is going all-in, citing the market’s anticipation of Donald Trump’s possible return and expected tariff policies, which could further boost market liquidity. Final Thoughts: A Game-Changing Moment for Crypto Arthur Hayes has a strong track record in market timing, and his confidence has caught the attention of investors across the crypto space. With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge, and new liquidity drivers emerging, this could be the beginning of a major altcoin run. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T13:14:53,"Taking Off: Why Aviator Is the Fastest-Rising Game in Online Casinos","Due to its rapid action and eye-catching design, the Aviator game is becoming increasingly popular with gamers. Players all over the globe are turning to the new brand of crash game, which mixes skill, timing and suspense with all the plays. Online trends for casinos go up and down, yet few have become hits like the Aviator. With a minimalist design and adrenaline-pumping format, it provides something beyond the norm compared to cards and slots. With players looking for fast, interactive wagering, the Aviator has filled a void that continues to grow through global platforms. You now see the online Aviator climbing through the rankings of favorite casino offerings, standing out in a crowded marketplace. Mechanics of the Crash At first, Aviator appears incredibly simple. A plane takes off the screen and a multiplier increases every second thereafter. As easy as that: cash out before the plane flies away. Hold back as long as possible; the higher the payout potential, the more you will lose the bet if the plane crashes before you cash out. This high-risk, high-reward aspect invokes instant decision-making and guarantees a sit-at-the-edge-of-your-seat gaming session. There are no payoff lines and spinning reels—merely a single increasing curve and a eureka moment set the winners apart from the spectators. The crash format, which we see in a few other games, lends itself perfectly to mobile play. It requires attention, yet doesn’t require a commitment of several hours. You can dip into the game for a couple of minutes on sites like aviator online and play several rounds, which makes it a convenient option depending on how you want to play. Why Simplicity Wins One reason why Aviator has been a success is because of how simple it is. Unlike fancy table games or multi-featured slots, aviator can easily be learned and played. You don’t have symbols to remember, hands to overcome and rules that need a strategy book. Intuitive: the game is easy to use—click to place your bet, click to cash out. This universality makes it accessible to players of all walks and skill levels. Whether you are a grizzled veteran of the casinos or a newcomer to the online bets scene, the intimidation element of the game vanishes when you play the Aviator. It boils down to the universal language of risk versus reward, all wrapped with a neat, modern design. Risk, Time and Adrenaline Aviator’s allure extends beyond visual or architectural—it is a psychological one. That risk vs. reward tension comes all at once and all the time. Each second the player hesitates to cash out is a likelihood of profit, but the ever-nearing risk of loss. This kind of play is based on what psychologists refer to as “intermittent reinforcement.” Like traditional gambling, not all spins reward, yet the chance that the next one does ensures players stay engaged. With short spin times and immediate, real-time resolution, the system could not be better optimized for thrill-seeking activity. Not only are players observing the multiplier rise, but they are also receiving a shot of dopamine with each decision point. That’s the ultimate self-control versus temptation exercise. Social Betting and Real-Time Thrills Unlike various solo-play slots, the Aviator adds a group dynamic to the game. Most game versions include a running chat window or leaderboard, which shows how the other players are betting and when they are cashing out. With the live aspect, players are part of a shared sense of fellowship—and occasionally, a rivalry. Seeing other players land giant wins or lose right as a significant multiplier occurs raises entertainment and psychological tension. That, too, encourages interactive gaming, as the players are free to adjust their strategy based on what the other players are doing. That’s what makes the game have a “live” quality, even though it is virtual. Flexible Payment Options Spurring Global Access One reason Aviator became universally accessible is the variety of payment systems that online casinos now offer. Consumers can now utilize old, familiar instruments like credit cards and debit cards and new online payment systems like e-wallets and online banks. That variety allows players from different countries to process transactions quickly and securely. Several casinos have been accepting cryptocurrency payments in addition to the standard payment method. Bitcoin, in particular, is becoming a more popular and secure option among tech-savvy users who want safe and anonymous transactions. Its rising popularity allows players greater freedom, specifically in areas where banking regulations may hamper common deposits—incorporating convenience, speed and security into current payment methods is a primary driver of the game’s expanding coverage to various player markets. What does the popularity of Aviator Mean for the Future of Online Gaming? Aviator’s explosive popularity indicates a broader shift in gamers’ preferences. Casual online casino gamers aren’t looking for over-the-top graphics or retro theming–they want interactivity, speed and true decision-making. Aviator achieves all three, delivering a tight, reactive gaming experience that rewards guts and gut instinct. This success may mark the beginning of a new trend in game design. Game developers might consider adding real-time multipliers, crash systems, or hybrid wager formats. We’re already starting to see initial manifestations of this through crypto casinos and wagering games with an esports twist. For online players yearning for a new and exciting adventure, the game isn’t a fad; it’s pointing the way ahead for the whole industry.

Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed brand and social media marketing solutions provider, announced that its Board of Directors has approved an expanded list of digital assets for its crypto treasury strategy. The company's board has expanded its previous strategy, which paved the way for holding up to 90% of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Accordingly, in addition to Bitcoin (BTC), the company will now be able to hold DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP, ETH and USD Coin (USDC) in its reserves. Thumzup also disclosed that President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., owns 350,000 shares in the company, worth approximately $4 million at current prices. Trump Jr.'s stake in Thumzup is the latest move by the Trump family to invest in companies pursuing cryptocurrency treasury strategies. Earlier in March, Eric Trump joined the advisory board of Metaplanet, a Japanese firm that has followed in the footsteps of MicroStrategy and allocated a large portion of its corporate reserves to Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T13:10:23,"Trader’s Analysis of Bitcoin, XRP, and Dogecoin: Price Predictions for 2025 and Top Presale to Buy","Over the past 24 hours or so, Bitcoin has had everyone on the edge of their seats, forcing even the skeptics to marvel at what’s shaping up to be the greatest asset (digital or otherwise) of the modern era. The ‘digital gold,’ once ridiculed by many and embraced by others, is now breaking all-time highs as we speak, currently trading just shy of the $120K mark , with $118,845 being its latest record. Naturally, with Bitcoin looking like a million bucks, fresh capital is and will be FOMO-ing into the market, buying even at all-time highs. While traditional investing wisdom warns against buying the top, in crypto, you just never know if there’s even a pullback. In this article, we’ll take a close look at Bitcoin’s future, the factors fueling its rise, and what major milestones it could conquer in the coming months. We’ll also analyze two other top mainstream cryptos – XRP and Dogecoin – to get a pulse on the broader crypto and meme coin sentiment, and explain why this may be the perfect time to keep an eye on Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , one of the top crypto presales right now. Why Is Bitcoin Up, and How Far Can It Go? Bitcoin began rallying on Wednesday, roughly thirty minutes after Donald Trump took to Truth Social, calling for a staggering 3% (or 300 basis points) rate cut by the Federal Reserve. Trump claimed such a rate cut would save the U.S. $360B annually in refinancing costs. It’s worth noting, though, that the Fed has never implemented a single rate cut exceeding 100 bps. Trump’s bold call for a 3% rate cut jolted markets with a fresh wave of risk-on energy, and Bitcoin was quick to react. In a powerhouse economy like the U.S., such an aggressive cut could destabilize the macro outlook: think inflation surging past 5%, the dollar dropping over 10%, and housing prices exploding thanks to cheaper mortgages. When traditional markets start to wobble, smart money often pivots to hard assets — and Bitcoin, the king of crypto, stands front and center as the go-to hedge. $BTC to Reach $125K in Q3, and $1M by 2030? Bitcoin is currently in what’s known as a price discovery phase, with no historical resistance levels left to conquer. It could, therefore, continue rallying so long as the momentum holds. While it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly where $BTC might top out in the short term, we can turn to the classic rectangle trading pattern for a potential projection. According to the trading playbook, when price breaks out of a rectangle pattern (the consolidation zone highlighted in blue above), the next move is often equal to the height (or breadth) of that range. If this setup plays out, we could see $BTC reach at least $125K in the current leg of the rally. Looking further ahead, given strong ETF inflows , a continually improving regulatory environment, and institutional players like Strategy and Metaplanet aggressively accumulating $BTC, many experts point to a conservative $500K target by 2030. Some analysts, however, are eyeing the magic $1M milestone. How’s $DOGE & $XRP Doing? Dogecoin has had the rub of the green recently, too, thanks to Elon Musk’s announcement of a new political party. One of the best meme coins of all time, $DOGE is up nearly 20% over the past seven days , with its 24-hour trading volume rising by 35%. From a technical analysis perspective, $DOGE is currently bouncing off the 200 exponential moving average From a technical standpoint, $DOGE is showing serious strength. It’s rebounding off the 200-week EMA — a historically reliable launchpad for major rallies. Even more compelling? The bounce is happening right at a long-term ascending trendline that previously ignited a massive 400% surge back in December 2024. If meme coin momentum keeps heating up, even a conservative breakout could send $DOGE soaring nearly 230% to around $0.48, potentially as soon as Q3 or Q4. Ripple’s XRP has also been painting the streets green lately, climbing over 17% in the past week . Most importantly, it has broken out of a descending trendline with solid volume and momentum. This encouraging setup positions it well for a move toward the next key resistance at $3.3991. If the breakout continues to hold, we could be in for a nearly 30% gain from current price levels. How Bitcoin Hyper Can Help You Ride Crypto’s Newfound Momentum? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a new cryptocurrency project that’s arguably the one best positioned to capitalize on Bitcoin’s renewed momentum. It’s not just another token with real utility – its utility is supercharging the OG Bitcoin blockchain with Solana-like performance and compatibility, including support for decentralized applications (dApps) and broader Web3 integration. At the core of $HYPER’s Bitcoin Layer 2 solution is a non-custodial, decentralized canonical bridge. As the name implies, it “bridges” Layer 1 and Layer 2, allowing users to seamlessly convert their native $BTC into Layer 2-compatible (or “wrapped”) $BTC. Another key component is Bitcoin Hyper’s integration of the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). This brings smart contract functionality and high-speed execution to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s worth noting that these features are typically absent in the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlocking Bitcoin’s Full Potential with $HYPER Putting it all together, you can use “wrapped” $BTC on Hyper’s Solana-like Layer 2 ecosystem to interact with dApps, including DeFi platforms and NFT marketplaces, trade and swap digital assets, participate in lending and borrowing protocols, and even engage with blockchain-based games and virtual environments. Most importantly, even though Bitcoin Hyper leverages Layer 2 scaling and Solana-level smart contract execution via the SVM, all transactions are ultimately settled on Bitcoin’s Layer 1. This ensures that while users benefit from faster speeds and dApp functionality, the Bitcoin blockchain’s underlying security remains intact. Join the Bitcoin Hyper Presale for Maximum Gains $HYPER is currently in presale, which means prices are among the lowest they’ll ever be. Each token is available at just $0.012225, and the project has already raised over $2.3M so far. Buying $HYPER now not only gives you the opportunity to earn generous staking rewards (currently yielding 349%), but also positions you for potentially massive gains on your investment. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction , the token could absolutely explode, riding Bitcoin’s momentum with a projected 1,500% surge, potentially reaching $0.20 by the end of the year. Check out our guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper for any help with the purchase process. Disclaimer : This article is not financial advice.

2025-07-11T13:08:03,"Here’s why Pi Network price is primed for a short squeeze","Pi Network price remained in a tight range this week, even as Bitcoin and other altcoins surged. Pi Coin ( PI ) was trading at $0.4900 on Friday, July 11, a few points above this week’s low of $0.4530. Still, there are several reasons why the coin is on the verge of a bullish breakout. First, data shows that the monthly token unlock will slow down over the next few months, reducing the number of coins brought to the market. Pi will unlock over 175 million coins this month, 137 million in August, 116 million in September, and 93 million in October. The token unlock pace will then rebound in November and December before falling for the next eight consecutive months. Second, Pi Coin price will likely benefit from the ongoing crypto bull run . Bitcoin ( BTC ) has already jumped to a record high as we had predicted here and here . This rally could continue as it targets the cup-and-handle target of nearly $150,000. A Bitcoin surge will likely lead to more gains among most altcoins. Third, Pi Network’s developers recently unveiled the Pi AI Studio that is helping developers build artificial intelligence-powered applications. Data shows that developers have already pitched thousands of applications. While not all will succeed, a few successful ones could help power its ecosystem. The new Pi App submissions for the AI App Studio have surpassed 12,000! Even if only half of these DApps become fully functional and approved, Pi Network could become the biggest project in crypto history due to: * The highest number of KYC-verified users * The largest… pic.twitter.com/58pvRzB7SE — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) July 9, 2025 Apps developed on the network will be supported by existing Pi Network products like Pi Ad Network, .pi Domains, and Pi Wallet. Those with substantial potential may also receive funding from the $100 million Pi Network Ventures. Most importantly, there is still a slim chance that Pi Network will be listed by major exchanges like Upbit, Binance, and Coinbase. Such a listing would likely trigger a major short squeeze. Pi Network price analysis Pi Coin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Pi Coin price has formed contrarian patterns that could stimulate a rebound. It has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.40 and a neckline at $1.6625. Pi Network has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal signal. In addition, its Bollinger Bands and Average True Range point to low volatility, which often leads to a short squeeze. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $1, followed by the neckline at $1.6625.",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/heres-why-pi-network-price-is-primed-for-a-short-squeeze/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE","Markets|Bitcoin|Pi Network|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T13:07:37,"Bitcoin Price Today Breaks All-Time High as Stock Market Soars – What’s Coming Next?","The post Bitcoin Price Today Breaks All-Time High as Stock Market Soars – What’s Coming Next? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has just smashed a new all-time high of $118,397.8, rising 6.5% in the last 24 hours, following the S&P 500’s record-setting rally. According to popular crypto analyst Kevin Svenson , this correlation signals the start of a potential parabolic rally for Bitcoin. S&P 500 Reaches Historic High of 6,333 Earlier this month, the S&P 500 index started at 6,187.28 and steadily climbed by 1.51%, eventually reaching a new record high of 6,333 points. Svenson highlights that Bitcoin often mirrors such movements in traditional markets. The recent S&P breakout could be the catalyst fueling Bitcoin’s ongoing surge . Bitcoin Price Breakout: $118K and Climbing Bitcoin began the month around $105,678.62, mostly trading between $105K–$109K until July 8, when strong buying pressure kicked in. Since then, Bitcoin has soared by 8.99%, reaching its latest peak of $118,397.8. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Top $1 Billion as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High , Kevin Svenson Predicts a Parabolic BTC Rally Svenson believes the current breakout is only the beginning.

As of July 11, 2025, the overall crypto market is showing strong positive momentum, with Bitcoin hovering around its new all-time highs. Major altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana are also seeing significant gains, indicating a broad bullish trend. Will Bitcoin price reach new highs? Yes, Bitcoin has already reached new all-time highs in July 2025, surging past $112,000 and even hitting $116,000. Analysts suggest continued upside potential, with some even forecasting $150,000 or more in the coming months if current momentum holds. How are altcoins performing during Bitcoin’s rally? Following Bitcoin’s strong moves, altcoins are also “waking up.” Ethereum crossed $2,900 (up 14% this week), XRP surged to $2.57 (up 13%), and Solana rose to $164 (up 8%).

2025-07-11T13:06:41,"No Major Gains for Pi Network (PI)? Analyst Reveals the Reason","TL;DR PI’s price increased by a mere 2.2% daily, possibly held back by low liquidity, concerns over centralization , and weak investor confidence. Over 215 million PI tokens are set to unlock soon, while exchange holdings have risen to 381.4 million, signaling potential selling ahead. PI Lags Behind The entire cryptocurrency market has been on fire over the past few days, with Bitcoin (BTC) tapping a new all-time high price of over $118,000. The altcoins performed quite well, too: Ethereum (ETH) spiked by 8% daily to surpass $3,000, Ripple (XRP) jumped by 9%, and Cardano (ADA) headed north by 16%. Pi Network (PI) has also posted some gains, albeit far insignificant compared to the majority of cryptocurrencies. Its valuation increased by 2.2% over the last 24 hours, and it currently trades at just below $0.50. Its market cap briefly exceeded $4 billion before retracing to the current $3.8 billion, making PI the 38th-largest digital asset. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko According to one popular X user, the native token of the controversial crypto project could follow BTC’s bullish momentum. However, they suggested that PI’s “missing decentralization, communication from the CT, and liquidity” would hamper the prospects of serious gains. “It won’t rise any significantly as it does not have enough liquidity and no decentralization. No one wants to put capital into an ecosystem where 1 couple controls everything,” the X user claimed . Despite a slight price uptick over the last 24 hours, PI is down 70% on a two-month scale. X user Zoe recently argued that the asset’s “main problem” lies in its massive supply and the constant release of new tokens. More than 215 million coins are set to unlock in the next month, with approximately 13.3 million PI scheduled on July 11 alone. This development allows investors to sell their holdings, potentially pushing the valuation even lower. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io Zoe thinks PI’s price may continue to “bleed slowly” as long as the team behind the project does not introduce a burning mechanism. Another Bearish Factor The rising number of PI coins stored on centralized crypto exchanges indicates a rising selling pressure and could contribute to a renewed downturn in the asset’s price. The total amount of coins on such platforms stood at 376 million as of July 10, but over the past 24 hours, there was an increase of approximately four million, bringing the figure to 381.4 million.

With fresh ETF inflows, technical breakouts, and expert bullish opinions, the top altcoin is now eyeing a major milestone of $4,000. Ethereum Price Action: Breaking Consolidation The Ethereum price has recently surpassed the June first week’s high of $2,870, currently trading at $2,986 with a market capitalization of $360.76 billion. The momentum in the second week has broken through a two-month consolidation range, resulting in a remarkable 43% rise over the past 20 days, with this week alone contributing over 19% to that gain. This surge follows Bitcoin’s impressive performance, as it recently reached a new all-time high of $118,340, generating significant excitement across the entire altcoin sector. As the top altcoin, Ethereum couldn’t afford to remain stagnant while Bitcoin electrifies the market. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have seen over $700 million in inflows during the second week of July. This level of momentum hasn’t been observed since December 2024, when Ethereum ETFs attracted over $830 million in the first week, according to Sosovalue. The optimism surrounding Ethereum isn’t solely driven by ETF activity and Bitcoin’s rise; a combination of factors, including substantial institutional investments, is also at play. Experts, including Limbo, suggest that with the range now broken and Ethereum trading above key levels, the long-awaited ETH season may finally came. Ted Pillows says- It Is Going For $4000 In a recent update, investor and analyst Ted Pillows shared a clean ETH price chart just hours ago, highlighting that the $2,800 level has finally been broken after several months of testing. $ETH broke key $2,800 resistance and is showing strength.

2025-07-11T13:00:58,"Polkadot price analysis: DOT breaks historical resistance, eyes run to $7.00","Polkadot has broken out of a multi-week resistance with a bullish engulfing candle, sparking speculation of a structural shift. However, the breakout remains in progress, and confirmation hinges on DOT holding above $3.75, a zone of high technical confluence. After several weeks of compression under a historical resistance, Polkadot ( DOT ) has finally breached the key ceiling with strong momentum. The breakout is developing on the weekly timeframe, adding to its potential significance. At the core of this move is the $3.75 level, a crucial zone that previously acted as resistance and is now being retested as support. If price action holds above this level, DOT could be setting up for a powerful trend reversal. Key technical points Support Reclaimed: The $3.75 level holds strong confluence, previously a ceiling, now key support. Weekly Engulfing Candle: A decisive bullish pattern breaking past multi-week resistance. Next Major Resistance: $7 high-timeframe resistance is the next major upside target. DOTUSDT (1W) Chart, Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, the breakout is promising but remains incomplete until the weekly candle closes and subsequent candles confirm strength above $3.75. The current structure shows signs of a bullish engulfing pattern, which often leads to continued buying, especially when coupled with a reclaimed support level. However, one concern is volume, which remains below average. For a breakout of this magnitude to be sustained, stronger volume would typically provide firmer confirmation. You might also like: XRP, BTC rise together; Investors flock to APT Miner to seek stable returns Historically, similar breakout patterns on DOT have led to extended rallies, particularly when backed by solid closes above key resistance levels. Should this breakout follow suit, the next logical target is the $7 resistance zone, which previously acted as a ceiling during earlier market cycles. The $3.75 zone now becomes the battleground between bulls and bears. If DOT can close multiple weekly candles above this level, the recent lows may be confirmed as a deviation, marking a shift toward a new bullish structural phase. This would likely attract additional buying interest and accelerate momentum toward the $7 target. However, failure to maintain support above $3.75 could invalidate the breakout, trapping long positions and sending DOT back into its prior range. What to expect in the coming price action: If DOT can close above $3.75 with strong volume, a sustained rally toward the $7 resistance becomes increasingly probable. Bulls must defend this reclaimed level to preserve the breakout structure. Failure to do so could result in a retracement and nullify the current bullish setup.

2025-07-11T13:00:58,"Altcoin Season: Arthur Hayes Predicts Explosive Opportunity for Crypto Investors","The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement, and for good reason. Bitcoin (BTC) has shattered its all-time high, pulling the entire digital asset space into a renewed state of optimism. Amidst this euphoria, a prominent voice has emerged with a powerful prediction: Arthur Hayes , the co-founder of BitMEX, believes a major Altcoin season is not just coming, but is potentially already here. For many crypto investors , this is the moment they’ve been waiting for. What is Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? Bitcoin’s recent surge past its previous all-time high is a monumental event, signaling robust demand and a maturing market. This isn’t just a fleeting pump; it’s backed by significant trading volume, indicating strong conviction from both retail and institutional players. But what exactly is fueling this impressive ascent? Institutional Inflows: The approval of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Major financial players are now able to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated vehicles, leading to billions of dollars flowing into the asset. This unprecedented level of institutional adoption provides a solid foundation for the current rally. Halving Hype: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, typically occurring every four years, is a well-known catalyst for price appreciation. This event reduces the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market, historically leading to supply shocks and upward price pressure. While not immediate, the anticipation builds momentum. Macroeconomic Landscape: A shift in global monetary policy, with central banks potentially easing interest rates, makes non-yielding assets like Bitcoin more attractive. As traditional investment returns face headwinds, investors seek alternative stores of value and growth opportunities. The resilience of the Bitcoin price in the face of various global uncertainties underscores its growing acceptance as a legitimate asset class. Its ability to reclaim and surpass previous peaks sets a positive precedent for the broader crypto ecosystem. Why are Ethereum Gains Poised for Even Greater Heights? While Bitcoin has been stealing the headlines, Ethereum (ETH) has been quietly consolidating, positioning itself for what many, including Arthur Hayes , believe will be substantial Ethereum gains . ETH is often seen as the primary beneficiary of capital rotation once Bitcoin’s initial surge cools, and several factors support this outlook: Dencun Upgrade: Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade significantly reduces transaction fees on Layer-2 networks, making the Ethereum ecosystem more scalable and affordable for everyday users and developers. This enhances its utility and competitiveness. Staking Yields: The transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has allowed ETH holders to earn yields by staking their tokens, making it an attractive asset for long-term holders seeking passive income. This also reduces the circulating supply, creating upward price pressure. DeFi and NFTs: Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). A resurgence in these sectors, driven by improved market sentiment, would directly translate into increased demand and value for ETH. The foundational strength of Ethereum, coupled with its continuous technological advancements, makes it a prime candidate for significant capital inflow as the market matures and crypto investors look beyond just Bitcoin for opportunities. Is Altcoin Season Truly Upon Us? Arthur Hayes ‘ Bold Prediction The term “ Altcoin season ” refers to a period when altcoins – cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin – experience significant price increases, often outperforming Bitcoin. This typically happens after Bitcoin has made its initial move, and capital begins to flow down the market capitalization ladder. Arthur Hayes , known for his astute market observations and sometimes provocative takes, is unequivocal in his belief that this phase is imminent. Hayes’ recent comments on X (formerly Twitter) highlight his firm conviction. He stated that Maelstrom, the Web3 venture capital firm where he serves as CIO, is “backing up the truck” and actively accumulating a wide range of tokens. This isn’t just casual speculation; it’s a declaration from a major player actively deploying significant capital into the altcoin market. This move suggests a belief that the risk-reward profile for altcoins is becoming increasingly favorable. What does “backing up the truck” imply? It means aggressive buying, indicating that Maelstrom sees substantial upside potential in a diverse portfolio of altcoins. This could include established large-cap altcoins, mid-cap gems, and even emerging smaller projects. Hayes’ endorsement carries weight, often influencing the sentiment of a wide range of crypto investors . Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors in an Altcoin Season With the potential for an Altcoin season looming, how can discerning crypto investors position themselves to capitalize on this opportunity while managing risk? Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Benefit Diversification Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Allocate capital across different altcoin categories (DeFi, Gaming, AI, Layer-1s). Mitigates risk if one sector underperforms; captures broader market upside. Thorough Research Investigate project fundamentals: team, technology, use case, tokenomics, community. Avoid hype-driven decisions. Identifies projects with long-term viability and reduces exposure to scams or weak projects. Risk Management Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders or take profits incrementally. Protects capital during market corrections and secures gains. Stay Informed Follow reputable analysts like Arthur Hayes , market news, and on-chain data. Helps in making timely decisions and understanding market sentiment. While the prospect of rapid Ethereum gains and other altcoin surges is exciting, it’s crucial to remember that altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin. They can experience dramatic price swings, both up and down. A disciplined approach, focusing on strong fundamentals and realistic expectations, is key to navigating this potentially rewarding period. Navigating the Volatility: Challenges and Considerations An Altcoin season , while offering immense upside, also comes with its own set of challenges. The very nature of altcoins, with their lower liquidity and often smaller market caps, makes them prone to higher volatility. This means: Increased Risk of Corrections: Prices can surge rapidly but also crash just as quickly. Profit-taking by early investors or sudden negative news can lead to sharp declines. “Rug Pulls” and Scams: The excitement of a bull market often attracts malicious actors. New projects with grand promises but no substance can emerge, leading to investors losing their capital. Due diligence is paramount. Information Overload: The sheer volume of new projects and daily news can be overwhelming. Distinguishing valuable information from noise becomes a challenge. Therefore, while the opportunity is tremendous, crypto investors must approach this period with caution and a well-defined strategy. Do not chase pumps blindly. Focus on projects with real utility, strong development teams, and active communities. Remember the words of Arthur Hayes , who often emphasizes risk management in his market commentaries, even as he champions bold moves. Conclusion: An Explosive Opportunity Awaits The stage is set. Bitcoin has led the charge, and Ethereum is poised to follow. With Arthur Hayes ‘ strong conviction and Maelstrom’s aggressive accumulation, the whispers of an Altcoin season are growing louder, promising an Explosive opportunity for those prepared. While the allure of significant Ethereum gains and other altcoin surges is undeniable, prudent investment strategies, thorough research, and disciplined risk management will be your best allies. This period offers a chance for substantial portfolio growth for diligent crypto investors . As the market evolves, staying informed and adaptable will be crucial. The coming months could truly redefine many portfolios.

2025-07-11T13:00:55,"Bitcoin MVRV Oscillator Predicts First Sell Pressure Level At $130,900 – Details","Bitcoin has officially broken through its previous all-time high of $112,000, surging to $118,000 just hours ago and entering uncharted territory for the first time since late May. The breakout confirms bullish momentum after weeks of consolidation and failed attempts, with price action now showing clear strength. With the psychological and technical barrier of $112K cleared, many analysts believe this move could mark the beginning of Bitcoin’s next expansive rally. Related Reading: Altcoins Jump Off Critical Support Level – Relief Or Reversal? Bulls are firmly in control, and on-chain metrics support this breakout narrative. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) Extreme Deviation Pricing Bands currently stand at 2.25. Historically, Bitcoin enters the overheated zone around 3.0 or higher, suggesting there is still room for growth before reaching excessive valuation territory. This metric, which measures the deviation between market price and realized value, helps identify when BTC is overbought or undervalued relative to past performance. At current levels, the data points to continued upside potential without major overheating concerns, fueling confidence that this breakout could extend further. Bitcoin Enters Expansion Phase As Market Eyes $130K After weeks of tight consolidation below the $110,000 mark, Bitcoin has finally broken out, signaling the start of a new market phase. The breakout above previous highs has reignited investor optimism, not only for BTC but also for the broader altcoin market, with many altcoins now pushing above key resistance levels for the first time in months. This move comes amid growing anticipation of a weakening US dollar and renewed inflationary pressures as Washington adopts looser fiscal policies. The market is increasingly pricing in the effects of tax cuts, high government spending, and dovish political rhetoric—all of which create a favorable environment for risk assets like Bitcoin. Still, the macro backdrop is not without risks. US Treasury yields remain elevated, flashing warnings of underlying systemic stress in credit markets. This tension underscores the fragility of the current rally and the importance of monitoring fundamental shifts. Top analyst Axel Adler shared insights using the MVRV oscillator, a model that compares Bitcoin’s market value to its realized value. According to Adler, historical data over the last four years suggests that when MVRV reaches 2.75, Bitcoin tends to face its first wave of meaningful selling pressure. If the same pattern holds true in this cycle, Bitcoin could reach approximately $130,900 before seeing notable profit-taking activity. While the current MVRV reading remains below that threshold, the model offers a clear signal of where long-term holders may begin offloading. Until then, the breakout sets the stage for a potential leg higher, with bulls now in control, pushing toward price discovery and a possible test of the $130K zone. Related Reading: Ethereum Back At Range Highs: Breakout Above $2,800 Could Ignite Altseason BTC Enters Uncharted Territory With Strong Momentum Bitcoin has officially broken into price discovery after blasting through its all-time high resistance near $112,000. The 3-day chart shows a massive bullish candle pushing BTC up to $118,683, representing an 8.94% gain in the last session. This breakout is the first clear sign of a strong bullish continuation after weeks of sideways consolidation below key resistance. The chart highlights a textbook breakout structure. BTC respected the $103,600 and $109,300 support zones multiple times throughout May and June before finally gaining enough momentum to pierce through the upper resistance. The recent surge came with a noticeable spike in volume, adding confidence to the breakout’s sustainability. Moving averages also confirm the bullish trend. The 50, 100, and 200 SMA lines remain aligned upward with increasing separation, suggesting that market structure remains strong and trend continuation is likely. Bitcoin is now trading well above all major moving averages, reinforcing the strength of the rally.

2025-07-11T12:51:00,"Investors Push Back On Bitcoin Miner Exec Pay","Summary Building on our 2022 analysis, we reviewed executive compensation across eight U.S.-listed Bitcoin miners: BTBT, CIFR, CLSK, CORZ, HUT, MARA, RIOT, and WULF. Bitcoin miners’ pay is significantly higher than in comparable industries, driven by a greater reliance on equity. Patterns in our latest findings reinforce the concerns raised in our 2022 report: that miner executive pay practices remain aggressive, equity-heavy, and often weakly aligned with shareholder outcomes. Most miners in our analysis now support annual say-on-pay votes. In the 2025 proxy season, shareholders of bitcoin mining companies are pushing back on executive compensation, citing concerns about pay practices and investor alignment. Please note that VanEck has exposure to Bitcoin and may have positions in Bitcoin mining stocks mentioned. Nearly 99% of executive pay proposals passed in the 2024 proxy season, and early 2025 filings show S&P 500 CEO pay rising nearly 10% year-over-year. Across corporate America, shareholder support for compensation remains strong, even as the numbers climb. Bitcoin miners are the exception. Despite aggressive compensation packages, their shareholders are balking. In our latest review of eight U.S.-listed miners, average support for executive pay proposals came in at just 64% , far below the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 averages of 90% and 91%. That skepticism appears well-founded. Mining executives continue to grant themselves oversized equity awards that dilute shareholders without reliably linking pay to long-term value creation. It’s a striking contradiction: in an industry built on Bitcoin’s 21-million hard cap, there are few such limits on how much stock insiders can issue themselves. Scope and Methodology Building on our 2022 analysis, we reviewed executive compensation across eight U.S.-listed Bitcoin miners: ( BTBT ), ( CIFR ), ( CLSK ), ( CORZ ), ( HUT ), ( MARA ), ( RIOT ), and ( WULF ). We excluded foreign issuers like IREN, HIVE, and GLXY, whose proxy disclosures lack the granularity required for consistent comparison. Using data from Gallagher benchmarking reports and DEF 14A filings, we compared total direct compensation (base salary, bonuses, and equity awards) against benchmarks from the energy and IT sectors, as well as the broader Russell 3000. Bitcoin Miners Outpay Peers, Driven by Equity-Heavy Packages The results were clear: Bitcoin miners’ pay is significantly higher than in comparable industries, driven by a greater reliance on equity. In some cases, this reliance is well-aligned with shareholder interests, but in many cases it appears excessive. In 2023, base salaries for miner NEOs averaged $474,000 , which is roughly in line with Energy at $505,000 , IT at $472,000 , and the broader market at $535,000 . However, equity and long-term awards made up 79 percent of total miner compensation that year, and that weighting increased to 89 percent in 2024 based on early proxy filings. While full peer data for 2024 is not yet available, the equity-heavy design continued to push total compensation significantly higher. Miner NEOs earned an average of $6.6 million in total direct compensation in 2023. This far exceeded the averages for Energy at $3.0 million , the Russell 3000 at $3.1 million , and even the tech sector at $4.5 million . In 2024, that figure nearly doubled to $14.4 million for the Bitcoin miners. To be sure, equity compensation likely rose across many sectors amid a broader bull market, but miners appear to have outpaced even that elevated baseline. Cash bonuses were elevated as well. In 2023, miner NEOs took home an average of $836,000 in bonuses, more than double the levels seen in IT and Energy. This suggests that even short-term incentives in the mining sector are generously structured compared to performance norms in adjacent industries.

The mean compensation factors for NEOs for Bitcoin miners and their peers compared to the energy and IT industries and the Russell 3000. *excluding CORZ, which was in Chapter 11 bankruptcy throughout 2023 Equity Award Structure: Short-Term Bias Remains, but Performance Gating Expands Patterns in our latest findings reinforce the concerns raised in our 2022 report: that miner executive pay practices remain aggressive, equity-heavy, and often weakly aligned with shareholder outcomes. The structure of these awards plays a key role, with most miners historically emphasizing short- to medium-term vesting schedules. While “as-achieved” performance grants remain uncommon, the trend is beginning to shift toward multi-year, performance-gated equity. As of their 2025 DEF 14A filings, six of the eight miners in our sample (Riot, Core Scientific, Hut 8, Cipher Mining, TeraWulf, and Marathon) report expanded use of performance stock units (PSUs). These awards typically vest over multiple years based on share price targets or relative total shareholder return (TSR), often paired with continued service requirements. Notably, Marathon transitioned fully to PSUs in 2025, while Cipher introduced a 50/50 mix of RSUs and PSUs. Core Scientific, following its reorganization, relaunched its long-term incentive program with PSU awards tied to cumulative stock performance. These changes mark a meaningful shift toward long-term alignment. Still, gaps remain. CleanSpark is the only miner in our dataset that has not adopted PSUs. Bit Digital’s 2025 plan authorizes them, but there’s no evidence of issuance in its filings. Both firms emphasize performance in principle, but neither discloses milestone-based vesting or gating criteria, elements now widely viewed as baseline governance practice. Taken together, the sector is showing early signs of reform. Most leading miners now incorporate multi-year vesting, relative benchmarks, and defined performance thresholds into their equity plans. While implementation varies, the departure from short-term-heavy designs is clear. As shareholder scrutiny builds, further improvements will likely be expected. Value Delivered? Not Always In 2024, NEO (Named Executive Officer) Compensation Equaled ~73% of RIOT's Market Cap Growth; WULF & CORZ, ~2% For all the structural shifts underway, a central question remains: are these pay packages aligned with shareholder value creation? Our analysis compared total NEO compensation to each company’s 2024 market-cap growth - a direct test of pay-for-performance alignment. The results were stark. While WULF and CORZ generated billions in new shareholder value, their NEOs took home just ~2% of that growth in compensation. By contrast, RIOT paid its NEOs $230 million , equivalent to 73% of its 2024 market-cap increase. MARA’s ratio came in at 18% . These disparities echo concerns we first raised in our 2022 report, when RIOT’s shareholders rejected the company’s say-on-pay proposal after disclosing $21.9 million in CEO compensation. That same proxy also included a proposal to expand RIOT’s equity compensation plan by 10 million shares, fueling investor concern over dilution, weak performance thresholds, and short-vesting equity. While RIOT has since adopted relative TSR-based PSUs, total pay still routinely outpaces shareholder returns. In 2024, NEO Compensation Equaled ~73% of RIOT's Market Cap Growth; WULF & CORZ, ~2% * Using data from its opening day on Jan 24th, 2024, for the 2023 EOY Market Cap, due to prior Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

While several miners have begun adopting longer vesting timelines and performance-linked awards, the absolute scale of 2024 equity grants remains a red flag. RIOT’s CEO received a $79.3 million equity award, the largest in the group, nearly double that of MARA and a multiple of its peers’ average. None of the companies in our sample issued special, one-time equity awards in 2024, suggesting a welcome move toward more standardized and predictable incentive cycles. But the size of regular-cycle grants alone continues to raise questions. Even with relative TSR gating in place, RIOT’s equity package reinforces concerns first raised in 2022: that total compensation remains out of step with shareholder value creation.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Shareholders are taking notice. In 2025, 3 of the 8 miners we analyzed (CORZ, RIOT, and MARA) faced striking rebukes on their executive pay proposals. Only 38% of CORZ investors approved its plan, followed by 32% for RIOT and just 22% for MARA. As discussed earlier, these reactions appear grounded in substance. CORZ’s $62 million NEO pay package amounted to just 2.2% of the firm’s market-cap growth: high in absolute terms, but modest compared to MARA’s 18% and RIOT’s 73% . Timing may have been CORZ’s undoing: the awards were issued only months after the company emerged from Chapter 11. In RIOT’s case, shareholder rejection is more straightforward and consistent with concerns flagged in 2021 and 2022. MARA’s even steeper disapproval likely reflects frustration with its dilutive Bitcoin accumulation strategy and a perceived lack of progress toward AI and HPC opportunities. Importantly, say-on-pay votes are advisory, but they send a clear message. Proxy advisors like ISS flag any proposal receiving less than 70% support as “low support,” while Glass Lewis applies an even stricter 80% threshold. Both expect boards -- especially compensation committees -- to respond and disclose corrective actions in the following year’s proxy. Votes under 50% , like those seen at CORZ, RIOT, and MARA, warrant what ISS calls “the highest degree of responsiveness.” Viewed through that lens, the Bitcoin mining sector stands out. Only two of the eight companies we assessed surpassed both the 70% and 80% thresholds in 2025, a 75% failure rate . By comparison, just 4.3% of Russell 3000 and 4.1% of S&P 500 companies fell below 70% in 2023, with even lower failure rates so far in 2024. Governance Reforms are Gaining Traction In response to growing scrutiny, several miners are adjusting how they engage shareholders on compensation. The most notable change is the adoption of “say-on-frequency” proposals, which determine how often investors vote on executive pay. In a sector known for rapid equity issuance and inconsistent performance alignment, annual votes provide a much-needed mechanism for accountability. Most miners in our analysis now support annual say-on-pay votes. CORZ, CIFR, RIOT, and HUT all received strong approval for this approach, with support ranging from 91% to 99% . BTBT was the only outlier, proposing to maintain a triennial vote. That proposal received just 65% support, signaling that investors prefer more frequent oversight. Several companies also sought approval to expand their equity or incentive plans. WULF and CORZ each proposed authorizing new grants equal to roughly 10% of shares outstanding . BTBT, HUT, and MARA requested approvals in the range of 4% to 5% . While all five proposals passed with solid majorities above 86% , the broader context is important . Two of these companies, CORZ and MARA, failed their say-on-pay votes outright, and one—BTBT—narrowly avoided the same outcome. This gap underscores a central concern. While shareholders may approve equity plans on procedural grounds, particularly when they apply company-wide, they remain deeply skeptical about how executive awards are structured and justified. As the sector evolves, we expect investor attention to shift toward award design, dilution levels, and the degree to which pay reflects long-term value creation. How Miners Can Rebuild Alignment As Bitcoin miners mature into large-scale infrastructure operators, their executive compensation programs must evolve as well. Recent proxy votes make clear that investors are no longer comfortable with oversized equity awards that lack meaningful ties to performance. Boards and compensation committees should focus on three priorities: 1. Incentivize cost-efficiency Bonuses and equity grants should be tied to cost-per-coin-mined. This metric captures the key drivers of profitability, including power pricing, fleet optimization, and SG&A control. It encourages operational discipline and better protects margins during Bitcoin price cycles. 2. Reinforce capital discipline Boards should incorporate measures like return on invested capital or capex efficiency into long-term incentive frameworks. These metrics help align compensation with how effectively management deploys shareholder capital, especially when growth depends on continued equity issuance. 3. Strengthen performance gating on equity awards Equity should vest over multiple years and include performance thresholds, not just service requirements. Relative total shareholder return remains a viable benchmark, but awards should include caps and minimums to ensure they reflect company-specific execution rather than general market trends. These changes won’t eliminate scrutiny, but they would move miner compensation closer to governance best practice and restore credibility to pay programs that have drawn justified criticism. Focusing on execution, efficiency, and capital discipline would send a clearer signal that boards are committed to long-term alignment.

2025-07-11T12:45:42,"Bitcoin trades near all-time high, but upside volatility could still lead to new highs","Interest rates on OKX’s USDT “Simple Earn” flexible savings product surged from 5% to 53% in the midday Asian trading hours on Friday, as Bitcoin and the crypto market tasted volatility for the first time in Q3 2025. According to market analysts, the spike is one of the highest short-term price hikes for the yield-bearing product in recent months. Historically, similar jumps have coincided with Bitcoin’s price rally. OKX USDT Simple Earn Flexible rates. Source: OKX On November 10, 2024, the savings product reached a 44% rate when Bitcoin opened at $76,677, and the coin went on to reach $90,000 in just days. Now, with Bitcoin trading at $118,500, an intraday increase of 6.5%, investors seem uncertain about taking profits over the possibility of a continued market run. Bitcoin price dooms short sellers According to Coinglass data, over $1.14 billion in short positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours. The liquidations came against the backdrop of Bitcoin’s ascent above $118,000. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is at 67, meaning the market is in a state of excessive buying. When the largest coin by market cap reached $113,000 during the US market trading close, Bitcoin transfers from miners to exchanges rose to 3,900 coins, the first uptick seen since May 23. Miners hold onto their coins unless prices go up to a level that justifies selling, mainly to cover the cost of mining operations. They could also be seeking to realize profits before the end of the “US crypto week,” when many expect price corrections to take place. CryptoQuant’s UTXO data reveals that only 15% of the market consists of holders who bought Bitcoin in the past month, down from 30% during previous price highs. This decrease indicates that the current uptrend is under the control of existing holders rather than by fresh capital inflows. SOPR and exchange activity indicate caution The Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for short-term holders shows that recent buyers are not selling, and are instead helping keep downward pressure on prices low. Data from Santiment reveals that since June, balances have dropped by 21% to 315,830 BTC. The trend is more profound when looking at the past five years, during which 1.88 million Bitcoins, or 61% of exchange-held coins, have moved into self-custody wallets. Long-term holders are comfortable placing their assets outside of exchanges to reduce the chances of any large-scale sell-offs. On the derivatives market front, open interest (OI) has gone up to $41.177 billion, a 5.67% increase. Higher OI means there’s more liquidity and attention in the futures market, and goes hand-in-hand with increased volatility. Glassnode: Market activity to grow further Late Thursday, Glassnode shared a chart on X that showed a $4.4 billion jump in Bitcoin’s realized cap, a metric that tracks the value of coins based on their last move, after the price crossed $113,000. Unlike market cap, Realized Cap reflects actual capital inflows – only rising when coins move at higher prices. The $4.4B jump as $BTC broke a new ATH above $112K confirms real conviction behind the move, not just speculative markup: https://t.co/2CkVmgTmet pic.twitter.com/xtDARvgcdH — glassnode (@glassnode) July 10, 2025 Per the market analysis platform, realized cap increases only when coins change hands at higher prices, by actual capital inflows, not speculative valuation. Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio, a chart comparison of the market cap to realized cap, is at 2.2. Previous market tops in March and December 2024 saw the MVRV ratio exceed 2.7. Looking at the two figures, market watchers believe the coin may still not have reached the peak of the run yet. Market analyst Axel Adler Jr. explained that an inflection point for selling takes place when MVRV reaches 2.75, a level that will see Bitcoin clock $130,900, about 17% above its $108,000 all-time high.

Ethereum, Solana, XRP Price Rally, Cardano Leads Altcoin Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is flashing green across the board. In the last 24 hours, almost all top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, BNB, Solana, and Cardano, have seen impressive gains. Bitcoin Hits $118K: Bull Market Back? On July 10, 2025, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $118,397 , triggering fresh optimism in the market. This breakout is widely seen as a risk-on signal, with analysts suggesting it may drive capital rotation into top altcoins. Rick Maeda , a leading crypto analyst, says Bitcoin’s momentum could inject liquidity into the broader altcoin market. Historically, BTC rallies often kickstart a second wave of gains in coins like Ethereum and Solana. Altcoins Wake Up: ETH, SOL, ADA Post Strong Gains In just 24 hours: Ethereum (ETH) is up 7.5% XRP has gained 7.1% BNB increased by 2.7% Solana (SOL) rose 4.1% Cardano (ADA) jumped 15.2% Ethereum is now testing its 2024 highs near $3,000, with a 17.48% rally in the past four days, reaching $2,986.25. Solana also recorded a strong 10.21% rise over the same period, now priced at $164.02. Mid-cap tokens are also rallying. Memecoins like Pepe rose 14.4%, and HYPE surged 10.2%, showing early signs of a broader altcoin breakout. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Charles Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Price Will Hit $250K , Ethereum Leads the Altcoin Charge Analysts agree: Ethereum is poised to benefit the most from this market uptrend.

Today, July 11, 2025, the crypto market is performing very strongly. Bitcoin hit a new all-time high above $118,000, boosting total crypto market capitalization past $3.65 trillion. Most major cryptocurrencies are seeing impressive gains, with trading volumes surging over 47% in 24 hours. Will the Bitcoin price rally sustain this month, July 2025? The Bitcoin rally is showing strong signs of sustainability for July 2025, driven by record ETF inflows ($1.18B on July 10), macro tailwinds like potential Fed rate cuts, and supportive policies from the Trump administration. Some analysts predict BTC could reach $122,000–$125,000 by mid-July. How high can Bitcoin price go in 2025? Bitcoin price predictions for 2025 vary, but many analysts are bullish. Forecasts range from an average of $109,046 (Changelly) to over $200,000 (Standard Chartered, Bernstein). Some, like Charles Hoskinson, are even forecasting a $250,000 price target by year-end 2025.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-hits-118k-ethereum-solana-xrp-price-rally-cardano-leads-altcoin-surge/,"BTC|ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|SOL|MARKET","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-11T12:41:43,"WisdomTree Forecasts Bitcoin at $250K and Gold at $4K by 2030 in Base Case Scenario","In a research note, Blake Heimann, Senior Associate of Quantitative Research at WisdomTree, presents bitcoin and gold as key “hard money” assets poised to benefit from continued expansion of the global money supply. With economic uncertainty mounting, investors are increasingly turning to assets that preserve purchasing power amid rising debt, inflation risks, and eroding institutional trust. Traditionally, gold has been viewed as the durable store of value. Now, bitcoin is emerging as a credible, decentralized counterpart in the eyes of many institutional investors. WisdomTree’s scenario-based forecast projects that in moderate inflation, steady liquidity expansion, and modest real growth—bitcoin could reach $250,000 and gold $4,000 per ounce by 2030. The analysis assumes bitcoin will continue to grow its share of the total “hard money basket” alongside gold, driven by increasing investor confidence in decentralized financial systems. Deflationary, Base, and Inflationary Forecasts Modeled The report outlines three macroeconomic trajectories: deflationary, base case, and inflationary. In the deflationary case, where fiscal discipline returns and money supply growth slows, bitcoin is expected to reach $120,000 by 2030 while gold retreats to $3,000. In an inflationary scenario characterized by entrenched inflation and weakening fiat confidence, bitcoin is forecast to surge to $500,000 by 2030 and hit $1.9 million by 2050. Gold could rise to $5,500 in 2030 and $18,800 by mid-century. The valuation model ties bitcoin and gold prices to the projected size of the global money supply, using historical ratios of hard money asset value to money supply to estimate future prices. Combined with assumptions around bitcoin’s expanding role within this basket, the model provides long-term forecasts for both assets’ potential growth trajectories under various economic regimes. Diversified Financial Future According to Heimann, the forecasts underscore the evolving roles bitcoin and gold may play in a diversified portfolio geared toward monetary resilience. Both assets, he notes, are uniquely positioned to capture value as the world adjusts to persistent liquidity, rising fiscal strain, and increased demand for decentralised alternatives to fiat. While the projections are not guarantees of future performance, they reflect a growing consensus that bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset—but an integral component of modern hard money strategy. Bitcoin Soars to Fresh Record at $118K Earlier today, Bitcoin surged to a record high above $118,600 on Friday, lifted by accelerating institutional demand, surging ETF inflows and renewed political tailwinds from the Trump administration. The latest rally caught traders off guard and triggered the highest wave of liquidations in years, signaling a powerful shift in momentum. The latest price spike came as market structure turned decisively bullish, according to 10X Research.

2025-07-11T12:41:41,"Why Bitcoin Is Rallying Now","Bitcoin has once again shattered expectations, rocketing to a new all-time high above $118,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is making headlines, but what’s really propelling this latest surge? Let’s dive into the story behind the rally, explore the technical landscape, and discover what could come next for BTC. Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? The Main Drivers 1. Institutional Inflows: ETFs Take Center Stage U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen explosive net inflows, with over $1.18 billion pouring in just this week. BlackRock’s IBIT alone attracted nearly $450 million in a single day, while total ETF trading volume hit $6.3 billion—the highest since May. Institutional investors, from asset managers to corporate treasuries, are snapping up Bitcoin as a portfolio staple. This “easy access” through ETFs is fueling unprecedented demand. 2. Regulatory Tailwinds: Pro-Crypto U.S. Policies The Trump administration’s pro-Bitcoin stance is energizing the market. A new executive order aims to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and Congress is advancing bills to legitimize digital assets. Trump’s family business is even seeking regulatory approval for a new “Crypto Blue Chip ETF,” adding even more legitimacy to the space. 3. Macroeconomic Shifts: The Perfect Storm The U.S. Dollar Index is down 10% year-to-date, with global investors seeking alternatives as Moody’s downgrades U.S. debt and trade tensions ease. Bitcoin’s appeal as a “digital gold” and hedge against inflation is stronger than ever, especially as traditional safe havens look shaky. 4. Supply Crunch: Holders Aren’t Selling On-chain data reveals that Bitcoin flows to exchanges are at a 10-year low, meaning fewer coins are available for sale—even as demand soars. This supply squeeze is amplifying every wave of new buying, making price spikes sharper and more dramatic. Technical Outlook: Charting the Rally Bullish Breakout Confirmed Bitcoin blasted through major resistance at $110,000, igniting a wave of bullish momentum. Technical analysis shows the price is well above all major moving averages (SMA7, SMA20, SMA50, SMA200), a classic sign of a strong uptrend. Momentum indicators like RSI (73.4) and Stochastic (over 95) signal “overbought” territory, but also confirm intense buying pressure. Short Squeeze Adds Fuel Over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated as bears got caught off guard, triggering a cascade of forced buying that accelerated the rally. Futures traders are now mostly long, but funding rates remain low—suggesting the rally is not just about leverage, but real demand. What’s Next? Key Levels to Watch If Bitcoin holds above $118,000, technical projections point to $122,880 as the next major target, based on Fibonacci extensions. A healthy pullback to test $112,000 as new support would be normal before any further leg up. Watch for volatility: with the market in “price discovery,” moves can be dramatic both ways. Conclusion: A Rally Built on Real Demand Bitcoin’s surge to $118,000 isn’t just another hype cycle. It’s the result of institutional FOMO, supportive policies, macroeconomic uncertainty, and a technical breakout that’s caught the world’s attention. Whether you’re a trader, investor, or just a crypto-curious observer, this rally is rewriting the rules—and the story is far from over. Ready to ride the next wave? Stay tuned, stay sharp, and keep your eyes on the charts.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9906/why-bitcoin-is-rallying-now,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the current momentum: Anticipation of the Dencun Upgrade: Slated for March, the Dencun upgrade is one of the most significant updates to the Ethereum network since ‘The Merge’. It promises to introduce ‘proto-danksharding’ (EIP-4844), which is expected to dramatically reduce transaction fees (gas fees) on Layer 2 solutions like Optimism and Arbitrum. Lower fees could lead to increased network activity and adoption, making Ethereum more competitive and appealing. Growing DeFi and NFT Ecosystems: Despite recent market fluctuations, the decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors, largely built on Ethereum , continue to innovate and attract users. Renewed interest and liquidity flowing back into these ecosystems directly benefit ETH as the underlying gas token and primary collateral. Increasing Institutional Interest: The recent approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs has paved the way for similar products for Ethereum . Major financial institutions are exploring or have filed for ETH spot ETFs, signaling a growing acceptance and demand from traditional finance. This influx of institutional capital could provide substantial liquidity and legitimacy to the asset. Bitcoin’s Halving and Broader Crypto Market Rally: Bitcoin’s strong performance, fueled by its upcoming halving event and ETF approvals, often creates a positive ripple effect across the entire crypto market . As the market leader, Bitcoin’s upward trajectory tends to pull altcoins, including Ethereum , along with it. The Significance of the $3,000 Milestone for Digital Assets Surpassing the $3,000 threshold is more than just a numerical achievement for Ethereum ; it carries profound psychological and market implications for all digital assets . For many investors, $3,000 represents a critical resistance level that, once broken, can signal a shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. This level was last seen in early February, and reclaiming it suggests renewed confidence and buying pressure. Historically, round numbers like $3,000 act as psychological barriers. Breaking through them can trigger further buying as traders and investors see it as a confirmation of upward momentum. For Ethereum , which reached an all-time high of over $4,800 in November 2021, reclaiming this level signifies a steady recovery and a potential retest of previous highs. It reinforces Ethereum’s position as a foundational element of the decentralized internet, solidifying its status among premier digital assets . How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? As a dominant force, Ethereum ‘s performance often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . Its movements can significantly influence altcoins, particularly those within its extensive ecosystem. When ETH surges, it typically instills confidence across the board, leading to a broader rally in the altcoin space. This positive correlation is due to several factors: Increased Liquidity: A rising ETH price often means more capital flowing into the Ethereum network, which can then spill over into other projects and tokens built on or associated with its blockchain . Investor Confidence: A strong ETH price performance boosts overall investor sentiment, encouraging more participation and investment across various cryptocurrencies. Market Capitalization Shift: Ethereum’s growing market capitalization reinforces its standing as a major player, attracting more institutional and retail interest to the crypto space as a whole. While Bitcoin often leads the charge, Ethereum ‘s robust ecosystem and ongoing development ensure its crucial role in driving the overall health and direction of the crypto market . Ethereum’s Blockchain: Innovation and Future Prospects Beyond its price action, the underlying strength of Ethereum lies in its robust blockchain technology and continuous innovation. Ethereum is not just a cryptocurrency; it is a decentralized global computer, enabling smart contracts and powering thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). Its transition to Proof-of-Stake with ‘The Merge’ significantly reduced its energy consumption, making it a more sustainable and environmentally friendly blockchain . The upcoming Dencun upgrade is just one step in Ethereum’s long-term roadmap towards greater scalability, security, and sustainability. Future upgrades aim to introduce sharding, further enhancing transaction throughput and reducing costs. This continuous evolution positions Ethereum as a leading platform for future technological advancements, from Web3 to enterprise solutions, making it an indispensable digital asset for the future economy. Navigating the Future: Actionable Insights for Ethereum Investors For those looking to engage with Ethereum and other digital assets , understanding the landscape is crucial. While the recent surge is exciting, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of major network upgrades like Dencun, regulatory developments, and broader economic trends that could impact the ETH price . Understand Volatility: Price corrections are a natural part of crypto cycles. Be prepared for potential dips and avoid making emotional decisions based on short-term price movements. Consider Long-Term Potential: Many investors view Ethereum as a long-term hold due to its foundational technology and vast ecosystem. Dollar-cost averaging can be a strategy to mitigate volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Ethereum is a strong asset, consider diversifying your holdings across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to manage risk. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any investment decisions, thoroughly research projects, understand their fundamentals, and assess your own risk tolerance. Ethereum ‘s triumphant return above $3,000 is a powerful testament to its enduring relevance and potential within the rapidly evolving crypto market . While the path ahead may bring its share of volatility, the underlying technological advancements and growing adoption continue to solidify its position as a cornerstone of the decentralized future. As the Dencun upgrade approaches and institutional interest intensifies, the narrative for Ethereum and the broader ecosystem of digital assets remains compelling.

According to Finbold research, Bitcoin’s 30-day average daily trading volume stood at approximately $61.66 billion, based on CoinMarketCap’s reported $1.85 trillion in cumulative volume. In comparison, Nvidia’s 30-day average daily volume was around $32.67 billion, calculated using YCharts data for share volume (200.44 million) and the July 9 closing price of $162.88.

2025-07-11T12:33:19,"Why is Cardano Price Up Today?","The post Why is Cardano Price Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cardano price has come alive with a meteoric 14.82% price surge, catching the attention of traders and long-term investors alike. The broader crypto market rally has played a key role, but so did Cardano-specific developments. IOG’s newly announced LATAM partnership has re-energized developer interest, while the Cardano Foundation’s revelation of $659 million in reserves with 15% in Bitcoin has further bolstered confidence. Successively, the clear technical breakout and a surge in whale transactions, have resulted in a multi-day high that may just be the beginning of a larger trend. Intriguing enough? Join me as I decode the short term Cardano price analysis. Whale Transactions Hit Peak Levels Cardano’s on-chain activity has seen a remarkable upswing. According to Santiment , whale transaction counts (>$100K) have been surging since July 8th and hit their peak yesterday and today. This swift escalation in large-volume transfers suggests that institutional players or early whales are positioning for a broader rally. It is worth noting that, ADA’s most recent whale spike coincides directly with the price breakout above key resistance levels, hinting at strategic accumulation. As the volume of transactions exceeding $100k rises, it often reflects either high-conviction accumulation or profit-taking. In this case, I believe that the timing and continued price climb suggest bullish accumulation is on the horizon. Cardano Price Analysis At the time of publication, ADA is changing hands at $0.7242 after surging 14.82% in the past 24 hours. Volume has soared by over 70%, reaching $1.88 billion, indicating strong market participation. ADA touched a daily low of $0.6227 and peaked at $0.7349, pushing above multiple resistance levels. The 4-hour chart I’ve shared reveals a convincing breakout from the $0.6554 resistance, with ADA now targeting $0.75 as the next psychological barrier. Bollinger Bands are widening, confirming increased volatility, while the RSI has surged to 91, suggesting short-term exhaustion but not yet a trend reversal. Strong support now lies between $0.613–$0.655. If ADA maintains this momentum, a test of $0.75 looks increasingly likely. However, traders should maintain caution, as the overbought RSI levels warrant caution for a minor pullback or consolidation. Hodling ADA? Read our Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for a sneak peek into its future! FAQs Why is Cardano (ADA) price rising today? ADA price is climbing due to a broader market rally, whale accumulation, bullish technical breakout, and renewed developer interest following IOG’s LATAM partnership. What does the whale activity mean for ADA’s future price? Rising whale transactions suggest smart money is accumulating, often preceding further price appreciation. Is it too late to buy ADA now?

2025-07-11T12:30:29,"Bitcoin: Smarter Web Company’s Strategic Move Bolsters Crypto Adoption with 1,275 BTC Holdings","In the ever-evolving landscape of digital finance, a significant trend continues to solidify its presence: the increasing embrace of Bitcoin by mainstream companies. This isn’t just about individual investors anymore; it’s about corporations making calculated, strategic moves that underscore their confidence in the future of decentralized currency. The latest news from the UK-based web development firm, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), perfectly illustrates this burgeoning phenomenon, sending ripples of excitement through the crypto community. The Smarter Web Company’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, recently made headlines with an official announcement confirming a substantial new acquisition of Bitcoin . This latest purchase involved an additional 275 BTC, a move that significantly bolsters their existing digital asset portfolio. With this strategic addition, SWC’s total Bitcoin holdings have now reached an impressive 1,275 BTC. This isn’t merely a speculative venture for SWC. It represents a clear commitment to integrating digital assets into their treasury management strategy. The decision reflects a growing understanding among corporate entities of Bitcoin ‘s potential as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a foundational element of the future financial system. Why Are Companies Pursuing Institutional Investment in Crypto? The trend of companies like SWC making substantial institutional investment s in Bitcoin is not random; it’s driven by a confluence of economic factors and a shifting perception of digital assets. Several key reasons compel corporations to allocate a portion of their treasury reserves to cryptocurrencies: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as ‘digital gold’ – a finite asset designed to hold its value against depreciating fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional portfolio of cash, bonds, and equities offers diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Future of Finance: Companies recognize that digital currencies and blockchain technology are not fads but fundamental shifts in how transactions will occur and value will be stored in the future. Early adoption positions them favorably. Technological Alignment: For a web development company like SWC, investing in Bitcoin aligns with their core business of technology and innovation, showcasing their forward-thinking approach. This strategic pivot by corporations signals a maturation of the crypto market, moving beyond retail speculation towards a more stable, institutionally-backed asset class. The Accelerating Pace of Crypto Adoption Among Corporations SWC’s recent acquisition is part of a broader, accelerating trend of crypto adoption by corporations worldwide. While MicroStrategy remains the poster child for corporate Bitcoin treasuries, many other companies, from tech giants to financial services firms, are quietly or openly adding Digital Assets to their balance sheets. This widespread adoption is a testament to the growing confidence in Bitcoin ‘s long-term viability and its potential to disrupt traditional financial paradigms. Consider the following examples that highlight this trend: Company Industry Notable Crypto Holdings/Activities MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Largest corporate holder of Bitcoin , consistently adding to holdings. Tesla Automotive, Clean Energy Held significant Bitcoin , accepted it for payments briefly. Block (formerly Square) Financial Services, Payments Holds Bitcoin , actively invests in Bitcoin development. Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining Holds significant self-mined Bitcoin . Hut 8 Mining Bitcoin Mining Canadian publicly traded company holding substantial Bitcoin . These examples, alongside SWC’s latest move, paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is no longer just for early adopters or niche investors. It’s becoming a legitimate component of corporate treasury strategies, signifying a pivotal moment in global crypto adoption . What Does It Mean When a Company Buys Bitcoin ? When a company buys Bitcoin , it sends a powerful signal to the market and beyond. It’s more than just a financial transaction; it’s an endorsement. Here’s what such a move typically signifies: Increased Legitimacy: Each corporate acquisition adds a layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class, making it more palatable for other institutional investors and even sovereign wealth funds. Supply Shock Potential: As more companies accumulate Bitcoin and hold it for the long term, the circulating supply available on exchanges decreases, potentially leading to upward price pressure due to scarcity. Risk Appetite and Innovation: Companies willing to allocate capital to Bitcoin often demonstrate a higher risk appetite and a commitment to innovation, positioning themselves at the forefront of technological and financial trends. Investor Confidence: For investors, a company holding Bitcoin can be seen as a sign of forward-thinking management and a belief in future growth, potentially attracting more traditional investment. SWC’s decision to increase its Bitcoin holdings from 1,000 BTC to 1,275 BTC isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about the message it conveys regarding their conviction in the digital asset space. The Strategic Importance of Digital Assets in Modern Portfolios The inclusion of Digital Assets like Bitcoin in corporate treasuries highlights their growing strategic importance. Beyond being a speculative investment, Bitcoin offers unique characteristics that appeal to sophisticated financial managers: Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single government or central bank, offering a level of autonomy and resilience. Transparency: All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public, immutable ledger (the blockchain), providing unparalleled transparency. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin can be sent and received anywhere in the world with an internet connection, bypassing traditional banking intermediaries and their associated costs and delays. Programmability (for the broader crypto space): While Bitcoin itself is primarily a store of value, the underlying blockchain technology enables a vast array of programmable financial instruments and applications, which is a key driver for long-term value. For a company like SWC, which operates in the digital realm, embracing Digital Assets is a natural extension of their business philosophy and a proactive step towards navigating the financial landscape of tomorrow. Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits are compelling, corporate Bitcoin holdings are not without their challenges. Companies must navigate several critical considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin ‘s price can be highly volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of corporate holdings. This requires a strong stomach and a long-term investment horizon. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies must stay abreast of changing laws regarding taxation, custody, and usage. Security: Safeguarding large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and stringent internal controls to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting Treatment: The accounting rules for cryptocurrencies are still developing, posing complexities for financial reporting. SWC’s continued investment suggests they have robust strategies in place to manage these risks, perhaps leveraging their expertise as a web development company to ensure top-tier digital security. Looking Ahead: The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Strategies The increasing trend of companies acquiring Bitcoin suggests a future where Digital Assets play a more central role in corporate finance. As regulatory clarity improves and institutional-grade infrastructure matures, more businesses are likely to follow suit. This could lead to: Wider Adoption as a Payment Method: Beyond treasury holdings, more companies might begin accepting Bitcoin for goods and services. Integrated Blockchain Solutions: Businesses might leverage blockchain technology for supply chain management, intellectual property rights, and other operational efficiencies. Increased Demand and Scarcity: As more corporate capital flows into Bitcoin , its finite supply will become even more pronounced, potentially impacting its value significantly. The Smarter Web Company’s latest move is not just a footnote in crypto news; it’s a testament to the ongoing paradigm shift in how corporations perceive and utilize money in the digital age. Conclusion: A Smarter Move for a Digital Future The Smarter Web Company’s decision to further expand its Bitcoin holdings to 1,275 BTC is a powerful indicator of the growing confidence in Digital Assets among forward-thinking corporations. It underscores a broader trend of institutional investment that is fundamentally reshaping the financial landscape. As companies increasingly recognize Bitcoin ‘s potential as a strategic asset, an inflation hedge, and a cornerstone of future finance, we can expect the pace of crypto adoption to accelerate even further. SWC’s move is a smart one, positioning them at the vanguard of a digital future where decentralized currencies play an undeniable and increasingly important role.

According to data provided by Arkham Intelligence , the Bhutanese government deposited 100.215 BTC, worth $11.83 million in total, on July 11. The deposit comes in the wake of another monster move, as $23.1 million worth of BTC was already deposited from the same wallet on July 10. Kingdom of Bhutan Bitcoin transaction. Source: Arkham Earlier in 2025, Bhutan’s on-chain activity was minimal, limited to tiny transactions of around 0.0001 BTC. However, the country picked up the pace in June, and the scale of these new movements appears to signal a major shift in the country’s crypto operations. Bhutan’s crypto moves Although Bhutanese authorities have made no official statement, large-scale moves such as these are often associated with selling intentions. If a large sale does follow, Bitcoin could face short-term volatility, especially if the sale is conducted in the open market rather than over-the-counter (OTC). Bhutan’s involvement in crypto is far from sudden, as the country has been mining Bitcoin using its hydroelectric power for a while now, partnering with firms like Bitdeer to scale up its operations. However, the latest moves could be an early sign of a broader transformation, one that will see crypto as a legitimate part of governmental financial strategies. The country still holds around $1.37 billion in Bitcoin reserves, as per the data provided by Arkham Intelligence , meaning it stands out as one of the most prominent state-level crypto investors.

2025-07-11T12:24:10,"Ripple CTO Debunks Satoshi Hack Theories After $8.6B BTC Transfer","The post Ripple CTO Debunks Satoshi Hack Theories After $8.6B BTC Transfer appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A cryptic series of Bitcoin transactions has sparked new fears that wallets belonging to Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto may have been compromised. The messages were sent out on July 1 via OP_RETURN, a feature used to store messages on the Bitcoin blockchain . The most alarming part is that these messages, embedded in transactions from legacy wallet addresses, claimed possession of their contents, raising concerns about security flaws in early Bitcoin infrastructure. Interestingly, the transactions involved old-style P2PKH addresses, which were widely used in Bitcoin’s early days. This specific detail set off a wave of speculation, with many wondering if the legendary Satoshi’s wallets, estimated to hold nearly one million BTC, might finally have been cracked. Whale Moves $8.6 Billion—Not a Sell-Off Days later, about 80,000 BTC, roughly $8.6 billion, moved from those dormant wallets into new, modern SegWit addresses. The eight dormant Bitcoin wallets likely belong to a single early miner, though the owner remains unknown. Their 14-year inactivity may be due to long-term holding, previously lost keys now recovered, or simply waiting for the right time to act. On-chain analysts at Arkham and Ledger’s CTO Charles Guillemet found this was likely a wallet security upgrade. The absence of transfers to exchanges suggests it wasn’t triggered by price-selling intentions. Ripple’s CTO Weighs In I think there are two likely explanations: 1) Someone is laundering their own money by claiming they found the keys somehow. 2) Someone has found wallets with weak keys or nonces and is trying to lawfully claim them as abandoned. Hard to say which. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 11, 2025 However, Ripple CTO David Schwartz weighed in to calm the panic. He suggested it’s more likely a case of someone reclaiming old, abandoned wallets or perhaps using these messages as a front to move funds. There’s no evidence that Bitcoin’s core cryptography has been compromised, and nothing points directly to Satoshi’s wallets being accessed. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse’s Net Worth Climbs to $10B After SEC Settlement , While neither theory confirms a direct breach of Bitcoin’s cryptography, both raise questions about the security of legacy wallets.

Cryptic Bitcoin transactions on July 1 via OP_RETURN, a feature for embedding messages, claimed possession of contents from old-style P2PKH addresses. This raised concerns that wallets belonging to early miners, potentially even Satoshi Nakamoto, might have been compromised due to security flaws. Are Satoshi Nakamoto’s known wallets actually compromised or untouched? For now, Satoshi Nakamoto’s known wallets remain untouched and no verified hacks have occurred. While the recent mysterious transactions stirred speculation, the idea of a major breach of Satoshi’s personal holdings remains unconfirmed and speculative. What are OP_RETURN messages on the Bitcoin blockchain? OP_RETURN is a Bitcoin script opcode that allows users to store small amounts of arbitrary data (like messages or hashes) on the blockchain as part of a transaction output. These outputs are provably unspendable and are often used for timestamping or embedding data from other layers.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-cto-debunks-satoshi-hack-theories-after-8-6b-btc-transfer/,"BTC|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN|WALLET|XRP|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T12:23:17,"XRP is expected to break new highs – DOT Miners help investors seize new opportunities","As bullish sentiment continues to rise in the cryptocurrency market, Ripple’s XRP has come into the spotlight, with multiple analysts predicting a potential major breakout. Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, stated that as long as XRP holds above the critical $2.34 level, the asset could break through the $2.65 threshold and potentially surge to new highs between $4 and $6. At the same time, Bitcoin (BTC) has also reached new milestones, surpassing $112,000 on July 9th, driven by the strong performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased corporate adoption. The rally has boosted other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Solana (SOL), which all saw significant gains in just 24 hours.
