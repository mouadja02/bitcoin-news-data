2025-07-11T10:50:40,"Early Bitcoin Buyer: Overlooking XRP Now Could Be a Costly Mistake","Chad Steingraber, a well-known pro-XRP game developer and early Bitcoin investor, recently drew attention with a post underscoring the potential he sees in XRP. In the post, he referenced his successful experience with Bitcoin, noting that he acquired all of his BTC holdings when the cryptocurrency was priced at $3,000. At the time, many doubted its viability, but Steingraber‚Äôs investment decision has since proven to be highly lucrative. I bought all my Bitcoin at $3,000. I wouldn‚Äôt have done that if I listened to naysayers. Same is true for XRP. ‚Äî Chad Steingraber (@ChadSteingraber) July 7, 2025 Bitcoin last traded at $3,000 in December 2018 and briefly maintained similar prices through early 2019. Since then, the asset has climbed to a peak of $118,000, representing a return of approximately 3,700%. Steingraber shared that if he had paid attention to the skeptics back then, he would have missed out on the gains entirely. Drawing Parallels Between Bitcoin Then and XRP Now In his message, Steingraber made it clear that he believes XRP is now in a phase similar to where Bitcoin was during its earlier years. ‚ÄúI bought all my Bitcoin at $3,000. I wouldn‚Äôt have done that if I listened to naysayers,‚Äù he wrote. He further remarked, ‚ÄúSame is true for XRP.‚Äù The implication is that XRP, like Bitcoin before it, could offer substantial returns to those who invest before the mainstream narrative shifts. The post reflects a broader belief held by many XRP supporters. They argue that XRP‚Äôs value proposition is still intact and that its long-term potential is underestimated by the market due to current sentiment and legal hurdles. While the coin has remained below its all-time high for nearly eight years, some holders maintain that the market is undervaluing it significantly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Skepticism Persists, but So Does Belief Despite enthusiasm within the XRP community, the token‚Äôs price performance over the years has disappointed some investors. Since the time Bitcoin stood at $3,000, XRP was priced around $0.28. Its gains since then amount to roughly an 11X return, which falls short compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 37X increase. This contrast has led some to question whether XRP can still deliver the kind of returns early Bitcoin investors enjoyed. However, supporters continue to point to the unique factors that have affected XRP‚Äôs trajectory. Chief among them is the long-standing legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which some believe suppressed the coin‚Äôs growth. With that lawsuit now concluded, advocates argue that XRP is in a better position to attract broader interest and investment. Voices Within the Community Urge Patience Others in the XRP space have echoed Steingraber‚Äôs outlook. Crypto educator Edoardo Farina recently claimed that XRP could experience a surge in demand once Ripple announces a clear plan for the tokens currently held in escrow. According to Farina, investors who wait until then to take positions may end up buying at much higher prices. Influencer Coach JV has also weighed in, suggesting that XRP is poised to benefit from what he describes as one of the most significant wealth transfers in modern financial history. Caution or Conviction? For many investors, the core question remains: When will XRP realize the growth its advocates foresee? While early Bitcoin adopters have already reaped large profits, XRP holders continue to wait for similar results. Yet individuals like Steingraber continue to urge patience, maintaining that dismissing XRP now could mirror the same mistake people made when they overlooked Bitcoin at $3,000.

The token jumped over 6% today and has outperformed the overall crypto market this week. On-chain data from Santiment shows XRP price is gaining traction among large holders. A total of 2,742 wallets now hold at least 1 million XRP, just one short of the all-time record. At press time, XRP is priced around $2.56, up 6.15% in 24 hours and nearly 14.86% over the past week.

Ripple XRP ‚Äì Growing Institutional Demand Interest from institutions is already picking up.

If approved, these ETFs could open the doors to greater institutional access and boost overall market demand for XRP. What‚Äôs Next for XRP Price? Currently, XRP is trading near $2.58. A push above $2.60 could open the door to $3. Analyst Javon Marks sees potential for a rally toward $9.63 if momentum holds.

2025-07-11T10:30:38,"Bitcoin (BTC) Madness, Top Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, and More: Bits Recap","TL;DR BTC reached a new historic peak, with indicators signaling more upside potential. XRP confirmed a multi-year triangle breakout, while analysts predict a push to $3 or a fresh ATH. ETH climbed over 20% in a week, with some industry participants envisioning a pump to $4,000. First Time in History The primary cryptocurrency remains on the crest of the wave, with its price exploding to a new all-time high of over $118,000 just a few hours ago. Moreover, several indicators suggest that bitcoin (BTC) has more room for growth. During previous peaks in 2024, for instance, the asset‚Äôs Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio spiked beyond 2.7, while it currently stands at around 2.35. BTC MVRV, Source: CryptoQuant Furthermore, CryptoQuant revealed that the short-term holder spent output profit ratio (SOPR) does not show signs of ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù profit-taking, resulting in minimal sell pressure from such investors. The diminishing amount of BTC stored on crypto exchanges also indicates a similar thing. Over the last several months, investors have gradually shifted assets from centralized platforms to self-custody methods, as shown in the chart below. BTC Exchange Netflow, Source: CryptoQuant Somewhat expected, the crypto community is full of members envisioning further gains for BTC. X user Captain Faibik claimed the bulls are ‚Äúin complete control,‚Äù predicting a rise to $126,000. OxNobler, who previously forecasted that the ‚Äúreal bull run‚Äù would start on July 10, thinks the ‚Äúsuper-cycle is here‚Äù and argued that the valuation could explode to $300,000. XRP Pumping, too Ripple‚Äôs cross-border token has followed the green wave in the crypto market, rising to a two-month high of $2.60. Furthermore, its price appears to have confirmed a breakout from a multi-year symmetrical triangle that formed between 2018 and 2024, which could be a precursor to additional solid gains. X user Cryptoinsightuk assumed that a rise above the resistance level of $2.60 could open the door to an ascent toward $3 and then a new all-time high. At the same time, though, investors should keep an eye on some important metrics that suggest a short-term correction is not out of the cards. An example is XRP‚Äôs Relative Strength Index (RSI), which has soared to 85, or extremely overbought territory. XRP RSI, Source: CryptoWaves How About ETH? The world‚Äôs largest altcoin has posted an impressive price increase of almost 20% over the past week, currently trading well above $3,000. ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko According to numerous analysts, the rally is far from being over. X user Cipher X does not expect any ‚Äúmajor correction‚Äù until $3,300-$3,400, whereas Ted suggested that ETH‚Äôs next stop is $4,000. However, there are also some warning signals. As CryptoPotato reported , the Ethereum Foundation offloaded 1,210 ETH for 3.5 million USDC at an average price of approximately $2,890. The entity‚Äôs past sell-offs have become part of crypto‚Äôs folklore, with some noting that these actions have often preceded notable price pullbacks. There have been exceptions, of course. In November of last year, the Ethereum Foundation initiated another selling spree, but the asset‚Äôs price continued its uptrend and topped $4,000 in December.

Our collaboration also fulfills the broader vision of making IO Buenos Aires a crypto hub.‚Äù Santiago Carmuega, TxPipe‚Äôs co-founder, echoed the sentiment: ‚ÄúThis partnership shows what‚Äôs possible when mission-aligned teams come together. We‚Äôre excited to help shape the future of crypto in Latin America.‚Äù The cadence of activity is set at one event every four to six weeks, with TxPipe supplying instructors and curriculum while IOG supplies space and operational support. Both companies argue that Argentina‚Äôs combination of skilled developers, culture of digital experimentation, and high cryptocurrency adoption‚Äîfueled in part by persistent inflation‚Äîmakes the country a natural hub for Cardano-centred innovation. ‚ÄúArgentina stands out as a strategic choice for long-term Web3 investment and ecosystem growth. With a highly skilled developer base, a strong culture of digital experimentation, and ongoing economic challenges, the country presents ideal conditions for the advancement of IO‚Äôs decentralized technologies. It also ranks among the world‚Äôs leaders in cryptocurrency adoption, as citizens and residents increasingly turn to digital assets for everyday transactions and to navigate inflation,‚Äù the press release states. The partnership follows IOG‚Äôs formal inauguration of its Buenos Aires office on 21 May 2025. Notably, IOG has been nurturing technical talent in the country for some time. In September 2024 the company‚Äôs education team delivered a two-week Cardano developer course at the National Technological University (UTN) in Buenos Aires, describing it as a ‚Äúmomentous‚Äù hands-on programme that deepened ties with the local community. The project has also gained visibility at the highest political levels. Last September Hoskinson met with President Javier Milei during Tech Forum Argentina to discuss blockchain‚Äôs role in economic reform. With the TxPipe partnership now operational, IOG is amplifying a strategy that combines bricks-and-mortar presence, formal education, and community-driven events to entrench Cardano‚Äôs developer base in Latin America , beginning with Argentina.

It recently hit all-time highs (so did copper). Now, it‚Äôs Bitcoin‚Äôs turn! The benchmark cryptocurrency just blew through its old high yesterday. It rose more than 4% to around $113,700, before easing back, as you can see in the MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Bitcoin (YTD Chart) What ‚Äúcaused‚Äù the breakout? Nothing specific to the day itself. But a key long-term factor is the Trump Administration‚Äôs friendlier regulatory approach to Bitcoin and other cryptos. That‚Äôs driving an increasing amount of institutional, corporate, and ‚Äúmainstream money‚Äù into the asset class. Other drivers include: The falling US dollar. It just suffered its worst first-half decline since 1973. Trump‚Äôs trade and tariff policies. They‚Äôre upending decades-long economic and financial market relationships. US moves to seize foreign assets, particularly Russian assets after the Ukraine invasion, are leading unfriendly and other wary nations to steer money away from US markets. Increasing bets on Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. As of yesterday, rate futures markets were pricing in a 67% chance the Fed cuts rates by a quarter point at its September policy meeting.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More ‚Äî Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin‚Äôs Resilience: Exploring Its Potential in Today‚Äôs Market Bitcoin is the first and most famous cryptocurrency. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a way to send money without banks. Instead of physical coins, it uses a network of computers worldwide. These computers keep a shared record of all transactions, called a distributed ledger. Transactions are verified through mining, where miners solve puzzles and earn bitcoins. This system aims to be secure and prevent fraud. Every four years, the reward for miners is cut in half, known as ‚Äúhalving.‚Äù This limits the total number of bitcoins to 21 million. Bitcoin‚Äôs technology could change how we handle money. By cutting out banks, it provides a decentralized way to transfer value. Today, Bitcoin remains a leader among cryptocurrencies. Its limited supply and halving events can boost demand. Compared to other coins, it has the biggest network and acceptance. Market trends show Bitcoin often sets the pace in crypto. While prices can swing, many view it as digital gold. In the current market cycle, its strength and position make it worth watching. Ethereum‚Äôs Next Big Move: Is It the Crypto to Watch Right Now? Ethereum has been shaking up the crypto world since 2015. Created by Vitalik Buterin, it introduced smart contracts and a bustling ecosystem of decentralized apps (dApps). It‚Äôs known for innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon, which make transactions faster and cheaper. In 2022, Ethereum made a big shift to a Proof-of-Stake system with the Merge, making it more energy-efficient. The upcoming sharding phase aims to boost its speed and lower costs even more. Ether (ETH) is the fuel that powers it all, used for transactions, rewarding those who stake their coins, and as a valuable asset in its own right. Looking at market trends, Ethereum‚Äôs future seems promising. Predictions suggest its price could soar as high as $6,580.53 next year. By 2025, even the estimated low is $2,700.31, showing solid potential. Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum stands out for its strong technology and constant improvements. With the Bitcoin halving cycles in mind, the crypto market might be gearing up for significant growth. Ethereum‚Äôs advancements and commitment to efficiency make it an attractive option in today‚Äôs market. Its focus on making things faster and cheaper could keep it at the forefront of the crypto scene. Solana‚Äôs SOL Coin: Speeding Ahead in the Crypto Race Solana is a rising star in the world of blockchain platforms. It focuses on scalability, offering a base for decentralized applications (dapps). Competing with giants like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana sets itself apart with its speedy transactions and flexible development options. At the heart of this ecosystem is SOL, Solana‚Äôs native cryptocurrency. SOL powers transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards those who support the network. The potential of Solana lies in its high-capacity network that doesn‚Äôt rely on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it appealing for developers looking to build high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL looks attractive due to its technological advantages and growing adoption. While Ethereum struggles with high fees and slower speeds, Solana offers a faster and more cost-effective alternative. As more projects and investors turn to Solana, SOL could continue to gain value, making it a coin to watch in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion Although BTC, ETH, and SOL are performing well, XYZVerse‚Äôs pioneering memecoin unites sports fans across disciplines, aiming for 20,000% growth in the current bull market.

2025-07-11T10:22:06,"Arthur Hayes signals start of ‚Äòmonster alt season‚Äô as markets flip bullish","Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes was bearish on BTC, but with the ongoing market rally, his tune is changing. In a July 11 X post, Hayes called Bitcoin‚Äôs ( BTC ) breakout to new all-time highs a key turning point. The former BitMEX CEO had recently warned that the U.S. Treasury‚Äôs efforts to rebuild its cash balance at the Fed, known as the TGA refill, could pressure risk assets by draining liquidity from the market, dampening short-term sentiment. However, the crypto market‚Äôs sharp move higher this week appears to have invalidated those fears. ‚ÄúI was slightly bearish in my last essay due to TGA refill. What changed? $BTC busted through ATH on good volume,‚Äù he wrote. I was slightly bearish in my last essay due to TGA refill. What changed? $BTC busted through ATH on good volume $ETH is following and will outperform, get ready for a monster alt szn. Mrkt thinks Trump will TACO on tariffs, so fuck it: @MaelstromFund is backing up the truck! ‚Äî Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) July 11, 2025 While BTC led the breakout, Hayes expects Ethereum ( ETH ) to take the lead from here, aligning with the asset‚Äôs steady climb over the past few days. Historically, such momentum often precedes capital rotation into altcoins, prompting the former executive to add that the long-awaited altcoin season is near. ‚ÄúGet ready for a monster alt szn,‚Äù Hayes said. Another factor driving his outlook is improving macro sentiment. He noted that markets expect President Trump to ease tariffs, which could support global trade and boost overall market performance. The former BitMEX CEO previously said in May that BTC must cross the $110,000 mark for the altcoin season to truly kick off, and predicted the breakout to occur around June or early Q3. With that breakout now confirmed, he believes the next phase of the cycle is underway. You might also like: Bitcoin ETF inflows hit billions as BTC smashes new all-time highs Long-term, Hayes has always been bullish on Bitcoin‚Äôs future. He expects BTC to reach around $250,000 by the end of the year and sees a possible path to $1 million by the end of Trump‚Äôs current term in 2028. Hayes‚Äô altseason forecast is already playing out, with momentum building across the market. Several assets such as SEI ( SEI ), SUI ( SUI ), and HBAR ( HBAR ) have jumped between 10% and 20% over the past 24 hours, with more than 98% of altcoins already outperforming Bitcoin in the ongoing rally. While the Altcoin Season Index from CMC still leans toward Bitcoin dominance, sitting at 30/100, some analysts say the tide is already turning and that a much bigger season for the asset class is already underway.

2025-07-11T10:21:20,"Ethena jumps 25% on Upbit listing announcement, eyes a move towards $0.46","Ethena price jumped 25% on the Upbit listing announcement, edging closer to the top of its trading range and targeting a potential breakout above $0.46. Ethena ( ENA ) price is up 25% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $0.37, with trading volume surging over 300%. With this surge, ENA price has now broken above the upper trendline resistance of a descending triangle pattern that had been forming since mid-May. The descending triangle, typically a bearish continuation pattern, has instead resolved to the upside ‚Äî a bullish signal made more convincing by explosive volume that accompanied the breakout. The breakout followed a rebound from what appears to be the bottom of a months-long consolidation range between $0.24 and $0.46. If ENA can successfully reclaim and hold the ~$0.30 zone on a retest of the breakout level, it could lay the foundation for further upside towards the top of that range. Source: TradingView You might also like: Ethena stalls below key level as 40M ENA token unlock approaches The current rally appears to be driven by today‚Äôs listing on South Korea‚Äôs largest exchange by trading volume, Upbit, which added Ethena trading pairs for KRW, Bitcoin ( BTC ), and Tether ( USDT ). This follows Upbit‚Äôs recent listing of Hyperlane ( HYPER ), which has seen a 100%+ surge in a single day after the listing, and Babylon (BABY) tokens. ENA‚Äôs price rally is also likely buyoed by the broader crypto market surge, with Bitcoin breaking above $118,000 and setting a new all-time high . Ethena‚Äôs ability to hold the lower horizontal support since early April is notable, especially amid regular token unlocks . The latest unlock released over 171 million ENA tokens worth over $63 million, representing 2.7% of circulating supply. Prior to that, in June, Ethena had a massive cliff unlock of 212.5 million tokens, representing 3.72% of its unlockable supply. However, the relatively horizontal support at ~$0.24 still didn‚Äôt budge. Looking ahead, traders should watch for ENA‚Äôs ability to maintain support around $0.30 on retest of the breakout level, as holding this level could confirm momentum for a sustained move toward the $0.46 resistance and beyond.

2025-07-11T10:20:20,"Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 30: Is Bitcoin Dominance the New Reality for Crypto?","The cryptocurrency world is constantly shifting, and understanding these shifts is crucial for any investor. Currently, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at a critical juncture, signaling a period where Bitcoin‚Äôs performance is outshining the rest of the digital asset landscape. What does an index reading of 30 truly mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate the evolving crypto market ? What is the Altcoin Season Index and How Does It Define Seasons? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), is a widely referenced metric that helps investors gauge the prevailing sentiment and performance dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. As of July 11, 00:30 UTC, the index registered 30, a slight increase from the previous day but still firmly within the realm of what‚Äôs known as Bitcoin Season . This index is designed to provide a clear snapshot of market dominance. Here‚Äôs how it works: Scope: It evaluates the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. This focus ensures a clear picture of speculative asset performance. Altcoin Season Threshold: For the market to officially enter Altcoin Season , a staggering 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This signifies broad-based strength across the altcoin sector. Bitcoin Season Threshold: Conversely, when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is deemed to be in Bitcoin Season . This indicates that capital is consolidating around Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin is acting as a safe haven or primary driver of market movements. Index Range: The index itself scores from 1 to 100, providing a granular view of where the market stands on the spectrum between full Bitcoin dominance and rampant altcoin outperformance. Understanding these thresholds is vital. An index of 30, as we see now, clearly points to Bitcoin‚Äôs current ascendancy, suggesting that most altcoins are struggling to keep pace with the king cryptocurrency. Decoding Bitcoin Season: Why Bitcoin Dominates the Crypto Market When the Altcoin Season Index dips to levels like 30, it unequivocally signals a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly drives this phenomenon, and what are its implications for the broader crypto market ? Bitcoin Season often emerges during periods of market uncertainty or when institutional capital flows primarily into Bitcoin. Several factors contribute to this dominance: Flight to Safety: In volatile or uncertain macroeconomic environments, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset within the crypto space compared to the more speculative altcoins. Its larger market cap, longer track record, and perceived store-of-value narrative make it a preferred choice. Institutional Interest: Major institutional players and corporations often gain exposure to the crypto space primarily through Bitcoin due to its liquidity and established regulatory pathways (e.g., Bitcoin ETFs). This concentrated demand can pull capital away from altcoins. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin‚Äôs programmatic supply reductions (halvings) historically precede significant price appreciation, leading to increased focus and investment in BTC. The anticipation and realization of these events can trigger a Bitcoin-centric rally. Reduced Risk Appetite: When overall market sentiment is cautious, investors tend to reduce exposure to higher-risk assets like many altcoins, opting for Bitcoin‚Äôs relative stability. During a Bitcoin Season , you‚Äôll typically observe Bitcoin‚Äôs price holding strong or appreciating, while many altcoins either stagnate or decline against BTC. This doesn‚Äôt mean altcoins can‚Äôt have individual rallies, but broadly, they struggle to outperform Bitcoin‚Äôs percentage gains over a sustained period. Historical Perspective: We‚Äôve seen periods of strong Bitcoin dominance following major market corrections or during accumulation phases prior to significant bull runs. These periods are crucial for Bitcoin to consolidate its position and attract new capital before it potentially spills over into the altcoin market. When Will Altcoin Season Return? Spotting Emerging Cryptocurrency Trends The burning question on many investors‚Äô minds is: When will the pendulum swing back towards Altcoin Season ? While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin dominance, understanding the triggers for a shift is key to identifying emerging cryptocurrency trends . What Triggers Altcoin Season? Altcoin Season typically doesn‚Äôt just happen overnight. It‚Äôs often the result of a confluence of factors: Bitcoin Stability or Sideways Movement: A common precursor is when Bitcoin‚Äôs price stabilizes or enters a consolidation phase after a significant rally. This allows capital that flowed into BTC to look for higher returns in altcoins. Capital Rotation: As Bitcoin‚Äôs gains slow, investors often rotate profits from BTC into altcoins, seeking higher percentage returns. This ‚Äúrisk-on‚Äù appetite fuels altcoin rallies. New Narratives and Technological Breakthroughs: The emergence of compelling new blockchain technologies, DeFi innovations, NFTs, GameFi, or other strong narratives can draw significant attention and capital into specific altcoin sectors, sparking broader interest. Increased Retail Participation: Altcoin seasons are often characterized by heightened retail investor interest and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), as smaller, lesser-known coins show parabolic gains. Improved Macroeconomic Conditions: A generally positive global economic outlook can increase investor confidence across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, leading to greater risk-taking. Benefits of Altcoin Season: Explosive Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can offer significantly higher percentage returns than Bitcoin during these periods. Diversification: A healthy altcoin market allows investors to diversify their portfolios beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Innovation Showcase: Altcoin season often highlights the innovative spirit of the crypto space, bringing attention to new projects and technologies. Challenges and Risks: Extreme Volatility: While offering high rewards, altcoins are notoriously volatile, with prices capable of crashing just as quickly as they rise. Increased Scam Risk: Periods of heightened speculation also attract bad actors, leading to more rug pulls, pump-and-dump schemes, and fraudulent projects. Liquidity Issues: Smaller altcoins can suffer from low liquidity, making it difficult to enter or exit positions without significant price impact. Spotting these emerging cryptocurrency trends requires diligent research, staying updated on project developments, and understanding market sentiment beyond just price charts. Navigating the Current Crypto Market: Strategies for Bitcoin Season Given the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 30, we are clearly in a period where Bitcoin Season reigns supreme. How can investors best position themselves and manage their portfolios during this phase of the crypto market ? Strategies for a Bitcoin-Dominant Market: During Bitcoin Season , a focus on accumulation and risk management is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC): If you believe in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value proposition, a Bitcoin Season presents an opportunity to accumulate more BTC, especially if altcoins are underperforming. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can be an effective strategy here. Research and Identify Future Altcoin Gems: Use this period of relative altcoin quietness to conduct thorough research. Look for projects with strong fundamentals, active development, clear use cases, and solid communities. These could be the outperformers when Altcoin Season eventually returns. Stablecoin Parking: For those who prefer to wait out volatility or are unsure about current market direction, parking funds in stablecoins can preserve capital until clearer opportunities arise. Risk Management and Portfolio Rebalancing: Review your portfolio‚Äôs exposure to altcoins. If you‚Äôve been heavily invested in altcoins that are now underperforming, consider rebalancing to reduce risk. This might involve selling some altcoins for BTC or stablecoins. Focus on Education: Use this time to deepen your understanding of blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and other emerging sectors. Knowledge is power, especially in a rapidly evolving market. Preparing for the Next Altcoin Season: While we are in Bitcoin Season , smart investors are always looking ahead. When the signs of an impending Altcoin Season begin to appear (e.g., Bitcoin dominance falling, strong performance from a broad range of altcoins against BTC), you might consider: Strategic Altcoin Allocation: Gradually reallocate a portion of your portfolio into carefully researched altcoins. Profit-Taking Strategies: Have a plan for taking profits as altcoins rise, especially given their volatility. Staying Agile: The crypto market moves fast. Be prepared to adapt your strategies as new cryptocurrency trends emerge. The key is not to be caught off guard. Understanding the current market phase allows for proactive, rather than reactive, decision-making. Is the Altcoin Season Index a Crystal Ball for Cryptocurrency Trends? The Altcoin Season Index offers a valuable snapshot of the crypto market , but is it a definitive predictor of future cryptocurrency trends ? While highly useful, it‚Äôs important to understand its limitations. Strengths of the Index: Simplicity and Clarity: It provides a straightforward, easy-to-understand metric for the overall health of the altcoin market relative to Bitcoin. Data-Driven: Based on verifiable price data from CoinMarketCap, it offers an objective assessment. Widely Recognized: Its prominence makes it a common language for discussing market cycles among crypto enthusiasts and analysts. Limitations and Nuances: Backward-Looking: The 90-day lookback period means the index reflects past performance, not necessarily immediate future movements. It confirms a trend rather than predicting its inception. Top 100 Bias: While covering a significant portion of the market, it doesn‚Äôt account for the performance of smaller, micro-cap altcoins, which can sometimes lead rallies. Market Cap Differences: A 10% gain for a large-cap altcoin is very different from a 10% gain for a micro-cap, yet the index treats them equally in terms of ‚Äúoutperformance.‚Äù Not a Guarantee: The index is an indicator, not a guarantee. Even in Bitcoin Season, individual altcoins can perform well due to specific news or developments. Conversely, a high index doesn‚Äôt mean every altcoin will pump. Excludes Stablecoins: While logical for measuring speculative performance, it means the index doesn‚Äôt capture the significant role stablecoins play in capital flows and market sentiment. Therefore, while the Altcoin Season Index is an excellent tool for understanding the current market phase, it should be used in conjunction with other technical analysis, fundamental research, and broader macroeconomic indicators to form a comprehensive view of cryptocurrency trends . It helps answer ‚Äúwhere are we now?‚Äù more than ‚Äúwhere are we going next?‚Äù Conclusion The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 30 clearly places the crypto market in a dominant Bitcoin Season . This period, characterized by Bitcoin‚Äôs outperformance, presents unique opportunities and challenges for investors. While altcoins may be taking a backseat, this is a crucial time for strategic accumulation, diligent research into future projects, and robust risk management. Understanding these cyclical shifts ‚Äì from Bitcoin Season to Altcoin Season and back ‚Äì is fundamental to navigating the volatile world of digital assets. By staying informed about the Altcoin Season Index and other key cryptocurrency trends , investors can make more informed decisions, position their portfolios effectively, and potentially capitalize on the next major market move.

2025-07-11T10:16:13,"Cardano price prediction: How high can ADA get this month?","Cardano price staged a strong rally on Friday, reaching its highest level since June 11. It has jumped in the last four consecutive days, mirroring the performance of the broader crypto market. This article explores what to expect in the coming weeks. Cardano price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the ADA price bottomed at $0.5085 and then bounced back. Its lowest level this week coincided with the lowest point in April this year, meaning that it has formed a double-bottom pattern. A double bottom is one of the most common bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. It has now moved above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). More technical indicators point to more gains in the coming weeks. For example, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has continued rising as it remains above 20. The token has moved above the Ichimoku cloud and the Supertrend. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for Cardano is bullish, with the next point to watch being at $0.8360, the neckline of the double-bottom pattern. A move above that resistance level will point to more gains, potentially to the psychological point at $1. A move below the support level at $0.60 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Cardano price chart | Source: TradingView Why ADA price is surging There are a few reasons why Cardano price is in a strong bull run. First, the rally has coincided with the ongoing Bitcoin price surge . Bitcoin soared to $118,000 for the first ever, and analysts expect the trend to continue. Bitcoin has soared because of the rising demand from American investors, who have piled into their ETFs. Cumulative ETF inflows soared to a record high of over $50 billion, with the IBIT ETF‚Äôs assets jumping to over $80 billion. This trend means that this fund will soon surpass the 20-year-old GLD ETF . Cardano price has also jumped as data points to a rebound of some of its assets. For example, Snek, the biggest meme coin in the ecosystem has continued soaring this week, with its market capitalization jumping to over $200 million. More data shows that the decentralized exchange (DEX) volume in Cardano has jumped to the highest point in over a week. Still, Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem is significantly smaller than other blockchains. Further, there are signs that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the spot ADA ETFs later this year. Such a move will lead to more inflows in the coming months. For example, spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs inflows have jumped sharply in the past few months. Cardano‚Äôs futures open interest has continued rising, a sign of rising demand among investors. Meanwhile, Cardano is preparing the upcoming Glacier airdrop, where its holders will receive NIGHT tokens.

2025-07-11T10:03:14,"Australia‚Äôs Tasmania Joins Nationwide Crackdown on Crypto ATMs as Scam Losses Hit $1.6 Million","Tasmania has become the latest Australian state to intensify efforts against crypto ATM scams after police revealed that the top 15 crypto ATM users in the region lost a combined AUD 2.5 million (around USD 1.6 million) to fraudsters. Key Takeaways: Tasmania cracks down on crypto ATM scams after top users lost AUD 2.5 million to fraudsters. Scammers pressure victims to use crypto ATMs once banks flag suspicious transactions. Australia‚Äôs crypto ATM network has surged to nearly 1,900 machines, making it the third-largest globally. Nearly a quarter of that amount, approximately AUD 592,000, was deposited directly into cryptocurrency ATMs, according to Tasmania Police Cyber Investigations . The move follows a national enforcement initiative led by the Australian Federal Police and the financial intelligence agency AUSTRAC, aimed at curbing criminal exploitation of crypto ATMs across the country. Scammers Push Victims to Use Crypto ATMs in Tasmania Detectives report that scammers often pressure victims into using crypto ATMs after traditional financial institutions flag suspicious transactions. ‚ÄúVictims are being manipulated, intimidated, and pressured into investing in fake investment and romance scams,‚Äù said Detective Sergeant Paul Turner. He warned that many of these scams involve large sums and can have devastating long-term effects on victims, including financial ruin and dependence on government support. ‚ÄúIf you are asked to deposit cash into a cryptocurrency ATM by someone you‚Äôve never met in person, or the offer comes with a high-pressure deadline or urgent tone, then it is likely a scam,‚Äù Turner said. AUSTRAC has recently introduced new rules and transaction limits for crypto ATM operators, effective June 3, to better fight scams. Crypto also remains a top priority for the agency heading into 2025. Tasmania‚Äôs crypto ATM network has grown rapidly, from just one machine in 2021 to over 20 today. Coin ATM Radar data confirms 24 machines in the state. Where in the world is #Bitcoin most accessible? Here are the top countries with the most Bitcoin ATMs: USA ‚Äì 30,780 Canada ‚Äì 3,062 Australia ‚Äì 1,389 Spain ‚Äì 276 Poland ‚Äì 219 Slovenia ‚Äì 80 #Crypto adoption is on the rise! pic.twitter.com/sleyKOqkc5 ‚Äî Biconomy.com (@BiconomyCom) June 16, 2025 Nationwide, Australia ranks third globally for Bitcoin and crypto ATMs, trailing only the US and Canada, with nearly 1,900 units, up sharply from 67 a year ago. Major operators include Localcoin, Coinflip, and Bitcoin Depot. More Countries Clamp Down on Crypto ATMs Internationally, authorities are also cracking down on crypto ATM misuse. Last week, New Zealand banned crypto ATMs and restricted international cash transfers to combat money laundering. In Australia, AUSTRAC recently introduced stricter rules for crypto ATM operators, including tighter cash limits and monitoring. Last month, the regulator refused to renew the registration of a local crypto ATM operator , Harro‚Äôs Empires. The agency placed operating conditions, including transaction limits, on them. In the US, Spokane, Washington, has banned crypto ATMs entirely , citing their use in scams targeting vulnerable residents. Lawmakers in the US Senate are also attempting to tighten laws on a state and local level, with one attempt led by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin. He has introduced the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act, which would bring in legislative measures designed to protect the public ‚Äî while attempting to limit inconvenience for law-abiding users. New users would be prevented from spending more than $2,000 a day at one of these machines, rising to $10,000 in a 14-day period.

2025-07-11T10:00:50,"Crypto thief gets 12 years in prison over unpaid $20 million","A judge has dramatically increased the prison sentence of convicted crypto thief Nicholas Truglia¬†to 12 years, citing his failure to repay $20.4 million¬†owed to his victim. Initially, the crypto scammer received an 18-month sentence for his role in a $22 million cryptocurrency theft scheme. US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, who ordered both sentences, told Truglia in the last hearing, ‚ÄúYou paid not a cent, not one cent.‚Äù Truglia joined a group of hackers to launder stolen assets On Thursday, Judge Hellerstein issued the new sentence after he found Truglia willfully breached his commitment to repay what he promised. However, Mark Gombiner, Truglia‚Äôs lawyer, argued before Judge Hellerstein that the resentence was unlawful and represented an extreme misuse of judicial discretion. The lawyer has pledged to appeal. Truglia was first sentenced in 2021, after he pleaded guilty to his part in the theft scheme. He was part of a group of so-called ‚Äúevil computer geniuses‚Äù who deceived telecom workers into switching victims‚Äô phone numbers to SIM cards they controlled. The group targeted Michael Terpin, CEO and founder of Transform Group, a PR consultancy for blockchain firms. They drained his crypto accounts and hired Truglia to convert the stolen assets into Bitcoin. At his first sentencing, the court learned that Truglia held $53 million worth of assets spanning crypto, fine art, and luxury jewelry. In a court filing, however, Gombiner claimed that his client had ‚Äúgiven up every asset he could access,‚Äù including the entire balance of his Wells Fargo & Co. account. Truglia also claimed that most of his assets were locked in an inaccessible Bitcoin wallet and maintained that he would settle his debts if he could access the funds. Terpin, who joined the hearing by phone, dismissed Truglia‚Äôs explanation as ‚Äúa giant smoke screen.‚Äù The judge also criticized Truglia‚Äôs extravagant way of living, arguing that he lived in luxury even without a job. Illicit crypto volume nearly hit $45 billion in 2024 Meanwhile, the crypto industry is still plagued by cybercrime. TRM Labs estimates that the illicit crypto volume was as high as $44.7 billion in 2024. According to their data, the TRON blockchain accounted for the majority of that activity‚Äî58%‚Äîfollowed by Ethereum 24%, Bitcoin 12%, and Binance Smart Chain and Polygon at 3% each. Despite leading in illicit activity, TRON experienced the steepest drop in illicit volume among all blockchains analyzed ‚Äî a $6 billion decline from 2023. Nearly half of the tokens‚Äô illicit volume was linked to sanctioned entities, and around 32% involved blocklisted funds. Overall, sanctioned entities accounted for the largest portion of illicit crypto volume, despite a 33% year-over-year decline in inflows. Over 85% of crypto inflows to sanctioned actors and regions were funneled through Garantex and Nobitex, the leading exchanges in Russia and Iran, respectively. However, both saw a drop in overall activity. Additionally, there were about 5,635 publicly reported attacks in 2024, surpassing 5,223 in 2023. Ransomware payouts also hit new heights, including a record $75‚ÄØmillion paid to the Dark Angels gang in March 2024. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-11T10:00:43,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating the Market‚Äôs ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô Zone with Wisdom","Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? The latest update from Alternative, the software development platform behind the popular Crypto Fear & Greed Index , shows the market is holding steady in a familiar place. As of July 11, the index remains unchanged at 71, firmly positioned within the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. But what does this really mean for you, the everyday crypto enthusiast or seasoned investor? Let‚Äôs dive deeper into this crucial indicator and understand how to navigate the current market landscape. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it‚Äôs a barometer for the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 (representing ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô) to 100 (indicating ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô), this index provides a snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly optimistic and euphoric, or gripped by panic and uncertainty. Its core purpose is to help investors understand if the market is behaving rationally or if emotions are taking over, which often precedes significant price movements. A low score suggests investors are too worried, potentially signaling a buying opportunity as assets might be undervalued due to widespread panic. Conversely, a high score, like our current 71, indicates that investors are getting too greedy, which can often be a precursor to a market correction. The index aims to counteract our natural human tendency to buy when prices are high (due to FOMO ‚Äì Fear Of Missing Out) and sell when prices are low (due to panic). Deconstructing Crypto Market Sentiment: How Does the Index Work? Understanding the index requires a look under the hood at the various factors that contribute to its calculation. The index doesn‚Äôt rely on a single metric but rather aggregates data from six key sources, each weighted differently to provide a holistic view of Crypto Market Sentiment . This multi-faceted approach helps to capture the complex interplay of forces driving investor behavior. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the components: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially sudden downward movements, often indicates fear in the market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values. Strong, sustained buying volume and upward price movements typically point towards greed. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, primarily Twitter, for keywords related to cryptocurrencies. It then processes the volume and sentiment of these posts. A surge in positive sentiment or specific, highly engaged discussions can indicate growing market excitement or greed. Surveys (15%): This component involves weekly polls where users are asked about their perception of the crypto market. While a significant contributor, this factor is currently paused, meaning the other components carry more weight in the interim. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin Dominance refers to Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety (investors moving out of altcoins into Bitcoin), which can be a sign of fear, or it can simply reflect strong Bitcoin performance. Google Trends (10%): This analyzes search query data for Bitcoin-related terms on Google. A sudden spike in search interest for terms like ‚ÄúBitcoin price manipulation‚Äù or ‚ÄúBitcoin bubble‚Äù might indicate fear, while searches for ‚Äúbuy Bitcoin‚Äù or ‚ÄúBitcoin rally‚Äù could suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index attempts to provide a nuanced yet easily digestible representation of the prevailing market mood. Understanding the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô Zone: What Does 71 Mean for Investors? With the index holding steady at 71, we are clearly in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. This reading suggests that investors are generally optimistic, perhaps even euphoric, about the market‚Äôs prospects. While optimism can fuel rallies, extreme greed often signals that prices might be overextended and due for a correction. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded significant market pullbacks, as the ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô begins to take profits while retail investors are still buying. Being in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone means: Increased FOMO: Many investors might be feeling the pressure to buy in, fearing they will miss out on further gains. This can lead to irrational decision-making. Potential for Overvaluation: Assets may be trading at prices higher than their fundamental value, driven by speculative demand rather than intrinsic worth. Risk of Correction: When everyone is bullish, there are fewer new buyers to push prices higher, making the market vulnerable to a downturn. A shift from greed to fear can happen rapidly. It‚Äôs a crucial time for investors to exercise caution and avoid getting swept up in the collective euphoria. Remember the old adage: ‚ÄúBe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù Navigating Market Volatility: Strategies for Prudent Investment The very nature of the crypto market is its inherent Market Volatility . The Fear & Greed Index, by incorporating volatility as a key component, acknowledges this characteristic. While volatility can be intimidating, understanding how to navigate it, especially when the market is in a state of greed, is essential for long-term success. The current index reading suggests that while prices may be trending upwards, the underlying volatility could still be significant, and sudden shifts are always possible. Here are some strategies to consider: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a large lump sum at potentially inflated prices, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the market‚Äôs current state. This strategy helps average out your purchase price over time and reduces the risk associated with market timing. Take Partial Profits: If you‚Äôve seen significant gains, consider taking a portion of your profits off the table. This allows you to secure gains and de-risk your portfolio without completely exiting the market. Set Stop-Loss Orders: For active traders, setting stop-loss orders can help limit potential losses if the market suddenly reverses course. Rebalance Your Portfolio: When certain assets perform exceptionally well, they might become a disproportionately large part of your portfolio. Rebalancing involves selling some of the high performers and reallocating funds to underperforming assets or stablecoins, bringing your portfolio back to your desired risk profile. Research Beyond Sentiment: While sentiment is important, always combine it with thorough fundamental and technical analysis. Don‚Äôt let the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading be your sole reason for making investment decisions. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Overall Market Health As one of the six factors, Bitcoin Dominance plays a subtle yet significant role in the overall Fear & Greed Index. Bitcoin, being the first and largest cryptocurrency, often sets the tone for the broader market. When Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is high, it can mean that investors are consolidating into BTC, possibly as a ‚Äòsafe haven‚Äô during uncertain times (fear), or simply because Bitcoin is leading a strong market rally (greed). Conversely, a declining Bitcoin dominance often signals an ‚Äòaltcoin season,‚Äô where capital flows from Bitcoin into various altcoins, indicating higher risk appetite and speculative ‚Äògreed‚Äô for potentially larger gains. The index takes this into account to gauge whether the market‚Äôs optimism is broad-based across all cryptocurrencies or more concentrated in Bitcoin. A high index reading coupled with rising Bitcoin dominance could imply strong institutional interest or a general flight to quality within the crypto space, even amidst overall ‚Äògreed.‚Äô Challenges and Actionable Insights: Using the Index Wisely While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool, it‚Äôs not a crystal ball. Its primary challenge lies in its nature as a sentiment indicator, which can be subjective and doesn‚Äôt account for every market variable. It should be used as a complementary tool, not as the sole basis for investment decisions. Actionable Insights for Investors: Understand its Limitations: The index reflects market emotion, not necessarily market fundamentals or future price action. External events, regulatory changes, or technological breakthroughs can quickly shift sentiment regardless of the index‚Äôs current reading. Combine with Other Analysis: Always pair the index‚Äôs insights with your own research into project fundamentals, technical analysis of price charts, and broader macroeconomic trends. Practice Emotional Discipline: The index is a powerful reminder to counter your innate biases. When it‚Äôs high, resist the urge to buy into hype. When it‚Äôs low, look for opportunities that others are too scared to seize. Develop a Strategy: Have a clear investment strategy that outlines your entry and exit points, risk tolerance, and diversification goals. The index can then serve as a useful prompt to re-evaluate your adherence to this strategy. Conclusion: Mastering Your Crypto Journey with Sentiment Awareness The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently hovering at 71 in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, offers a fascinating glimpse into the collective psyche of the crypto market. It serves as a vital reminder that emotions, not just logic, play a significant role in price movements. By understanding its components ‚Äì from Market Volatility and Bitcoin Dominance to social media chatter ‚Äì you gain a deeper appreciation for the forces at play. While the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading suggests caution, it also highlights a period of strong investor confidence. The key is to leverage this insight to make informed, rational decisions, rather than being swayed by the prevailing emotional tide. Use the index as a guide to cultivate emotional discipline, manage your risks effectively, and build a resilient investment strategy that can withstand the inevitable ups and downs of the dynamic crypto world. Your journey in cryptocurrency will be far more rewarding when guided by wisdom, not just widespread sentiment.

2025-07-11T10:00:08,"Crypto News: Bitcoin (BTC) Surges to $109,336 on ETF Inflows, but This $0.03 Token Could Hit $0.60 by September","Bitcoin (BTC) has stormed to a new all-time high of $109,336, powered by massive ETF inflows that signal growing institutional interest. While BTC remains the undisputed king of crypto, most investors already holding it are now asking the big question: where‚Äôs the next 20x return going to come from? One answer gaining attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äîa rapidly growing decentralized finance protocol that‚Äôs still available at a presale price of just $0.03. In Phase 5 of its rollout, the project has already raised over $12 million and has a community of more than 13,000 holders. With 68% of the current phase already sold and the token price set to rise to $0.035 next, many seasoned crypto investors are moving quickly to secure a stake. Notably, some of these investors are BTC whales who‚Äôve started diversifying into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in search of exponential growth. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Surge While Mutuum Offers A Smarter Use for Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) surged 2.2% over the past week, reaching $109,336 with a $2.07T market cap, driven by $407.78M in daily ETF inflows on July 2, marking 16 consecutive days of positive flows. Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC led with $183.96M, boosting institutional adoption, with 6.3% of BTC supply in ETFs. A bullish engulfing candle and Texas‚Äôs $1B BTC reserve expansion signal a 1.3x rally to $140K, supported by posts on X noting $1.2B in whale losses absorbed by dip buyers. However, DXY strength and a 4.7% rate cut probability risk a pullback to $105K if $110,900 resistance holds. Bitcoin (BTC)‚Äôs utility as a store of value grows, with 730K active addresses and $14B in ETF inflows since April. While the world watches BTC break new highs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making it easier for holders to do more with their crypto. Rather than just sitting on assets like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), users will soon be able to borrow against them through Mutuum‚Äôs non-custodial lending protocol. The platform supports two lending models: Peer-to-Peer (P2P), where users lend directly to each other with full control over terms, and Peer-to-Contract (P2C), where users deposit assets into lending pools to earn variable yield. To make this even more efficient, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will integrate a Layer-2 solution‚Äîhelping users avoid high gas fees while enabling fast execution. This is particularly important for retail lenders and borrowers who want to stay nimble and cost-effective, especially as markets continue to move quickly. Beyond the core lending mechanics, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also features the introduction of mtTokens‚Äîyield-bearing assets that represent deposits into the protocol. These mtTokens will accumulate interest automatically and can be staked in special smart contracts for even greater rewards. This unlocks a sustainable dividend system, backed by platform revenue and reinforced through planned buyback initiatives. The next major milestone is the beta launch of the lending platform, which will give early adopters direct access to test its features. To celebrate this stage, Mutuum has announced a $100,000 giveaway for early participants‚Äîawarding ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Analyst Targets $0.60‚Äî20x from Today‚Äôs Price Analysts who predicted BTC‚Äôs breakout in 2020 are now eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the highest-upside projects in the current DeFi cycle. With a presale price of $0.03 and a planned listing at $0.06, investors entering now are already in line for a 100% gain at launch. But that‚Äôs just the beginning. One market expert has issued a forecast that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could reach $0.60 by September 2026‚Äîa full 20x from today‚Äôs price. This is based on the project‚Äôs unique blend of utility, smart contract architecture, scalable roadmap, and growing investor demand. The forecast is not a shot in the dark: the same analyst successfully called the major breakout for BTC in late 2020 and recognized AAVE‚Äôs trajectory in its early days. At a time when top-tier tokens like BTC offer stability but limited short-term upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a compelling case for exponential gains‚Äîwith real DeFi use cases, fully-audited security from CertiK, and a tokenomics structure that rewards both lending activity and early participation. With Phase 5 nearly 70% sold and the price set to jump to $0.035, the window to buy in at $0.03 is closing fast. In a market where timing makes all the difference, smart capital is already shifting. While BTC celebrates its new high, the next 20x play might already be hiding in plain sight‚Äîand it‚Äôs called Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

The breakout follows sustained accumulation, reduced exchange supply, and bullish momentum building over key resistance levels. Supportive U.S. policies, including moves toward a national Bitcoin reserve, have added fuel to the rally. Meanwhile, macroeconomic shifts like a weaker dollar and expectations of easing interest rates have strengthened Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a hedge, setting the stage for potential continued upside. Institutional Demand Powers the Surge A major catalyst behind Bitcoin‚Äôs price explosion is the surge in institutional interest. Over the past few weeks, spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded billions in net inflows, reflecting strong demand from both retail and professional investors. Asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck have become dominant market players, adding legitimacy and driving capital into BTC. This is not only absorbing existing supply but also reducing the available float, creating a bullish supply-demand imbalance. On-chain data shows a consistent outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges, indicating that more holders are moving their assets to cold storage rather than keeping them available for trading. This pattern is consistent with long-term accumulation phases seen in previous bull runs. As the ETF narrative matures and institutional FOMO (fear of missing out) kicks in, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a digital store of value is gaining momentum, contributing to a sustained price appreciation. Macro Tailwinds & Technical Triggers Align Global macroeconomic conditions have also played a pivotal role in Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout. As central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, signal a potential shift toward interest rate cuts, investor appetite for alternative assets like Bitcoin has surged. A weakening U.S. dollar and rising concerns around long-term inflation have made BTC an attractive hedge. Simultaneously, technical price action has confirmed a strong bullish structure, with Bitcoin consistently breaking through major resistance levels, triggering liquidations of leveraged short positions. The BTC price has reached the final barrier before entering a strong discovery phase. Currently, the price trades within the discovery phase but carries the possibility of a pullback. However, a rise above the range could invalidate the bearish possibilities for a while. The RSI is yet to enter the overbought range, which suggests the token has more bullish potential. Therefore, a rise above the range may push the price to around $130K, which could be the new high for the current bull run. Collectively, recent data suggests that over $300 million worth of shorts were wiped out in a single day, amplifying the rally. Additionally, the psychological impact of reclaiming previous highs has reignited retail enthusiasm, drawing new participants into the market. The alignment of favorable macro conditions and internal market mechanics suggests that this move is not merely speculative but rather the foundation of a broader, more sustained bull cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-reaches-118k-milestone-heres-what-could-drive-prices-even-higher/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-11T09:50:35,"Trump Tariffs: Unleashing a Global Economic Challenge","The financial world is abuzz with breaking news: former U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly planning to impose blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% on imported goods if he returns to office. This significant policy shift, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, citing NBC News, has sent ripples of speculation across markets. For those of us deeply invested in the cryptocurrency market , understanding the potential fallout of such a move is paramount. Will this be a catalyst for digital assets, or will it simply add to the broader economic uncertainty? Trump Tariffs: What‚Äôs on the Table? Donald Trump‚Äôs potential return to the White House brings with it a familiar, yet intensified, approach to international commerce: aggressive protectionism. The proposed blanket tariffs, ranging from 15% to 20% on all imported goods, represent a significant escalation from his previous trade policies. During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs on specific goods like steel and aluminum, and engaged in a high-profile trade war with China. This new proposal, however, suggests a far broader and more sweeping application. Blanket Application: Unlike targeted tariffs, a ‚Äòblanket‚Äô approach means virtually all goods entering the U.S. would be subject to these new levies, regardless of their origin or type. Significant Percentage: A 15-20% tariff is substantial, designed to drastically increase the cost of foreign goods and incentivize domestic production. Economic Philosophy: This policy aligns with an ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô economic strategy, aiming to reduce trade deficits and bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The implications of such a policy are far-reaching, touching every aspect of the economy from consumer prices to corporate supply chains, and inevitably, the global financial landscape. The Broad Economic Impact: Who Pays the Price? When discussing economic impact , tariffs often lead to a complex web of consequences that extend far beyond border fees. While the stated goal of tariffs is to protect domestic industries and jobs, the reality is often more nuanced, with costs ultimately passed down to consumers and businesses alike. Potential Economic Ramifications: Inflationary Pressures: Imported goods become more expensive. U.S. businesses that rely on imported components or finished products will face higher costs, which they are likely to pass on to consumers in the form of higher prices. This can fuel domestic inflation, eroding purchasing power. Supply Chain Disruptions: Global supply chains are intricately linked. Imposing blanket tariffs could force companies to re-evaluate or reconfigure their sourcing strategies, potentially leading to delays, increased operational costs, and reduced efficiency. This might encourage ‚Äòreshoring‚Äô but at a potentially significant short-term cost. Reduced Consumer Spending: Higher prices for goods and services, coupled with potential wage stagnation if businesses struggle, could lead to a decline in overall consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic growth. Corporate Profitability: Companies, especially those heavily reliant on international trade or imported materials, could see their profit margins squeezed. This might lead to lower earnings, impacting stock valuations and investment decisions. Job Market Shifts: While some domestic manufacturing sectors might see a boost, others reliant on affordable imports or export markets could face job losses. The overall effect on employment is often debated and highly dependent on the specific industry and market response. Who Wins and Who Loses? Potential Beneficiaries Potential Disadvantaged Certain domestic manufacturers (if they can scale up efficiently) Consumers (higher prices, reduced choice) U.S. government (tariff revenue, though often offset by economic slowdown) Import-reliant businesses (retailers, some tech firms) Sectors with strong domestic supply chains Export-oriented U.S. industries (due to retaliatory tariffs) International trading partners (reduced access to U.S. market) Navigating Global Trade: A New Era of Protectionism? The prospect of significant new import duties raises critical questions about the future of global trade . Trump‚Äôs previous tariffs sparked retaliatory measures from countries like China and the European Union, leading to a period of heightened trade tensions. A blanket tariff policy would almost certainly provoke a similar, if not more aggressive, response from major trading partners. Key Considerations for Global Trade: Retaliatory Tariffs: Other nations are highly likely to impose their own tariffs on U.S. exports, making American goods more expensive abroad and harming U.S. industries that rely on international markets (e.g., agriculture, technology). Weakening International Institutions: Such unilateral actions could further undermine the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other multilateral trade agreements, leading to a more fragmented and less predictable global trading system. Shift Towards Regionalization: Countries might increasingly look to form regional trade blocs and diversify their supply chains away from reliance on the U.S. market, accelerating a trend away from globalized production. Increased Geopolitical Tensions: Trade disputes can easily spill over into broader diplomatic and geopolitical conflicts, impacting international relations and stability. The global economy thrives on predictability and open markets. A widespread tariff regime could inject significant uncertainty, discouraging cross-border investment and innovation. How Import Duties Could Ripple Through Traditional Markets The direct consequences of these potential import duties will undoubtedly send shockwaves through traditional financial markets. Investors in stocks, bonds, and commodities will need to brace for increased volatility and re-evaluate their portfolios. Market-Specific Impacts: Stock Markets: Expect heightened volatility. Sectors heavily reliant on imported goods (e.g., retail, consumer electronics) could face headwinds due to higher costs and reduced consumer demand. Conversely, some domestic manufacturing or raw materials sectors might see initial gains, but these could be offset by broader economic slowdowns or retaliatory tariffs. Bond Markets: A ‚Äòflight to safety‚Äô could occur, driving demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, potentially lowering yields. However, if inflation becomes a significant concern, bond yields might rise to compensate for eroded purchasing power. Currency Markets: The U.S. Dollar (USD) might initially strengthen as capital flows into the U.S. seeking safety, or as foreign companies pay more for U.S. goods (if exports are not severely hit). However, persistent trade deficits or economic slowdowns could eventually weaken the dollar. Commodities: Prices for raw materials could fluctuate. If global economic growth slows due to trade wars, demand for industrial commodities might fall. Agricultural commodities could be particularly vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs. Investors should prepare for a period of uncertainty, with a greater emphasis on defensive assets and careful sector analysis. The Cryptocurrency Market: A Safe Haven or a Stormy Sea? Now, let‚Äôs turn our attention to what matters most to our readers: the cryptocurrency market . How might a significant shift in U.S. trade policy, leading to potential economic instability, impact digital assets? Arguments for Crypto as a Safe Haven: Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate outside the traditional financial system, making them less susceptible to direct governmental policy changes or the stability of a single nation‚Äôs economy. Inflation Hedge: If widespread tariffs lead to significant inflation and devalue fiat currencies, some argue that Bitcoin, with its capped supply, could act as a hedge, similar to ‚Äòdigital gold.‚Äô Flight to Quality: In times of global economic uncertainty and traditional market volatility, investors might seek alternative assets, potentially driving demand for cryptocurrencies. Increased Adoption: If traditional banking and payment systems become more cumbersome or expensive due to trade friction, the efficiency and borderless nature of crypto transactions could gain appeal. Arguments for Crypto Volatility and Correlation: Market Correlation: Despite its decentralized nature, the crypto market has shown increasing correlation with traditional equity markets, particularly tech stocks. A downturn in global equities could drag crypto prices down. Reduced Disposable Income: If consumers face higher prices and economic hardship, discretionary spending on speculative assets like crypto might decrease. Regulatory Scrutiny: Periods of economic stress often lead to increased regulatory scrutiny across all financial sectors, including crypto, which could introduce new uncertainties. Liquidity Concerns: In a widespread market panic, even crypto could face liquidity challenges as investors rush to cash out. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors: Monitor Macro Trends: Pay close attention to inflation data, interest rate decisions, and global trade developments. Diversify Wisely: Consider a balanced portfolio that includes both established assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside stablecoins for capital preservation. Understand Correlations: Be aware that while crypto offers diversification benefits, it‚Äôs not entirely immune to traditional market movements. Long-Term Vision: For long-term holders, short-term volatility might present accumulation opportunities. The overall impact on crypto will likely be complex, a mix of direct and indirect effects. While its decentralized nature offers a unique appeal during economic turbulence, its increasing integration into the broader financial landscape means it won‚Äôt be entirely insulated. Challenges and Opportunities: Navigating the New Economic Landscape The potential implementation of blanket tariffs presents a dual landscape of significant challenges and emerging opportunities. The challenges are clear: increased inflation, supply chain disruptions, potential trade wars, and market volatility. Businesses will need to adapt quickly, re-evaluating sourcing strategies and potentially absorbing higher costs or passing them to consumers. However, opportunities may also arise. Domestic industries could experience a resurgence, leading to job creation in specific sectors. Innovation in supply chain management and logistics might accelerate. For the crypto world, this could be a moment for digital assets to prove their mettle as alternative stores of value or efficient cross-border payment mechanisms, especially if traditional systems face increased friction. The necessity of finding new ways to transact and store value, free from geopolitical pressures, could accelerate mainstream adoption of decentralized technologies. Conclusion: Preparing for an Unpredictable Future The prospect of new Trump tariffs of 15% or 20% on imports looms large, promising to reshape the economic landscape in profound ways. From consumer prices and corporate profits to the intricate dance of global trade , the economic impact will be felt across every sector. While traditional markets brace for volatility and uncertainty, the cryptocurrency market stands at a crossroads, potentially offering a decentralized alternative or facing its own set of challenges amidst the broader economic shifts. Vigilance, adaptability, and a deep understanding of these evolving dynamics will be crucial for navigating what promises to be an unpredictable future.

2025-07-11T09:45:48,"Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 ‚Äì 2030: How High Will BTC Price Go?","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 ‚Äì 2030: How High Will BTC Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Bitcoin is currently trading at: $¬†118,080.61753879 Predictions suggest BTC could reach $175K in 2025. Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is becoming aggressively bullish as in the year‚Äôs second half, July, a new ATH has been marked, smashing previous all-time highs of $112K . As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop, as it has entered a price discovery mode. This optimism has been directly fueled by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , skyrocketing institutional adoption , much clearer regulations, and unwavering political support from figures like President Trump. It‚Äôs now seen as ‚Äúa hedge against inflation‚Äù more than ever, and the cryptocurrency is capturing global attention. Major players like MicroStrategy , Metaplanet , Trump Media , and several other entities are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. With the Federal Reserve hinting at future rate cuts and market enthusiasm at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: ‚ÄúCan Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWill it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?‚Äù This Bitcoin price prediction dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $110,660.75 and $118,856.47 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin‚Äôs performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran‚Äôs Supreme Leader. Iran‚Äôs defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 The Bitcoin price performance in July 2025 has been nothing short of impressive. Since the final week of June, Bitcoin has broken free from its consolidation zone, fueled by a combination of whale accumulation, increased spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On-chain data reveals a sharp increase in whale transactions especially in the $100K+ and $1M+ brackets. Spot volume also hit a 3-month high, indicating heightened market participation. These catalysts combined helped the BTC price to break above the $110,000 resistance, enter price discovery, and establish a new all-time high at $118,340. However, following a ceasefire announcement on June 23, Bitcoin rebounded quickly, signaling strong buy-the-dip behavior among investors, and now its course has once again aimed north. Also, dormant wallets coming back online also suggest broader ecosystem confidence. These older addresses that were left untouched for years HAVE recently reactivated during the current rally, pointing toward stronger belief in long-term price potential. From a technical perspective, BTC now eyes the psychological milestone of $120,000. Should the price maintain upward momentum, this level may be tested before the end of the month. However, any short-term pullback would make $110,000 a crucial support to hold. A drop below this level may validate a false breakout, potentially dragging BTC back to the $101,000 swing low support zone and final defense line stays near the $95,000 mark. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $95,000 $103,500 ‚Äì $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin‚Äôs price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin‚Äôs bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin‚Äôs future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-11T09:42:11,"Peter Schiff Urges Bitcoin Holders to Sell and Buy Silver","Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff is once again sounding the alarm, telling investors to sell Bitcoin (BTC) and purchase silver. These comments come as the flagship cryptocurrency surged past $118,000, achieving a new all-time high. Schiff‚Äôs Comments In a July 10 post on X, Schiff urged BTC holders to cash in their stash and turn to silver before the metal‚Äôs next upward price movement. ‚ÄúWith Bitcoin hitting new highs today (in dollars), it‚Äôs a great time to sell some and buy silver ahead of silver‚Äôs next big leg up,‚Äù he said. The leading crypto asset by market cap saw its price hit $118,254, marking yet another record high in 2025. Following this, the economist explained that BTC can easily crash while silver offers a more stable and undervalued alternative. He further compared the two assets, stating that silver was trading back above $37 and up almost 2% on the day, while BTC‚Äôs new high is speculative and overextended. The precious metals proponent emphasized that silver mining stocks remain underpriced despite the upward movement, suggesting the market hasn‚Äôt yet factored in their momentum. According to him, once silver breaks past the $40 level, it could accelerate quickly toward $50. He also thinks that mining stocks would catch up once this happens. Despite his warnings, BTC is still ahead of silver in terms of market value. It currently ranks sixth among global assets with a market cap of $2.20 trillion, just ahead of Google, with silver coming in at $2.007 trillion. The digital asset‚Äôs price has also continued to rally, driven by strong ETF inflows, growing corporate adoption by crypto-focused treasury firms, and an increasingly supportive regulatory environment. Crypto Community Remains Unconvinced Crypto supporters were quick to respond to Schiff‚Äôs latest commentary, with most not buying what he was selling. Their responses to his X post ranged from people asserting they would not dispose of their BTC for silver to others referencing the apparent folly of his previous remarks. One X user highlighted how the gold bug‚Äôs sentiment had gone from ‚ÄúBitcoin will never hit 100k‚Äù to ‚Äúeven if Bitcoin keeps rising for a while‚Ä¶‚Äù Others pointed out the flaw in his logic, claiming that the cryptocurrency had clearly outperformed the metal. It‚Äôs not the first time Schiff has fired broadsides at Bitcoin. In the past, he has advised traders to sell all of their BTC in favor of gold mining stocks, claiming that it is a risky asset. The financial commentator is an invested critic of the digital asset, often calling it speculative and without intrinsic value, while asserting that it will collapse someday if a major economic crisis hits The post Peter Schiff Urges Bitcoin Holders to Sell and Buy Silver appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/peter-schiff-urges-bitcoin-holders-to-sell-and-buy-silver/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|MINING|FIAT","AA News|BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|Bitcoin|Peter Schiff",cryptocompare

ETFs acquired $5.2 billion in Bitcoin over the past 30 days amid supply constraints. Hougan says breaking free from the $100K range has set Bitcoin up for new price discovery. Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan has projected Bitcoin will surpass $200,000 by the end of 2025. He has cited massive institutional demand meeting limited token supply as the primary catalyst. Hougan‚Äôs forecast arrives as Bitcoin sets a new all-time high of $118,403, surpassing previous resistance levels. Hougan attributes the current price surge to unrelenting demand from corporate buyers and exchange-traded funds rather than correlation with technology stocks or political developments. ETF data supports Hougan‚Äôs thesis with $5.2 billion in Bitcoin acquisitions over the past 30 days. This shows substantial institutional commitment to cryptocurrency exposure. These purchases by regulated investment vehicles signal mainstream financial acceptance and create persistent buying pressure.

2025-07-11T09:31:43,"Bitcoin (BTC) Surges to $118,400: How High Can the Price Climb?","The surge out of Bitcoin‚Äôs bull flag is happening. So far the price has been as high as $118,400. This may well be surpassed on Friday. Just how high can this rocketship go? S&P 500 about to break back into the long-term ascending channel? Source: TradingView At the same time that Bitcoin is bursting higher, the US stock market is paving the way. The best way to view this is via the S&P 500. After the big dip caused by the Trump tariffs, the v-shaped recovery has been nothing short of sensational. It might be today, or it could be next week, but the index looks as though it can climb back into the ascending channel which has been in force since early 2023. This is good news for $BTC given that a climbing US stock market usually coincides with similar price action for Bitcoin. Current upside pause just temporary? Source: TradingView After breaking out of the bull flag and faking out the first time, and threatening to do so a second time, the $BTC price suddenly shot skyward and reached and surpassed the all-time high at $112,000. A short period of consolidation followed in the form of a flag pennant. However, this soon broke out, and another $7,000 was soon added to the price as it hit more than $118,000. Since then, there has been a slight retracement into the $117,000s, but this does look temporary, and the price could start to spike yet again at some point during Friday. $130,000 is not out of the realms of possibility. It does need to be borne in mind that sooner or later, this upward spike will need to start calming down, and it would be healthy for the price to go sideways and perhaps down for a more extended period of time, giving the momentum indicators time to reset, as they are quite overbought now. At what point this might start to happen is unsure at this stage, and there is the possibility of more upside before gravity begins to take effect. Potential downside price targets Source: TradingView While more upside price action is probably favourite right now, it is good to look at the possibilities for potential downside. Drawing in the Fibonacci extension levels for this move, it can be seen that the deepest retracement that could be reasonably expected is to the 0.618 level. This coincides with the top corner of the bull flag, making it a good support level. It can be seen that up to now, the 0.236, the most shallow Fibonacci level, is acting as good support. At the bottom of this daily chart, the RSI indicator line has just crossed into overbought territory above 70.00. That said, it will need to get above 78.60 in order to avoid bearish divergence on this time frame. Bearish divergence needs to be annulled on weekly time frame Source: TradingView More importantly, on the weekly time frame, the indicator line for the RSI can be seen to be approaching the descending trendline (bottom of chart). This looks tricky for the bulls, and could be a rejection point. If it does break through, it will need to confirm, and then get above 88.40 in order to fully annul bearish divergence on this weekly time frame.

Svenson tells his 83,400 YouTube subscribers that whenever the S&P 500 index hits a new all-time high, Bitcoin tends to follow suit. The S&P 500 index reached a record high of 6,333 points earlier this week. ‚ÄúBitcoin is now ready to play out the next major parabolic advance, the next phase of the parabolic trend‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶And if the S&P is stable or trending into new all-time highs, then that will allow Bitcoin to also do the same.

2025-07-11T09:00:12,"Shanghai regulator eyes a yuan-based stablecoin","Crypto might still be banned in mainland China, but signs are emerging that the world‚Äôs second-largest economy isn‚Äôt staying on the sidelines forever. A Shanghai regulator reportedly held a rare meeting on stablecoins and digital currencies. This comes in when the digital assets market is rallying high, printing green indexes all around. The cumulative crypto market cap surged by almost 6% over the last day to hit $3.67 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume has now breached $230 billion. Bitcoin (BTC) made a huge comeback to mark a fresh all-time high of $118,400. Shanghai eyes stablecoins According to the report, a post on the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission‚Äôs official WeChat mentioned that the Thursday meeting brought together 60-70 officials and experts, including policy voices from Guotai Haitong Securities who presented global stablecoin developments and offered strategic policy suggestions. It is a move that marks a subtle but notable shift in tone for a country that outlawed crypto trading and mining back in 2021. The city of Shanghai is China‚Äôs financial nerve center and a frequent testing ground for pilot reforms. It added that the meeting stopped short of endorsing any change in crypto rules. However, regulator He Qing highlighted the need for ‚Äúgreater sensitivity to emerging technologies and enhanced research into digital currencies.‚Äù This approach would have been inconceivable even a year ago. Chinese tech giants like JD.com and Ant Group are reportedly preparing applications to issue yuan-backed stablecoins via Hong Kong. The landmark legislation for stablecoin licensing is expected to go live on August 1. That move is seen as a key part of Hong Kong‚Äôs effort to reposition itself as Asia‚Äôs digital asset capital. Meanwhile, the mainland‚Äôs crypto watchdogs aren‚Äôt dropping their guard. The Beijing Internet Finance Association issued a stern warning on Wednesday against stablecoin scams and unlicensed fundraising schemes. The watchdog flagged buzzwords like ‚ÄúDeFi,‚Äù ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù and ‚Äústablecoins‚Äù as red flags. They are accusing bad actors of mimicking Ponzi models to lure retail investors. ‚ÄúThese activities can easily evolve into crimes such as illegal fundraising, financial fraud, and money laundering,‚Äù the group said. Dollar rules stablecoins Pressure is still mounting as the US dollar accounts for more than 99% global stablecoin market. However, some Chinese policymakers are increasingly uneasy about ceding control of digital trade rails to American currency-backed tokens. For exporters across China‚Äôs southern provinces, dollar stablecoins like USDT and USDC have already become a shadow settlement layer for international deals. The renminbi makes up less than 3% of global cross-border flows. A Hong Kong-issued RMB stablecoin could be Beijing‚Äôs answer to breaking the dollar‚Äôs monopoly. If green-lit, such a product would allow offshore users to transact in digital RMB tokens without the underlying currency ever leaving China. It‚Äôs a workaround that protects Beijing‚Äôs regulatory firewall while offering an alternative to the dollar. Data shows that the global stablecoin market cap stood around $262.56 billion on Friday. Tether‚Äôs USDT is leading the category with a cap of $160 billion while Circle‚Äôs USDC holds a cap of $62.8 billion. DAI is another major stablecoin in the tally with a circulation of 5.36 billion. Running the wave up, Bitcoin price surged by 6% in the last 24 hours. BTC posted a fresh ATH of above $118,400 before crawling back to the $117K zone. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 93% to hit $117.7 billion. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The spot Ethereum ETF has now seen a total of $6.1 billion in inflows, and is way ahead of its eight competitors. Additionally, it was the second-best day for aggregate inflows for the products since they launched with $383 million or 129,500 ETH.

Almost $900 million has entered Ethereum ETFs in just six trading days so far this month, according to Farside Investors.¬†In total, there have been more than $5 billion in inflows since launch, despite Grayscale‚Äôs fund hemorrhaging $4.2 billion.

WE ARE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/79KMoQenjV ‚Äî Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 11, 2025 Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also been on a roll with a whopping $1.17 billion in aggregate inflows on Thursday, the largest inflow day since early November and the second best since launch. The lion‚Äôs share went into BlackRock‚Äôs fund as usual, which saw $448.5 million in inflows, bringing its total inflow to a staggering $53.4 billion. It was a ‚Äúhuge volume day for IBIT,‚Äù said Balchunas, observing twice the average volume of $5 billion. ‚ÄúWhen IBIT sees big volume surges on up price days, it portends big boy flows,‚Äù he added, stating that there is a good chance that they‚Äôll reach $1 billion over the next day or so. Financial advisors, who control an enormous amount of money, have barely even begun allocating to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, said Nate Geraci before adding: ‚ÄúMajor platforms such as Vanguard are still gatekeeping these ETFs (which is laughable IMO).

2025-07-11T08:49:35,"Bitcoin Short-Sellers Crushed as Price Hits New ATH","Bitcoin short-sellers faced a brutal shakeout on Thursday as the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency surged to fresh all-time highs, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. According to CoinGlass data , crypto markets saw $1.01 billion in short positions liquidated. This included around $570 million in Bitcoin shorts and nearly $207 million in Ether shorts, as Bitcoin hit $116,500 and Ether touched $2,990 on Thursday. The surge marks Bitcoin‚Äôs second consecutive day of setting new records, with Wednesday‚Äôs peak at $112,000 being swiftly surpassed. The rally lifted the total crypto market capitalization by 6% over the past day to $3.68 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Traders React to the Massive Short Squeeze The swift upward move caught many in the market off guard. ‚ÄúBears in disbelief,‚Äù crypto analyst Miles Deutscher posted on X, while trader Daan Crypto Trades described the price surge as a ‚ÄúMASSIVE Short squeeze on BTC & ETH.‚Äù Velo, another market commentator, highlighted the scale of the liquidations, noting, ‚ÄúLots of emails are being sent.‚Äù This liquidation event, while significant, was smaller than the one recorded on February 3, when over $2.24 billion in positions were wiped out amid fears of a global trade war following import tariff announcements by US President Donald Trump. Despite these past shakeouts, Thursday‚Äôs squeeze was notable for the speed at which Bitcoin moved past its previous record levels. Split Sentiment Before the Breakout Earlier in the week, analysts were divided on Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term potential to break new highs. Bitfinex analysts noted on Tuesday that BTC was showing a ‚Äúlack of follow-through strength,‚Äù with bulls appearing hesitant without a clear macro catalyst, as the asset hovered around $108,500. Their report stated that traders were waiting for fresh momentum before pushing the price significantly higher. However, others, including MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, were more optimistic. ‚ÄúThe inevitable breakout to an ATH on Bitcoin might even happen during the upcoming week,‚Äù van de Poppe predicted on June 30. For now, market participants are watching closely to see if BTC can hold above its new highs or push further. If Bitcoin retraces to Wednesday‚Äôs level of $112,000 , around $2.11 billion in long positions could be at risk of liquidation, adding another layer of tension as traders recalibrate in the face of BTC‚Äôs latest historic climb.
