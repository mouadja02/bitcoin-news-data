2025-07-11T15:43:56,"Bitcoin: Race To The Bottom","Summary Bitcoin has proven itself as a hedge and store of value, outperforming traditional assets during market volatility and monetary debasement. Institutional adoption is accelerating, with surveys showing a growing allocation to Bitcoin in diversified portfolios globally. The macro environment of rising debt and currency debasement makes Bitcoin the best asset to hold for the next decade. While short-term cycles matter, the real risk is not owning Bitcoin, as its long-term trend remains strongly upward. Thesis Summary Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is breaking out again, showing that it could potentially be ready for another big run-up. In the last year, Bitcoin has set itself apart from other risk assets, showing that it is in a league of its own and that it is not just a speculative bet but is increasingly being considered by the market like a hedge and store of value. I estimate Bitcoin's value based on three different approaches: Market cap, the Stock-to-Flow Model, and Technical Analysis. But while I remain bullish on Bitcoin, the four-year cycle that has played out in the past also suggests we could be getting close to a top, and investors should have an exit strategy in place once euphoria sets in. Just Buy Bitcoin The appeal for Bitcoin has never been more undeniable, and as we rally into new all-time highs, more and more people are beginning to realize this. The last few months have proven that Bitcoin is more than a speculative asset. While the major stock indexes plummeted in April, Bitcoin outperformed on the way down, and it is now outperforming on the way up. You just can't ignore the facts, and even major fund managers are being forced to admit that Bitcoin has a place in a well-diversified portfolio. A June survey found 67% of institutional investors believed digital assets had a role in a portfolio , with 69% planning to increase allocation. Another survey showed 59% of institutional investors were planning to allocate at least 5% of their portfolios towards digital assets. Race To The Bottom The evidence for owning Bitcoin is overwhelming right now, and this can be proven in just one chart. DXY (TV) The dollar has seen one of its worst six months in decades, and this is simply pricing in the reality that deficits are going to keep increasing and being monetized by the Fed. The latest Big Beautiful bill will increase the deficit by trillions Trump has officially talked about wanting a dovish Fed, and he will likely get his wish next year. More importantly, though, this is a global phenomenon. Global debt (IIF ) Global debt is 333% of GDP. This is not getting paid back with austerity. This is only getting paid back in debased currency, and the best hedge against debasement has been proven over the last few years to be Bitcoin. Debasement is going to be the defining macro factor of the next 10 years. Institutions know it, and they are gearing up for it. How High Can We Go? With the latest evidence from institutional surveys, it's clear that Bitcoin is going to make its way into most portfolios around the world. This gives us an easy way of calculating the price of Bitcoin. Let's take the survey above that suggests 5% of institutional portfolios will go into Bitcoin. That's 5% of a total global asset base of around $175 trillion as of a year ago. That's around $8.75 trillion in market cap that could flow into Bitcoin, with a maximum of 21 million in circulation. That yields a price of $416,667. With that said, this is likely a longer-term target, which could take some time to play out. More immediately, I am looking at the $150,000 area. BTC Price TA (Trendspider) This is the next key fib level from the bear market low and would complete a five-wave impulse nicely. The Real Risk Is Not Owning Bitcoin The way I see it, the real risk right now is not having any exposure to Bitcoin. Everything right now suggests it's the best asset to hold during a debasement. In fact, this is a strong argument to also hold stocks and gold. Bitcoin is likely the best option going forward since it is still in its early phase of adoption and has a much more global appeal. Does that mean we go up in a straight line? Of course not. Bitcoin, like other assets, is still subject to the business cycle. It's going to come down at some point, but the overall trend is going to be up. If you really wanted to time a short-term top, then we'd have to look at things like global liquidity trends and macro indicators like the ISM. But for now, these metrics still suggest we are going higher. Liquidity is on the up, and the economy remains strong. Risks Although I am bullish given the liquidity outlook, plenty of events could derail this. Geopolitics, a recession, or the return of inflation are all possible headwinds. Bitcoin is volatile, so investors should be ready for large corrections at any given time. Takeaway The last year has been very important for Bitcoin. It has shown, with price action, that it is a hedge against monetary debasement. Coincidentally, at the same time, the US has shown that more debt and debasement is indeed the way forward. Cash in the bank is going to lose value. The least you can do is hold financial assets like stocks. And in my view, the best thing you can do is hold Bitcoin right now.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800688-bitcoin-race-to-the-bottom?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

Despite the absence of identity verification, many no KYC casinos implement voluntary responsible gambling tools including self-imposed deposit limits, loss limits, and cool-down periods. Players should utilize these tools proactively to maintain control over their gambling habits. Legal Considerations The legal landscape for no KYC casinos varies significantly across jurisdictions. These platforms often operate in regulatory gray areas, as many countries require gambling operators to implement KYC procedures as part of anti-money laundering compliance.

The anonymous nature of these platforms doesn't diminish the importance of understanding local gambling regulations. Advantages and Disadvantages Advantages: Complete privacy and anonymity Instant account creation and gameplay access No personal documentation required Faster withdrawals without verification delays Protection from data breaches Freedom from banking restrictions Support for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies Disadvantages: Limited legal protections in some jurisdictions Fewer traditional responsible gambling controls Greater personal responsibility for security Potential regulatory uncertainty Limited recourse in case of disputes Conclusion No KYC crypto casinos offer the perfect solution for players seeking privacy and instant gaming access.

Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC, the two largest dollar-pegged stablecoins, each reached new record supplies this week, according to TradingView data. Since the start of July, USDC’s market cap has grown by $1.3 billion, reaching $62.8 billion, while USDT added $1.4 billion to hit nearly $160 billion. Looking further back to April, when the market hit a short-term low, the growth is even more pronounced. USDT expanded by $15.2 billion—roughly 10.5%—and USDC added $2.7 billion, or 4.6%. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies with prices tied to an external asset, predominantly to the U.S. dollar. While they have been increasingly popular for payments, the asset class serves as a key source of liquidity and trading pairs on crypto exchanges. Hence, analysts often treat their growth as a proxy for fresh capital entering the broader crypto economy. Previously, periods of accelerating stablecoin growth coincided with sharp rallies in bitcoin, Caleb Franzen, founder of Cubic Analytics, pointed out in a chart shared on X .

Europe's securities regulator has warned cryptocurrency companies not to mislead their customers, according to a Reuters report. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has warned crypto platforms not to mislead customers about the regulatory status of their products. ESMA said some cryptoasset service providers (CASPs) offer both regulated and unregulated products, but are putting retail investors at risk by failing to clearly distinguish between their products. ESMA emphasized that firms must clearly distinguish between products that fall within the scope of MiCA and those that do not. On this point, ESMA said that having crypto asset service providers (CASPs) offer both regulated and unregulated products through the same platform “causes risks for investors” because customers may not be aware of which products are under MiCA protection. “Some CASPs may use their regulated status under MiCA as a marketing argument, leading to confusion between regulated and unregulated products and services.” Finally, ESMA also said that cryptocurrency companies should not use their regulated products as a “promotional tool” or imply that their unregulated products are within the scope of the MICA. *This is not investment advice.

Coinbase Demands Transparency After State’s Abrupt Legal Action The Washington Times reports that Coinbase has filed a lawsuit accusing Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield of suddenly changing their stance on digital assets. It is now demanding public records to understand what led to the change, and claims that the shift happened behind closed doors, with no public hearings, rulemaking, or chance for input, violating transparency rules. pic.twitter.com/siEmaP50IQ — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) July 11, 2025 “Let there be no doubt: Oregon’s lawsuit, like the SEC’s, is meritless, and Coinbase will do whatever is required to beat it,” said Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s CLO, in a previous blog post. He shared that Oregon’s Attorney General is preparing to sue Coinbase using the same outdated arguments the SEC already dropped. Grewal called the move political and harmful, saying it goes against the bipartisan efforts in Washington to create clear, fair crypto rules. Ryan VanGrack, Coinbase’s vice president of litigation, stressed that transparency is essential for good governance. He criticized Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield for pursuing a lawsuit that, according to him, benefits out-of-state law firms while hurting Oregon residents who want to trade digital assets. This comes after the Attorney General sued Coinbase in April. He claimed that the company broke the law by not registering with state and federal regulators. After the federal government dropped its case against Coinbase, Oregon filed its own lawsuit, claiming that Coinbase was illegally selling risky, unregistered crypto to people in the state. Coinbase Says Oregon Lawsuit Favors Out-of-State Law Firms Coinbase notes in its lawsuit that for years, Oregon told people that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin were not covered by state rules. But suddenly, in April, the state changed its mind and filed a lawsuit against Coinbase, claiming that the company was breaking the law by not registering properly. It also points out that the state hired outside law firms that could take 20-30% of the gains if the case succeeds. Coinbase argues that no new law was passed to regulate digital currencies and says the public deserves to know why it happened. The company wants the court to force Governor Kotek to release documents explaining the change. An Untimely Move Mr Vangrack notes that Oregon is the only state suing Coinbase, and it is both untimely and inappropriate for a state to step in on something that falls under federal authority. This comes as the lawmakers from both parties are working on legislation to bring clearer regulations to better regulate the crypto industry. Congress is expected to vote next week on two key bills: the Clarity Act and the GENIUS Act, which aim to bring more transparency and rules to the digital asset industry.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/coinbase-hits-back-at-oregon-over-sudden-crypto-policy-shift/,"EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BTC","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-11T15:17:01,"Analyst: Skip Bitcoin FOMO, Altcoins Offer Better Gains Now","Bitcoin (BTC) has sent the crypto community into delirium, hitting a new all-time high (ATH) of almost $119,000 after brief stops around $113,000 and $116,000. However, despite the excitement, prominent analyst CrediBULL Crypto has cautioned traders not to chase the rally blindly, suggesting that the real opportunity lies in altcoins, not Bitcoin. Why BTC FOMO Could Be Costly With BTC currently over 650% above its ideal accumulation zone, CrediBULL posted a stark warning on X: “The big opportunity for gains is on ALTS even if Bitcoin is the one that is ‘leading’ this move.” He added that anyone buying the asset at this particular point should only do so for an active trade with a clear setup. “If you can’t identify a trade setup then there is no reason to buy Bitcoin at these levels as there are much better opportunities in alts from a R/R perspective at current levels.” His comments echoed a broader sentiment emerging from key market voices, including former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes and YouTuber Crypto Rover, who likened the current market cycle to November 2024, when a major altcoin rally followed Bitcoin’s price surge. In a recent tweet, Hayes said he had reversed his previously bearish stance, citing Bitcoin’s strong breakout and the rising dominance of Ethereum (ETH). “Get ready for a monster alt szn,” he wrote, signaling increased institutional confidence. The crypto entrepreneur also reported that his Maelstrom Fund is ramping up altcoin exposure amid expectations of favorable political and macroeconomic shifts. Observers have described the flagship cryptocurrency’s latest move as structurally different from past bull cycles. According to CryptoQuant, it isn’t driven by speculative angst, but rather by strategic accumulation and restrained selling activity. Additionally, metrics like the MVRV ratio, currently 2.2 vs. over 2.7 in previous tops, SOPR, and MPI all hint at a sustainable rally with long-term potential. The drop in exchange balances, down over 21% in four months, also suggests that holders are in no rush to exit their positions. Altcoins on the Mend However, even with BTC in price discovery mode, Ethereum and several other altcoins are beginning to outshine it in percentage gains. ETH, for instance, is up by more than 18% in the last seven days, beating Bitcoin’s 8.9% rise in the same period. It has also reclaimed the $3,000 level and is setting its sights on $3,350–$3,500. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has pumped 23.7% across the week, reclaiming critical support at $0.64 and eyeing a return to $1. Hyperliquid (HYPE) is up nearly 19%, having set a new all-time high at $46.25, and is now targeting the $50 psychological threshold. Even Solana (SOL) is catching a bid, with prices climbing above $164 and showing potential for a rally beyond $180.

According to Companies Market Cap , Bitcoin is now sitting in the sixth place among the world’s largest companies, metals, and digital assets, with a market cap of $2.34 trillion. Silver follows at spot number seven, with $2.163 trillion in market capitalization. Top assets by market cap: Source: companiesmarketcap.com Tech giants Google and Meta are behind BTC and silver, with $1.15 trillion and $1.79 trillion, respectively. Notably, Bitcoin is currently close to entering the top five assets. It has a chance to overtake Amazon as well. The massive company has a market cap of $2.37 trillion, about $3 trillion more than BTC. Meanwhile, gold still reigns supreme. The first place boasts a whopping market cap of $22.6 trillion. NVIDIA is a distant second, recording $4 trillion. Microsoft and Apple follow, standing in the $3 trillion range. Analysts have noted Bitcoin’s maturation and stability , especially for a volatile asset, during the ongoing turbulent period. Specifically, it saw significant institutional interest and was consolidating above $100,000 for days before surging to a new all-time high – all the while defying major macroeconomic uncertainty and global geopolitical tensions. Per Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at Mercuryo , BTC surged past $118,000 “amid sustained institutional demand for the biggest cryptocurrency, which has been such a driving force in this current market cycle.” He continues: “While altcoins are also in the green with Ethereum spiking past the $3,000 mark, the underlying ‘orange pill’ narrative remains steadfastly in place. Bitcoin’s growing status as a store of value is one that more and more big players and institutions are simply unable to ignore.” You may also like: Bitcoin Hits $94k ATH, Surpasses Silver to Become Seventh Largest Asset in the World Bitcoin (BTC) market capitalization overtook that of silver with the influx of institutional money into digital assets, according to this week’s Bitfinex Alpha Market Report.The exchange’s analysts remarked that last week, BTC broke past initial resistance levels and hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $93,318.Additionally, it recorded the latest ATH of $94,040 just hours before the writing of this article.Notably, the surges moved BTC’s market capitalization (counting all BTC mined... ‘We’re Only at Beginning of New Phase in This Market’ The crypto market has seen a significant surge. The market cap is up 2.8% in the last 24 hours to $3.76 trillion. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $117,884. The coin hit a new all-time high of $118,667 earlier today. The current price is also a surge from the intraday low of $110,984. Also, it is up 9.1% in a week, 7.5% in a month, and 101% in a year. Moreover, analysts and investors are waiting to see if BTC will surpass the $119,000 and $120,000 levels, which could propel it towards $130,000 . Bitpanda’s Deputy CEO Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad argues that “we’re well on track to break through the $120,000 barrier.” Macroeconomic factors, record-high ETF inflows, and renewed confidence in digital assets drive the rally. “The crypto market tends to move in cycles, evolving segment by segment and wave by wave. It’s very possible that we’re only at the beginning of a new phase in this market,” Enzersdorfer-Konrad says. BTC is Now More in Demand Than Ever Moreover, Nicolai Sondergaard, research analyst at Nansen , argued that this isn’t a macro-driven rally, but an isolated event. However, recent US policy developments, “such as fiscal expansion and expectations of further monetary easing, have created a backdrop that is undeniably favorable for Bitcoin.” Also, he adds, we’re seeing growing institutional confidence in BTC as a balance sheet asset and strong, sustained inflows into BTC and ETH spot ETFs. While $BTC has made a new ATH above $118K, Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) remains below the euphoria zone, currently at 0.69.

Regulations such as the EU’s MiCA contributed significantly, he adds. But, Kral warns, “with such hype comes the need for caution. No one knows whether the price will go up or down.” James Harris, the newly appointed Group CEO of Tesseract , also notes that while “it was great to see Bitcoin decisively shatter its all-time highs” in USD terms, “they fall short versus EUR, GBP, or Gold (XAU).” That said, the continued momentum has “BTC edging closer to those benchmarks as well,” Harris says.

Market participants also took a bit of a breather after back-to-back record closes for the benchmark S&P 500 index ( SP500 ). The S&P ( SP500 ) was last -0.4% in morning trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) was -0.2% , and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) was -0.6% . Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. “Stocks are not quite desensitized to tariff headlines just yet. We are still seeing knee-jerk reactions to negative trade headlines. Volatility is an opportunity for investors who are still too exposed to cash,” said Michael Landsberg, CIO at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 6 basis points to 4.41%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 2 basis points to 3.91%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a new all-time high on Friday, fueled by growing institutional interest and supportive signals from the Trump administration. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget is expected to be in deficit by $50B in June versus $70.9B in June 2024. The focus will shift slightly from tariffs and trade developments to the second quarter U.S. earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from major banks. ""We believe second quarter earnings will be good, but not as good as first quarter. Much of the second quarter was marked with tariff and trade issues, and that may have caused some dislocations in earnings for certain industries as their customers may have been in a holding pattern,"" said Landsberg.

Now, they’re taking that expertise to Coinbase, and the implications for onchain markets could be massive. On July 11, crypto exchange Coinbase announced it had poached Opyn’s core leadership team, including CEO Andrew Leone and Head of Research Joe Clark, in a talent-focused acquisition that underscores its aggressive push into onchain finance. The move, framed by Coinbase as a way to accelerate its onchain markets strategy, brings aboard two of DeFi’s most influential derivatives architects, known for pioneering innovations like Power Perpetuals and Squeeth. While the deal doesn’t include Opyn’s underlying protocol, it marks a clear talent acquisition as Coinbase doubles down on bringing traditional market functionality onto public ledgers. You might also like: Stocks slip amid Trump’s tariff threats, Bitcoin spike buoys crypto stocks Coinbase bets big on the architects of DeFi’s derivatives revolution Unlike previous acquisitions driven by product or protocol expansion, this was a bet on people. According to Coinbase, the decision to onboard Opyn’s top minds was made under its build-buy-partner-invest framework, with the leadership team’s hybrid grasp of DeFi primitives and traditional market mechanics standing out. Leone and Clark aren’t just engineers. The two are heralded as architects of market structure, having launched some of DeFi’s most novel instruments during Opyn’s experimental run. At Coinbase, they’ll be placed within the institutional Onchain Markets division, tasked with advancing efforts like Verified Pools and contributing to broader onchain exchange infrastructure. The Opyn team’s move underscores a broader industry reckoning. After navigating regulatory scrutiny, including a 2023 CFTC settlement over unregistered trading, Leone and Clark bring hard-won experience in balancing DeFi’s permissionless ideals with compliance realities. In its announcement, Opyn framed the transition as a natural evolution, stating, “Coinbase shares our belief that the future of finance is onchain and they are committed to making that a reality.” Big news: Coinbase is acquiring Opyn’s leadership team! Opyn’s mission has been to empower others through an inclusive, fair, and open financial system. We couldn’t imagine a better place than Coinbase to carry that vision forward. We are proud of the contributions we made to… pic.twitter.com/Pw5HyUFKns — Opyn (TESTNET IS LIVE) (@opyn_) July 11, 2025 This marks Coinbase’s sixth acquisition this year, following strategic grabs like Deribit’s team in May and onchain analytics platform Spindl in January. The pattern is clear: Coinbase is assembling a war chest of niche expertise, betting that the next phase of crypto adoption hinges on seamless integration between centralized trust and decentralized efficiency. As Clark noted, their goal is to build “the connective tissue of finance on immutable public ledgers.” The implications extend beyond talent. By embedding DeFi-native thinkers like Leone and Clark into its institutional framework, Coinbase is signaling that the future of trading isn’t just onchain, it’s hybrid. For traders, that could mean deeper liquidity and novel products; for competitors, it’s a warning that the exchange isn’t ceding ground to upstarts.

2025-07-11T15:00:31,"Bitcoin Is The ‘Manhattan’ Of The Digital Age, Says Scaramucci–Here’s Why","According to a recent interview, SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci drew a bold comparison between today’s Bitcoin market and a famous land deal from 1626. He said investors who buy BTC now will face big swings just like the first people who tried any new asset. In his view, those bumps in the road are part of getting in early on something big. Early Bitcoin Purchase Analogy Scaramucci pointed out that Peter Minuit bought Manhattan Island for just 60 Dutch guilders, or about $24 at the time. Based on reports, land in Manhattan today costs millions. He used that gap to argue that buying 1 BTC around $111,000 feels like a bargain. Minuit’s deal grew into one of the world’s most valuable real estate markets. Bitcoin, he believes, could follow a similar path. JUST IN: ANTHONY SCARAMUCCI COMPARES #BITCOIN AT $100K TO BUYING MANHATTAN IN 1690 “THIS IS DIGITAL PROPERTY. YOU EITHER SEE IT, OR YOU DON’T.” pic.twitter.com/DO4hHX1INV — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) July 10, 2025 Volatility And Early‑Adopter Risks Investors in Bitcoin know sharp price swings can happen at any moment. The top crypto asset has plunged 70% or more in past cycles, only to rebound later. Scaramucci said that kind of ride is what pioneers signed up for. He warned that anyone who can’t handle sudden drops might bail out before the next rally. At the same time, those who stay could see big gains. According to market data, Bitcoin hit a record high of $118,200 today before slipping back to $111,120. Trading volume surged as that peak was reached. It’s a reminder that every rally brings its own tests. Altcoin Spotlight On Solana While Scaramucci’s focus is on Bitcoin, he revealed his top alternative holding is Solana . Based on reports, he said SOL’s speed and low fees make it useful for more than just trading. That choice shows he’s betting some of his gains on other networks. Many investors follow a similar playbook: put most money in Bitcoin and a smaller share in projects that could grow faster. Regulatory And Market Challenges Ahead Scaramucci didn’t shy away from risks beyond price swings. He mentioned that US regulators are still deciding how to treat crypto . Data shows that any new rules on exchanges or tokens could shake up the market. He also flagged the chance of a big sell‑off if economic worries spike again. Bitcoin Market Still Maturing He argued that Bitcoin is still in its infancy. By comparing it to Manhattan in 1690—before any tall buildings existed—Scaramucci wants to show there’s room to grow. He forecast a BTC price of $200,000 before year‑end. Those numbers suggest he sees at least an 80% jump from current levels. Whether that happens will depend on more firms and people using crypto over time.

These insights emerge at a time when both asset classes are trading at new record highs. For instance, Bitcoin has reached an all-time peak of $118,000, while the S&P 500 is edging close to the 6,300 mark. By press time, the maiden cryptocurrency was trading at $117,624, having rallied over 6% in the last 24 days, while in the past week, BTC is up 8%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Year-to-date, the S&P 500 measured in Bitcoin is down another 15%. Bitcoin v. S&P 500 performance. Source: Bitbo Overall, the data suggests that Bitcoin’s appreciation has been so extreme over the last decade that traditional equity benchmarks appear to have effectively gone to zero when denominated in BTC. Implications of Bitcoin’s performance against S&P 500 Critics might argue this comparison is more symbolic than practical, considering that few institutions price their portfolios in Bitcoin. However, for Bitcoin advocates, the data highlights the cryptocurrency’s feature as a scarce, decentralized asset capable of outperforming traditional financial systems over time. It is essential to note that these two assets belong to distinctly different asset classes. The S&P 500 is a diversified index of large U.S. companies, representing traditional equity ownership in the global economy.

2025-07-11T14:49:34,"Grayscale Challenges SEC’s Delay of GDLC ETF Launch, Calls Stay Order Unlawful","Grayscale has pushed back against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to halt the launch of its large-cap crypto ETF, calling the agency’s stay order both unlawful and harmful to investors. The asset manager filed a letter with the SEC on Friday in response to the unexpected pause on its plan to convert the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The SEC had already approved the conversion earlier this year but then issued a stay order to review the approval — without explaining why. “Grayscale, the Exchange and the Fund’s current investors are suffering harm as a result of the delay,” the company said in its letter . The GDLC ETF would hold a basket of large-cap digital assets including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana and cardano, with around 80% of the fund currently weighted in bitcoin. The move to convert it into a spot ETF is part of Grayscale’s broader strategy to bring more crypto products to mainstream financial markets, following the launch of its spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF in January. While the SEC has not clarified its reasons for the delay, market watchers suggest the hold is likely due to internal procedural issues , rather than political opposition to crypto. The ETF would hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cardano and XRP. Of these, Cardano and XRP don't currently have their own individual ETFs, and Solana just has one fund — with several applications hoping to add to this number. Scott Johnsson, a financial lawyer and ETF expert, said in a post on X that although the SEC’s move was out of the ordinary, it likely won’t derail the fund entirely. “Given Grayscale was suggesting they had productive talks with the SEC prior to approval, and they had made extensive amendments to the rule proposal in line with those discussions, my guess is the Rule 431 application was a parting gift from Crenshaw acting unilaterally,” he wrote, referring to SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. “This is going to launch, it’s just a matter of when imo.” If approved, GDLC would be the first multi-asset crypto ETF in the U.S., giving investors exposure to a curated basket of top digital currencies without needing to manage wallets or custody themselves.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/11/grayscale-challenges-sec-s-delay-of-gdlc-etf-launch-calls-stay-order-unlawful,"REGULATION|BTC|ADA|BUSINESS|SOL","Policy|Grayscale|News",cryptocompare

What is it about XYZVerse that has professionals recommending it to beginners? This article explores the features that make XYZVerse an attractive option for newcomers to the crypto scene. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges From Meme to Mainstream: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a light-hearted take on cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to the serious world of crypto. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum cap and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially viewed as a joke or ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin took the world by surprise in 2021. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, its value skyrocketed, propelling it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, offering faster transaction times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Its community-driven approach has fostered a loyal following, contributing to charitable causes and sponsorships. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's appeal lies in its simplicity and the backing of a vibrant community. While other cryptocurrencies focus on complex technologies and use cases, Dogecoin remains accessible to newcomers. Market trends show a growing interest in decentralized finance and meme coins, suggesting that Dogecoin could continue to gain traction. However, its unlimited supply may affect long-term value. Investors looking for potential gains might find Dogecoin attractive, but should consider the volatility and do their research. Conclusion While coins like DOGE remain popular, XYZVerse's unique sports focus and ambitious growth plans position it as a promising option for beginners in the current bull market.

2025-07-11T14:47:10,"The Hidden Concerns Behind ATH: Could 2025 Be the Last Escape for Bitcoin? Metaphysical Insights on Market Challenges Ahead","Recently, HTX, a global leading cryptocurrency exchange invited Master Hataki, an expert in metaphysics and cryptocurrency, to conduct an in-depth Bazi analysis of Bitcoin. Using the timestamp of Bitcoin’s Genesis Block (January 3, 2009, 18:15 UTC), Master Hataki revealed a chilling forecast: according to his calculations, Bitcoin could face a “double Tai Sui” in 2026, leading to a major price correction. 2025 might be the “last escape opportunity” before Bitcoin enters a turbulent phase. Bitcoin’s Metaphysical Warning: The Challenge of 2026 Master Hataki’s Bazi analysis of Bitcoin shows a strong “Metal-Water” dynamic. In the Five Elements philosophy: Water represents liquidity, aligning with Bitcoin’s nature as a circulating currency. Metal is associated with finance and investment, explaining Bitcoin’s financial traits. In metaphysical terms, Tai Sui (the Grand Duke of Jupiter) represents a clash between an entity’s Bazi and the year’s energy, signaling challenges. Master Hataki noted that Bitcoin’s chart includes “Zi” (Rat), which clashes with the year “Wu” (Horse) in 2026, forming a Zi-Wu Clash . This suggests that Bitcoin will face Tai Sui that year. Even more concerning, two Zi-Wu clashes appear in Bitcoin’s Bazi, meaning it will face a “double Tai Sui”—a rare and significant challenge. The Impact of “Double Tai Sui” on Bitcoin Master Hataki explains the possible consequences of this metaphysical clash: Asset Damage and Loss : Clashes in Bazi represent financial disruption and loss. Bitcoin could experience significant downward pressure in 2026, with its market value dropping sharply. This could trigger a loss of investor confidence, causing a ripple effect in the market. External Interference : The clash may also suggest external disturbances, such as sudden regulatory changes, institutional sell-offs, or even attacks on blockchain technology. These could destabilize Bitcoin’s price and market position. Disunity and Discord : The clash could lead to increased friction within the Bitcoin community and among investors, weakening the overall market stability and Bitcoin’s support base. Negative Energy Transformation : Master Hataki emphasized that the Wu (Fire) of 2026, when it clashes with Bitcoin’s chart, could lead to a loss of wealth. This would not only mean price drops but also a broader shift in market energy, tightening liquidity in the crypto space. Key Timeframes for Potential Volatility Master Hataki highlighted two critical periods in 2026 when market volatility may peak: Wu Month (June 6 to July 7) and Zi Month (December 7 to January 5, 2027). During these times, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations may be especially intense. Investors are advised to remain cautious during these periods. The “False Good” Cycle of 2025 Though 2025 marks the first year of the Fire cycle, Bitcoin might still experience a “false good” phase, though Bitcoin has recently reached a new all-time high where prices rise temporarily before a correction. Master Hataki cautions that from November 7 to December 7 , the Si-Hai Clash could cause price volatility. While the metaphysical analysis doesn’t predict complete collapse, it does remind investors of the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. HTX’s Strategy for Navigating Market Risks Despite the metaphysical warning, Bitcoin’s “double Tai Sui” scenario serves as a reminder of the crypto market’s inherent uncertainties. HTX offers a range of investment products designed to help investors remain resilient during volatile times while still seeking profit opportunities. Here are some of the key strategies: HTX Launchpool: A Stable Growth Option When major cryptocurrencies face downward pressure, staking new coins provides a safer alternative. By participating in HTX Launchpool , investors can earn tokens from new projects and avoid the risks of market downturns, benefiting from new projects’ growth while adding value to their portfolios. Options and Short Contracts: Seizing Reverse Opportunities For experienced investors, HTX’s derivatives market offers tools to profit during bear markets. With Put Options , investors can lock in profits when Bitcoin’s price is expected to fall, or use short contracts to directly profit from declines. These tools can be powerful when used strategically, but they come with higher risks.

In that sense, analyst Ali Martinez pointed to the formation of a bullish pattern for ADA that could propel the digital asset above the critical level around $1. The analyst claims that the $0.55 support for Cardano has been a key support on high timeframes. The last time the cryptocurrency dropped to this level in April this year, as seen on the chart below, ADA was able to rise to over 55% and touched the $0.85 mark. ‘It’s happening again’ said Martinez while pointing at the bullish momentum driving Cardano since it touched the bottom of this parallel channel.

2025-07-11T14:30:41,"Chainlink Uptrend Weakening As Signs Of Fatigue Emerge: Why $14.20 Is Important","Sharing fresh insights on X, Crypto Analysis AI observed that Chainlink is maintaining its upward trajectory, but not without signs of fading strength, identifying $14.20 as a key level to watch. Holding above this level could preserve the bullish structure, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper pullback. Mixed Signals In Focus: Chainlink Short-Term Strength Vs. Medium-Term Caution According to Crypto Analysis AI, LINK/USDT is currently showing mixed signals, with a slight bullish bias in the short term but potential consolidation or pullback risks in the medium term. The 1H timeframe shows more buy signals, while the 4H timeframe indicates weakening momentum after a strong uptrend. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range In the 1H timeframe, the following bullish signals are active: ADX (35.47, strong trend), EMA (EMA9 > EMA20), KDJ (buy), ICHIMOKU (buy), and TRIX (buy). At the same time, several indicators are flashing bearish signals, including MACD (histogram negative), PSAR (sell), and Keltner Channels (sell). Some metrics remain neutral, with RSI at 57.60 (not overbought) and OBV showing neutral. For the 4H timeframe, bullish signals include ADX (34.17, strong trend), MACD (positive histogram), and Supertrend (buy). However, KDJ (sell), SMI (sell), and Schaff Trend Cycle (overbought) are signaling possible weakness. RSI at 66.94 (nearing overbought) and neutral OBV further support a cautious medium-term view, which increases the risk of a pullback. Key Observations from Crypto Analysis AI note that short-term momentum favors bulls. However, medium-term indicators suggest exhaustion, pointing to the 4H RSI reading. Fluctuations And Consolidation Signal Caution Crypto Analysis AI reports that the current trend for Chainlink remains an uptrend, but is slowing. Looking at recent price action, Crypto Analysis AI observed that on the 1H timeframe, LINK fluctuated between $14.25 and $14.48, closing at $14.34. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin’s Next Move Holds The Key Meanwhile, on the 4H chart, there was a strong rally from $13.50 to $14.49, which is now consolidating near $14.30 and $14.40. The analyst also mentioned that volume is declining in the recent 1H candles, which suggests weakening momentum. Crypto Analysis AI identified the following key resistance levels: $14.48 (recent high) and $14.65 (upper Bollinger Band, 1H). In terms of key support, he pointed out $14.20 (recent swing low, 4H), followed by $13.90-$14.00 (psychological support, 4H EMA20) and $13.50 (strong support, previous breakout zone). Outlining potential bullish scenarios, Crypto Analysis AI explained that if LINK holds above $14.20, it could retest $14.48 and $14.65. In a bearish scenario, a break below $14.20 may lead to a deeper correction toward $13.90-$14.00. Meanwhile, for a neutral scenario, Chainlink may continue to consolidate between $14.20 and $14.48 before the next directional move. Finally, Crypto Analysis AI flagged several cautionary signals: 4H RSI near 67 could trigger profit-taking while the MACD histogram is declining despite higher highs. Furthermore, there is lower volume on recent up moves, suggesting weakening demand.

The trader pseudonymously known as Kaleo tells his 706,400 followers on the social media platform X that a $500,000 Bitcoin price is a “magnet” based on the logarithmic regression channel. A logarithmic regression channel is a tool used to identify the long-term trend of the price of an asset that experiences exponential growth at first before the rate of growth slows. According to the pseudonymous analyst, increasing demand and a friendly regulatory environment are some of the factors that will act as bullish catalysts for Bitcoin. “I think option three [Bitcoin demand outpacing supply and price breaking higher] is finally primed to happen led by more fundamental bullish catalysts lining up than we’ve ever seen before. [Exchange-traded funds] ETFs, clearer regulations, state and corporate adoption, tech/decentralized applications that actually works, etc., along with broader bullish market conditions. List goes on, but you get the picture.” Source: Kaleo/X Bitcoin is trading at $110,893 at time of writing. Next up is Ethereum ( ETH ). Kaleo says the second-largest crypto asset by market cap could go up by around 44% from the current level after reclaiming key resistance levels. “Send it to $4,000 with haste.” Source: Kaleo/X Ethereum is trading at $2,780 at time of writing. Next up is Avalanche ( AVAX ). Kaleo says AVAX is on the cusp of breaking out and printing a “god candle” – a sudden large bullish candlestick on the price chart. “AVAX is just getting warmed up.

2025-07-11T14:27:50,"Trader Says XRP Pump to $10 Will Be the Most Hated Pump of All Time. Here’s Why","Veteran crypto trader Cobb has sparked a new wave of debate in the digital asset space with a bold statement: if XRP surges to $10, it will be “the most hated pump of all time.” His comments, shared via X, tap into the deep polarization that surrounds XRP and the long-standing tension between its believers and skeptics. Beneath the surface of this viral claim lies a compelling mix of market psychology, price dynamics, and historical baggage that could make such a rally not only possible but emotionally explosive. The Sideliners: A Massive Wave of Reluctant Buyers Cobb argues that “XRP has the most sideliners out of any coin.” It’s a claim rooted in observation. Despite being a top-ten crypto asset by market cap, XRP is often overlooked or outright dismissed by large portions of the crypto community, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum purists. Years of regulatory pressure, public skepticism, and misinformation have led many to sell out in frustration or avoid the token altogether. XRP pump to $10.00 will be the most hated pump of all time, giving it even more fuel to discover even higher prices XRP has the most sideliners out of any coin XRP derangement syndrome is real pic.twitter.com/IcvskRKJGB — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 11, 2025 Ironically, this massive group of sidelined investors could become a powerful catalyst. If XRP begins a strong upward move, many of these doubters may find themselves forced to buy back in, chasing momentum and adding fuel to the rally. As Cobb suggests, this emotional whiplash could be what turns the pump into one of the most hated in crypto history. XRP Derangement Syndrome: When Bias Blocks Opportunity Cobb also refers to what he calls “XRP Derangement Syndrome”, the tendency of many in the crypto world to irrationally dismiss or mock XRP, regardless of its technicals, fundamentals, or adoption metrics. For years, XRP has been the target of criticism, often painted as centralized or anti-crypto despite its unique position as a bridge currency and settlement layer. This psychological bias could magnify the resentment if XRP proves its critics wrong. A $10 rally would not only reward long-term holders, it would publicly vindicate a token many had written off. That kind of narrative reversal can be emotionally jarring, particularly for those who missed the move or bet against it. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Price Outlook and Market Structure As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.60, continuing to build on strong bullish momentum. It recently closed its highest-ever quarterly candle, signaling a major breakout from long-term resistance zones. The next critical level to watch is $2.69, aligning with a macro Fibonacci retracement. A confirmed break above that level could quickly open the path toward $5.89 and even $10, especially if retail and institutional sideliners begin to FOMO back in. On-chain data and whale activity suggest growing confidence in the asset, with large positions opening at key levels and broader sentiment shifting as XRP shows relative strength. The Most Emotional Rally in Crypto? Cobb’s projection is about more than just price, it’s about narrative tension, market psychology, and a deeply divided community. A $10 XRP wouldn’t just mark a technical milestone; it would force a reckoning for those who doubted the token for years. In a market driven by emotion, that kind of resentment could act as the ultimate accelerant, pushing XRP not just to $10, but far beyond .

Fueled by rising momentum and institutional demand, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been on the rise over the past few days, surging to a new all-time high of $118,000. The uptrend forced a massive wave of liquidations across the market, with short sellers taking the biggest hit. According to CoinGlass, more than $1 billion in short positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours alone, marking the largest daily liquidation event in four years.

2025-07-11T14:15:07,"The most active crypto ATM users were scam victims, Australia police warns","Tasmania Police contacted 15 of the top crypto ATM users in the area to discover that they all fell victim to scams. The investigation found no legitimate activity among the highest-volume users statewide. Combined losses reached $2.5 million, including $900,000 deposited through cryptocurrency ATMs. Since 2021, the number of crypto ATMs in Tasmania has increased from one to 20 machines. Police investigation reveals widespread crypto ATM scam activity Tasmania Police contacted more than 15 Tasmanians suspected of being money mules and scam victims. The operation was part of a national action to combat criminal use of cryptocurrency ATMs . Tasmania Police Cyber Investigations discovered no legitimate activity among the top 15 users. All the victims had been engaged in some scam activities on various platforms. All 15 of them lost a total of $2.5 million from scam activities, directly transferring approximately $900,000 via cryptocurrency ATMs in the scams. Detective Sergeant Paul Turner said crypto ATM numbers rose from one to 20. Expansion was seen throughout Tasmania since 2021, providing more opportunities for scams. Victims are exposed to manipulation, intimidation, and coercion tactics by international criminal syndicates. There are typical types of scams, including romance scams, investment scams, government impersonation scams, and tech support scams. Utility scams and job offer scams also target crypto ATM users. Scammers send victims to crypto ATMs after banks implemented friction in transactions. High-value scams have severe and long-term impacts on victims in communities. Pensions leave victims dependent or compel them into asset disposal. Postponement of retirement may even be necessary while families take up support roles economically. The report also claims that the reduced economic activity from such losses impacts the welfare of Tasmania . Red flags include solicitations by unfamiliar individuals and tight timing. Promised profits guaranteed usually signal investment scams for vulnerable groups. Global crypto ATM expansion continues despite regulatory concerns The global crypto ATM network expanded with over 1,000 new machines installed worldwide. Total numbers rose from 37,722 at the start of the year to 38,726 by June. The United States rebounded in Q2 after a Q1 decline, adding 500 machines. US installations reached 30,447 total machines by mid-year through improved regulatory clarity. Increased institutional participation drove growth across multiple states and regions. Australia led relative growth, adding 491 new ATMs during the first half. Growing retail take-up and benign fintech environment underpinned Australian growth rates. Canada installed 245 ATMs and Europe 149 new machines. These markets demonstrate sustained take-up even as regulatory pressure increases elsewhere. New Zealand announced plans to ban crypto ATMs in AML and CFT reforms. Cash conversion to high-risk assets was identified by the government as a key concern. Facilitating illicit transactions with these machines prompted the choice of the regulatory reaction. Australia introduced new operating rules and transaction limits for crypto operators. A $5,000 cap applies to cash deposits and withdrawals at machines. Enhanced customer due diligence and mandatory scam warnings became requirements recently. Australians lost over $3 million to crypto ATM scams since January. 150 unique scam reports were filed with average losses exceeding $20,000. Nearly half of the victims were over 51 years old, with a female majority. Law enforcement operations identified 90 scam victims and suspected money mules. One woman in her 70s lost over $430,000 through romance scams. Investment fraud and extortion emails commonly target crypto ATM users. Scammers exploit crypto ATMs after bank transaction friction The victims are directed to crypto ATMs by the scammers after banks create tension when customers try to deposit suspicious funds. The scammers then direct victims to cryptocurrency machines. Detective Sergeant Turner cautions people to heed bank warning messages. Family and friends, and the police too, can be stabilizing resources when victims are being misled. Rushed timescales and urgent language usually indicate customer scams. Cash deposit requests from strangers are usually scams. Unrealistically high return assurances and profit guarantees are red flags. Investment scams offer unrealistic profit, and romance scams target emotional connections.

2025-07-11T14:11:43,"Find out why crypto is up today and the best altcoins to buy","The crypto market gained steam on Friday, July 11, with Bitcoin and most altcoins jumping by over 5%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to nearly $120,000, while the crypto Fear and Greed Index moved to the greed zone of 65. The total market capitalization of all coins jumped to over $3.6 trillion. Why crypto is up today Crypto prices rallied ahead of the upcoming crypto week , during which politicians in Washington will consider three major bills. One of them is GENIUS, which will regulate stablecoins and has already passed in the Senate. Lawmakers will also consider the CLARITY Act, which separates the roles between the SEC and the CFTC. Additionally, regulators will review a bill to ban Central Bank Digital Currencies in the U.S. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also moving higher due to hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September and continue through 2026. Some Fed officials, like Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman, have called for a rate cut as soon as this month.

Trump, who has called for a 300 basis point cut, has hinted that he will only nominate an official who will cut rates. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies historically perform well in a low-interest-rate environment. Further, crypto is rising due to increasing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows, which signal strong demand from American investors. Bitcoin ETFs have added over $51 billion in inflows since inception, while Ethereum funds crossed the $5 billion milestone. In a note to crypto.news, Premyslaw Kral, the CEO of Zondacrypto, said: “We’re observing increased interest from institutional players, largely in the form of ETFs, which have significantly changed the reality of the crypto industry, alongside simple capital inflows, as observed now on the BTC market.” There are also hopes that the Chinese government will legalize cryptocurrencies. A top regulator told a conference that the government was studying digital coins. Unbanning cryptocurrencies would likely lead to increased demand from Chinese individuals and retail investors. Best altcoins to buy in this crypto bull run Analysts, including Arthur Hayes believe that the altoin season is around the corner. Such a move would benefit many altcoins, especially meme coins. Some of the best meme coins to consider are the popular names like Pepe ( PEPE ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ). Top utility cryptocurrencies, especially those with high ETF approval hopes like Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ), will be the other top beneficiaries of this bull run. Other top altcoins to buy are Chainlink, Quant, and Hedera Hashgraph.

The rally is lifting the whole crypto market, and bold predictions are flooding in. NBA legend Scottie Pippen also jumped in to comment on Bitcoin’s new all-time high. He shared a bold message to his followers on X, saying, “SEND EVERYTHING HIGHER.” He didn’t mention just Bitcoin, but also included major altcoins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, XRP, Cardano, and Solana. His overly bullish message has the crypto crowd buzzing, who are calling for a continued market rise. SEND EVERYTHING HIGHER $BTC $ETH $SOL $XRP $BALL @Game5Ball $ADA $LINK $DOGE $SHIB — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 11, 2025 The broader market is also riding the wave with gains across the board. Traders are watching closely for a move above $120,000. Altcoins Riding the Wave Bitcoin’s breakout has reignited the crypto market, acting as a liquidity trigger and pushing capital into altcoins. Ethereum is nearing $3,000 with strong ETF inflows, Solana has reclaimed $160 and is eyeing $200, while tokens like SHIB, AVAX, and HYPE also posted impressive gains. Analysts see this as a broader market shift, with BTC leading the charge and altcoins following fast. Investors further expect new all-time highs in the second half of the year, fueled by rising corporate Bitcoin buying and progress on U.S. crypto legislation. Bitcoin spot ETFs also saw a massive $1.18 billion net inflow on Thursday, the second largest in history. Ethereum spot ETFs saw $383 million in net inflows. Bullish Forecasts from Crypto Experts Former Binance CEO also shared a simple yet powerful message. He asked his followers not to panic if they missed buying Bitcoin when it was cheaper, as he notes that there will be more chances. While governments can keep printing money, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which will make it more valuable over time. Remember I said the gigachad bullrun is coming.

He predicts Bitcoin will soar to $250,000, and trillions will flow into altcoins. He points to the upcoming Genius and Clarity Acts as the key catalysts that will unlock massive growth. However, Peter Schiff, a well-known Bitcoin critic and gold supporter, says that this might be the perfect time to sell Bitcoin and buy silver.

2025-07-11T14:07:24,"Bitcoin back to $118,000 after teasing bulls with $120,000 milestone breach","Bitcoin just hit $120,000 for the first time ever early Friday, before sliding slightly to around $117,297.10 by the afternoon. That’s a solid 5% jump in less than 24 hours, fueled mostly by a flood of cash into Bitcoin ETFs, according to Coinglass , which also showed that Thursday saw the highest daily short liquidation in four years, totaling around $2.42 billion. The earlier peak, $118,872.85, came overnight and broke past the previous May high. This jump also pulled Ether up with it. The second-largest crypto climbed nearly 6% to $2,976.90, after briefly crossing back above $3,000 for the first time since February. The rise didn’t come from nowhere. Those Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.18 billion flow in yesterday, the biggest single-day inflow of 2025. That’s the kind of cash wave that moves mountains. Ether ETFs weren’t quiet either, pulling in $383.1 million, their second-largest haul ever, according to data from SoSoValue. While BTC kept rising, stocks tied to it started cooling. Mining firms Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms were up just 2.5% and 1.5%, while Strategy, the one everyone treats as a Bitcoin stock, climbed nearly 3%. Platforms like Coinbase, Robinhood, Circle, and eToro barely moved at all. ETFs flood with cash after Fed minutes The rally didn’t exactly begin with fireworks. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve published its meeting minutes, showing officials are split on how fast to cut interest rates. Some want to hold off. Some want to go harder. The market read that as a green light, and Bitcoin started creeping up. By market close, it was surging. The rally was also helped by a run-up in tech stocks. Markus Thielen, CEO at 10x Research, said that was the moment traders began breaking through the “top range.” He expects the next Fed chair , assuming Donald Trump follows through on replacing Jerome Powell, to take a softer stance. “We also know that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug,” Markus added, pointing to the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’, which could raise the federal deficit and end up being another boost for Bitcoin. Another thing pushing Bitcoin up was short liquidations. Over the last day, more than $650 million in short bets against Bitcoin were wiped out. Those are traders who borrowed Bitcoin to bet against it, then had to buy it back when the price spiked, pushing it even higher. Ether shorts weren’t safe either, losing over $215 million in the same window. This kind of domino effect, where short sellers get forced out, adds more fuel to the fire. Fed pressure, Trump threat, and summer slowdowns Bitcoin ETFs weren’t attracting this kind of money a few months ago. That changed around April 17, when talk started heating up about Powell’s job. That week, Trump said “termination” of Powell might be necessary due to the Fed’s rate stance. That’s when the ETF inflows started growing fast. Since then, total inflows have reached almost $16 billion. Now, Bitcoin bulls are watching Congress. A crypto bill could pass soon, and treasury departments from large companies are still adding Bitcoin to their holdings. Those two trends, more demand from corporations and better regulation, are keeping the rally going. But it could still stall if something big happens in global markets. “Powell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not,” said Markus. “So we have to take the market relatively short-term.” There’s also the seasonal effect. Markus pointed out that summer usually means less trading from equity funds. “Normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer,” he said. That means Bitcoin could either coast or get choppy, depending on who stays active.

2025-07-11T14:06:25,"Stocks slip amid Trump’s tariff threats, Bitcoin spike buoys crypto stocks","U.S. stocks slipped on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening 250 points lower following President Donald Trump’s 35% tariff against Canada. With stocks having reached new all-time highs in recent weeks, trading on July 11 was largely a reaction to fresh trade war concerns. As the Dow fell 250 points, the S&P 500 pared gains at -0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.3%.. However, Bitcoin ( BTC ) bucked the trend, rising by about 5% in 24 hours to hit a new all-time high above $118,000. The crypto bellwether’s performance ignited bullish moves across the altcoin market, with Ethereum ( ETH ) crossing above the psychological $3,000 level. Bitcoin ’s rally lifted crypto stocks, with MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), and Robinhood (HOOD) gaining in premarket trading. MSTR was up 2% in early trading after the U.S. stock market opened, while COIN and HOOD had pared their premarket gains.

This followed President Trump’s announcement of a 50% duty rate on Brazil earlier in the week. While Trump has added to the jitters with remarks that he sees another 15% to 20% blanket tariffs against many of the U.S. trading partners, stocks remain near their all-time highs . “I think the tariffs have been very well-received. The stock market hit a new high today,” Trump said during an interview with NBC News. Overall investor optimism, however, may dissipate if there’s a flare-up in trade wars—a scenario China recently warned of as Trump threatened tough tariffs on members of the emerging market economics bloc dubbed BRICS. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are the founding members, but the group has expanded to include Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates among others.

2025-07-11T14:04:40,"Bitcoin Hits New ATH, Altcoins Rocket, Trump’s Latest Tariffs: Your Weekly Crypto Recap","It was a historic week for the cryptocurrency market and its leader, which finally broke out of consolidation and skyrocketed to a new all-time high. There were very few actual signs of what was about to happen in the past few weeks. Recall that BTC had dumped below $100,000 during the Israel-Iran conflict, and even though it quickly bounced to a six-digit price territory, it remained in a tight range between $105,000 and $110,000. These boundaries managed to confine the asset for a couple of weeks despite a few breakout attempts. However, that all changed in the middle of the current business week when the primary cryptocurrency began a massive leg up that broke the upper boundary on Wednesday, and it quickly spiked to a fresh peak at $112,000. Although it retraced slightly in the following hours, its run was just getting started. On Thursday evening, bitcoin flew to $113,000 and later $116,000 . The gains continued on Friday as the cryptocurrency flew to almost $119,000 to register its current all-time high. Despite losing some ground since then and retracing to just over $117,000 as of press time, it’s still up by 8% weekly. Its market cap has shot up to $2.340 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit this week and is down to 62.4%. The reason for this is that many altcoins have marked mindblowing weekly pumps. Some of the leaders include ETH (17%), XRP (20%), DOGE (20%), ADA (30%), SUI (20%), LINK (17%), XLM (39%), and HBAR (32%). HYPE is also up by double digits (17%) and pumped to a new all-time high of over $46. These impressive price increases come as a bit of a surprise, given the latest tariff developments from Trump against other countries. In the past week alone, the POTUS has announced numerous tariffs against Canada, the EU, the UK, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and other nations, some of which are up to 35%.
