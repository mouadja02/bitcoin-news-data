2025-07-11T06:46:01,"Here’s why Hyperlane price has surged over 100% today","Hyperlane’s native token, HYPER, extended its rally for a second consecutive day following its listing on two premier South Korean exchanges. According to data from crypto.news, Hyperlane ( HYPER ) rallied to an all-time high of $0.66 on July 11, morning Asian time, before stabilizing near $0.61 at the time of writing. This marks a 100% gain in the past 24 hours and a cumulative increase of over 450% over the last two trading sessions. The rally unfolded in a markedly high-volume trading environment, with daily turnover exceeding $4.1 billion, an increase of more than 3,000% from prior averages. Concurrently, open interest in HYPER futures contracts climbed 147% to a record $186.5 million, indicating growing speculative interest and positioning from derivatives traders anticipating further upside. This sharp price appreciation is primarily attributed to the token’s listing in KRW trading pairs on both Upbit and Bithumb . While HYPER had previously been available in BTC and USDT pairs on Upbit since late May, the earlier listings led to only modest gains . The new KRW pairings, however, seem to have enhanced accessibility and liquidity for South Korean investors, resulting in an immediate surge in buying activity .

The strong demand for the KRW trading pair among South Korean investors is clear from the fact that most of today’s trading volume came from Upbit, which recorded $2.6 billion. Binance and Bithumb followed with $384 million and $246 million, respectively. For the uninitiated, Hyperlane functions as a permissionless interoperability protocol, offering modular messaging and bridging solutions across Layer 1 chains, rollups, and app-specific chains. It enables developers to deploy freely, configure tailored security models, and build cross‑chain applications with ease. The HYPER token powers the protocol by supporting validator staking, protocol governance, and usage incentives. Hyper price analysis From a technical perspective, HYPER’s price broke out of a descending resistance trendline, invalidating over three months of bearish structure. HYPER 1-day price chart — July 11 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators, including the RSI and MACD, are both at multi-month highs, signaling strong bullish momentum. Importantly, neither indicator has produced a bearish divergence yet, supporting the case for continued upward movement. HYPER MACD and RSI chart — July 11 | Source: crypto.news The next significant resistance level lies at the psychological $7 mark, which, if broken, could open the path for further price discovery. However, the rally may face short-term resistance as exchange wallet balances have jumped by 34% in the last 24 hours, according to Nansen, now holding 34.54 million tokens. This is often a sign that early investors may be positioning to lock in profits, which could introduce some selling pressure in the short term.

Here Are The Predictions","Investments in options that predict the Bitcoin price will surpass $140,000 by the end of September have surpassed $868 million, according to data from cryptocurrency derivatives exchange Deribit. The transactions in question consist of “call options,” which involve the expectation that the price will rise above $140,000 on the specified expiration date (September 26). Call options are known as products where investors take bullish positions. Market participants' expectations for July were already bullish. 10x Research CEO Markus Thielen predicted Bitcoin could reach $116,000 in July, while Bitwise analysts had a bolder forecast targeting $136,000.

While Bitcoin’s fresh all-time high helped, there’s more to this rally than just market momentum. According to popular crypto analyst Dr Altcoin, Pi may have already hit its lowest price, and we might never see $0.40 again. Here’s what’s giving him that confidence. Dr Altcoin Says $0.40 Was Pi’s Final Bottom Dr Altcoin believes Pi Coin’s recent dip to $0.40 may have been its last major low. It’s now been over a week since it touched that zone, and he sees no signs of it falling back, especially with a major shift happening in its token supply. According to Pi Scan data , the amount of unlocked Pi hitting the market will shrink by about 30%, dropping to just 116 million coins by the end of August. That means fewer coins available for selling, which could reduce pressure on the price and help it move higher naturally. It has been over a week since Pi dropped to the $0.4 range. It is unlikely to fall further, especially as we approach the end of August, when the amount of unlocked Pi is expected to decrease by at least 30%. If my prediction is correct, this month’s price will be the lowest Pi… pic.twitter.com/CTcDgpmkza — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) July 10, 2025 Pi’s Big AI Bet Could Be the Game-Changer At the same time, Pi Network is entering the AI space with full force. Its new Pi AI Studio allows developers to build and launch AI projects within the ecosystem. This move could greatly increase real-world use of Pi Coin. Community analyst Mr. Spock believes this could be a game-changer. If Pi captures just 1% of the projected $16 trillion AI market by 2030, its market cap could reach $160 billion, a huge leap from its current $3.97 billion. That could send Pi’s price soaring past $22 in the long term, a 46x gain from where it is now. Bitcoin’s Rally Pushes Pi Higher Bitcoin’s rally to a new all-time high has also lifted the entire crypto market, and Pi is riding the wave. It recently broke above $0.45 and is now holding strong at $0.52. This is the token’s first real upward momentum this month, and many see it as a sign that Pi is entering a new phase of growth.

According to a July 11 announcement, Pump.fun has already begun integrating Kolscan’s features into its platform, describing the acquisition as a move that would “enable better products for both Kolscan and Pump.fun users” while introducing “totally new experiences” to the onchain trading space. we’re excited to announce that pump fun has acquired @kolscan Kolscan is a wallet tracker that monitors the activities of top onchain traders. it provides realtime transactions, token PnL, and a leaderboard ranking their performance our integration will not only enable better… pic.twitter.com/V4VDcOwVeG — pump.fun (@pumpdotfun) July 10, 2025 Kolscan is a real-time analytics tool that tracks the activity of top onchain traders, also referred to as key opinion leaders (KOLs). It offers wallet-level insights into token holdings, live transactions, and trading performance. One of its central features is a dynamic leaderboard ranking traders based on their profit and loss performance, allowing users to monitor and compare the strategies of influential traders in the Solana ecosystem. You might also like: Bitget Wallet launches new Pump.fun integrated mobile app for meme coin trading Pump.fun co-founder Alon Cohen has confirmed that Kolscan will remain free to use, and the platform has planned a series of improvements to enhance data accuracy, speed up trade updates, and introduce new tools for tracking and copying top-performing strategies. Cohen said the acquisition aligns with his belief that “onchain trading is a social sport,” where users not only speculate but also trade alongside friends and compare performance. According to Cohen, products that “provide social insights/tools and gamify the trading experience” are key to Pump.fun’s continued growth. Previously, the token deployer had introduced the livestreaming feature , which was temporarily suspended and later relaunched with moderation systems in place after users began abusing the tool to broadcast harmful and violent content. Pump.fun’s move to acquire Kolscan also comes as the platform faces mounting pressure to stay ahead of the competition. After dominating the Solana memecoin scene earlier this year, its market share has slipped below 60% and revenue has also declined , while rivals like LetsBonk continue to gain traction. The integration of Kolscan may help Pump.fun reassert its edge by adding utility and transparency that go beyond simple token deployment. Meanwhile, the Kolscan acquisition comes just ahead of Pump.fun’s highly anticipated ICO and can be seen as a strategic move to bolster investor confidence by demonstrating the platform’s commitment to expanding its ecosystem and enhancing user experience through social and data-driven features. As previously reported by crypto.news, the ICO will offer 15% of the total PUMP token supply, equivalent to 150 billion tokens, at a price of $0.004 each. An additional 18% has already been sold to institutional investors under the same terms.

Source: Cryptonews The milestone comes as Bitcoin surges to new all-time highs above $118,400, creating perfect storm conditions for the second-largest cryptocurrency to begin its own parabolic advance. The breakthrough follows a grueling eight-month battle that saw Ethereum decline from January’s opening near $3,298 to its cycle low in April. Historical price data reveals a volatile journey through 2025, with February closing around $2,900, March at $2,650, and the devastating April collapse to $1,794 before recovery began. President Trump’s recent declaration on Truth Social that crypto is “ through the roof “ has triggered massive buying pressure across digital asset markets. Bitcoin price prediction as $BTC explodes past $113K record levels targeting $120K by tomorrow following Trump's explosive crypto endorsement declaring it's going ""through the roof"". $120K tomorrow? #Bitcoin #ATH #Trump https://t.co/QZaaKfinrt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 10, 2025 The timing of Trump’s endorsement, combined with unprecedented dollar weakness, has created ideal conditions for risk asset appreciation, with institutional investors interpreting this as a signal of continued monetary accommodation. The Ethereum breakout coincides with Bitcoin’s explosive rally past $117,000, which liquidated over $1.14 billion in leveraged positions within 24 hours. Over $243 million in Ethereum liquidations alone contributed to the market-wide short squeeze, which pushed both cryptocurrencies to new highs. Dollar Collapse Fuels Crypto Rally Across Major Assets Trump’s proposed 300-basis-point interest rate cut has created massive tailwinds for alternative assets, as the dollar experiences its worst performance since 1973. The Dollar Index has fallen 10.1% year-to-date, trading 6.5 points below its 200-day moving average, the largest margin in 21 years. The emergency-level monetary intervention into a growing economy, with an annual growth rate of 3.8%, would push inflation above 5% while driving the dollar down an additional 10%. Historical precedent warns against such aggressive policy, as the Federal Reserve has never implemented cuts exceeding 75 basis points outside recession periods. Kobeissi Letter analysis projects dramatic asset price inflation following potential rate cuts, with gold targeting $ 5,000 per ounce and continued capital flight into cryptocurrencies. It's official: President Trump is now calling for the first 300+ basis point interest rate cut in US history. This would be 3 TIMES larger than the 100 bps cut on March 15th, 2020, the largest in history. So, what happens if the Fed does this? Let us explain. (a thread) pic.twitter.com/k3Bo0ri1zY — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 9, 2025 Bitcoin’s correlation with dollar weakness positions digital assets as primary beneficiaries of monetary debasement and currency depreciation. Corporate treasury adoption accelerates as companies seek protection from currency debasement, with over $1 billion allocated to crypto treasuries this week alone. The institutional revolution combines with retail FOMO to create sustained buying pressure. Bitcoin ETFs have purchased $15 billion worth of BTC since mid-April , according to 10X Research, with steady institutional demand supporting higher trading ranges. Trump’s crypto-friendly policies include establishing a national crypto reserve and appointing pro-crypto officials to key regulatory positions. Technical Analysis Confirms Bullish Breakout Pattern Ethereum’s daily chart reveals a textbook breakout scenario following months of consolidation within a descending channel pattern. The asset spent considerable time forming lower highs and lows, ranging from $4,000 to $1,500, before breaking decisively above the Ichimoku cloud resistance. Source: SMART_MONEY_FLOW_SMF on TradingViews The Ichimoku cloud breakout represents a shift from bearish to bullish momentum, with price definitively reclaiming the psychological $3,000 level. The technical setup establishes $2,950-$3,050 as key support after the breakout, with ascending projections targeting $3,600, $4,200, and $4,800. In fact, according to MerlijnTheTrader , the weekly perspective provides even stronger bullish confirmation, showing a clean reclamation of the $2,200 resistance with minimal pullbacks. The price action indicates strong buying pressure across timeframes, with blue arrow projections extending toward $10,000 based on historical bull market patterns. The broader context of Bitcoin establishing new highs above $117,000 provides additional momentum for Ethereum, which historically outperforms Bitcoin in percentage terms during parabolic phases. Previous resistance levels at $4,000 represent the next major target given historical significance as cycle highs. Key risk factors include failing to hold above the $2,800-$2,900 support level, which could indicate false breakout scenarios and potential retests of the $2,200 levels. However, current momentum and institutional participation suggest a continued upward trajectory toward $4,000 initially. Based on technical indicators and market structure, Ethereum is positioned for continued appreciation toward $3,600-$4,200 in the near term, with the potential for an extension to $4,000+ if Bitcoin’s momentum sustains.

Although crypto is banned, the interest hasn’t faded. From regulators to tech giants, enthusiasm for digital currencies, especially stablecoins, is heating up fast. A recent report from Reuters shows that Chinese regulators are renewing their focus on the sector. Shanghai Officials Explore Stablecoin Strategy This week, the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission held a key meeting with local officials to explore strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies. This shows a shift in tone in the country’s approach. He Qing, head of the Shanghai regulator, stressed the need to pay closer attention to new technologies and to do more research on digital currencies. The meeting was attended by about 60–70 people. Since Shanghai is China’s main financial center, it often takes the lead in testing new government policies and regulatory changes. At the meeting, a policy expert from Guotai Haitong Securities broke down the basics of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, discussed the global regulatory trends, highlighted the risks and opportunities of stablecoins, and offered policy advice for digital assets growth. Tech Giants Push For Yuan-based Stablecoin China tech giants like JD.com and Ant Group are also urging the central bank to allow Yuan-based stablecoins to compete with US-dollar-backed crypto. Both companies plan to apply for licenses in Hong Kong, where new stablecoin rules take effect on August 1. Stablecoins are gaining global momentum. With the U.S. ahead with advanced crypto regulations, major companies like Amazon and Walmart are also exploring stablecoin projects. Crypto Hype Meets Warning Signs However, making changes in China will not be easy. Just last month, central bank governor Pan Gongsheng warned that the rise of digital currencies and stablecoins brings major regulatory challenges. China banned crypto trading and mining in 2021 over concerns about financial stability. Recently, a Chinese industry group has warned investors about scams linked to stablecoins. The Beijing Internet Finance Association said some groups are using the hype around stablecoins to promote fake high-return schemes disguised as financial innovation. The association has warned that these activities can quickly turn into crimes like illegal fundraising, fraud, pyramid schemes, and money laundering. Rising Interest in Digital Assets But the surge in interest is clear as an index tracking stablecoin-related stocks in China has jumped 88% over the past three months. A similar index in Hong Kong has more than doubled. Digital currencies are gaining ground fast. Bitcoin has been breaking records lately. Just today, it is up over $118,000, hitting a record high.

(Technical Analysis)","Summary Cryptocurrencies are in a frenzy, and this happens after months of muted performance and range-bound markets despite the cryptos’ tendency to generate lots of market movement. Daily Bitcoin charts are showing decent strength in the most recent moves up - particularly after war fears failed to create a strong reversal in prices. The latest gap down just breaching the $100,000 mark quickly got bought by dip buyers. With Bitcoin making all-time highs, it might drag up other altcoins with it. Some names like ADA, SUI, XRP and others are getting lifted by the newfound bullish sentiment. By Elior Manier A thesis of failed opportunities by sellers to send the crypto market to correct lower had been a sign of a potential move to new all-time highs, which just happened on Thursday. Cryptocurrencies are in a frenzy, and this happens after months of muted performance and range-bound markets despite the cryptos’ tendency to generate lots of market movement. A general trend of entries from financial institutions into cryptocurrencies, allowed by progressively lenient regulations, is bringing non-negligible flows and adding an even more solid backstop demand to digital assets. Traditional investors are progressively entering the most recent primary market through ETFs, with the latest ETF launch opening the door for Solana. This comes amid market participants trying to diversify from the US dollar. Trump’s frantic policy is creating significant uncertainty, particularly for the Federal Reserve, which is seeing chances of losing some of its political independence. The US President is doing the most to influence the Fed board members, regularly insulting Jerome Powell on his Truth Social. The latest move to all-time highs liquidated many participants who were betting on no more new highs for Bitcoin - you can take a look at these flows right here . A $600M liquidation won’t be enough to take markets to continuous all-time highs; however, with a real appetite for risk and technology investments (as seen with the Nasdaq making daily ATHs), the move might just continue. Bitcoin Daily and Intra-Day analysis Bitcoin Daily Chart Bitcoin Daily Chart, July 10, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Daily Bitcoin charts are showing decent strength in the most recent moves up - particularly after war fears failed to create a strong reversal in prices. The latest gap down just breaching the $100,000 mark quickly got bought by dip buyers. Failed patterns in technical analysis tend to be major signs of reversals, as is currently the case in crypto markets. After breaching the $113,000 level, Fibonacci extensions (127% to 138%) point to potential resistance at $120,000, and a further breakout to potential key resistance at $135,000 (161.8%). You can check this guideline on how to spot potential resistances and new zones of interest in price discovery with Fibonacci extensions with this article. Bitcoin 2H Charts Bitcoin 2H Chart, July 10, 2025 (Source: TradingView) Range-bound conditions in the world's leading cryptocurrency had built up Volume-At-Price at its all-time highs - good conditions to launch the crypto to discover new levels. A fail to retest again the lower end of the 100,000-110,000 range led to buyers stepping in before, leading to the current impulsive move. A measured move using the previous impulse points to a 115,000 minor potential resistance. The RSI is largely overbought, which may calm the buying flows, however only temporarily. It will be interesting to look at the reaction to a potential retest of the 110,000 pivot to spot if more buyers step in. In the meantime, the direction has higher probabilities of more upside than downside, that is if nothing crazy happens in macro. Crypto Market Cap Crypto Total Market Cap, July 10, 2025 (Source: TradingView) The overall market cap still hasn't caught up to the December 2024 $3.86T highs, and the way this impulsive move is going, it seems that except for any surprising negative surprise or geopolitical turmoil, we should be at least going back to the previous highs. Markets are currently standing about 6% to the market cap highs. With Bitcoin making all-time highs, it might drag up other altcoins with it.

Bybit alone saw $461 million in liquidations, with over 93% of those being shorts. Binance and HTX followed closely with $204 million and $193 million in liquidations, respectively. Bitcoin ETF Demand Keeps Climbing Bitcoin touched a new all-time high above $118,000 today, with investor demand still rising through spot ETFs. Over $15 billion has now flowed into these products since they launched, and data shows institutional buying hasn’t slowed down. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF alone holds more than 700,000 BTC, and its rising revenue now rivals some of BlackRock’s biggest legacy offerings. Analysts suggest this kind of steady inflow is helping to stabilize price action and may continue to support Bitcoin through the summer. Traders Reposition Ahead of Potential Rate Cuts Alongside ETF demand, the broader macro environment is also playing a role. With Donald Trump pushing for aggressive interest rate cuts , potentially down to 1%, risk assets like Bitcoin are seeing renewed appeal. Traders are now positioning for what they expect could be a friendlier environment for crypto under future policy shifts. Many are piling into call options at higher strike prices, including $130,000, showing that sentiment remains strong. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why is Crypto Going Up Today ? , Altcoins Follow the Breakout Ethereum is also making headlines . In a rare flip, ETH surpassed Bitcoin in 24-hour futures volume, suggesting trader focus may be broadening beyond BTC. With growing expectations around a spot ETH ETF approval, Ethereum may be next in line for a surge in institutional attention. XRP jumped above $2.57, DOGE crossed $0.19, and Solana posted a 5% gain, all on the back of renewed market optimism. The broad-based rally suggests traders are rotating into altcoins after accumulating Bitcoin, anticipating wider market gains if ETF inflows and regulatory clarity continue. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T06:22:51,"Bitcoin hits new high above $118K as BTC ETFs see over $1B in inflows on Thursday","Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $118,000 early Friday, fueled by rising institutional demand and strong signals from across the crypto industry. As per CoinMarketCap data, the coin reached an all-time high of $118,403. The world’s largest cryptocurrency gained over 6% in the past 24 hours, trading at $118,376 at the time of writing. The rally coincided with a sharp spike in inflows to spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds, which recorded $1.18 billion on Thursday—the second-highest daily total since their launch. Short-sellers were hit hard by the move, with more than $1 billion in crypto short positions liquidated in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass. Of the $1.01 billion in liquidations, roughly $570 million came from Bitcoin shorts and $206.93 million from Ether shorts, affecting 232,149 traders. The broader crypto market also rallied, with total market capitalization rising 5% to $3.66 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC ETF inflows continue hot streak Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded massive inflows on July 10, with total net additions touching $1.18 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT led with $448.5 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC at $324.3 million and Ark’s ARKB at $268.7 million.

Cumulatively, over the six trading sessions starting July 2, total net inflows across all issuers stood at $2.69 billion. The sustained buying reflects renewed institutional demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated ETF products, amid improving sentiment in the broader crypto market. ETH breaches $3,000 Ethereum surged past $3,000 on Thursday, briefly touching the $3,030 mark for the first time in five months, as buying momentum gathered pace. The rally, echoing Bitcoin’s strength, was fueled by a combination of market-wide bullishness and strong inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. ETH gained over 6% in the past 24 hours and more than 15% over the last three days. US spot Ethereum ETFs saw net inflows of $383 million on the day, their fifth straight session of positive flows. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) accounted for the bulk of the activity, pulling in $300.9 million.

This comes amid a heated rally in the broader cryptocurrency market where BTC’s price just reached a new all-time high above $118,000. Ironically, some warning signs are starting to pop already.

Source: TradingView But why is this a worrying signal? Well, there are certain things that the crypto community has playfully earmarked as bad news in the past few cycles. For instance, whenever you start seeing Jim Cramer talking about how Bitcoin is the greatest asset and that he owns millions of it, it’s time to unpack. The Ethereum Foundation selling has kind of been the same sign, at least on multiple occasions. The entity sells ETH to fund development and it’s usually offloading during rallies, oftentimes marking local tops. Of course, that’s not always the case. For example, last year, it sold different batches of ETH in September, October, and November, while the cryptocurrency achieved a local top in December. The post Top Signal?

2025-07-11T06:02:09,"Prominent Cryptocurrency Analyst Shares Scenario Predicting Bitcoin Price Day by Day: “First to $444,000, then…”","Cryptocurrency analyst Fred Krueger shared a noteworthy scenario during the days when Bitcoin reached historic highs. Titled “The Great Treasury Bubble,” this scenario fictionally chronicles how Bitcoin rose to $444,000 through institutional treasuries from August 2025 to August 2026, before falling dramatically to $84,000. Krueger's script progresses day by day as follows: August 11, 2025: With Bitcoin at $132,000, Japanese company Metaplanet purchased an additional 5,445 BTC, bringing its total holdings to a symbolic 21,000 BTC. This purchase was financed by a 100 billion yen BTC-backed loan from Goldman Sachs Japan and a new Strategy-like yield product, JSTRK. By the end of the day, BTC had risen to $138,000. August 21, 2025: US-based Strategy announced the acquisition of 20,000 BTC. Funding was provided through convertible bonds and balance sheet leverage. BTC exceeds $150,000. September 15, 2025: Companies like Galaxy Digital, Riot, and GameStop also joined the BTC treasury strategy. ETF inflows skyrocketed. BTC: $178,000. October 7, 2025: BTC surpasses $201,000. Strategy launches new high-yield institutional product, STRK+. January 12, 2026: BTC reaches $296,000. Metaplanet announced it refinanced its debt with 15% interest. JSTRK trading broke records in Osaka. April 6, 2026: Bitcoin peaks at $444,000. Strategy published its report, “Bitcoin is now the core currency of modern businesses.” It also hedged 3,000 BTC with bearish options. In Krueger's scenario, the collapse begins from here: April 16, 2026: Strategy sells 1,100 BTC to acquire waste management company AmeriPure. CFO: Wall Street shaken. May 18, 2026: Metaplanet acquired the logistics company OsakaLogix. 4,000 BTC was hedged. June 23, 2026: Internal Strategy memos leaked, claiming STRK+ investors were not paid. BTC collateral was seized. BTC fell 22% in one day to $330,000. July 10, 2026: Metaplanet announced it sold 6,000 BTC and shifted its focus to cash-generating sectors. BTC: $196,000. August 10, 2026: A year later, Bitcoin plummets to $84,000. The strategy is under regulatory scrutiny. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T06:00:53,"Solana Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle—Next Stop $164?","Solana has shown a potential breakout from a Symmetrical Triangle. Here’s where the next price target could lie, according to an analyst. Solana Has Surged Above Symmetrical Triangle Resistance In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how Solana has just broken a resistance line. The level in question is part of a Symmetrical Triangle, a pattern from technical analysis (TA). This pattern belongs to the class of triangles, formations that involve the asset trading within two converging trendlines. The upper line acts as a source of resistance, while the lower one as that of support. A break out of either of these levels implies a continuation of trend in that direction. A surge above the triangle is a bullish sign and a drop under it a bearish one. Since the price’s range becomes narrower as it travels within a triangle, a breakout can become more likely as it approaches the apex. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breakout Not Just Hype—$4.4B Inflows Back The Move Generally, triangle breakouts are considered to be of the same length as the height of the formation (that is, the distance between the upper and lower trendlines at their widest). There are three popular triangle types: Ascending, Descending, and Symmetrical. The first and second variants have one trendline parallel to the time-axis. In the case of the Ascending type, it’s the upper level. This means that as Solana moves inside an Ascending Triangle, its range gets narrower toward a net upside. Similarly, the Descending Triangle involves the opposite setup, with the support line being parallel to the time-axis instead. The third type, the Symmetrical Triangle, is the middle ground between the two: it has the two trendlines approaching each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope. In other words, the Symmetrical Triangle represents a period of consolidation where the range gets narrower in true sideways fashion. Due to this fact, a breakout is more-or-less equally probable to occur in either direction. In contrast, there is a bias associated in Ascending and Descending Triangles. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the Symmetrical Triangle Solana was trading inside just earlier: As is visible in the above graph, the Solana price was nearing in on the end of the triangle and as probability would dictate, a breakout was becoming likely. The asset indeed ended up finding a break and it seems to have been in the up direction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Moving With Stocks, But Ethereum’s Correlation Is Fading So what could be next for SOL? According to the analyst, the asset might target $164.

2025-07-11T05:29:07,"Crypto Whale James Wynn Liquidated in 12 Hours as BTC Soared to New Peaks","TL;DR The popular crypto whale going by the X handle James Wynn suffered another painful liquidation, at least for one of their visible wallets, tracked by Lookonchain. This came as bitcoin’s price surge kept going in the past 12 hours or so, hitting a fresh all-time high above $117,000. James Wynn’s $BTC short position got fully liquidated in less than 12 hours, resulting in another loss of $27,921.63! https://t.co/205yuTcrz1 pic.twitter.com/AyVORksque — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 11, 2025 What’s particularly interesting about today’s liquidation is the amount of time BTC needed to prove the naysayer wrong – under 12 hours. Wynn opened the trade yesterday on Hyperliquid by depositing almost $28,000 and claimed a referral bonus of over $3,950. However, this is far from the first instance where Wynn’s known wallet has been wrecked. As previously reported , some of his most painful losses resulted in multi-million-dollar wipeouts, which raised multiple questions within the community, including from Arthur Hayes. Bitcoin’s price pumps over the past 36-48 hours, in which the asset flew from under $108,000 to a new all-time high of over $117,000 earlier today, has left other short whales in limbo as well. Recall that this one was wrecked for more than $51 million during the initial surge. Lookonchain, though, reported another one, who is currently down by more than $10 million on their short position but deposited another $5.5 million USDC to Hyperliquid to avoid liquidations. Whale 0x5D2F is down over $10M on a 1,135 $BTC ($132.65M) short position. To avoid liquidation, he deposited another 5.5M $USDC into Hyperliquid.

2025-07-11T05:21:52,"Altcoin Mania Incoming: Bitcoin Confirms Breakout, XRP Price Targets $3","The post Altcoin Mania Incoming: Bitcoin Confirms Breakout, XRP Price Targets $3 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is rising again as Bitcoin’s price surged from $113,000 to $117,000 in a single day, currently hovering around $116,000. This fresh breakout hints at the possible start of a new bull rally, with analysts expecting more gains ahead. As always, market volatility is expected, with price swings and retests of support levels. But the overall trend is clearly bullish. Despite months of market fears like tariffs, war news, and regulatory crackdowns, on-chain data and market charts have consistently supported that a bull market was still intact, and it’s now showing on the price charts. Not just Bitcoin, but altcoins are waking up too. Ethereum has crossed $2,900, up 14% this week. XRP surged to $2.57, gaining 13%, while Solana rose to $164, up 8% in seven days. This pattern follows the typical bull market cycle where liquidity rotates from Bitcoin into altcoins after BTC makes strong moves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Coins To Buy And HODL As Nvidia Briefly Surpasses $4T Market Cap , What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? In technical terms, Bitcoin has also broken out of major resistance areas on multiple charts, including a long-standing descending channel and a bullish cup-and-handle pattern on the 3-day chart. If this breakout holds, it could set Bitcoin on a path toward $150,000 in the coming months. According to the analysis, the current market structure is holding up well. Key support is sitting at around $112,100, and as long as Bitcoin stays above this level, the upward momentum is expected to continue. A dip below this price would shift attention to lower support areas, including the $107,300 range. While a short-term pullback could happen, strong rallies like this tend to surprise on the upside. Bitcoin’s recent climb past its earlier resistance levels signals that the market could still have room to run. Global liquidity is also on the rise, stock markets like the S&P 500 are hitting new all-time highs, and the U.S. dollar is weakening, a combination historically favorable for crypto. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As of July 11, 2025, the overall crypto market is showing strong positive momentum, with Bitcoin hovering around its new all-time highs. Major altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana are also seeing significant gains, indicating a broad bullish trend. Will Bitcoin price reach new highs? Yes, Bitcoin has already reached new all-time highs in July 2025, surging past $112,000 and even hitting $116,000. Analysts suggest continued upside potential, with some even forecasting $150,000 or more in the coming months if current momentum holds. How are altcoins performing during Bitcoin’s rally? Following Bitcoin’s strong moves, altcoins are also “waking up.” Ethereum crossed $2,900 (up 14% this week), XRP surged to $2.57 (up 13%), and Solana rose to $164 (up 8%). This indicates a typical liquidity rotation. Is it the right time to invest in altcoins? With Bitcoin showing strong bullish momentum and liquidity typically rotating to altcoins after BTC surges, many analysts suggest now could be a good time to consider altcoins. However, remember the inherent volatility and conduct thorough research.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-mania-incoming-bitcoin-confirms-breakout-xrp-price-targets-3/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN|XRP","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

This step allows users to earn rewards by locking their digital assets to ensure network security. Users will be able to stake ETH and SOL assets on Robinhood's platform. Rewards will be distributed according to protocol rates determined by the respective blockchain networks, minus any applicable fees. Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks All-Time High Again — Here's Why and What Analysts Think Will Happen Next For Ethereum staking, Robinhood creates validator pools by pooling users' stakes to meet the 32 ETH requirement.

Additionally, starting October 1, 2025, Robinhood Crypto will charge a 25% platform fee on staking rewards. In addition, fees from third-party staking partners will also apply.

2025-07-11T05:12:54,"Will Crypto Markets Keep Surging When $4B Bitcoin Options Expire Today?","Around 36,800 Bitcoin options contracts will expire on Friday, July 11, and they have a notional value of roughly $4 billion. This event is larger than last week’s expiry but unlikely to be enough to influence spot markets, which have performed better towards the end of the week. US President Trump’s tariff deadline came and went with tariffs imposed on countries that did not make a prior deal with Uncle Sam. As predicted , Bitcoin reached an all-time high and has moved into new price discovery. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.94, meaning that there are slightly more calls expiring than put contracts. There is also a max pain point of $107,000, around $9,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $120,000, with almost $2 billion at this strike price. There is also $1.8 billion OI at $115,000 and $1.7 billion OI at $140,000 as bullish speculators load up on contracts. Options Expiry Alert Over $4.6B in crypto options expire tomorrow at 08:00 UTC on Deribit. $BTC : $3.99B notional | Put/Call: 0.94 | Max Pain: $107K $ETH : $609M notional | Put/Call: 1.04 | Max Pain: $2,550 Bitcoin hit $112K overnight, but with long gamma at $110K, dealer… pic.twitter.com/ZgZwsgwQRO — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 10, 2025 In its weekly update, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said the group showed “limited market discussion with focus on Trump’s trade deals and Truth Social crypto ETF developments.” It added that there was “minimal consensus” on market direction, with most activity centered around news events rather than price analysis. “Option buyers are holding onto positions despite mounting theta decay—reluctant to exit, yet uneasy to remain,” reported Deribit. However, these comments were before Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high above $117,000. In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 238,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $609 million, a max pain point of $2,550, and a put/call ratio of 1.04. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $4.6 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Crypto markets have surged 4% over the past 24 hours to reach $3.7 trillion total capitalization, the highest level since January. The move has been driven by Bitcoin, which surged to an all-time high of over $117,300 following a 5.5% daily gain during late trading on Thursday. The asset is now trading in new price discovery, having broken out of its two-month sideways channel. Ethereum has also broken out with a 6.5% daily surge to come just shy of $3,000. The asset was trading at a five-month high of $3,000 at the time of writing during the Friday morning Asian session. The altcoins were all in the green with larger gains for Dogecoin, Cardano, Sui, and Hedera.

2025-07-11T05:09:02,"Why the Ethereum Foundation Sold 1,210 ETH Today?","The post Why the Ethereum Foundation Sold 1,210 ETH Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Ethereum Foundation sold 1,210 ETH for approximately $3.5 million in USDC via Uniswap V4, with the transaction averaging $2,889.50 per ETH. This sale follows a recent series of fund movements, during which approximately 21,000 ETH were consolidated into a multisig wallet over the past month. From this wallet, 7,000 ETH was further distributed, including today’s sale from a secondary address. The transaction, tracked live via Lookonchain, adds a real-time layer of insight into the Foundation’s treasury operations. A wallet linked to the #EthereumFoundation sold 1,210 $ETH for 3.5M $USDC at an average price of ~$2,890 over the past 6 hours. https://t.co/2srVIybEGt pic.twitter.com/ez1k5Q6uT1 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 11, 2025 Strategic Reallocation, Not Panic This sale appears to align with the Foundation’s long-standing practice of measured asset management, likely aimed at funding development, grants, and ecosystem initiatives. Rather than flooding the market or creating panic, these controlled offloads are meant to support operational expenses transparently. Despite occasional calls for ETH to be staked or funneled into DeFi, the Foundation maintains a neutral stance that prioritizes long-term project health and flexibility. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum ETF Inflows Cross $320M, Is a Major ETH Price Rally Ahead? , Price Action and Whale Accumulation Ethereum price recently touched $3,000 before pulling back, establishing key support near $2,750. Notably, while the Foundation is selling, other players are buying heavily. Over $358 million in ETH has been scooped up by whales and institutional wallets in the past 24 hours, signaling growing confidence from the smart money side of the market. Rising TVL, Falling Fees Even though the Ethereum network is being used more, with total value locked (TVL) rising from $50 billion to $73 billion in just three months, this hasn’t boosted demand for ETH itself. Moreover, the network fees have dropped 22% in the last month. Hence, Lower fees mean less ETH is burned, which weakens its appeal as a deflationary asset. This drop in fee revenue may be one reason the Foundation chose to sell today. Overall, today’s ETH sale by the Ethereum Foundation looks more like routine treasury management than anything negative. With institutions still buying and Ethereum gaining more real-world use, the overall outlook remains strong, even as on-chain demand takes a breather. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum’s price is up today due to several converging factors: massive institutional demand flowing into spot Ethereum ETFs (like BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust), a structural squeeze in circulating supply from staking and token burns, and a broader surge in the crypto market following Bitcoin’s new all-time highs. What is the Ethereum Foundation? The Ethereum Foundation (EF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting Ethereum and related technologies. It was founded in 2014 and is based in Switzerland. Its mission is to allocate resources to critical projects, advocate for Ethereum, and foster a decentralized, open-source ecosystem without controlling the network itself.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-the-ethereum-foundation-sold-1210-eth-today/,"ETH|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare

DOGE is now consolidating and might aim for a move above $0.20. DOGE price started a fresh increase above the $0.1750 and $0.180 levels.

The launch created massive interest online and raised over $10 million in sales. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back In ‘Retesting Phase’ After Key Level Reclaim – The Calm Before The Storm? Snoop Dogg’s Telegram Drop Raises $12 Million On Wednesday, Snoop Dogg launched digital collectibles on Telegram, igniting an NFT frenzy on the platform. The collection offered unique NFTs inspired by the rapper’s style, including multiple marijuana-themed collectibles, anthropomorphic beagles, and vintage cars. The drop is part of Telegram’s Collectible Gifts, unique works of art on the platform that can be displayed on profiles and have special attributes. As the website explains, the collectibles can be transferred between users or auctioned on NFT marketplaces. Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, revealed that the Snoop Dogg drop sold out in 30 minutes, selling 996,000 NFTs for $12 million, adding that “Blockchain minting and the secondary market go live in 21 days. It’s going to be wild.” Last week, Durov shared that the 4th of July-themed Gifts also sold out within minutes, with over 800,000 collectibles selling in 10 minutes. Amid the collectibles’ launch, the rapper promoted it alongside a new track titled “Gifts” on his official Telegram Channel. He shared the link to the song’s music video and tagged Durov’s Telegram channel, saying, “time to drop it like it’s hot.” In the track, Snoop Dogg shouts out Toncoin (TON), the native token of the TON Blockchain, and Telegram. “Plug in my phone, get dressed, and then I plot my play / Critical existence, digital resistance / Shifted, gifted, and lifted / (…) / Stickers and games on Telegram, guess it’s coming soon / My privacy is not for sale,” some of the lyrics read. Notably, this isn’t the rapper’s first NFT venture, as he entered the space when the sector first gained mainstream popularity in 2021 and dropped collections in 2022 and 2023. NFT Mania Making A Comeback? On X, NFT lead at the TON blockchain, Zenith highlighted the drop’s success, as some of the supply gifts sold out in less than 2 minutes. He explained that Telegram gifts have had a peak market capitalization of over $200 million and a trading volume of $122 million since their launch. According to the post, the first OG collection, the Plush Pepe, now has a floor price of 4,200 TON, worth $11,886. “They are NFT Collectibles that are on the TON Blockchain and inside of Telegram!” he noted. To Zenith, this could be the start of a new NFT narrative, adding that they “would not be surprised if other famous brands or web3 IPs would want to launch some gifts too!” However, they pointed out that it could also mean nothing for the sector. In a recent report, DappRadar shared that Q2 data revealed new narratives are emerging, while old ones are “making a comeback.” The report claims that “NFTs are becoming more affordable, but the interest hasn’t disappeared. On the contrary, it’s shifting in nature,” a trend the platform’s analysts have been observing “for a while.” Related Reading: Solana Ready For $160 Reclaim? Analysts Say Breakout Is A Matter Of Time Notably, NFT trading volume dropped by 45% in Q2, but sales increased by 78%. Meanwhile, the number of traders increased 20% from Q1, with an average of 668,598 monthly traders. “Taken together with the spike in sales, this suggests a slow but steady return of users to the NFT space, although likely for different motivations than in previous cycles,” the report concluded.

Bitcoin’s consolidation around the upper boundary of its previously broken range at $108,355 ended on Wednesday, paving the way for a sharp move higher. The rally was mirrored by Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), both of which broke through key resistance levels, reinforcing the broader strength across the top cryptocurrencies. At the time of writing, both major cryptocurrencies were trading over 6% higher. The overall crypto market was up around 5% to trade at $3.64 trillion. Bitcoin’s dominance is around 64%. As bullish structures continue to form, traders are positioning for further upside, with sentiment turning increasingly optimistic. The surge also triggered the largest wave of liquidations in years, underscoring the abrupt shift in market momentum. The Bitcoin rally: where is BTC going? The cryptocurrency is now up approximately 24% year-to-date, with analysts setting their sights on $130,000 as the next major resistance. According to 10X Research, the latest breakout was driven by a decisive shift in market structure toward a bullish trend. Bitcoin has reached 10X Research’s July price target of $116,000, a level the firm projected based on seasonal trends pointing to a 9% rally. 10x Research @10x_Research · Follow The Quiet Bitcoin Signal That Triggered $1 Billion in Crypto LiquidationsActionable Market InsightsWhy this report mattersBitcoin just hit our July price target ($116,000)—but what’s unfolding beneath the surface is even more critical. A fresh uptrend signal has 8:07 am · 11 Jul 2025 3 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply While 10X had previously expected a broader consolidation through the summer, its outlook turned more bullish in recent weeks as upside positioning remained limited, setting the stage for a sharp move higher. According to the firm, a fresh trading signal was triggered as Bitcoin made a new short-term high, indicating that the rally could extend further. Historically, such signals have produced a median gain of 20%, with six out of ten instances delivering positive returns. If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could climb as high as $133,000 by September, as per the research firm. Crypto liquidations surge More than $1.14 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGlass, marking one of the most significant shakeouts in recent months. Short traders bore the brunt of the losses, accounting for nearly $1.02 billion of the total. Bitcoin alone was responsible for over half of the liquidations, with $591 million in positions wiped out. Ethereum followed with $241 million in liquidations, while other major tokens—including Hyperliquid, Solana, and XRP—also experienced sharp losses. ETH and XRP eye key targets Ethereum rebounded after finding support near the $2,461 daily level last week, rallying 10% to close above its resistance at $2,724 on Wednesday. The upward momentum continued with a 6.59% gain on Thursday, bringing the price to retest the key psychological level of $3,000. As of Friday, ETH is hovering around $2,970. A daily close above $3,000 could pave the way for a move toward the next resistance level at $3,730. US spot Ethereum ETFs recorded net inflows of $383 million on Thursday, marking five consecutive days of positive flows. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) saw the biggest inflow at around $300.9 million. Ripple (XRP) extended its recovery on Friday, reaching highs of around $2.59. According to data from Glassnode, the number of addresses on the XRP Ledger has steadily increased over the past two years, now averaging 7.3 million—up from 6.3 million at the start of the year and 5.7 million as of July 10, 2024. The ongoing growth in network activity, coupled with recent price momentum, suggests XRP may have the potential to accelerate its uptrend, with a short-term target above the $3.00 mark.

Called the Crypto Blue Chip ETF , the fund will track cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cronos, and now XRP. XRP Price Prediction Since the announcement, XRP’s price has surged. In the last 24 hours alone, it’s up 6%, currently trading at $2.57, and eyeing the $2.60 mark next. The breakout has opened doors for a fresh rally, with targets at $2.67 and beyond in the coming days or weeks. On the charts, analysts are spotting bullish signs. In fact, XRP has officially broken out of a major resistance zone between $2.31 and $2.36, a level that had capped its price for weeks. The breakout suggests that XRP is moving out of its long sideways range and could be gearing up for a stronger rally. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoin Mania Incoming: Bitcoin Confirms Breakout, XRP Price Targets $3 , If XRP can clear short-term hurdles around $2.44, it could continue climbing towards its next important resistance between $2.60 and $2.65. On the downside, any pullback might find support around the old resistance zone at $2.31 to $2.36, now expected to act as a safety net for prices. Can XRP Hit New All-Time-Highs? XRP is currently in the middle of a third-wave rally, a phase typically known for strong upward moves. If this momentum continues, XRP could eventually eye $3.30, $5.00, and possibly even higher levels like $9.81 in the longer term, though that would require very bullish market conditions. In the short term, if prices face a pullback, key support levels to watch are around $2.25–$2.36. Holding above these zones would keep the bullish trend alive. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

XRP’s price is up today primarily due to its inclusion in Donald Trump’s Truth Social “Crypto Blue Chip ETF” filing. This institutional exposure, combined with increased whale accumulation and a breakout from key technical resistance levels, is fueling the rally. Will XRP price reach new highs in July? XRP has already reached a 7-week high in July 2025 by breaking out of its consolidation. Analysts predict short-term targets of $2.60-$2.65, and potentially even $3.40, if the current bullish momentum and ETF sentiment continue through the month. How high can XRP price go in 2025? Analysts predict varying highs for XRP in 2025. Some short-term targets include $3.20-$3.50 by late Q3. More optimistic forecasts suggest XRP could reach $5.05 or even as high as $9.81 by the end of 2025, fueled by ETF approvals and institutional adoption. Is XRP a good investment? Yes, XRP remains a promising 2025 investment due to strong fundamentals, stablecoin use, and potential ETF listings.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-price-prediction-as-xrp-joins-trump-backed-crypto-blue-chip-etf/,"TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BTC|CRO|ALTCOIN","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
