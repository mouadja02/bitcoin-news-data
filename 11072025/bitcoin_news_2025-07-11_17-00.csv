Bitcoin","New data indicates that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) long-term performance shows the S&P 500 has lost nearly all its value when measured in BTC terms. These insights emerge at a time when both asset classes are trading at new record highs. For instance, Bitcoin has reached an all-time peak of $118,000, while the S&P 500 is edging close to the 6,300 mark. By press time, the maiden cryptocurrency was trading at $117,624, having rallied over 6% in the last 24 days, while in the past week, BTC is up 8%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Regarding their relative long-term performance, the S&P 500 priced in Bitcoin is now down 99.98% since 2012, one of the most dramatic asset revaluations in modern financial history, according to data shared by market commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter on July 11. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 measured in Bitcoin is down another 15%. Bitcoin v. S&P 500 performance. Source: Bitbo Overall, the data suggests that Bitcoin’s appreciation has been so extreme over the last decade that traditional equity benchmarks appear to have effectively gone to zero when denominated in BTC. Implications of Bitcoin’s performance against S&P 500 Critics might argue this comparison is more symbolic than practical, considering that few institutions price their portfolios in Bitcoin. However, for Bitcoin advocates, the data highlights the cryptocurrency’s feature as a scarce, decentralized asset capable of outperforming traditional financial systems over time. It is essential to note that these two assets belong to distinctly different asset classes. The S&P 500 is a diversified index of large U.S. companies, representing traditional equity ownership in the global economy.

2025-07-11T14:49:19,"Pros Recommend XYZVerse ($XYZ) Over Dogecoin for Beginners Seeking Low‑Cost Crypto Exposure","For those new to cryptocurrency and seeking a budget-friendly option, industry experts are highlighting XYZVerse ($XYZ) as a better choice than Dogecoin. What is it about XYZVerse that has professionals recommending it to beginners? This article explores the features that make XYZVerse an attractive option for newcomers to the crypto scene. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges From Meme to Mainstream: The Rise and Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin started in 2013 as a light-hearted take on cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun alternative to the serious world of crypto. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with no maximum cap and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially viewed as a joke or ""memecoin,"" Dogecoin took the world by surprise in 2021. Fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from personalities like Elon Musk, its value skyrocketed, propelling it into the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap exceeding $50 billion. Dogecoin’s technology is based on Litecoin, offering faster transaction times and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. Its community-driven approach has fostered a loyal following, contributing to charitable causes and sponsorships. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's appeal lies in its simplicity and the backing of a vibrant community. While other cryptocurrencies focus on complex technologies and use cases, Dogecoin remains accessible to newcomers. Market trends show a growing interest in decentralized finance and meme coins, suggesting that Dogecoin could continue to gain traction. However, its unlimited supply may affect long-term value. Investors looking for potential gains might find Dogecoin attractive, but should consider the volatility and do their research. Conclusion While coins like DOGE remain popular, XYZVerse's unique sports focus and ambitious growth plans position it as a promising option for beginners in the current bull market.

2025-07-11T14:47:10,"The Hidden Concerns Behind ATH: Could 2025 Be the Last Escape for Bitcoin? Metaphysical Insights on Market Challenges Ahead","Recently, HTX, a global leading cryptocurrency exchange invited Master Hataki, an expert in metaphysics and cryptocurrency, to conduct an in-depth Bazi analysis of Bitcoin. Using the timestamp of Bitcoin’s Genesis Block (January 3, 2009, 18:15 UTC), Master Hataki revealed a chilling forecast: according to his calculations, Bitcoin could face a “double Tai Sui” in 2026, leading to a major price correction. 2025 might be the “last escape opportunity” before Bitcoin enters a turbulent phase. Bitcoin’s Metaphysical Warning: The Challenge of 2026 Master Hataki’s Bazi analysis of Bitcoin shows a strong “Metal-Water” dynamic. In the Five Elements philosophy: Water represents liquidity, aligning with Bitcoin’s nature as a circulating currency. Metal is associated with finance and investment, explaining Bitcoin’s financial traits. In metaphysical terms, Tai Sui (the Grand Duke of Jupiter) represents a clash between an entity’s Bazi and the year’s energy, signaling challenges. Master Hataki noted that Bitcoin’s chart includes “Zi” (Rat), which clashes with the year “Wu” (Horse) in 2026, forming a Zi-Wu Clash . This suggests that Bitcoin will face Tai Sui that year. Even more concerning, two Zi-Wu clashes appear in Bitcoin’s Bazi, meaning it will face a “double Tai Sui”—a rare and significant challenge. The Impact of “Double Tai Sui” on Bitcoin Master Hataki explains the possible consequences of this metaphysical clash: Asset Damage and Loss : Clashes in Bazi represent financial disruption and loss. Bitcoin could experience significant downward pressure in 2026, with its market value dropping sharply. This could trigger a loss of investor confidence, causing a ripple effect in the market. External Interference : The clash may also suggest external disturbances, such as sudden regulatory changes, institutional sell-offs, or even attacks on blockchain technology. These could destabilize Bitcoin’s price and market position. Disunity and Discord : The clash could lead to increased friction within the Bitcoin community and among investors, weakening the overall market stability and Bitcoin’s support base. Negative Energy Transformation : Master Hataki emphasized that the Wu (Fire) of 2026, when it clashes with Bitcoin’s chart, could lead to a loss of wealth. This would not only mean price drops but also a broader shift in market energy, tightening liquidity in the crypto space. Key Timeframes for Potential Volatility Master Hataki highlighted two critical periods in 2026 when market volatility may peak: Wu Month (June 6 to July 7) and Zi Month (December 7 to January 5, 2027). During these times, Bitcoin’s price fluctuations may be especially intense. Investors are advised to remain cautious during these periods. The “False Good” Cycle of 2025 Though 2025 marks the first year of the Fire cycle, Bitcoin might still experience a “false good” phase, though Bitcoin has recently reached a new all-time high where prices rise temporarily before a correction. Master Hataki cautions that from November 7 to December 7 , the Si-Hai Clash could cause price volatility. While the metaphysical analysis doesn’t predict complete collapse, it does remind investors of the unpredictable nature of the crypto market. HTX’s Strategy for Navigating Market Risks Despite the metaphysical warning, Bitcoin’s “double Tai Sui” scenario serves as a reminder of the crypto market’s inherent uncertainties. HTX offers a range of investment products designed to help investors remain resilient during volatile times while still seeking profit opportunities. Here are some of the key strategies: HTX Launchpool: A Stable Growth Option When major cryptocurrencies face downward pressure, staking new coins provides a safer alternative. By participating in HTX Launchpool , investors can earn tokens from new projects and avoid the risks of market downturns, benefiting from new projects’ growth while adding value to their portfolios. Options and Short Contracts: Seizing Reverse Opportunities For experienced investors, HTX’s derivatives market offers tools to profit during bear markets. With Put Options , investors can lock in profits when Bitcoin’s price is expected to fall, or use short contracts to directly profit from declines. These tools can be powerful when used strategically, but they come with higher risks. HTX Earn: The Anchor in Market Uncertainty In uncertain times, allocating funds into low-risk, high-return earning products is wise. HTX’s earning products offer competitive returns, helping assets grow steadily during market fluctuations. With USDD and USDT earning products, investors can earn above-market yields, helping idle funds stay productive and countering market downturns. POS Coin Staking: Earning Even in a “Tai Sui” Year For those holding POS (Proof of Stake) cryptocurrencies, staking offers a way to earn passive income while protecting against market risks. By staking these coins on HTX , investors can enjoy substantial rewards, even during challenging market periods. Conclusion: Preparing for the Crypto Market’s Uncertainty Metaphysical insights into Bitcoin’s future offer a unique perspective on market risks, but they also highlight the need for strategic planning. Whether or not one subscribes to these predictions, being prepared for market volatility is always a smart move. HTX provides the tools to help investors manage risk and capitalize on profitable opportunities, ensuring that even in uncertain times, they can make informed and strategic decisions.

The analyst claims that the $0.55 support for Cardano has been a key support on high timeframes. The last time the cryptocurrency dropped to this level in April this year, as seen on the chart below, ADA was able to rise to over 55% and touched the $0.85 mark. ‘It’s happening again’ said Martinez while pointing at the bullish momentum driving Cardano since it touched the bottom of this parallel channel.

Holding above this level could preserve the bullish structure, while a breakdown might trigger a deeper pullback. Mixed Signals In Focus: Chainlink Short-Term Strength Vs. Medium-Term Caution According to Crypto Analysis AI, LINK/USDT is currently showing mixed signals, with a slight bullish bias in the short term but potential consolidation or pullback risks in the medium term. The 1H timeframe shows more buy signals, while the 4H timeframe indicates weakening momentum after a strong uptrend. Related Reading: Chainlink Consolidates Above Key Support – Bulls Eye $20 Range In the 1H timeframe, the following bullish signals are active: ADX (35.47, strong trend), EMA (EMA9 > EMA20), KDJ (buy), ICHIMOKU (buy), and TRIX (buy). At the same time, several indicators are flashing bearish signals, including MACD (histogram negative), PSAR (sell), and Keltner Channels (sell). Some metrics remain neutral, with RSI at 57.60 (not overbought) and OBV showing neutral. For the 4H timeframe, bullish signals include ADX (34.17, strong trend), MACD (positive histogram), and Supertrend (buy). However, KDJ (sell), SMI (sell), and Schaff Trend Cycle (overbought) are signaling possible weakness. RSI at 66.94 (nearing overbought) and neutral OBV further support a cautious medium-term view, which increases the risk of a pullback. Key Observations from Crypto Analysis AI note that short-term momentum favors bulls. However, medium-term indicators suggest exhaustion, pointing to the 4H RSI reading. Fluctuations And Consolidation Signal Caution Crypto Analysis AI reports that the current trend for Chainlink remains an uptrend, but is slowing. Looking at recent price action, Crypto Analysis AI observed that on the 1H timeframe, LINK fluctuated between $14.25 and $14.48, closing at $14.34. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) On Standby: Bitcoin’s Next Move Holds The Key Meanwhile, on the 4H chart, there was a strong rally from $13.50 to $14.49, which is now consolidating near $14.30 and $14.40. The analyst also mentioned that volume is declining in the recent 1H candles, which suggests weakening momentum. Crypto Analysis AI identified the following key resistance levels: $14.48 (recent high) and $14.65 (upper Bollinger Band, 1H). In terms of key support, he pointed out $14.20 (recent swing low, 4H), followed by $13.90-$14.00 (psychological support, 4H EMA20) and $13.50 (strong support, previous breakout zone). Outlining potential bullish scenarios, Crypto Analysis AI explained that if LINK holds above $14.20, it could retest $14.48 and $14.65. In a bearish scenario, a break below $14.20 may lead to a deeper correction toward $13.90-$14.00. Meanwhile, for a neutral scenario, Chainlink may continue to consolidate between $14.20 and $14.48 before the next directional move. Finally, Crypto Analysis AI flagged several cautionary signals: 4H RSI near 67 could trigger profit-taking while the MACD histogram is declining despite higher highs. Furthermore, there is lower volume on recent up moves, suggesting weakening demand.

A logarithmic regression channel is a tool used to identify the long-term trend of the price of an asset that experiences exponential growth at first before the rate of growth slows.

2025-07-11T14:27:50,"Trader Says XRP Pump to $10 Will Be the Most Hated Pump of All Time. Here’s Why","Veteran crypto trader Cobb has sparked a new wave of debate in the digital asset space with a bold statement: if XRP surges to $10, it will be “the most hated pump of all time.” His comments, shared via X, tap into the deep polarization that surrounds XRP and the long-standing tension between its believers and skeptics. Beneath the surface of this viral claim lies a compelling mix of market psychology, price dynamics, and historical baggage that could make such a rally not only possible but emotionally explosive. The Sideliners: A Massive Wave of Reluctant Buyers Cobb argues that “XRP has the most sideliners out of any coin.” It’s a claim rooted in observation. Despite being a top-ten crypto asset by market cap, XRP is often overlooked or outright dismissed by large portions of the crypto community, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum purists. Years of regulatory pressure, public skepticism, and misinformation have led many to sell out in frustration or avoid the token altogether. XRP pump to $10.00 will be the most hated pump of all time, giving it even more fuel to discover even higher prices XRP has the most sideliners out of any coin XRP derangement syndrome is real pic.twitter.com/IcvskRKJGB — Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL) July 11, 2025 Ironically, this massive group of sidelined investors could become a powerful catalyst. If XRP begins a strong upward move, many of these doubters may find themselves forced to buy back in, chasing momentum and adding fuel to the rally. As Cobb suggests, this emotional whiplash could be what turns the pump into one of the most hated in crypto history. XRP Derangement Syndrome: When Bias Blocks Opportunity Cobb also refers to what he calls “XRP Derangement Syndrome”, the tendency of many in the crypto world to irrationally dismiss or mock XRP, regardless of its technicals, fundamentals, or adoption metrics. For years, XRP has been the target of criticism, often painted as centralized or anti-crypto despite its unique position as a bridge currency and settlement layer. This psychological bias could magnify the resentment if XRP proves its critics wrong. A $10 rally would not only reward long-term holders, it would publicly vindicate a token many had written off. That kind of narrative reversal can be emotionally jarring, particularly for those who missed the move or bet against it. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Current Price Outlook and Market Structure As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.60, continuing to build on strong bullish momentum. It recently closed its highest-ever quarterly candle, signaling a major breakout from long-term resistance zones. The next critical level to watch is $2.69, aligning with a macro Fibonacci retracement. A confirmed break above that level could quickly open the path toward $5.89 and even $10, especially if retail and institutional sideliners begin to FOMO back in. On-chain data and whale activity suggest growing confidence in the asset, with large positions opening at key levels and broader sentiment shifting as XRP shows relative strength. The Most Emotional Rally in Crypto? Cobb’s projection is about more than just price, it’s about narrative tension, market psychology, and a deeply divided community. A $10 XRP wouldn’t just mark a technical milestone; it would force a reckoning for those who doubted the token for years. In a market driven by emotion, that kind of resentment could act as the ultimate accelerant, pushing XRP not just to $10, but far beyond .

2025-07-11T14:27:41,"Bitcoin bull run wrecks shorts in historic liquidation","BTC’s latest breakout didn’t just set new records, it wiped out tens of thousands of traders in one of the most brutal short squeezes the market has seen in years. Fueled by rising momentum and institutional demand, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been on the rise over the past few days, surging to a new all-time high of $118,000. The uptrend forced a massive wave of liquidations across the market, with short sellers taking the biggest hit. According to CoinGlass, more than $1 billion in short positions were wiped out in the past 24 hours alone, marking the largest daily liquidation event in four years. The largest day of short liquidation in 4 years.😢 https://t.co/7aKXaaVxi3 pic.twitter.com/52kwAPBIcq — CoinGlass (@coinglass_com) July 11, 2025 Over 232,000 traders were affected. Bitcoin shorts made up the largest share, with $570 million wiped out, while Ether ( ETH ) shorts added another $206.9 million as ETH climbed to $3,000. Altcoins weren’t spared either, with dozens of high-leverage positions crushed as prices surged across the board.

The biggest single loss was $88.55 million on HTX, and Binance saw about 5,000 BTC liquidated. With BTC now holding close to $118,000, analysts say the rally will continue. The spike in liquidations comes on the back of strong fundamentals. Institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have soared, macro sentiment is improving, and risk appetite across markets is broadening. Together, these factors are strengthening bullish conviction. Weighing in on the performance Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley forecasts that the positive trend will continue. He believes that Bitcoin is “detaching from the $100,000 range,” predicting that the asset could reach up to $200,000 by year end.

2025-07-11T14:26:30,"U.S. stocks dip after back-to-back record closes as Trump targets Canada","Wall Street's major averages were lower on Friday as President Donald Trump slapped a 35% tariff on Canada and warned of further hikes if Ottawa retaliated. Market participants also took a bit of a breather after back-to-back record closes for the benchmark S&P 500 index ( SP500 ). The S&P ( SP500 ) was last -0.3% in morning trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) was about flat, and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) was -0.5% . Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. “Stocks are not quite desensitized to tariff headlines just yet. We are still seeing knee-jerk reactions to negative trade headlines. Volatility is an opportunity for investors who are still too exposed to cash,” said Michael Landsberg, CIO at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 6 basis points to 4.41%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 2 basis points to 3.91%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a new all-time high on Friday, fueled by growing institutional interest and supportive signals from the Trump administration. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget is expected to be in deficit by $50B in June versus $70.9B in June 2024. The focus will shift slightly from tariffs and trade developments to the second quarter U.S. earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from major banks. ""We believe second quarter earnings will be good, but not as good as first quarter. Much of the second quarter was marked with tariff and trade issues, and that may have caused some dislocations in earnings for certain industries as their customers may have been in a holding pattern,"" said Landsberg.

2025-07-11T14:24:48,"Crypto Markets Rebound in Q2 2025: Top Takeaways from the Latest 99Bitcoins Report","The crypto industry witnessed a strong first half of 2025, with Bitcoin leading the charge thanks to improving regulatory conditions, growing ETF participation, and aggressive accumulation by large institutions. Sponsored by KCEX exchange, the latest State of Crypto Q2 2025 report by 99Bitcoins shows that the quarter-to-date gains of most U.S. indices remained below 15%, with only the S&P 500 IT index rising 18.4%. In comparison, the crypto market outperformed them all, delivering impressive returns of 21.72%. This was also one of the best quarters for the stablecoin market. Total stablecoin transactions crossed the $35T mark, with the number of active unique addresses reaching 265M. $USDT commanded a 68.77% share of all stablecoin transactions, while Circle’s $USDC followed with 30.83%. Circle’s IPO was a massive hit, too, with its stock price soaring 168% on just the first day of trading. This shows that investors have a huge appetite for exposure to the stablecoin sector, even if through indirect routes. Read on as we unpack more crypto market trends, analyze Bitcoin’s (and Ethereum’s) performance over the last four months, and explore what might lie ahead for the rest of 2025. Bitcoin in the First Half of 2025 Bitcoin was a tale of two quarters during the first half of 2025. The first quarter saw a sharp 30% correction in the ‘digital gold,’ with prices falling to a low of $74.5K amid macroeconomic pressures such as the global trade war. The second quarter, however, marked a string reversal, with $BTC surpassing its previous all-time high of $109K. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading just shy of $120K , having formed a fresh lifetime high of $118,845. In contrast to previous bull runs, retail interest remained relatively muted in Q2. Instead, institutional buying stepped in. As of May 27, publicly traded companies had borrowed around $2.1B to acquire Bitcoin, and corporations now hold over 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. Strong ETF Inflows Bitcoin ETF activity also saw a significant rise. Total Assets Under Management (AUM) now represent around 6.35% of Bitcoin’s market cap. Chris Wright, Global Head of Marketing at 21Shares, projects a very chunky 50% increase in inflows in 2025 compared to last year, reaching approximately $55B. If this trend continues, total AUM could hit $200B by the end of the year, up from current levels of $110B. Interestingly, exchange inflow volumes declined during the second quarter, indicating that Bitcoin investors are opting to HODL. The total supply held by long-term investors rose from 14.05M to over 14.65M, signaling conviction-driven accumulation. Even in the derivatives market, long positions significantly outnumbered shorts. Plus, the number of crypto addresses holding over 1M Bitcoin increased to 160,822 in June, up from 124,663 in mid-March. All signs point in one direction – the market overwhelmingly believes Bitcoin’s upward trajectory will continue in the foreseeable future. Way Ahead for Bitcoin 99Bitcoins had predicted a 70% chance of a bullish scenario playing out for Bitcoin in the coming months. And so far, that forecast has proven accurate. The report correctly noted that once $BTC broke past the $103K level, it would likely surge towards its first major target of $120K, a key psychological resistance. According to 99Bitcoins, if ETF tailwinds and increasing regulatory clarity persist, $BTC could be propelled even further, with $135K as the next upside target. Daniel Polotsky, Co-Founder of CoinFlip, strongly believes that Bitcoin will end well above $100K by year-end. However, given escalating global tensions and the renewed threat of a tariff war, investors should still be mindful of a possible bearish turn. If the asset fails to hold above the $120K mark and drops back below $103K, it could revisit $98K, and possibly even $89K, for a fresh liquidity sweep. Ethereum Stats from Q2 Ethereum moved in correlation with Bitcoin during the second quarter, with the coefficient ranging between 0.48 to 0.98. This means $ETH largely mirrored $BTC’s movements during this period. Similar to Bitcoin, Ethereum also dropped nearly 60% from its all-time high during the first quarter before bouncing back sharply. Currently trading at just shy of $3K , $ETH remains about 36% below its previous all-time high, which could soon be taken out if the bullish momentum continues. The MVRV ratio for $ETH followed a volatile path over this time. At the start of the year, it stood at around 1.5, indicating Ethereum was trading well above its average acquisition price and was considered overvalued. As expected, profit-booking kicked in, dragging the MVRV ratio below 1.0 in March, suggesting that most $ETH holders were in loss territory. During the Q2 recovery, the MVRV bounced back to 1.2, indicating nominal profits for the average holder. On the charts, the $2.8K mark has acted as a strong resistance for Ethereum since the first week of May. It finally managed to close above this level yesterday (July 10) and is now consolidating in that zone. If Ethereum holds this level, it could continue its upward climb toward $3.4K. However, if it falls back in the $2.4K-$2.8K range, it may trade sideways for most of the next quarter before making a decisive directional move. Some Other Crypto Stats from Q2 2025 Let’s now look at some other key crypto stats outlined in the report: Crypto venture capital funding in the first quarter of 2025 reached nearly 60% of all VC investments made in 2024, raising around $4.8B. This fresh capital is expected to fuel innovation, support early-stage startups, and attract top-tier talent. Crypto-related hiring surged by 753%, with the majority of new roles in marketing and development, highlighting strong overall growth potential within the space. The best meme coins also performed notably well in the second quarter, with over 5.9M tokens created so far this year. Like Bitcoin and Ethereum the meme, the meme coin market saw a dip during Q1 before rebounding in Q2. Coins like $PEPE led the charge, skyrocketing by an astounding 89.93M%. In contrast, more established tokens like $SHIB and $DOGE were absent from the top trending cryptos list. Wrapping Up After succumbing to macroeconomic pressures in Q1, the crypto market found its footing again in the second quarter of 2025. With Bitcoin now trading at all-time highs, the 99Bitcoins Q2 State of Crypto Market Report has reinforced market confidence with its ambitious $135K year-end target. From rising institutional inflows and surging long-term holder conviction to the resurgence of Ethereum and a record-breaking meme coin rally, the data points to a maturing market with renewed momentum and growing participation. For investors looking to ride the wave, now might be the best time to explore the best cryptos to invest in .",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-markets-rebound-in-q2-2025-takeaways-from-latest-99bitcoins-report/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-07-11T14:15:07,"The most active crypto ATM users were scam victims, Australia police warns","Tasmania Police contacted 15 of the top crypto ATM users in the area to discover that they all fell victim to scams. The investigation found no legitimate activity among the highest-volume users statewide. Combined losses reached $2.5 million, including $900,000 deposited through cryptocurrency ATMs. Since 2021, the number of crypto ATMs in Tasmania has increased from one to 20 machines. Police investigation reveals widespread crypto ATM scam activity Tasmania Police contacted more than 15 Tasmanians suspected of being money mules and scam victims. The operation was part of a national action to combat criminal use of cryptocurrency ATMs . Tasmania Police Cyber Investigations discovered no legitimate activity among the top 15 users. All the victims had been engaged in some scam activities on various platforms. All 15 of them lost a total of $2.5 million from scam activities, directly transferring approximately $900,000 via cryptocurrency ATMs in the scams. Detective Sergeant Paul Turner said crypto ATM numbers rose from one to 20. Expansion was seen throughout Tasmania since 2021, providing more opportunities for scams. Victims are exposed to manipulation, intimidation, and coercion tactics by international criminal syndicates. There are typical types of scams, including romance scams, investment scams, government impersonation scams, and tech support scams. Utility scams and job offer scams also target crypto ATM users. Scammers send victims to crypto ATMs after banks implemented friction in transactions. High-value scams have severe and long-term impacts on victims in communities. Pensions leave victims dependent or compel them into asset disposal. Postponement of retirement may even be necessary while families take up support roles economically. The report also claims that the reduced economic activity from such losses impacts the welfare of Tasmania . Red flags include solicitations by unfamiliar individuals and tight timing. Promised profits guaranteed usually signal investment scams for vulnerable groups. Global crypto ATM expansion continues despite regulatory concerns The global crypto ATM network expanded with over 1,000 new machines installed worldwide. Total numbers rose from 37,722 at the start of the year to 38,726 by June. The United States rebounded in Q2 after a Q1 decline, adding 500 machines. US installations reached 30,447 total machines by mid-year through improved regulatory clarity. Increased institutional participation drove growth across multiple states and regions. Australia led relative growth, adding 491 new ATMs during the first half. Growing retail take-up and benign fintech environment underpinned Australian growth rates. Canada installed 245 ATMs and Europe 149 new machines. These markets demonstrate sustained take-up even as regulatory pressure increases elsewhere. New Zealand announced plans to ban crypto ATMs in AML and CFT reforms. Cash conversion to high-risk assets was identified by the government as a key concern. Facilitating illicit transactions with these machines prompted the choice of the regulatory reaction. Australia introduced new operating rules and transaction limits for crypto operators. A $5,000 cap applies to cash deposits and withdrawals at machines. Enhanced customer due diligence and mandatory scam warnings became requirements recently. Australians lost over $3 million to crypto ATM scams since January. 150 unique scam reports were filed with average losses exceeding $20,000. Nearly half of the victims were over 51 years old, with a female majority. Law enforcement operations identified 90 scam victims and suspected money mules. One woman in her 70s lost over $430,000 through romance scams. Investment fraud and extortion emails commonly target crypto ATM users. Scammers exploit crypto ATMs after bank transaction friction The victims are directed to crypto ATMs by the scammers after banks create tension when customers try to deposit suspicious funds. The scammers then direct victims to cryptocurrency machines. Detective Sergeant Turner cautions people to heed bank warning messages. Family and friends, and the police too, can be stabilizing resources when victims are being misled. Rushed timescales and urgent language usually indicate customer scams. Cash deposit requests from strangers are usually scams. Unrealistically high return assurances and profit guarantees are red flags. Investment scams offer unrealistic profit, and romance scams target emotional connections. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-11T14:11:43,"Find out why crypto is up today and the best altcoins to buy","The crypto market gained steam on Friday, July 11, with Bitcoin and most altcoins jumping by over 5%. Bitcoin ( BTC ) surged to nearly $120,000, while the crypto Fear and Greed Index moved to the greed zone of 65. The total market capitalization of all coins jumped to over $3.6 trillion. Why crypto is up today Crypto prices rallied ahead of the upcoming crypto week , during which politicians in Washington will consider three major bills. One of them is GENIUS, which will regulate stablecoins and has already passed in the Senate. Lawmakers will also consider the CLARITY Act, which separates the roles between the SEC and the CFTC. Additionally, regulators will review a bill to ban Central Bank Digital Currencies in the U.S. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are also moving higher due to hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September and continue through 2026. Some Fed officials, like Christopher Waller and Michele Bowman, have called for a rate cut as soon as this month. You might also like: Polkadot price analysis: DOT breaks historical resistance, eyes run to $7.00 Fed interest rate cuts are expected to accelerate in 2026 when Donald Trump’s nominee to replace Jerome Powell is sworn in. Trump, who has called for a 300 basis point cut, has hinted that he will only nominate an official who will cut rates. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies historically perform well in a low-interest-rate environment. Further, crypto is rising due to increasing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows, which signal strong demand from American investors. Bitcoin ETFs have added over $51 billion in inflows since inception, while Ethereum funds crossed the $5 billion milestone. In a note to crypto.news, Premyslaw Kral, the CEO of Zondacrypto, said: “We’re observing increased interest from institutional players, largely in the form of ETFs, which have significantly changed the reality of the crypto industry, alongside simple capital inflows, as observed now on the BTC market.” There are also hopes that the Chinese government will legalize cryptocurrencies. A top regulator told a conference that the government was studying digital coins. Unbanning cryptocurrencies would likely lead to increased demand from Chinese individuals and retail investors. Best altcoins to buy in this crypto bull run Analysts, including Arthur Hayes believe that the altoin season is around the corner. Such a move would benefit many altcoins, especially meme coins. Some of the best meme coins to consider are the popular names like Pepe ( PEPE ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ). Top utility cryptocurrencies, especially those with high ETF approval hopes like Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ), will be the other top beneficiaries of this bull run. Other top altcoins to buy are Chainlink, Quant, and Hedera Hashgraph.

Traders are watching closely for a move above $120,000. Altcoins Riding the Wave Bitcoin’s breakout has reignited the crypto market, acting as a liquidity trigger and pushing capital into altcoins. Ethereum is nearing $3,000 with strong ETF inflows, Solana has reclaimed $160 and is eyeing $200, while tokens like SHIB, AVAX, and HYPE also posted impressive gains. Analysts see this as a broader market shift, with BTC leading the charge and altcoins following fast. Investors further expect new all-time highs in the second half of the year, fueled by rising corporate Bitcoin buying and progress on U.S. crypto legislation. Bitcoin spot ETFs also saw a massive $1.18 billion net inflow on Thursday, the second largest in history. Ethereum spot ETFs saw $383 million in net inflows. Bullish Forecasts from Crypto Experts Former Binance CEO also shared a simple yet powerful message. He asked his followers not to panic if they missed buying Bitcoin when it was cheaper, as he notes that there will be more chances. While governments can keep printing money, Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, which will make it more valuable over time. Remember I said the gigachad bullrun is coming.

2025-07-11T14:07:24,"Bitcoin back to $118,000 after teasing bulls with $120,000 milestone breach","Bitcoin just hit $120,000 for the first time ever early Friday, before sliding slightly to around $117,297.10 by the afternoon. That’s a solid 5% jump in less than 24 hours, fueled mostly by a flood of cash into Bitcoin ETFs, according to Coinglass , which also showed that Thursday saw the highest daily short liquidation in four years, totaling around $2.42 billion. The earlier peak, $118,872.85, came overnight and broke past the previous May high. This jump also pulled Ether up with it. The second-largest crypto climbed nearly 6% to $2,976.90, after briefly crossing back above $3,000 for the first time since February. The rise didn’t come from nowhere. Those Bitcoin ETFs saw $1.18 billion flow in yesterday, the biggest single-day inflow of 2025. That’s the kind of cash wave that moves mountains. Ether ETFs weren’t quiet either, pulling in $383.1 million, their second-largest haul ever, according to data from SoSoValue. While BTC kept rising, stocks tied to it started cooling. Mining firms Mara Holdings and Riot Platforms were up just 2.5% and 1.5%, while Strategy, the one everyone treats as a Bitcoin stock, climbed nearly 3%. Platforms like Coinbase, Robinhood, Circle, and eToro barely moved at all. ETFs flood with cash after Fed minutes The rally didn’t exactly begin with fireworks. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve published its meeting minutes, showing officials are split on how fast to cut interest rates. Some want to hold off. Some want to go harder. The market read that as a green light, and Bitcoin started creeping up. By market close, it was surging. The rally was also helped by a run-up in tech stocks. Markus Thielen, CEO at 10x Research, said that was the moment traders began breaking through the “top range.” He expects the next Fed chair , assuming Donald Trump follows through on replacing Jerome Powell, to take a softer stance. “We also know that saving the budget deficit has sort of been pushed under the rug,” Markus added, pointing to the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’, which could raise the federal deficit and end up being another boost for Bitcoin. Another thing pushing Bitcoin up was short liquidations. Over the last day, more than $650 million in short bets against Bitcoin were wiped out. Those are traders who borrowed Bitcoin to bet against it, then had to buy it back when the price spiked, pushing it even higher. Ether shorts weren’t safe either, losing over $215 million in the same window. This kind of domino effect, where short sellers get forced out, adds more fuel to the fire. Fed pressure, Trump threat, and summer slowdowns Bitcoin ETFs weren’t attracting this kind of money a few months ago. That changed around April 17, when talk started heating up about Powell’s job. That week, Trump said “termination” of Powell might be necessary due to the Fed’s rate stance. That’s when the ETF inflows started growing fast. Since then, total inflows have reached almost $16 billion. Now, Bitcoin bulls are watching Congress. A crypto bill could pass soon, and treasury departments from large companies are still adding Bitcoin to their holdings. Those two trends, more demand from corporations and better regulation, are keeping the rally going. But it could still stall if something big happens in global markets. “Powell might turn dovish end of the month at the Fed meeting, and maybe he will not,” said Markus. “So we have to take the market relatively short-term.” There’s also the seasonal effect. Markus pointed out that summer usually means less trading from equity funds. “Normally, long-only equity investors also pare back their risk into the summer,” he said. That means Bitcoin could either coast or get choppy, depending on who stays active. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-07-11T14:06:25,"Stocks slip amid Trump’s tariff threats, Bitcoin spike buoys crypto stocks","U.S. stocks slipped on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening 250 points lower following President Donald Trump’s 35% tariff against Canada. With stocks having reached new all-time highs in recent weeks, trading on July 11 was largely a reaction to fresh trade war concerns. As the Dow fell 250 points, the S&P 500 pared gains at -0.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.3%.. However, Bitcoin ( BTC ) bucked the trend, rising by about 5% in 24 hours to hit a new all-time high above $118,000. The crypto bellwether’s performance ignited bullish moves across the altcoin market, with Ethereum ( ETH ) crossing above the psychological $3,000 level. Bitcoin ’s rally lifted crypto stocks, with MicroStrategy (MSTR), Coinbase (COIN), and Robinhood (HOOD) gaining in premarket trading. MSTR was up 2% in early trading after the U.S. stock market opened, while COIN and HOOD had pared their premarket gains.

This followed President Trump’s announcement of a 50% duty rate on Brazil earlier in the week. While Trump has added to the jitters with remarks that he sees another 15% to 20% blanket tariffs against many of the U.S. trading partners, stocks remain near their all-time highs . “I think the tariffs have been very well-received. The stock market hit a new high today,” Trump said during an interview with NBC News. Overall investor optimism, however, may dissipate if there’s a flare-up in trade wars—a scenario China recently warned of as Trump threatened tough tariffs on members of the emerging market economics bloc dubbed BRICS. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa are the founding members, but the group has expanded to include Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates among others.

2025-07-11T14:04:40,"Bitcoin Hits New ATH, Altcoins Rocket, Trump’s Latest Tariffs: Your Weekly Crypto Recap","It was a historic week for the cryptocurrency market and its leader, which finally broke out of consolidation and skyrocketed to a new all-time high. There were very few actual signs of what was about to happen in the past few weeks. Recall that BTC had dumped below $100,000 during the Israel-Iran conflict, and even though it quickly bounced to a six-digit price territory, it remained in a tight range between $105,000 and $110,000. These boundaries managed to confine the asset for a couple of weeks despite a few breakout attempts. However, that all changed in the middle of the current business week when the primary cryptocurrency began a massive leg up that broke the upper boundary on Wednesday, and it quickly spiked to a fresh peak at $112,000. Although it retraced slightly in the following hours, its run was just getting started. On Thursday evening, bitcoin flew to $113,000 and later $116,000 . The gains continued on Friday as the cryptocurrency flew to almost $119,000 to register its current all-time high. Despite losing some ground since then and retracing to just over $117,000 as of press time, it’s still up by 8% weekly. Its market cap has shot up to $2.340 trillion, while its dominance over the alts has taken a hit this week and is down to 62.4%. The reason for this is that many altcoins have marked mindblowing weekly pumps. Some of the leaders include ETH (17%), XRP (20%), DOGE (20%), ADA (30%), SUI (20%), LINK (17%), XLM (39%), and HBAR (32%). HYPE is also up by double digits (17%) and pumped to a new all-time high of over $46. These impressive price increases come as a bit of a surprise, given the latest tariff developments from Trump against other countries. In the past week alone, the POTUS has announced numerous tariffs against Canada, the EU, the UK, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and other nations, some of which are up to 35%.

Following this historic run and new all-time high, analysts, commentators, and everyone in between rushed to offer their opinion on what drove the asset and how high it can go. According to CryptoQuant, this rally is different due to several factors you can check here . Bitcoin Tapped $112,000: Dormant Whales Stir, Retail Nowhere to Be Found . Before today’s peak, which marked the first one for the month at $112,000, reports emerged that retail investors were still nowhere to be found. Instead, the majority of the gains were attributed to larger and institutional investors. Ripple Taps The Oldest US Bank to Custody RLUSD . BNY Mellon, the oldest US bank and one of the most consistently bullish on the cryptocurrency industry, will serve as the custodian for Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD.

2025-07-11T14:04:09,"Bitcoin (BTC) Rally Sparks Altcoin Bull Run! Analysts Predict These Altcoins Will Benefit Most!","Bitcoin (BTC) made a big move on the evening of June 9, attacking from $109,000 and reaching $118,000. While Bitcoin's two-day run from record to record has increased optimism in the market, altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH), XRP and Solana (SOL) have also taken action and achieved significant gains. At this point, while the rally in BTC is expected to initiate the altcoin rally, analysts have announced their updated predictions. Speaking to Coindesk, Presto Research analyst Rick Maeda said that Bitcoin breaking new records will increase market optimism and trigger new capital inflows into the market. Citing historical data, the analyst noted that Bitcoin's new highs are adding liquidity to the market and driving flows into large-cap altcoins. He predicted that major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP will benefit the most. Bitcoin reaching new highs triggers capital flows into the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. With new liquidity comes increased interest from retail investors and a rebalancing of institutional portfolios. As a result, capital may flow into ETH, SOL, and XRP due to renewed retail enthusiasm and institutional portfolio shifts.” What About Ethereum and Solana? BTSE COO Jeff Mei stated that Ethereum, which made a big move in the recent rally, benefited from increased ETF inflows and renewed institutional interest. Expecting the rally to continue, Mei said, “ETH could soon reclaim $3,200. SOL is also in a good position to revisit the 200 level.” Finally, LVRG Research analyst Nick Ruck said, “Altcoins are lining up to rally on the back of Bitcoin's rally. With regulators easing pressure on crypto brokers and ETF momentum accelerating, a strong environment is emerging for further upward movement.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T14:00:07,"Bitcoin ETFs inflows set new post-Trump election victory high","US Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded their second-biggest inflow day in history. The Bitcoin ETF infow rate is surpassed only by the day Donald Trump won the US presidential election last November. As Bitcoin (BTC) zoomed past $118k on Friday, the Fear and Greed Index ticked into full “greed” mode, and institutional capital came pouring in. Altcoins also followed the Bitcoin surge, as the cumulative crypto market cap surged by 6% over the last day to stay above $3.67 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume is up by a massive 67% to hit $246 billion. However, Bitcoin’s dominance is nearing 64% now. Wall Street pours billions into BTC ETFs Data shows that Bitcoin ETFs posted $1.18 billion of inflows on Thursday alone. This has been recorded as the biggest amount of inflow seen since Trump’s election victory. BTC ETFs saw $1.38 billion of inflow on November 7, 2024, the day the US presidential election results were announced. The funds also posted $1.11 billion of inflows on November 11, 2024. BlackRock’s iShares IBIT led the charge with $448 million in net inflows, while Fidelity’s fund wasn’t far behind with $324 million. The incoming fund surge helped to push IBIT’s daily trading volume past $5 billion. It is nearly twice its normal volume, and the second-highest single-day activity across all 11 US Bitcoin ETFs since they launched in 2024. Ark’s ARKB saw $268 million flowing in, while Grayscale’s BTC ETF posted $81 million of inflow. Meanwhile, Grayscale’s GBTC is the only fund that is losing value, as it recorded $40.1 million of withdrawals. Source: Sosovalue Bitcoin’s price has increased 100% over the last year and is currently trading at an average of $117,850. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 99% to remain above $123 billion. Bitcoin has a market cap of $2.34 trillion. Ethereum ETFs weren’t left out of the party as they saw $383.1 million in inflows, their second-highest ever. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF smashed its own record with a $300.9 million single-day intake. It traded over $800 million across two days. ETFStore’s Nate Geraci called it a “new daily record,” noting that platforms are still gatekeeping access and that financial advisors have barely begun allocating. Trump to join the ETF frenzy All of this is happening as Bitcoin enters full-blown price discovery mode. BTC just notched its second new all-time high this week, and analysts are throwing out $200K price targets like it’s 2021 again. At the same time, ETH cracked above $3,000 for the first time since February. BlackRock’s ETH ETF traded over $800 million across two days. Amid the ETFs surge, Trump is also throwing his own ETF into the ring. Trump Media has filed with the SEC to launch the “Crypto Blue Chip ETF”. It will reportedly hold 70% BTC, 15% ETH, 8% Solana, 5% XRP, and 2% Cronos. The president who once called Bitcoin “a scam” is now pushing a multi-asset crypto ETF tied to his media empire. It follows earlier reports that the Trump family is neck-deep in crypto investments, including potential stakes in American Bitcoin mining and ties to Ripple. Since Trump took office, the SEC has paused several enforcement actions against crypto firms and unveiled more ETF-friendly guidance. Under his administration, crypto is being rebranded from dangerous shadow finance to digital asset innovation.

He expects silver to break above $40, forecasting a quick move toward the $50 level. Schiff says Bitcoin is “digital fool’s gold” with no utility compared to precious metals.

His recommendation comes as silver trades above $37 with nearly 2% daily gains, positioning the precious metal for what he anticipates will be a larger advance than Bitcoin’s continued rise.

2025-07-11T13:50:15,"Bitcoin Investment: Remixpoint’s Strategic Acquisition Amplifies BTC Holdings to 1,168.28","In the dynamic world of digital assets, corporate moves often signal broader market trends. A recent development that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community is the Japanese energy consulting firm Remixpoint’s latest foray into the Bitcoin market. This strategic acquisition is more than just a purchase; it underscores a growing confidence among traditional businesses in the long-term viability and value of digital assets. Remixpoint, already a notable player in the corporate crypto space, has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to its Bitcoin investment strategy, solidifying its position as a significant corporate holder of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Why is Remixpoint BTC Investment a Game Changer? Remixpoint’s decision to purchase an additional 116.72 BTC is not an isolated event but a continuation of a well-defined corporate strategy. This latest acquisition brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,168.28 BTC, as reported by Odaily. For a company primarily known for energy consulting, this substantial commitment to Bitcoin speaks volumes about their outlook on the future of finance and technology. What makes Remixpoint’s move particularly significant? Strategic Diversification: It highlights a trend where companies are looking beyond traditional assets for treasury management, seeking hedges against inflation and alternative growth opportunities. Early Adoption Credibility: Remixpoint was an early corporate adopter of Bitcoin, and their continued accumulation lends credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for institutional portfolios. Influence in Japan: As a Japanese firm, their actions can influence other businesses in a country known for its cautious yet progressive stance on cryptocurrency regulation and adoption. Long-Term Vision: Accumulating Bitcoin, especially during market fluctuations, suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition rather than short-term speculation. This ongoing accumulation by Remixpoint is a clear signal to the market that a well-researched and disciplined approach to Bitcoin can be integrated into a company’s financial framework. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Remixpoint is certainly not alone in its pursuit of Bitcoin. Over the past few years, a discernible trend has emerged: publicly traded companies, private enterprises, and even investment funds are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This phenomenon has transformed Bitcoin from a niche digital currency into a recognized corporate treasury asset. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Block (formerly Square) have pioneered this movement, each with their unique motivations: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often viewed as a scarce asset, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power. Growth Potential: Companies see the potential for significant appreciation, viewing Bitcoin as a high-growth asset that can enhance shareholder value over time. Technological Alignment: For tech-forward companies, holding Bitcoin aligns with their innovative ethos and positions them at the forefront of financial technology. Treasury Management: Diversifying cash reserves away from low-yield traditional instruments into a potentially higher-yielding, uncorrelated asset. While the motivations vary, the underlying theme is a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable component of a modern corporate treasury strategy. The transparency of these holdings, often disclosed in financial reports, adds a layer of institutional validation to the cryptocurrency market. Understanding Bitcoin Investment Strategies for Corporations For corporations considering a dive into Bitcoin, the strategy extends beyond a simple purchase. It involves a comprehensive understanding of the asset, its risks, and its potential rewards. Remixpoint’s consistent accumulation points to a disciplined approach that other firms can learn from. Key aspects of a corporate Bitcoin investment strategy include: Risk Assessment and Management: Bitcoin’s volatility is a primary concern. Companies must establish clear risk tolerance levels, potentially hedging strategies, and robust internal controls to manage exposure. Custody Solutions: Secure storage of Bitcoin is paramount. This often involves engaging institutional-grade custodians that offer cold storage, multi-signature wallets, and robust security protocols. Regulatory and Accounting Considerations: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape and understanding the accounting treatment of Bitcoin (e.g., as an intangible asset) are crucial. This requires expert legal and accounting advice. Board and Shareholder Approval: Such a significant strategic shift often requires buy-in from the board of directors and clear communication with shareholders about the rationale and benefits. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Objectives: Is the Bitcoin held as a long-term treasury asset, or is there a component for active trading? Remixpoint’s consistent additions suggest a long-term holding strategy. A well-thought-out strategy minimizes potential pitfalls and maximizes the benefits of integrating Bitcoin into a corporate balance sheet. It’s not just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about building a resilient and future-proof financial framework. What Does This Mean for Japanese Bitcoin Adoption ? Japan has a unique relationship with cryptocurrency. It was one of the first countries to recognize Bitcoin as legal property and has a well-developed regulatory framework. However, corporate adoption, especially among traditional firms, has been somewhat slower compared to other regions like North America. Remixpoint’s continued and significant Bitcoin investment sends a strong signal within Japan: Building Trust: A reputable energy consulting firm embracing Bitcoin can help build trust and familiarity among other Japanese businesses and the general public, potentially easing skepticism. Setting a Precedent: Remixpoint’s success and transparency with its Bitcoin holdings could encourage other Japanese companies to explore similar strategies, fostering broader corporate adoption. Regulatory Confidence: The fact that a Japanese company is making such large-scale investments within the existing regulatory framework might indirectly affirm the robustness of Japan’s crypto regulations. Innovation Hub: It reinforces Japan’s position as an innovation hub, willing to embrace new technologies and financial paradigms, even in traditional sectors. While one company’s actions don’t define an entire nation’s trajectory, Remixpoint’s consistent moves are undoubtedly a positive indicator for the future of Bitcoin and digital assets in Japan’s corporate landscape. The Future of Corporate BTC Investment Strategy The trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings is likely to continue evolving. As more companies become comfortable with the asset class, we might see increasingly sophisticated strategies emerge. These could include: Broader Asset Classes: Companies might expand beyond Bitcoin to include other major cryptocurrencies or even tokenized assets as part of their treasury. Integrated Crypto Operations: Beyond just holding, companies might start integrating crypto payments, blockchain-based supply chains, or even decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols into their core operations. Enhanced Reporting and Transparency: As regulations mature, there will likely be clearer guidelines for reporting and auditing crypto assets, leading to greater transparency. ESG Considerations: With growing concerns about environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, companies might increasingly consider the environmental impact of their Bitcoin holdings, potentially favoring greener mining initiatives. Remixpoint’s proactive stance exemplifies a forward-thinking approach to corporate finance. Their ongoing commitment to Bitcoin is not just about accumulating an asset; it’s about positioning the company for a future where digital assets play a central role in the global economy. This strategic vision, coupled with disciplined execution, sets a compelling example for businesses worldwide contemplating their own journey into the crypto realm. A Bold Step Towards a Digital Future Remixpoint’s latest acquisition of 116.72 BTC, pushing their total holdings to over 1,168 BTC, is a significant event that resonates far beyond the confines of their balance sheet. It is a powerful testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic asset for corporate treasuries. This move by a Japanese energy consulting firm underscores the global nature of Bitcoin adoption and its increasing integration into traditional financial strategies. As more companies like Remixpoint embrace Bitcoin, the landscape of corporate finance is undeniably shifting, paving the way for a more digitally-native and decentralized economic future. Their consistent and expanding Bitcoin investment strategy serves as a beacon, highlighting the potential for long-term value creation and diversification in an ever-evolving market.

2025-07-11T13:30:04,"Bitcoin Rally: Unveiling the Next Explosive Phase","The cryptocurrency world is buzzing! Bitcoin has once again defied expectations, smashing through previous all-time highs and sending ripples of excitement across the globe. But hold on a second – if you think this Bitcoin rally is just another fleeting speculative bubble, you might be missing the bigger picture. This isn’t your typical retail-driven frenzy; something fundamentally different is unfolding, suggesting that the most exciting chapters of this journey are still unwritten. Decoding the Current Bitcoin Rally: Why It’s Different In a recent and insightful update, crypto services provider Matrixport highlighted a crucial distinction about the current Bitcoin rally . Unlike the euphoric surges of 2017 or 2021, where leverage and rampant retail speculation often fueled parabolic climbs (and subsequent corrections), this ascent is remarkably grounded. We’re seeing: Minimal Leverage: The market isn’t overheated with excessive borrowed funds, which typically makes rallies fragile. Limited Retail Speculation: While retail interest is growing, it’s not the primary driver. This suggests a more organic, less volatile growth trajectory. Strong Spot ETF Inflows: A relentless stream of capital is pouring in from newly launched exchange-traded funds. Rising Institutional Demand: Major players, from hedge funds to asset managers, are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin. This unique confluence of factors paints a picture of a more mature, robust market. It’s not just about price action; it’s about a structural shift in how Bitcoin is perceived and adopted globally. The foundations for sustained growth appear stronger than ever, signaling that this Bitcoin rally has deeper roots and potentially much further to run. The Unstoppable Force: Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Perhaps the single most impactful catalyst for Bitcoin’s recent surge has been the monumental success of the Spot Bitcoin ETF s in the United States. Since their approval, these investment vehicles have become a magnet for capital, providing a regulated, accessible, and familiar gateway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Consider the sheer volume: major players like BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC have seen unprecedented inflows, quickly accumulating hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins. This isn’t just new money entering the ecosystem; it’s a fundamental re-allocation of capital from traditional finance into digital assets. The demand from these ETFs is so significant that it often outpaces the daily supply of newly mined Bitcoin, creating a supply-demand imbalance that naturally pushes prices higher. This sustained buying pressure from the Spot Bitcoin ETF s acts as a powerful tailwind, providing a consistent bid for Bitcoin that was largely absent in previous cycles. It’s a clear signal that Bitcoin is transitioning from a niche asset to a mainstream investment vehicle. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Demand: A Paradigm Shift? Beyond the direct impact of ETFs, the broader trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin demand is arguably the most significant long-term driver. For years, Bitcoin was primarily a retail phenomenon, dismissed by traditional finance as too volatile or speculative. That narrative has dramatically shifted. Today, major financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are actively exploring or already holding Bitcoin as part of their diversified portfolios. Why this change? Institutions are recognizing Bitcoin’s unique properties: Digital Gold: A hedge against inflation and currency debasement, especially in an era of unprecedented global debt. Portfolio Diversification: Its low correlation with traditional assets makes it an attractive addition for risk management. Technological Innovation: A bet on the future of decentralized finance and digital economies. This surge in institutional Bitcoin demand is not merely about speculation; it’s about strategic long-term allocation. These are not weak hands looking for quick profits; they are sophisticated investors building positions with a multi-year horizon. This fundamental shift lends unprecedented legitimacy and stability to the market, laying the groundwork for a truly global, institutionalized asset class. Unveiling Unpriced Catalysts: What Drives Bitcoin Price Prediction? While the current drivers are strong, Matrixport’s report emphasizes that several significant bullish catalysts remain largely ‘unpriced’ by the market. This means their potential positive impact hasn’t been fully factored into the current Bitcoin price prediction , suggesting further upside as they gain traction. What are these hidden gems? Mounting Political Pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve: The political landscape often influences monetary policy. As economic pressures mount, there could be increased calls for the Federal Reserve to ease its stance, potentially through interest rate cuts or more accommodative policies. Such moves typically boost risk assets like Bitcoin, making it more attractive relative to traditional investments. The Potential Passage of the GENIUS Act: While specific details about a ‘GENIUS Act’ in relation to crypto aren’t widely publicized, in the context of bullish catalysts, it likely refers to hypothetical, forward-looking legislation that could be highly favorable to the crypto industry. This could involve clearer regulatory frameworks, tax incentives for digital asset adoption, or government support for blockchain innovation. Any significant positive legislative development would provide immense clarity and confidence, unlocking further institutional investment and adoption, thereby positively impacting the Bitcoin price prediction . Historically Strong July Seasonality: The crypto market, like traditional markets, sometimes exhibits seasonal patterns. Historically, July has shown a tendency for positive price action for Bitcoin. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, this historical trend adds another layer of potential tailwind, especially when combined with stronger fundamental drivers. These unpriced catalysts represent potential ‘surprise’ upsides that could propel Bitcoin into new territories, adding fuel to the ongoing rally and shaping future Bitcoin price prediction models. Navigating the Crypto Market Outlook: Are Traders Underexposed? Despite Bitcoin’s impressive breakout to new all-time highs, a fascinating aspect highlighted by Matrixport is that most traders remain underexposed. This means a significant portion of the market, including both institutional and retail participants, has not yet fully committed to the current uptrend. What does this imply for the overall crypto market outlook ? Room for Further Upside: If a large segment of traders is still on the sidelines, there’s a substantial pool of capital waiting to enter the market. As prices continue to rise and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) sets in, this sidelined capital could flood in, pushing Bitcoin even higher. Reduced Risk of Immediate Overheating: Unlike rallies driven by speculative frenzy, the current ‘underexposure’ suggests that the market isn’t yet in a state of irrational exuberance, providing a healthier environment for sustained growth. Actionable Insights for Your Portfolio: Given this optimistic crypto market outlook , what should investors consider? Assess Your Exposure: Honestly evaluate if your current portfolio allocation aligns with your long-term conviction in Bitcoin. Are you truly prepared for potential further upside? Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For those looking to increase exposure, DCA remains a prudent strategy to mitigate volatility and build a position over time. Stay Informed on Catalysts: Keep a close eye on developments related to Fed policy, regulatory news, and market sentiment, as these could accelerate the ‘unpriced’ catalysts. Risk Management: While the outlook is positive, always adhere to sound risk management principles. Only invest what you can afford to lose and understand the inherent volatility of the crypto market. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the outlook for the Bitcoin rally appears robust, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential headwinds. Regulatory uncertainty, though improving, can still introduce volatility. Macroeconomic shifts, unexpected geopolitical events, or significant profit-taking by large holders could temporarily dampen enthusiasm. However, the underlying narrative of increasing institutional adoption and a more mature market structure suggests that any dips may be seen as buying opportunities rather than signs of a prolonged downturn. The fundamental drivers indicate a resilient path forward. A Compelling Future for Bitcoin The current Bitcoin rally is not just another surge; it’s a testament to the asset’s evolving maturity and growing acceptance in mainstream finance. Driven by unprecedented Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and burgeoning institutional Bitcoin demand, this rally stands on far more solid ground than its predecessors. With significant unpriced catalysts like shifting political pressures, potential legislative tailwinds, and historical seasonal trends still on the horizon, the stage is set for Bitcoin to continue its remarkable ascent. The market’s current underexposure only reinforces the potential for further upside, suggesting that the journey towards wider adoption and higher valuations is far from over. This is a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, marking its undeniable transition into a truly global, institutional-grade asset.

2025-07-11T13:23:51,"Top Crypto That Will Pump Hard if Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Its ATH Soon","The post Top Crypto That Will Pump Hard if Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks Its ATH Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News If Bitcoin is about to explode past its all-time high, it won’t just be BTC making headlines, a select few altcoins are perfectly positioned to ride the wave. New DeFi coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the pack. This under-the-radar gem is gaining momentum fast, and investors are already calling it one of the top tokens to grab before July ends. The project is priced at $0.03 in the 5th presale phase, which is more than 65% sold. Those who invest in this phase will get a 100% return on investment after listing the token. More than $12. million has already been raised, with a total of more than 13,000 early investors. During presale Phase 6, the token will cost $0.035, and that represents 16.67% return on investments made in Phase 5. Mutuum Finance could 100x if Bitcoin breaks its ATH. BTC on the Brink: The Trigger for the Next Altcoin Surge? As of now, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $108,723, just shy of its all-time high of $111,970 reached in May 2025. The price action has been consolidating beneath major resistance, with increasing volume suggesting a breakout could be imminent. A confirmed move above its ATH would not only validate bullish sentiment but also historically acts as a catalyst for altcoin rallies. During previous cycles, BTC breakouts have triggered sharp inflows into mid- and low-cap tokens as traders rotate profits down the chain. If Bitcoin flips this level into support, it could unlock a high-volatility environment, one where fast-moving projects like Mutuum Finance are poised to benefit from the spillover momentum. Mutuum Presale Powers Past $12M as Hype Accelerates The Mutuum Finance presale has more than 13,000 investors and has raised more than $12 million. Investors have picked up more than 65% of the tokens in phase 5. This indicates growing confidence of investors in the short-term success of the project as well as in their bright future. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering $100,000 giveaway , divided into 10 winners of $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 holders of the Mutuum Finance will be rewarded under its newly introduced leaderboard system. As the users level up they will be rewarded the bonus tokens. Innovating DeFi: How Mutuum Finance Is Reshaping Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transforming DeFi lending through the creation of a platform that renders customers the sole owner of their assets. It is a workable multifunctional double-lending system, which incorporates the synergy of both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. In P2C, lending pools are utilized via smart contracts. The platform is sensitive to prevailing market conditions in real time, an aspect that makes returns to lenders less volatile and borrowers financially stable. Through the elimination of intermediaries, the P2P model provides direct lending, which is particularly convenient on highly volatile assets like meme coins. If Bitcoin (BTC) breaks its all-time high of $111,970, the biggest winners may not be BTC holders, but early backers of fast-moving altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $12 million raised, more than 13,000 investors, and 65% of Phase 5 already sold out, Mutuum is quickly cementing itself as a top crypto contender for 2025. Investors buying in now at $0.03 are guaranteed a 100% ROI upon listing, with even Phase 6 offering a solid 16.67% gain over current prices. Built on a revolutionary dual lending model and backed by a $100K giveaway and leaderboard rewards system, Mutuum is more than hype, it’s real DeFi innovation.

With Bitcoin soaring past $118,000 and Ethereum closing in on the $3,000 mark, Hayes believes a powerful rally across altcoins is imminent. Arthur Hayes Flips Bullish as Bitcoin Breaks Out Initially cautious due to the U.S. Treasury General Account (TGA) restocking plan, Hayes has now shifted his stance. In a recent post on X, he wrote , “BTC busted through ATH on good volume, ETH is following and will outperform — get ready for a monster alt szn.” Previously, he warned that the TGA’s $850 billion refill target could drain liquidity from the market. However, with Bitcoin breaking new highs and Ethereum gaining strength , Hayes now views this as a short-term hurdle. Ethereum to $10,000? Hayes Thinks It’s Possible Hayes believes Ethereum is poised to outperform, potentially reaching $10,000, driven by increasing corporate adoption and strong on-chain metrics. With ETH gaining institutional interest and showing signs of bullish divergence, the setup for an explosive rally looks more probable than ever. The Stablecoin Liquidity Bazooka In his blog post “ Quid Pro Stablecoin ,” Hayes argues that bank-issued stablecoins could unlock $6.8 trillion in liquidity, acting as a “liquidity bazooka” for the U.S. Treasury. Major banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo are expected to accelerate this stablecoin adoption. While the TGA refill may temporarily tighten liquidity, Hayes sees it as a blip in a larger bullish cycle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025) , Altcoin Season Coming Soon? Currently, the Altcoin Season Index is at 30/100 — far from confirming a full-blown altseason. Still, Hayes stands by his earlier May prediction that a summer rally would unfold. He sees growing momentum and believes the breakout in BTC and ETH will soon spread to major altcoins like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche. Adding fuel to the fire, Hayes mentioned the Maelstrom Fund is going all-in, citing the market’s anticipation of Donald Trump’s possible return and expected tariff policies, which could further boost market liquidity. Final Thoughts: A Game-Changing Moment for Crypto Arthur Hayes has a strong track record in market timing, and his confidence has caught the attention of investors across the crypto space. With Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge, and new liquidity drivers emerging, this could be the beginning of a major altcoin run. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In his “Quid Pro Stablecoin” essay, Hayes argues that bank-issued stablecoins could unlock $6.8 trillion in liquidity for the U.S. Treasury. This “liquidity bazooka” would come from major banks converting dormant deposits into on-chain dollars (stablecoins) which can then be recycled into Treasury bills. How might political factors influence this potential altseason? Hayes also cites the market’s anticipation of Donald Trump’s possible return to power and expected tariff policies as contributing factors. These political developments could further boost market liquidity, adding fuel to the potential “monster altseason.”",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arthur-hayes-predicts-monster-altcoin-season-as-bitcoin-hits-new-ath/,"BTC|ALTCOIN|ETH|TRADING|MARKET","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T13:14:53,"Taking Off: Why Aviator Is the Fastest-Rising Game in Online Casinos","Due to its rapid action and eye-catching design, the Aviator game is becoming increasingly popular with gamers. Players all over the globe are turning to the new brand of crash game, which mixes skill, timing and suspense with all the plays. Online trends for casinos go up and down, yet few have become hits like the Aviator. With a minimalist design and adrenaline-pumping format, it provides something beyond the norm compared to cards and slots. With players looking for fast, interactive wagering, the Aviator has filled a void that continues to grow through global platforms. You now see the online Aviator climbing through the rankings of favorite casino offerings, standing out in a crowded marketplace. Mechanics of the Crash At first, Aviator appears incredibly simple. A plane takes off the screen and a multiplier increases every second thereafter. As easy as that: cash out before the plane flies away. Hold back as long as possible; the higher the payout potential, the more you will lose the bet if the plane crashes before you cash out. This high-risk, high-reward aspect invokes instant decision-making and guarantees a sit-at-the-edge-of-your-seat gaming session. There are no payoff lines and spinning reels—merely a single increasing curve and a eureka moment set the winners apart from the spectators. The crash format, which we see in a few other games, lends itself perfectly to mobile play. It requires attention, yet doesn’t require a commitment of several hours. You can dip into the game for a couple of minutes on sites like aviator online and play several rounds, which makes it a convenient option depending on how you want to play. Why Simplicity Wins One reason why Aviator has been a success is because of how simple it is. Unlike fancy table games or multi-featured slots, aviator can easily be learned and played. You don’t have symbols to remember, hands to overcome and rules that need a strategy book. Intuitive: the game is easy to use—click to place your bet, click to cash out. This universality makes it accessible to players of all walks and skill levels. Whether you are a grizzled veteran of the casinos or a newcomer to the online bets scene, the intimidation element of the game vanishes when you play the Aviator. It boils down to the universal language of risk versus reward, all wrapped with a neat, modern design. Risk, Time and Adrenaline Aviator’s allure extends beyond visual or architectural—it is a psychological one. That risk vs. reward tension comes all at once and all the time. Each second the player hesitates to cash out is a likelihood of profit, but the ever-nearing risk of loss. This kind of play is based on what psychologists refer to as “intermittent reinforcement.” Like traditional gambling, not all spins reward, yet the chance that the next one does ensures players stay engaged. With short spin times and immediate, real-time resolution, the system could not be better optimized for thrill-seeking activity. Not only are players observing the multiplier rise, but they are also receiving a shot of dopamine with each decision point. That’s the ultimate self-control versus temptation exercise. Social Betting and Real-Time Thrills Unlike various solo-play slots, the Aviator adds a group dynamic to the game. Most game versions include a running chat window or leaderboard, which shows how the other players are betting and when they are cashing out. With the live aspect, players are part of a shared sense of fellowship—and occasionally, a rivalry. Seeing other players land giant wins or lose right as a significant multiplier occurs raises entertainment and psychological tension. That, too, encourages interactive gaming, as the players are free to adjust their strategy based on what the other players are doing. That’s what makes the game have a “live” quality, even though it is virtual. Flexible Payment Options Spurring Global Access One reason Aviator became universally accessible is the variety of payment systems that online casinos now offer. Consumers can now utilize old, familiar instruments like credit cards and debit cards and new online payment systems like e-wallets and online banks. That variety allows players from different countries to process transactions quickly and securely. Several casinos have been accepting cryptocurrency payments in addition to the standard payment method. Bitcoin, in particular, is becoming a more popular and secure option among tech-savvy users who want safe and anonymous transactions. Its rising popularity allows players greater freedom, specifically in areas where banking regulations may hamper common deposits—incorporating convenience, speed and security into current payment methods is a primary driver of the game’s expanding coverage to various player markets. What does the popularity of Aviator Mean for the Future of Online Gaming? Aviator’s explosive popularity indicates a broader shift in gamers’ preferences. Casual online casino gamers aren’t looking for over-the-top graphics or retro theming–they want interactivity, speed and true decision-making. Aviator achieves all three, delivering a tight, reactive gaming experience that rewards guts and gut instinct. This success may mark the beginning of a new trend in game design. Game developers might consider adding real-time multipliers, crash systems, or hybrid wager formats. We’re already starting to see initial manifestations of this through crypto casinos and wagering games with an esports twist. For online players yearning for a new and exciting adventure, the game isn’t a fad; it’s pointing the way ahead for the whole industry.

Aside from Bitcoin, It Will Acquire Ethereum, XRP, and Four More Surprise Altcoins!","Apart from Bitcoin (BTC), altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP and Solana also began to attract attention within the scope of the treasury strategy. At this point, while many companies have added altcoins such as ETH and XRP to their reserves, the latest move came from Thumzup, where US President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., is also a shareholder. The company announced in its official statement that it will expand its Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy to include Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), XRP, and USDC. 6 More Altcoins to Buy Besides Bitcoin! Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed brand and social media marketing solutions provider, announced that its Board of Directors has approved an expanded list of digital assets for its crypto treasury strategy. The company's board has expanded its previous strategy, which paved the way for holding up to 90% of its liquid assets in Bitcoin. Accordingly, in addition to Bitcoin (BTC), the company will now be able to hold DOGE, LTC, SOL, XRP, ETH and USD Coin (USDC) in its reserves. Thumzup also disclosed that President Donald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., owns 350,000 shares in the company, worth approximately $4 million at current prices. Trump Jr.'s stake in Thumzup is the latest move by the Trump family to invest in companies pursuing cryptocurrency treasury strategies. Earlier in March, Eric Trump joined the advisory board of Metaplanet, a Japanese firm that has followed in the footsteps of MicroStrategy and allocated a large portion of its corporate reserves to Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T13:08:03,"Here’s why Pi Network price is primed for a short squeeze","Pi Network price remained in a tight range this week, even as Bitcoin and other altcoins surged. Pi Coin ( PI ) was trading at $0.4900 on Friday, July 11, a few points above this week’s low of $0.4530. Still, there are several reasons why the coin is on the verge of a bullish breakout. First, data shows that the monthly token unlock will slow down over the next few months, reducing the number of coins brought to the market. Pi will unlock over 175 million coins this month, 137 million in August, 116 million in September, and 93 million in October. The token unlock pace will then rebound in November and December before falling for the next eight consecutive months. Second, Pi Coin price will likely benefit from the ongoing crypto bull run . Bitcoin ( BTC ) has already jumped to a record high as we had predicted here and here . This rally could continue as it targets the cup-and-handle target of nearly $150,000. A Bitcoin surge will likely lead to more gains among most altcoins. Third, Pi Network’s developers recently unveiled the Pi AI Studio that is helping developers build artificial intelligence-powered applications. Data shows that developers have already pitched thousands of applications. While not all will succeed, a few successful ones could help power its ecosystem. The new Pi App submissions for the AI App Studio have surpassed 12,000! Even if only half of these DApps become fully functional and approved, Pi Network could become the biggest project in crypto history due to: * The highest number of KYC-verified users * The largest… pic.twitter.com/58pvRzB7SE — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) July 9, 2025 Apps developed on the network will be supported by existing Pi Network products like Pi Ad Network, .pi Domains, and Pi Wallet. Those with substantial potential may also receive funding from the $100 million Pi Network Ventures. Most importantly, there is still a slim chance that Pi Network will be listed by major exchanges like Upbit, Binance, and Coinbase. Such a listing would likely trigger a major short squeeze. Pi Network price analysis Pi Coin price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Pi Coin price has formed contrarian patterns that could stimulate a rebound. It has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.40 and a neckline at $1.6625. Pi Network has also formed a falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish reversal signal. In addition, its Bollinger Bands and Average True Range point to low volatility, which often leads to a short squeeze.

According to popular crypto analyst Kevin Svenson , this correlation signals the start of a potential parabolic rally for Bitcoin. S&P 500 Reaches Historic High of 6,333 Earlier this month, the S&P 500 index started at 6,187.28 and steadily climbed by 1.51%, eventually reaching a new record high of 6,333 points. Svenson highlights that Bitcoin often mirrors such movements in traditional markets. The recent S&P breakout could be the catalyst fueling Bitcoin’s ongoing surge . Bitcoin Price Breakout: $118K and Climbing Bitcoin began the month around $105,678.62, mostly trading between $105K–$109K until July 8, when strong buying pressure kicked in. Since then, Bitcoin has soared by 8.99%, reaching its latest peak of $118,397.8. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Liquidations Top $1 Billion as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High , Kevin Svenson Predicts a Parabolic BTC Rally Svenson believes the current breakout is only the beginning.

As of July 11, 2025, the overall crypto market is showing strong positive momentum, with Bitcoin hovering around its new all-time highs. Major altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana are also seeing significant gains, indicating a broad bullish trend. Will Bitcoin price reach new highs? Yes, Bitcoin has already reached new all-time highs in July 2025, surging past $112,000 and even hitting $116,000. Analysts suggest continued upside potential, with some even forecasting $150,000 or more in the coming months if current momentum holds. How are altcoins performing during Bitcoin’s rally? Following Bitcoin’s strong moves, altcoins are also “waking up.” Ethereum crossed $2,900 (up 14% this week), XRP surged to $2.57 (up 13%), and Solana rose to $164 (up 8%). This indicates a typical liquidity rotation.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-price-today-breaks-all-time-high-as-stock-market-soars-whats-coming-next/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ALTCOIN","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-11T13:06:41,"No Major Gains for Pi Network (PI)? Analyst Reveals the Reason","TL;DR PI’s price increased by a mere 2.2% daily, possibly held back by low liquidity, concerns over centralization , and weak investor confidence. Over 215 million PI tokens are set to unlock soon, while exchange holdings have risen to 381.4 million, signaling potential selling ahead. PI Lags Behind The entire cryptocurrency market has been on fire over the past few days, with Bitcoin (BTC) tapping a new all-time high price of over $118,000. The altcoins performed quite well, too: Ethereum (ETH) spiked by 8% daily to surpass $3,000, Ripple (XRP) jumped by 9%, and Cardano (ADA) headed north by 16%. Pi Network (PI) has also posted some gains, albeit far insignificant compared to the majority of cryptocurrencies. Its valuation increased by 2.2% over the last 24 hours, and it currently trades at just below $0.50. Its market cap briefly exceeded $4 billion before retracing to the current $3.8 billion, making PI the 38th-largest digital asset. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko According to one popular X user, the native token of the controversial crypto project could follow BTC’s bullish momentum. However, they suggested that PI’s “missing decentralization, communication from the CT, and liquidity” would hamper the prospects of serious gains. “It won’t rise any significantly as it does not have enough liquidity and no decentralization. No one wants to put capital into an ecosystem where 1 couple controls everything,” the X user claimed . Despite a slight price uptick over the last 24 hours, PI is down 70% on a two-month scale. X user Zoe recently argued that the asset’s “main problem” lies in its massive supply and the constant release of new tokens. More than 215 million coins are set to unlock in the next month, with approximately 13.3 million PI scheduled on July 11 alone. This development allows investors to sell their holdings, potentially pushing the valuation even lower. PI Token Unlocks, Source: piscan.io Zoe thinks PI’s price may continue to “bleed slowly” as long as the team behind the project does not introduce a burning mechanism. Another Bearish Factor The rising number of PI coins stored on centralized crypto exchanges indicates a rising selling pressure and could contribute to a renewed downturn in the asset’s price. The total amount of coins on such platforms stood at 376 million as of July 10, but over the past 24 hours, there was an increase of approximately four million, bringing the figure to 381.4 million. Gate.io leads with 178.5 million in their depositing wallet, whereas Bitget comes in second with 133.7 million. The post No Major Gains for Pi Network (PI)?

2025-07-11T13:06:29,"Ted Pillows: Ethereum Price Poised for $4,000 Rally","The post Ted Pillows: Ethereum Price Poised for $4,000 Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Ethereum price (ETH) has recently gained significant traction in July 2025, riding the bullish wave generated by Bitcoin’s new all-time high. With fresh ETF inflows, technical breakouts, and expert bullish opinions, the top altcoin is now eyeing a major milestone of $4,000. Ethereum Price Action: Breaking Consolidation The Ethereum price has recently surpassed the June first week’s high of $2,870, currently trading at $2,986 with a market capitalization of $360.76 billion. The momentum in the second week has broken through a two-month consolidation range, resulting in a remarkable 43% rise over the past 20 days, with this week alone contributing over 19% to that gain. This surge follows Bitcoin’s impressive performance, as it recently reached a new all-time high of $118,340, generating significant excitement across the entire altcoin sector. As the top altcoin, Ethereum couldn’t afford to remain stagnant while Bitcoin electrifies the market. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs have seen over $700 million in inflows during the second week of July. This level of momentum hasn’t been observed since December 2024, when Ethereum ETFs attracted over $830 million in the first week, according to Sosovalue. The optimism surrounding Ethereum isn’t solely driven by ETF activity and Bitcoin’s rise; a combination of factors, including substantial institutional investments, is also at play. Experts, including Limbo, suggest that with the range now broken and Ethereum trading above key levels, the long-awaited ETH season may finally came. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Arthur Hayes Predicts Monster Altcoin Season as Bitcoin Hits New ATH , Ted Pillows says- It Is Going For $4000 In a recent update, investor and analyst Ted Pillows shared a clean ETH price chart just hours ago, highlighting that the $2,800 level has finally been broken after several months of testing. $ETH broke key $2,800 resistance and is showing strength.

Meanwhile, another analysis from crypto YouTuber named Crypto Rover draws a striking comparison between Ethereum crypto’s current structure and Bitcoin’s reaction in Q1 2024. He notes that the same pattern is emerging in Q3 2025 for Ethereum, suggesting a potential bullish trajectory ahead. FAQs Where do you see ETH by December 2025? As per our Ethereum price forecast 2025, the ETH price could reach a maximum of $5,925. Will Ethereum price hit $20,000 in 2030? According to our Ethereum Price Prediction 2030, the ETH coin price could reach a maximum of $15,575 by 2030. Is Ethereum a good investment?
