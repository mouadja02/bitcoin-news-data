2025-07-11T17:56:32,"U.S. stocks dip, Nasdaq seesaws as Trump targets Canada","Wall Street's major averages were mostly lower on Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) tilted both sides of the flat line as President Donald Trump slapped a 35% tariff on Canada and warned of further hikes if Ottawa retaliated. Market participants also took a bit of a breather after back-to-back record closes for the benchmark S&P 500 index ( SP500 ). The S&P ( SP500 ) was last -0.2% in afternoon trade, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( COMP:IND ) was flat, and the blue-chip Dow Jones ( DJI ) was last -0.6% . Trump announced on Thursday a 35% tariff on Canada and warned about further hikes if Ottawa decided to respond. These levies are expected to take effect Aug. 1, according to a letter posted on his Truth Social account. In addition, Trump said he would impose blanket tariffs of 15-20% on other remaining countries. “Stocks are not quite desensitized to tariff headlines just yet. We are still seeing knee-jerk reactions to negative trade headlines. Volatility is an opportunity for investors who are still too exposed to cash,” said Michael Landsberg, CIO at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. Over in the bond market, the 10-year Treasury yield ( US10Y ) rose 7 basis points to 4.42%, while the 2-year yield ( US2Y ) rose 2 basis points to 3.91%. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to a new all-time high on Friday, fueled by growing institutional interest and supportive signals from the Trump administration. On Friday's economic calendar, the monthly Treasury Statement budget is expected to be in deficit by $50B in June versus $70.9B in June 2024. The focus will shift slightly from tariffs and trade developments to the second quarter U.S. earnings season, which kicks off next week with reports from major banks. ""We believe second quarter earnings will be good, but not as good as first quarter. Much of the second quarter was marked with tariff and trade issues, and that may have caused some dislocations in earnings for certain industries as their customers may have been in a holding pattern,"" said Landsberg.

2025-07-11T17:53:23,"Dogecoin Price Prediction: Fib Extension Flashes $4 Target – How Quickly Can DOGE Get There?","Dogecoin has reclaimed the spotlight as the original meme coin surges back above the $0.20 threshold following exactly one month of consolidation. Fibonacci extension levels now indicate an ambitious $4 target, with trading volume returning to the market amid Bitcoin’s historic price highs. Currently trading at $0.199 after experiencing a minor pullback, DOGE maintains a 10% daily gain while extending its weekly performance to 19.61%. $7.6 Billion Futures Bet on Dogecoin Rally As Analysts Agree DOGE is Primed for 2000% Breakout One of the most remarkable aspects of this rally is Dogecoin’s consistent trading volume, which has surpassed that of higher-ranked cryptocurrencies like Binance Coin (BNB) . For perspective, DOGE recorded over $2.5 billion in trading volume with a market capitalization of $29.8 billion, while BNB generated $2.3 billion in volume despite its substantially larger $95.8 billion market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, market sentiment suggests sustained interest in DOGE’s upward trajectory. In the futures market, over $7.6 billion has been traded within the past 24 hours, with positions betting on DOGE’s continued ascent. Source: Coinglass Open interest for Dogecoin remains decidedly positive, with approximately $2.7 billion in capital backing the meme coin over the last 24 hours. This heightened level of interest has prompted seasoned investors and analysts to believe Dogecoin can revisit its $0.7376 all-time high, achieved in 2021. Prominent DOGE investor “doge god” shared a chart projecting a Dogecoin rally to $3.80.

For Dogecoin to reach the $4 Fibonacci target, the DOGE community, popularly known as the “DOGE ARMY”, would need compelling reasons to mobilize, as they have repeatedly demonstrated their unmatched influence in the meme coin market. One of the movement’s most prominent long-term supporters is Tesla and X CEO Elon Musk, who has consistently advocated for the cryptocurrency. In April 2021, following Dogecoin’s historic highs, Musk posted that “SpaceX is going to put a literal Dogecoin on the literal moon,” referencing the popular crypto slang “to the moon.” A year later, the SpaceX founder reaffirmed his commitment to supporting Dogecoin’s growth. I will keep supporting Dogecoin — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 19, 2022 On the technical front, the DOGE/USDT 4-hour chart displays a breakout from a descending channel, signaling a reversal from recent bearish momentum. This bullish breakout is reinforced by a rising RSI, which has crossed above the 70 level, indicating strong buying pressure and potential for continued upward movement. Source: TradingView Additionally, the MACD histogram has turned positive, further supporting the bullish momentum thesis. Price currently hovers around $0.1985 and appears positioned to target the next key resistance zone near $0.30. Should momentum persist, DOGE could rally toward the $0.43–$0.45 region, which represents a previous high. A continuation beyond that level opens the path for a move toward $0.50 and eventually $0.58, aligning with the projected trajectory analysis. A short-term pullback may occur around $0.30 before the uptrend resumes, but the overall structure remains decidedly bullish.

With the price climbing above $118,000, further gains are expected. At this point, a prediction came from Cardano (ADA) founder Charles Hoskinson. After Bitcoin broke new records, Charles Hoskinson once again predicted a $250,000 price target for BTC. Bitcoin Bull Target! Stating that a bigger bull run is ahead of us and calling the next phase a “gigachad bull run,” Charles Hoskinson claimed that Bitcoin could reach $250,000. The Cardano founder claimed that Bitcoin's rise will be driven by the approval of two important bills: the GENIUS Stablecoin Act and the CLARITY Act. These bills aim to create a comprehensive federal framework for stablecoin and digital asset regulation. If passed, these bills could finally end the rivalry between the SEC and CFTC and provide cryptocurrency companies with a clear legal path forward. Hoskinson said that creating a clear legal framework for the cryptocurrency sector will increase institutional adoption and bring trillions of capital that have been sitting on the sidelines into Bitcoin and altcoins. “I said the Gigachad bull run is coming. We will see 250k Bitcoin and trillions of dollars entering the altcoin space. Genius and Clarity's actions will be the catalyst.” *This is not investment advice.

The leading cryptocurrency has climbed around 6.8%, following a spectacular breakout above the $110,000 resistance mark. This bullishness began on July 10, when BTC surpassed $113,800 — its second all-time high within 24 hours. The surge has been driven by strong institutional appetite, ongoing spot BTC ETF inflows, and general market optimism. Market conditions are set for BTC’s explosive growth Analysts attribute the current price action to a mix of technical and macroeconomic factors. Expectations of future cuts in U.S. Federal Reserve rates have boosted risk appetite. Meanwhile, strong performance in equity markets has spilled over into crypto. Matrixport’s earlier forecast predicted that there could be a rally to $116,000 and beyond in July — already an attainable goal. Their prediction was based on past seasonally robust summer performance typically experienced with BTC. $120K next? Experts anticipate further upside With technical breakouts steepening and the momentum accelerating, the majority of analysts now anticipate that Bitcoin will reach the $120,000 mark by the end of July. If this resistance level is broken, the next likely target area is the range between $130,000 and $140,000.

However, instead of announcements, the President set new rates for different countries while delaying the imposition of tariffs until August 1, the next key date for crypto traders to watch. Japan, South Korea, and several other nations face at least 25% tariffs starting from August; Brazil faces 50% tariffs, among others. The country has warned of reciprocal tariffs, with no further measures for now. The U.S. is imposing 35% tariffs on Canada, starting August 1. Southeast Asian countries face between 30% and 40% tariffs. Stock markets responded positively to the news and the Trump effect pushed Bitcoin to a new peak. Expert commentary Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at Mercuryo, told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “Bitcoin has surged past $118,000 to a new all-time high amid sustained institutional demand for the biggest cryptocurrency, which has been such a driving force in this current market cycle. While altcoins are also in the green with Ethereum spiking past the $3,000 mark, the underlying ‘orange pill’ narrative remains steadfastly in place. Bitcoin’s growing status as a store of value is one that more and more big players and institutions are simply unable to ignore. This is evidenced by sustained inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs this week.” Nick Jones, founder and CEO of Zumo, added: “With Bitcoin setting a fresh record high, the market is booming.

2025-07-11T17:30:39,"Explosive OKX USDT Savings Rate: Unlocking Bull Market Potential","Are you ready for a fascinating dive into the world of cryptocurrency yields? Imagine waking up to find that the interest rate on your stablecoin savings has skyrocketed from a respectable 5% to an astonishing 53%. This isn’t a fantasy; it’s exactly what happened recently with the OKX USDT Simple Earn flexible savings product, sending ripples of excitement and speculation across the crypto community. Such a dramatic surge in the USDT savings rate is more than just an anomaly; many seasoned observers are pointing to it as a powerful indicator, potentially signaling the dawn of a new crypto bull market . What Triggered This Unprecedented OKX USDT Rate Spike? The crypto world thrives on volatility and opportunity, and the recent surge in OKX’s flexible savings product for USDT is a prime example. According to insights shared by Wu Blockchain on X, the interest rate for OKX USDT Simple Earn briefly jumped from its usual 5% to an incredible 53%. This wasn’t a sustained rate, but even a temporary spike of this magnitude demands attention. Wu Blockchain highlighted a crucial historical pattern: sharp increases in OKX’s Simple Earn rates have almost exclusively occurred during periods of intense market activity, typically associated with bull markets. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen such a phenomenon. For instance, on November 10, 2024, the rate soared to 44% when Bitcoin experienced a significant rally, opening at $76,775 and closing at $80,474, as reported by Yahoo Finance data. These instances suggest a strong correlation between high stablecoin yields and burgeoning market confidence. Understanding OKX Simple Earn and Its Mechanics Before we delve deeper into the implications, let’s clarify what Simple Earn is. It’s a product offered by OKX that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings, including stablecoins like USDT. The ‘flexible’ aspect means users can deposit and withdraw their funds at any time, offering liquidity, unlike fixed-term products. The interest rates are dynamic, fluctuating based on market demand for borrowing the underlying assets. So, why would the demand for borrowing USDT suddenly spike to justify a 53% APY? Several factors could contribute: High Leverage Demand: During a bull run, traders often borrow stablecoins like USDT to open leveraged long positions on volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, anticipating further price increases. This increased borrowing demand drives up interest rates. Arbitrage Opportunities: Significant price discrepancies across different exchanges can lead to a surge in demand for stablecoins for arbitrage strategies, where traders profit from these price differences. Liquidity Needs: Exchanges might face temporary liquidity crunches for USDT due to massive trading volumes or large withdrawals, leading them to offer higher rates to attract deposits. Derivatives Market Activity: A booming derivatives market, especially perpetual futures, can create a strong demand for stablecoin collateral, pushing up borrowing costs. Is This the Definitive Crypto Bull Market Signal We’ve Been Waiting For? The connection between surging USDT savings rate s and a crypto bull market is more than just anecdotal. It’s rooted in the fundamental economics of supply and demand within the crypto ecosystem. When confidence is high and asset prices are climbing, the appetite for risk increases. Traders want to maximize their exposure, and borrowing stablecoins to do so becomes a common strategy, even at elevated interest rates. Let’s consider the historical context: Date of Rate Spike OKX USDT Rate Bitcoin Price Action (Approx.) Market Sentiment Recent Spike 53% (briefly) Strong upward momentum Highly optimistic, ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) Nov 10, 2024 44% Opened $76,775, Closed $80,474 Building bullish sentiment Previous Bull Cycles Elevated rates (variable) Consistent rallies Widespread euphoria The direct correlation between these rate spikes and significant movements in Bitcoin price surge data, particularly its upward trajectory, strengthens the argument. It suggests that institutional and retail investors alike are actively seeking capital to participate in the rally, driving up the cost of borrowing stablecoins. While one indicator is rarely enough to confirm a bull market, this OKX USDT rate surge, coupled with the observed Bitcoin price surge , paints a compelling picture. It aligns with other common bull market signals such as: Increased trading volumes across major exchanges. Positive funding rates in perpetual futures markets. Mainstream media attention on crypto. Growing institutional investment. How Can Investors Leverage High USDT Savings Rates? For investors holding stablecoins, a soaring USDT savings rate presents an incredible opportunity for passive income. Even if the 53% rate was brief, the fact that rates can reach such levels, even temporarily, means that keeping an eye on these flexible earn products can be highly rewarding. It allows you to earn substantial returns on assets that are typically used to preserve capital and hedge against volatility. However, it’s crucial to approach these opportunities with a clear understanding of the benefits and potential challenges: Benefits: High Passive Income: Earning double-digit, or even triple-digit, APYs on a stablecoin is exceptionally rare in traditional finance. Capital Preservation: USDT is pegged to the US dollar, offering a degree of stability compared to volatile cryptocurrencies, making it an attractive option for parking funds while still earning yield. Flexibility: Products like OKX Simple Earn allow for easy deposit and withdrawal, giving users control over their funds. Challenges and Risks: Rate Volatility: Flexible rates can drop as quickly as they rise. The 53% was temporary, and rates can revert to lower levels. Platform Risk: While OKX is a major exchange, all centralized platforms carry some level of counterparty risk, including potential hacks or operational issues. Stablecoin De-peg Risk: Though rare for major stablecoins like USDT, there’s always a minimal risk of the stablecoin losing its peg to the underlying fiat currency. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto lending and yield products is still evolving, which could impact offerings in the future. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Given the signals and opportunities, how can you position yourself effectively? Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Yield Products Actively: Keep a close watch on flexible earn products on major exchanges like OKX. Set up alerts for significant rate changes. Diversify Your Stablecoin Holdings: Don’t put all your stablecoin eggs in one basket. Consider holding a mix of USDT, USDC, and other reputable stablecoins across different platforms. Understand the Product: Before participating, fully understand the terms and conditions of any yield product. Is it flexible or fixed? What are the withdrawal fees or lock-up periods? Assess Risk Tolerance: High yields often come with higher risk. Only allocate funds you are comfortable with, especially in a volatile market. Stay Informed: Follow reliable crypto news sources, analysts, and on-chain data to gauge overall market sentiment and potential shifts towards a crypto bull market . The dramatic spike in OKX USDT rates is a compelling event that adds another layer to the ongoing discussion about the next major bull run. While not a standalone confirmation, it certainly aligns with the kind of market behavior typically observed when momentum is building. For those looking to capitalize, understanding the mechanics of these high yields and managing associated risks will be key to navigating what could be an exciting period for the crypto market. The confluence of a surging USDT savings rate and a strong Bitcoin price surge offers a tantalizing glimpse into the potential for significant gains. As the market continues to evolve, staying vigilant and informed will empower you to make strategic decisions and potentially unlock substantial opportunities within the burgeoning digital asset space.

According to insights from TradingShot , this latest surge resembles previous upward trends recorded at the end of 2023. In those earlier instances, Bitcoin underwent a sharp correction of approximately 32% over 112 days before rebounding strongly by around 91.12%. Notably, this upward momentum has typically been supported by the one-week 50-period moving average ( MA ), as pointed out in a TradingView post on July 11. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The current rally, which began on April 7, 2025, appears to be following a similar path. If things unfold as they did before, the analyst noted that the market could see Bitcoin climb to just above $140,000. TradingShot also identified that a breakthrough from a bull flag pattern, formed between mid-May and June, has sparked this new surge. To this end, the outlook suggested that the maiden cryptocurrency might hit $140,000 as early as August 2025. Bitcoin’s short-term target Another analyst, Ted Pillows, shared a similar optimistic view. In an X post on July 10, he mentioned that Bitcoin could very well reach $120,000 in the short term. He connected this growth to patterns known as Wyckoff Accumulation, noting that the increase in the global M2 money supply is a key factor driving this rally. Pillows explained how Bitcoin’s movements align with the stages of Wyckoff’s model: it goes through an accumulation phase, then a spring, followed by a successful test, and finally a sign of strength that leads to the breakout. $BTC hit a new ATH today.

2025-07-11T17:20:39,"Bitcoin’s Alarming Shift: Retail Holdings Plummet on Centralized Exchanges","The world of Bitcoin is always in motion, and recent data points to a significant, perhaps alarming, shift in who holds the digital gold. Are you a retail investor in Bitcoin? Then you’ll want to pay close attention to this evolving narrative. On-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X has highlighted a compelling trend: the share of retail BTC holdings is steadily decreasing. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a profound change that could redefine the market’s dynamics and investor strategies. Are Retail BTC Holdings Really Shrinking? Unveiling a Crucial Market Shift The numbers speak volumes. According to the analysis, the total Bitcoin balance across centralized exchanges (CEXs) has plummeted to approximately 2.4 million BTC. This represents a substantial decline of more than 360,000 BTC since the start of the current year, a reduction estimated to be worth around $42.8 billion at recent market prices. This significant outflow from CEXs, particularly concerning the retail segment, suggests a deeper transformation in how Bitcoin is being held and utilized. For years, centralized exchanges have been the primary gateway for millions of retail investors to buy, sell, and trade Bitcoin. They offered convenience, liquidity, and a relatively straightforward user experience. However, this recent data indicates that a considerable portion of retail BTC holdings is moving off these platforms. This shift isn’t uniform across the board, but the overall trend is clear: the collective Bitcoin stash of smaller, individual investors on exchanges is diminishing. What does this mean for the everyday investor? It signals a maturing market where custody preferences are evolving, and perhaps, where the lines between retail and institutional participation are blurring. The implications for market liquidity, price discovery, and even regulatory oversight are profound. Understanding the Bitcoin Decline on Centralized Exchanges: What’s Driving It? The observed Bitcoin decline on centralized exchanges isn’t a singular phenomenon; it’s likely a confluence of several powerful trends reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the bigger picture: Shift to Self-Custody: A growing number of Bitcoin holders are embracing the mantra of ‘not your keys, not your coin.’ Concerns over exchange security breaches, regulatory uncertainties, and the desire for true ownership are prompting many to move their BTC into hardware wallets or other self-custody solutions. This empowers individuals with complete control over their assets, reducing reliance on third-party custodians. Institutional Accumulation: As Bitcoin gains legitimacy, institutional players like asset managers, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are entering the market. These large entities often acquire Bitcoin through over-the-counter (OTC) desks or dedicated institutional platforms, bypassing retail-focused centralized exchanges entirely. Their accumulation doesn’t show up in CEX retail balances, yet it absorbs significant supply. Regulatory Scrutiny and Compliance: Increased regulatory pressure on centralized exchanges, including stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, might deter some users who prefer more privacy or find the verification processes cumbersome. This could push certain retail participants to alternative, less regulated avenues or simply off-exchange. Emergence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and DEXs: While not a direct cause of CEX outflows, the rise of decentralized finance protocols and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) offers alternative avenues for trading, lending, and earning yield on Bitcoin (often wrapped Bitcoin, or WBTC). This provides options beyond traditional centralized platforms, potentially diverting activity. Maturity of the Asset: Bitcoin is increasingly seen less as a purely speculative asset for quick gains and more as a long-term store of value or a hedge against inflation. Investors with a long-term conviction are more likely to move their holdings off trading platforms and into secure cold storage, reducing the liquid supply on exchanges. This multi-faceted Bitcoin decline on CEXs reflects a maturing ecosystem where various forces are at play, each contributing to the evolving distribution of Bitcoin ownership. The Evolving Role of Centralized Exchanges in a Maturing Market For a long time, centralized exchanges were synonymous with cryptocurrency trading. They served as the primary on-ramps and off-ramps for fiat currency, providing liquidity and a user-friendly interface for new entrants. However, the market has evolved significantly, and with it, the role of these exchanges is undergoing a profound transformation. In the early days, CEXs were often the only practical way for individuals to access Bitcoin. They facilitated price discovery and provided the necessary infrastructure for a nascent market. Today, while still critical, they face new challenges and opportunities. Security breaches, though less frequent now, have historically eroded trust. Regulatory frameworks are tightening globally, imposing new compliance burdens and sometimes limiting services in certain regions. Furthermore, the growth of self-custody solutions, institutional trading desks, and decentralized alternatives means that CEXs are no longer the sole arbiters of crypto activity. They must innovate to remain competitive and relevant. This often involves offering a wider range of services beyond simple spot trading, such as staking, lending, derivatives, and specialized yield products. The future of centralized exchanges hinges on their ability to adapt to a more sophisticated user base and a highly dynamic regulatory and technological environment. What Does a Lower BTC Balance on CEXs Signify for Bitcoin’s Future? A shrinking BTC balance on centralized exchanges is more than just a data point; it’s a significant indicator with several interpretations for Bitcoin’s future trajectory. It suggests a fundamental shift in market structure and investor behavior: Reduced Retail Speculation: Fewer Bitcoins held on exchanges could imply a decrease in the immediate availability for speculative day trading by retail investors. This doesn’t mean retail interest is waning entirely, but rather that their approach to holding Bitcoin might be shifting from short-term trading to long-term investment. Increased Long-Term Conviction: When investors move their Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage, it typically signifies a strong long-term conviction. They are not planning to sell in the near future and are prioritizing security and self-sovereignty. This ‘hodling’ mentality can contribute to a more stable market base. Institutionalization: The decline in CEX balances often correlates with an increase in institutional activity. As large funds and corporations accumulate Bitcoin, they tend to do so through private deals or specialized custodians, keeping their holdings off the public order books of retail exchanges. This further cements Bitcoin’s status as an institutional-grade asset. Potential for Supply Shock: A lower liquid supply of Bitcoin on exchanges can amplify price movements. If demand surges while available supply for immediate trading is limited, it could lead to more volatile price swings, potentially to the upside. This concept is often referred to as a ‘supply shock.’ Ultimately, a decreasing BTC balance on centralized exchanges points towards a maturing asset class. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond its early, highly speculative phase and is being increasingly held for its fundamental value and long-term potential, rather than purely for short-term trading opportunities. OKX’s Strategic Play: A Glimmer of Hope Amidst the Outflows? Amidst the general trend of outflows from centralized exchanges, OKX stands out as an interesting exception. In the past 24 hours (at the time of the analyst’s report), it was the only exchange among the top five by BTC holdings to record a net inflow. This counter-trend movement is likely linked to the introduction of OKX’s BTC Yield+ product, a strategic offering designed to attract and retain Bitcoin holders. The BTC Yield+ product aims to address several key concerns for investors: Capital Preservation: The product is designed with mechanisms to preserve the principal investment, a crucial factor for risk-averse investors. Interest Returns: It offers interest returns on deposited Bitcoin, providing a passive income stream for holders who might otherwise simply hold their BTC idly in a wallet. Flexible Deposits and Withdrawals: The flexibility to deposit and withdraw funds as needed makes it attractive to those who want to earn yield without locking up their assets for extended periods. OKX ‘s success with this product highlights a potential pathway for centralized exchanges to adapt to the evolving market. By offering innovative, yield-generating products that cater to the desire for passive income while mitigating perceived risks, exchanges can still attract significant capital. This demonstrates that while some investors are moving to self-custody, others are willing to keep their Bitcoin on exchanges if compelling, secure, and flexible earning opportunities are available. This strategic move by OKX could set a precedent for how other exchanges approach user retention and asset management in a competitive and maturing market. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor The shifting landscape of Bitcoin holdings presents both challenges and opportunities for retail investors. To navigate this evolving market effectively, consider these actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Custody Strategy: Understand the pros and cons of self-custody versus using centralized exchanges. For long-term holdings, a hardware wallet offers superior security. For active trading or yield-earning opportunities, CEXs might still be suitable, but choose reputable platforms with strong security track records. Diversify Your Investment Approach: Beyond simply buying and holding spot Bitcoin, explore various strategies. This could include participating in yield-generating products like OKX’s BTC Yield+, exploring DeFi protocols (with thorough due diligence), or even considering Bitcoin-backed loans if it aligns with your financial goals. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is constantly changing. Keep abreast of new laws and guidelines in your jurisdiction, as they can impact how you can hold, trade, and use your Bitcoin. Perform Due Diligence on Yield Products: While attractive, yield products come with their own set of risks, including smart contract risk, counterparty risk, and impermanent loss in some DeFi scenarios. Always research the product, the platform, and the underlying mechanisms before committing your funds. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: The trend of Bitcoin moving off exchanges into cold storage suggests a market that is increasingly focused on long-term value rather than short-term speculation. Aligning your strategy with this long-term view can help you weather market volatility and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value. By understanding these market shifts and adapting your strategies accordingly, you can position yourself to thrive in Bitcoin’s dynamic ecosystem. Conclusion: Navigating Bitcoin’s Evolving Landscape The analysis revealing a significant decline in retail BTC holdings on centralized exchanges underscores a critical phase in Bitcoin’s journey. It’s a clear signal that the market is maturing, with investors increasingly opting for self-custody or seeking out innovative products that offer yield without compromising on capital preservation. This shift away from traditional exchange-based holding by retail participants, coupled with growing institutional interest, paints a picture of a Bitcoin ecosystem that is becoming more sophisticated and diversified. While this trend presents challenges for centralized exchanges, it also spurs innovation, as exemplified by OKX’s successful BTC Yield+ product. For investors, understanding these evolving dynamics is not just academic; it’s essential for making informed decisions about how to secure, manage, and grow their Bitcoin investments in a landscape that is constantly redefining itself. The future of Bitcoin continues to unfold, marked by a fascinating interplay of decentralization, institutional adoption, and strategic product development.

NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE today announced the closing of a $8 million Series A funding round led by Fulgur Ventures. The capital will fast-track the expansion of a Bitcoin-native financial infrastructure that merges regulated issuance with seamless trading for retail and institutional clients worldwide. Early access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here . NEXBRIDGE will use the proceeds to launch new digital assets and pursue additional listings across licensed exchanges. NEXPLACE will accelerate development and go-to-market execution ahead of its H2 2025 launch, while advancing further licensing efforts in key jurisdictions. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE currently operate as separate entities, but share the same shareholder group and strategic roadmap— with plans to consolidate under a single holding once the necessary corporate and jurisdictional steps are completed. “Our vision for BitcoinFi is simple: bring the safeguards of traditional capital markets onto Bitcoin rails and make digital assets accessible with 24/7 efficiency— through compliant, global infrastructure,” said Michele Crivelli, Founder & CEO of both companies. Today we focus on secure access to familiar exposures like bonds or equities—made available through NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, with our own platform built to evolve and unlock advanced features over time. Tomorrow, we’ll enable businesses to raise capital on-chain through native, regulated digital instruments designed to move funds directly to the issuer, without traditional intermediaries.” A new on-chain market architecture NEXBRIDGE issues regulated digital assets backed by real underlying value, offering both familiar exposures and new formats for accessing them. In November 2024, NEXBRIDGE launched USTBL—the first public, regulated digital asset backed by U.S. Treasury Bills and issued on Bitcoin infrastructure via the Liquid Network. Initially listed on Bitfinex Securities, USTBL is now preparing to expand across additional licensed exchanges. Following this, El Salvador’s digital‑asset regulator (CNAD) approved a broader range of products—spanning from single-stock exposures to multi-asset strategies—set to launch on NEXPLACE and other licensed venues, including through NEXBRIDGE’s own OTC desk. NEXPLACE, licensed as a Digital Asset Service Provider, offers a unified venue for trading a wide range of digital assets—from native cryptocurrencies and utility tokens to asset-linked instruments. Advanced features—such as using eligible tokenized assets as collateral for derivatives—will be gradually rolled out following launch. Unlike models where tokenized assets are mere digital wrappers of off-chain products, NEXBRIDGE issues digital assets that are regulated at the token level. Each issuance is formally approved by CNAD, receives a unique instrument identifier, and includes public disclosures such as proof-of-reserve attestations and a dedicated termsheet detailing key information. In this model, transparency and regulatory oversight apply directly to the digital asset users hold and trade—not just to the structure behind it. While initial distribution will occur primarily via NEXPLACE, the infrastructure is designed for openness. NEXBRIDGE’s regulatory architecture allows its assets to be listed on other licensed trading venues—ensuring portability. This dual model bridges two worlds: providing secure, regulated access to digital markets for global users—especially those in fast-growing emerging economies—while giving institutions a simplified interface to manage both crypto and asset-linked positions with full transparency. “This raise helps us unlock a new generation of asset-linked digital products—especially for users in markets where access to dollar-based exposure has been limited,” Crivelli added. “Each token we issue is directly regulated, with its own public termsheet, governance, and oversight—rather than being a passive mirror of an off-chain asset. That’s a structural shift - and a foundation we can build on.” Strategic alignment and investor support Fulgur Ventures, the lead investor, supports Bitcoin‑native infrastructure with real‑world applications. “Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a unique, scarce digital asset—now increasingly relevant to institutional finance,” said Oleg Mikhalsky, Partner at Fulgur Ventures. “Traditional financial institutions are beginning to recognize Bitcoin not only as a store of value but also as a settlement layer for both monetary transactions and tokenized instruments. NEXBRIDGE and NEXPLACE demonstrate a meaningful, real-world use case enabled by the Liquid Network that reinforces Bitcoin’s role in capital markets—a development Fulgur is proud to support.” Blockstream — the Bitcoin infrastructure firm behind the Liquid Network layer-2 that powers asset issuance and settlement — emphasized the partnership’s strategic potential. “By powering NEXBRIDGE’s digital asset issuance and NEXPLACE’s trading platform with the Liquid Network, we’re helping shape a new generation of capital markets—anchored to Bitcoin’s security, built for global scale, said Adam Back, Co‑founder & CEO of Blockstream. Early access to NEXPLACE is now available — users can join the waitlist here . About NEXBRIDGE NEXBRIDGE Digital Financial Solutions is a regulated issuer headquartered in El Salvador. It creates and offers asset-linked digital assets under the country’s Digital Asset Issuance Law, with settlement secured through the Bitcoin-based Liquid Network.

2025-07-11T17:04:02,"What Has Blockchair Highlighted About Bitcoin’s Security Budget?","Blockchain explorer and analytics firm Blockchair recently launched Budget.Day, a website designed to raise awareness and foster discussion about Bitcoin’s declining security budget, an issue that could threaten the network’s long-term viability. The platform presents simplified, live visualisations to help users understand how Bitcoin’s security is funded through a combination of block subsidies and transaction fees. With the block subsidy halving every four years and the fee market still underdeveloped, Budget.Day highlights the growing risk of insufficient miner incentives, which could expose the network to potential 51% attacks. The site also explores potential responses, from scaling solutions to controversial proposals such as modifying the 21 million BTC supply cap. By addressing widespread misconceptions, such as relying on hashrate growth or optimistic price projections, Blockchair aims to promote a more informed, solutions-oriented debate about Bitcoin’s future security. How Does Bitcoin’s Security Model Actually Work? Bitcoin’s security model is grounded in a decentralised Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, where miners expend computational energy to validate transactions and secure the network. This model relies on economic incentives to align the interests of participants and deter malicious behaviour. Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles, and the first to find a valid solution earns the right to add a new block to the blockchain. This process requires significant energy expenditure and hardware investment, making attacks such as double-spending or chain reorganisations economically unfeasible unless the attacker controls a majority of the network’s total hash rate. The difficulty adjustment algorithm ensures that blocks are produced roughly every 10 minutes regardless of changes in network hash power, maintaining predictable issuance and a steady cadence of transaction processing. The “security budget” refers to the total amount of value paid to miners to incentivise this ongoing work, comprising two key components: the block subsidy and transaction fees. The block subsidy is the new bitcoin minted in each block, which started at 50 BTC and halves approximately every four years (currently at 3.125 BTC per block as of the 2024 halving ). Transaction fees are paid by users to have their transactions included in blocks, and they become increasingly important over time as the subsidy diminishes. Together, these rewards must remain economically attractive enough to sustain miner participation. If the security budget falls below what miners require to cover their operational costs, some may drop off the network, reducing hash rate and making the system more vulnerable to attacks. Bitcoin’s long-term security model anticipates the eventual phasing out of the block subsidy, which will approach zero around the year 2140. As a result, the network will eventually rely entirely on transaction fees to maintain its security budget. This shift places significant importance on continued high demand for block space and a healthy fee market. If transaction volumes and fees are too low in the subsidy-free future, Bitcoin could struggle to sustain sufficient hash power, unless alternative mechanisms (like optional sidechains or off-chain solutions such as the Lightning Network) generate enough economic activity to sustain base-layer fees. Critics have questioned whether fees alone will be sufficient to maintain robust security, while proponents argue that scarcity, increased adoption, and economic utility will naturally support a viable fee market. A key feature of this model is its game-theoretic resilience, where miners are economically incentivised to act honestly because attacking the network would not only be costly, but would also undermine confidence in the system, and by extension, the value of the attacker’s own bitcoin holdings and mining infrastructure. Additionally, Bitcoin’s fixed supply schedule means that the issuance component of the security budget is decreasing over time, so the long-term viability of the network depends on demand-driven transaction fees and ongoing technological adaptation. Thus, Bitcoin’s security model is not static, but a dynamic equilibrium between economic incentives, user behaviour, and technological innovation, all of which must continue to evolve in tandem to preserve the network’s integrity. What is Budget.Day and Why Does it Claim Bitcoin’s Security Model is Potentially at Risk? Blockchair’s newly launched website, Budget.Day , serves as an educational resource and warning signal concerning Bitcoin’s declining security budget or block subsidy which gets reduced by 50% every 210,000 blocks when the Halving occurs, and could become a structural issue with long-term implications for the network’s resilience. The site offers a plain-language breakdown of how Bitcoin’s PoW model depends on miner compensation through block subsidies and transaction fees, and what happens when that financial incentive weakens. With block rewards halving every four years and transaction fees failing to bridge the gap, Budget.Day argues that Bitcoin could eventually face a situation where its economic defences no longer deter attacks like double-spending, transaction censorship, or network stalling. The concern is not theoretical; it’s grounded in measurable trends and declining miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s overall value. At the heart of the site’s argument is the diminishing block subsidy, which has now fallen to 3.125 BTC per block and will ultimately reach zero around the year 2140. In theory, this declining subsidy should be offset by a robust fee market, but the data suggests that has not occurred. As of early 2025, transaction fees contribute just a fraction of the total miner revenue, and fee levels remain low due to limited block space and users’ willingness to seek cheaper alternatives on other chains. Budget.Day warns that if revenue from fees and BTC price appreciation do not outpace the subsidy’s decline, fewer miners may find it worthwhile to secure the network. This would reduce hash power, lowering the cost threshold for a successful 51% attack and weakening the deterrent that underpins Bitcoin’s trustless design. Budget.Day outlines several potential paths forward, ranging from technical scaling to more radical protocol changes. The first option, on-chain scaling, includes increasing block size, reducing block time, or incorporating optional block extensions. These changes could allow more transactions per block, enabling lower individual fees while maintaining adequate aggregate miner compensation. More controversial proposals involve shifting Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism to alternatives like proof-of-stake or implementing ongoing inflation through mechanisms like tail emission or demurrage . However, these approaches raise philosophical and practical concerns, including violations of Bitcoin’s fixed-supply principle and increased centralisation risks. The site presents these not as endorsements, but as trade-offs that must be critically assessed. A key part of Budget.Day’s effort is to challenge widely held assumptions about Bitcoin’s future security. The site cautions that rising hashrate alone does not guarantee security, particularly if it results from cheaper energy or hardware. It also rebuts the idea that future Bitcoin price increases will automatically resolve the issue, noting that miners are paid in BTC and potential attackers can bribe in BTC, making fiat-denominated projections irrelevant to network safety. The conclusion is direct but measured: without meaningful adaptation or reform, Bitcoin’s current incentive model may not be sufficient to secure the chain in the long term. The site does not claim to offer final answers but rather seeks to elevate a technical and economic issue that has remained under-discussed despite its foundational importance. Is Blockchair Concern Trolling or is This a Conversation Worth Having? The team behind Budget.Day deserves recognition for opening a conversation that many in the Bitcoin community have long preferred to sidestep. Addressing the long-term viability of Bitcoin’s security budget is not an easy task, especially when it challenges prevailing narratives of self-sufficiency and inevitable success. Rather than promoting complacency, the project highlights real risks associated with declining miner incentives and the assumption that rising prices or speculative demand will naturally solve every structural issue. By presenting the data in a clear, accessible way, Budget.Day invites the community to engage with these concerns honestly, something that requires both technical insight and a willingness to question orthodoxy. When Bitcoin was introduced, it was envisioned as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, enabling high volumes of everyday transactions with minimal fees. Early usage reflected that aim, with microtransactions and direct payments playing a central role. Over time, however, the narrative shifted. Faced with scalability limitations and fierce internal debates over block size, Bitcoin’s dominant use case evolved into that of “digital gold”, a scarce, deflationary asset meant to be stored rather than spent. This transformation has brought certain advantages, such as broader institutional acceptance and a strengthened store-of-value appeal, but it has also created an unintended side effect: the diminishing use of Bitcoin for routine payments has undermined the development of a sustainable fee market that can eventually replace the block subsidy. This dynamic poses a structural challenge for the long-term integrity of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system. The reliance on rising transaction fees to compensate for falling subsidies assumes ongoing, high-volume usage of the base layer. Yet if most holders are investors who rarely move their coins, and if users seeking low fees migrate to second-layer solutions or alternative blockchains, the on-chain activity needed to support miner incentives may never materialise. Unorthodox tokenisation protocols like Ordinals and Runes sparked significant controversy within the Bitcoin community due to their impact on network fees and perceived divergence from Bitcoin’s original purpose. These protocols enabled the inscription and minting of digital assets directly on the Bitcoin blockchain, often leading to sharp spikes in transaction fees during periods of high activity. For many everyday users, this rendered Bitcoin temporarily unusable, with basic transactions becoming prohibitively expensive. Critics, particularly long-time Bitcoiners, dismissed these tokens that cluttered the network and exploited block space for speculative purposes. However, from the perspective of miners operating on razor-thin margins in an increasingly competitive landscape, these fee spikes provided a much-needed boost to revenue, so much so that some miners began offering private mempools and Out-of-Band Relay Channels like Marathon’s Slipstream , directly to tokenisation projects. With block subsidies declining over time, the additional income generated by Ordinals- and Runes-driven demand offered a temporary economic reprieve, highlighting the growing tension between Bitcoin’s evolving use cases and its shrinking security budget. Several voices in the Bitcoin development community, including Peter Todd, have voiced concern over this issue. Todd has openly discussed the possibility that a hard fork introducing modest ongoing inflation , such as tail emission, or mechanisms like demurrage (A form of HODL Tax) might eventually be needed to secure the network as the subsidy approaches zero. Such proposals are understandably controversial, as they challenge one of Bitcoin’s most sacrosanct design principles: the fixed 21 million BTC supply cap. However, raising these options should not be seen as heretical, but as a responsible effort to preserve the system’s long-term viability. Budget.Day does not prescribe a specific solution but should be commended for bringing these perspectives to the surface. Ignoring the potential mismatch between Bitcoin’s current usage patterns and its future security model does the network no favours. By choosing to engage seriously with difficult questions, the leadership behind Budget.Day is helping ensure that Bitcoin’s evolution is guided by informed deliberation rather than blind faith.

2025-07-11T17:03:08,"SUI Price Eyes $3.60 Breakout After 20% Weekly Surge","TL;DR SUI forms a symmetrical triangle, approaches $3.60 resistance, with rising volume and bullish price structure. Fibonacci levels show strength above $3.18, with $2.82 and $2.60 acting as key support zones. SUI rally fueled by tBTC launch and Grayscale report praising the network’s team and architecture. SUI Price Sees Strong Weekly Gains Sui (SUI), the native token of the Sui blockchain, has posted a 20% gain over the past seven days. The price climbed from $2.94 to $3.24 in recent sessions, supported by a $0.34 trading range that showed increasing activity. At the time of writing, SUI was trading at $3.52, with a 24-hour volume of $1.92 billion, and an 8.7% price increase in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the recent rise comes after a series of market and ecosystem developments that have shifted momentum toward the bulls. Trading volumes have increased as the token approached key technical levels that traders are closely monitoring. Technical analysis shows SUI consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern is commonly seen during periods of market indecision, where both buyers and sellers narrow the price range. According to crypto analyst Ali, a close above $3.60 would confirm a potential breakout from this formation. $SUI is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle. A sustained close above $2.60 could be the breakout signal bulls have been waiting for. pic.twitter.com/KyzWxOOslg — Ali (@ali_charts) July 10, 2025 Notably, the triangle shows consistently higher lows since February 2025, supported by an upward-sloping trendline beginning around $1.92. As price action nears the upper resistance boundary of $3.60, market watchers remain cautious of whether the move will continue or pause within the range. Key Support and Resistance Levels Key Fibonacci retracement levels are currently aligned with major zones of interest. The 0.618 level at $3.59 closely matches the $3.60 resistance area. A move beyond this level may indicate sustained strength. The 0.5 level sits at $3.18, a point SUI has already moved above, reflecting stronger momentum. Support remains at $2.82, the 0.382 Fib level, followed by lower support near $2.60. A move below this level would keep the triangle formation intact and suggest the price could continue to trade sideways in the near term. Catalysts Behind Recent Momentum SUI’s recent rally has followed notable ecosystem developments. The launch of Threshold Network’s tBTC on the Sui blockchain introduced bitcoin liquidity to the network, with a potential of over $500 million in BTC value being added. Additionally, a report by Grayscale highlighted the Sui blockchain’s design and development team. The report pointed to the protocol’s architecture, its origins from former Facebook employees, and a strategy focused on technology and scalability as key strengths.

Prices of most major alts have followed Bitcoin, which hit a new all-time high today of $118,667, and which could set a few new records before the day ends. PEPE has benefitted from this rally along with most major alts, with the meme coin also sitting on a 30% return in a week and a 37.5% increase in a fortnight. And with its trading volume rising by over 10x virtually overnight, more gains could be coming very soon.

If we look at PEPE’s chart right now, we see that it has broken out of the pennant formed from its medium-term highs and lows. Source: TradingView Even more bullishly, the moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has just turned positive, and it could continue rising for a while yet, given previous peaks. We also see that PEPE’s 24-hour trading volume has risen from $600 million only yesterday to $7.6 billion today, marking a massive 1,100% increase. This signals a big influx in demand, and we can also see whales beginning to buy up PEPE in large quantities again, as revealed by on-chain data.

Trading Bot Snorter Raises $1.7 Million in Presale for Native Token: Is This Crypto’s Next Killer App? If PEPE is not that exciting anymore, traders can consider one of many up-and-coming alternatives, with numerous presale tokens looking very exciting right now. For instance, Snorter (SNORT) is an Ethereum and Solana-based project that is in the process of developing an automated sniping bot. It launched the presale for its SNORT token a few weeks ago, and has now raised just over $1.7 million amid growing investor interest. As an automated sniping bot, Snorter will use AI to discover emerging tokens before they go parabolic, helping users to stay ahead of the market. It will provide several other features, including atomic swaps, limit orders, rugpull protection and copy trading, so that users can mirror the strategies of whales. These comprehensive features help to explain why its presale is taking off, and also why the project has grown a substantial community in a short space of time. Users will need to hold SNORT if they want to access the bot’s capabilities, which should mean that the coin attracts plenty of demand. Investors can buy it now by going to the Snorter website and connecting a compatible wallet, such as Best Wallet . The token currently costs $0.0979, but this will continue to rise periodically until the sale ends, so buyers should act quickly.

2025-07-11T17:00:39,"Bhutan’s Bold Bitcoin Move: $50M+ BTC Transferred to Binance, Signaling Strategic Shift","Prepare for a fascinating insight into the world of sovereign crypto! The Royal Government of Bhutan, a nation often associated with Gross National Happiness, has just made a series of significant moves in the Bitcoin market, sending ripples through the digital asset community. According to vigilant on-chain analytics provider Onchain Lens, Bhutan has recently deposited a staggering 100 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at approximately $11.8 million at the time of transfer, directly to the global cryptocurrency giant, Binance Exchange. This single transaction, however, is merely the latest in a series of substantial transfers. Over the past eleven days, the Himalayan kingdom has reportedly moved a grand total of 449.3 BTC, amounting to an impressive $50.15 million, to the very same exchange. These bold Bhutan Bitcoin transactions raise immediate questions: What’s driving these significant transfers? What does it signify for Bhutan’s crypto strategy, and for the broader landscape of government crypto adoption? What’s Behind Bhutan’s Recent Bitcoin Transfers? The news of Bhutan’s multi-million dollar Bhutan Bitcoin deposits to Binance has certainly captured the attention of market watchers. For a nation that has historically maintained a low profile regarding its digital asset holdings, these transparent on-chain movements offer a rare glimpse into its evolving financial strategy. While the exact motivations behind these specific transfers remain officially undisclosed, several compelling theories emerge when considering the nature of such large-scale transactions by a sovereign entity. Liquidity Management: Governments, like large corporations, often manage diverse asset portfolios. Depositing BTC to an exchange could be a strategic move to enhance liquidity, allowing for quicker conversion into fiat currency or other assets as needed. This could be for national projects, debt servicing, or even to capitalize on market highs. Treasury Diversification: Bhutan, through its sovereign wealth arm Druk Holdings and Investments (DHI), has been known to hold Bitcoin. These transfers might be part of a broader treasury management strategy, where digital assets are actively managed alongside traditional investments. Operational Funding: It’s plausible that a portion of these funds is being moved to cover operational costs related to their crypto mining activities or other digital economy initiatives that require fiat conversion. Market Rebalancing: The deposits could signal a rebalancing of their crypto portfolio, perhaps reducing their BTC exposure to diversify into other digital assets or to take profits from previous acquisitions. Understanding these transactions requires looking beyond just the numbers. It speaks volumes about the growing confidence of national entities in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, even if the immediate purpose is to liquidate for fiat. Why Choose Binance for Such Significant Binance Deposit Activity? The choice of Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, for these substantial Binance deposit activities is not coincidental. Binance offers unparalleled liquidity, a critical factor for large-scale transactions that need to be executed without significantly impacting market prices. For a government entity looking to manage tens of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin, liquidity is paramount. Here’s why Binance likely stands out: Deep Liquidity Pools: Binance boasts the deepest order books for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, ensuring that large sell orders can be absorbed with minimal slippage. This is crucial for maintaining the value of large transactions. Global Reach and Accessibility: As a globally recognized platform, Binance provides a robust infrastructure for international transactions, which could be beneficial for a government managing assets across different jurisdictions or seeking to engage with a global market. Range of Services: Beyond simple spot trading, Binance offers a suite of services including derivatives, staking, and lending, which could potentially be utilized for more complex treasury management strategies, though the current on-chain data points primarily to deposits. Security Infrastructure: Despite past challenges, Binance continually invests in its security protocols, offering institutional-grade security measures that are essential for safeguarding sovereign assets. The fact that a sovereign nation like Bhutan is entrusting such a significant amount of its digital assets to a centralized exchange like Binance underscores the platform’s established position and perceived reliability within the institutional crypto landscape. Bhutan’s Quiet Ascent in Government Crypto Engagement Bhutan’s involvement with cryptocurrencies is not new, though it has often been shrouded in a degree of secrecy. Unlike El Salvador, which made Bitcoin legal tender and openly acquired BTC for its national treasury, Bhutan’s approach to government crypto has been more reserved, yet demonstrably active. The kingdom, through Druk Holdings and Investments (DHI), its sovereign wealth fund, has reportedly been engaged in Bitcoin mining since at least 2019, leveraging its abundant hydropower resources for cheap, sustainable energy. This long-standing engagement suggests a sophisticated understanding and strategic long-term view of digital assets. The current deposits to Binance could be a natural progression of this strategy, moving from accumulation (mining) to active management and potentially realization of profits. This positions Bhutan as a quiet pioneer in the realm of sovereign digital asset management, offering a unique model compared to more publicly declared national crypto initiatives. Table: Comparative Approaches to Government Crypto Country/Entity Primary Crypto Strategy Transparency Level Key Takeaway Bhutan (DHI) Mining, Treasury Management, Active Trading (implied) Low (historically), Increasing (on-chain data) Quiet, strategic long-term engagement; leveraging natural resources. El Salvador Legal Tender, National Treasury Accumulation High (public announcements) Bold, public adoption; aims for economic transformation. Various Central Banks CBDC Exploration/Development Varies (public research, pilot programs) Focus on digital fiat, not decentralized crypto; control-oriented. What Do These Deposits Mean for Bhutan’s BTC Treasury ? The substantial transfer of 449.3 BTC, worth over $50 million, represents a significant portion of what is publicly known about Bhutan’s BTC treasury . While the total extent of DHI’s holdings remains private, these movements indicate active management and potentially a strategic decision to either realize profits or reallocate capital. For a nation with a relatively small economy, a $50 million injection, whether for investment or expenditure, is considerable. This activity highlights several key aspects of managing a sovereign Bitcoin treasury: Profit Realization: Given Bitcoin’s significant price appreciation over the years, especially since 2019 when Bhutan reportedly began mining, these transfers could represent a strategic decision to lock in profits, providing a financial boost to national development initiatives. Diversification: The funds might be earmarked for diversification into other traditional or digital assets, reducing exposure to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility while retaining a presence in the digital economy. Funding National Projects: Proceeds from these sales could directly fund infrastructure projects, social programs, or other government expenditures, leveraging digital asset gains for tangible national development. Precedent Setting: Bhutan’s continued, albeit quiet, engagement with a significant BTC treasury sets a precedent for other smaller nations considering digital assets as a viable component of their national reserves or investment portfolios. The transparency offered by on-chain analysis, despite the government’s silence, provides invaluable insight into how nations are beginning to interact with and manage their digital asset holdings. It underscores the dual nature of Bitcoin: a volatile asset, yet one that can be a powerful tool for treasury management and national development when strategically utilized. The Evolving Landscape of Sovereign Crypto Adoption Bhutan’s latest moves are part of a broader, accelerating trend of sovereign crypto engagement globally. While the focus has often been on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) or outright legal tender adoption like in El Salvador, Bhutan represents a third, perhaps more pragmatic, pathway: the strategic accumulation and management of decentralized cryptocurrencies as part of a national investment or treasury strategy. This trend is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Hedging: In an era of increasing inflation and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by some as a hedge against fiat currency devaluation and a store of value. Technological Advancement: Nations are recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets for their economies, from cross-border payments to new industries. Diversification of Reserves: Traditional reserve assets like gold and fiat currencies are being re-evaluated, prompting nations to explore alternative, uncorrelated assets. Leveraging Unique Advantages: Countries with abundant renewable energy, like Bhutan with its hydropower, can leverage these resources for profitable Bitcoin mining operations, turning a natural advantage into a financial one. The quiet yet consistent engagement of nations like Bhutan suggests that beneath the headlines of legal tender and CBDCs, a significant shift is occurring. Governments are not just observing; they are actively participating in the digital asset space, managing portfolios, and potentially using crypto gains to fund national development. This evolution in sovereign crypto strategies marks a pivotal moment, signaling a gradual yet profound integration of digital assets into the global financial fabric. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities for Nations Holding Crypto? While the opportunities are vast, including potential for significant returns and economic diversification, nations holding substantial crypto assets also face unique challenges: Volatility Risk: The price of Bitcoin can fluctuate wildly, impacting the value of a nation’s treasury significantly. Security Concerns: Safeguarding large crypto holdings requires robust cybersecurity infrastructure and expertise to prevent hacks and theft. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential compliance and legal challenges for sovereign entities. Public Perception: Managing public perception and understanding of crypto investments can be challenging, especially in nations with less exposure to digital assets. Despite these challenges, the long-term strategic benefits, particularly for nations looking to innovate and diversify their economies, often outweigh the risks. Bhutan’s actions serve as a testament to this calculated risk-taking. The Future is Digital: What’s Next for Bhutan and Beyond? Bhutan’s consistent engagement with Bitcoin, culminating in these significant transfers to Binance, paints a picture of a forward-thinking nation quietly positioning itself in the digital economy. It’s a powerful reminder that while the crypto market is often dominated by retail investors and large institutions, sovereign entities are increasingly becoming key players, albeit with different objectives and operational scales. We might see more nations discreetly, or even openly, adopting similar strategies: leveraging natural resources for mining, building diversified digital asset treasuries, and utilizing crypto gains for national development. The transparency of the blockchain ensures that even the most discreet moves eventually come to light, providing valuable insights into the evolving relationship between traditional governance and decentralized finance. In conclusion, Bhutan’s recent deposits of over $50 million in Bitcoin to Binance are far more than just financial transactions; they are a powerful statement. They underscore a strategic, long-term commitment to digital assets, positioning Bhutan as a quiet leader in sovereign crypto engagement. This bold move highlights the increasing comfort and sophistication with which nations are navigating the complex yet opportunity-rich world of cryptocurrencies, setting a fascinating precedent for global financial evolution.

2025-07-11T16:55:18,"U.S. Treasury Department Officially Revokes Controversial Crypto Broker Reporting Rule After Republican Lawmakers Vote It Down","The Department of the Treasury is formally taking down a new rule that expanded the definition of a broker under the U.S. Tax Code. The rule titled “Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers that Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales” classified decentralized finance (DeFi) exchanges as brokers required to furnish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with information on user transactions involving digital assets. The rule was published in the Federal Register on December 30th during the final weeks of the Biden administration and took effect on February 28th. In March, legislators from both chambers of Congress voted to repeal the controversial law, a move supported by President Donald Trump, who signed the bill reversing the crypto broker rule on April 11th. The Treasury Department says the controversial rule now has no legal force or effect. “Pursuant to the CRA (Congressional Review Act), any rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or effect by enactment of a joint resolution shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect. Accordingly, the Treasury Department and the IRS are reverting the text of the section 6045 regulations back to the text that was in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the Final Rule.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-11T16:52:30,"BTC Bull Charts Heat Up While BlockDAG Builds With a Massive $336M Presale & 2M+ Mining Army","The markets are running hot, and BTC Bull token’s price just made a statement. With a 75 percent spike and Bitcoin eyeing a new all-time high, the BTC Bull price chart is lighting up across Telegram and TradingView. For some, this might feel like 2021 again. For others, it’s a signal to look harder at what’s rising beneath the surface. While BTC Bull is having a moment, BlockDAG (BDAG) is building a movement. Its presale has already smashed through $336 million, and with over 2 million users already on its X1 mobile mining app, it’s not waiting on hype; it’s creating real traction. And in this market, traction is currency. BTC Bull Makes a Move With Price & Prediction Buzz It’s not every day a new meme token jumps 75 percent. But BTC Bull token’s price is on the move, and traders are watching closely. The BTC Bull price chart shows strong short-term volume, and analysts are now dropping bullish takes around a possible parabolic move. While the market adjusts to Bitcoin’s own push, BTC Bull’s price prediction chatter is picking up speed. Some are calling for 5x moves, others see the pump as a positioning play while Bitcoin retraces. Regardless, the token has broken into the wider conversation, especially as it moves across meme and BTC-maxi communities. But as always in crypto, questions linger. Can BTC Bull maintain this momentum? Or is this a peak-before-plateau scenario? Without a broader ecosystem or roadmap, it’s tough to say what carries this past the hype cycle. Still, for now, eyes are locked on the next leg of the BTC Bull price chart. BlockDAG’s X1 App Hits 2M+ Miners as Presale Crushes $336M While meme tokens are riding waves, BlockDAG is building the beach. Its X1 miner app , which is a tap-to-mine mobile tool that’s already drawn over 2 million users, is turning daily engagement into network power. This isn’t just another crypto app; the X1 miner is built for scale. It lets users mine BDAG directly from their phones with zero hardware, and with over 2 million people already using it, BlockDAG is proving it can onboard at speed while keeping things simple. That traction has helped fuel one of the biggest crypto presales in years. BlockDAG has already raised over $336 million, locking in serious attention from both traders and developers. And with a fixed presale price of $0.0016 until August 11, the entry window is still open. But what’s more important is what’s being built behind the numbers. The app is just one piece of the broader rollout, but it proves a key point. Real utility scales fast when it’s frictionless. BlockDAG isn’t waiting for a CEX listing or influencer pump. It’s onboarding users now, and those users are doing more than speculating; they’re mining, engaging, and positioning for mainnet. In a cycle driven by hype, BlockDAG is executing. The numbers don’t just look good; they represent activity, adoption, and trust in the build. Fast Charts vs Long-Term Play The BTC Bull token price spike is real, and for short-term traders, that’s enough. The BTC Bull price chart shows volume, heat, and shows that meme energy still lives large in the right pockets of the market. But what happens when the candles fade? A BTC Bull price prediction today might say 10x, but tomorrow’s forecast depends on more than momentum. Without a utility layer or community-driven ecosystem, holding power becomes the question. BlockDAG doesn’t live on speculation alone. With over 2 million users on the X1 app and a presale breaking records, its foundation is already working. The engagement isn’t hypothetical; it’s active, measurable, and designed for the long haul. In a side-by-side view, one chart shows hype. The other shows infrastructure. Wrapping Up The BTC Bull token price is flying, no doubt about it. The buzz, the breakout, and the BTC Bull price chart are turning heads. Even the most cautious are paying attention, and the BTC Bull price prediction crowd is louder than ever. But in a cycle where every breakout is followed by a reset, the projects with utility tend to keep moving while others stall. And BlockDAG is proving exactly what that looks like. With 2 million+ users actively mining through X1 and a $336 million presale continuing to climb, it’s not chasing moments, it’s building continuous momentum with no signs of stopping any time soon. Traders might play BTC Bull, but the smart money is watching BlockDAG.

2025-07-11T16:51:25,"Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Prepares to Break Out of Descending Channel Pattern – Is $100 ADA Next?","The Cardano price has rocketed 15% over the past 24 hours, positioning for further gains as Bitcoin reaches $118,000 all-time highs , with the market increasingly focusing on altcoins like ADA that demonstrate strong fundamentals and promising technical indicators. Currently, ADA is trading at $0.7185, marking a 24% increase over the past seven days and solidifying its position as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $25.4 billion. The recent rally was accompanied by over $1.7 billion in ADA trading volume, representing a substantial 50.12% increase in a single trading session. Cardano Technical Analysis: Why Analysts Predict “Made in America” ADA Could Hit $100 With ADA successfully breaking above the upper resistance trendline of a falling wedge pattern, analysts are projecting a reclaim of the $1 psychological level in the short term, alongside a potential new all-time high above $3 in the medium term. Additionally, Cardano’s status as a “Made in America” cryptocurrency, which appeared on President Trump’s strategic reserve list mentioned in March, has led many analysts to project an ambitious $100 target for ADA. LONG: $ADA /USDT (1W) Cardano is experiencing a #bullish trend, surpassing MA200. pic.twitter.com/LWqWLIP0sj — CryptostarExpert (@CryptostarExper) July 11, 2025 This ambitious target could materialize over the next few market cycles if Cardano successfully secures multiple ETF listings and establishes strategic partnerships across education, government, and business enterprise sectors . On the technical front, the ADA/USDT 2-week chart displays a strong bullish bounce from the crucial support region between the 0.618 and 0.786 Fibonacci retracement levels, which previously functioned as a demand zone. Source: TradingView Following a consolidation period and rejection wicks below $0.60, the Cardano price has now surged to $0.7176, gaining over 22% in the latest candle formation. This particularly indicates renewed buying interest among investors. The projected trajectory suggests a potential pullback before continuation, targeting a recovery wave toward key resistance levels at $0.9989, $1.2164, and ultimately $1.3795. The Fibonacci structure adds to this bullish outlook, as price action reclaims levels above the golden ratio (0.618), increasing the probability of continuation if momentum remains sustained. Should bulls successfully defend the $0.65–$0.70 region during any minor retracement, ADA could enter a medium-term uptrend targeting the $1.00 psychological zone and higher levels. And with broader adoption expected to accelerate in the coming years, a long-term move toward $100 ADA is no longer out of the question. While ADA Pumps, Smart Money Find 349% APY in Bitcoin Hyper Presale With the crypto market swinging wildly, many investors are now looking for undervalued altcoins with serious upside potential. One new project catching attention is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) – the main token powering the first-ever Layer 2 chain built for Bitcoin. Put simply, HYPER is designed to make Bitcoin faster and cheaper by using Solana-style technology behind the scenes. Right now, HYPER is still in its presale phase, meaning early buyers can grab tokens at a discount before they officially launch on public exchanges. Source: Bitcoin Hyper Within just one month, Bitcoin Hyper has attracted over $2.37 million in investments. Early buyers are already benefiting from substantial 349% APY staking rewards. Investors can join institutional whales in acquiring Bitcoin Hyper today at the lowest available price of $0.012225. Time is of the essence, as the price tier increases within the next 30 hours.

2025-07-11T16:50:39,"Crypto Funding Surge: Industry Set to Exceed $18 Billion in 2024","The world of digital assets is buzzing with incredible news! We’re witnessing a monumental wave of crypto funding , with the industry rapidly approaching a staggering $18 billion in total investments this year. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a powerful signal of growing confidence and maturity within the blockchain ecosystem. If you’ve been following the market, you know that sustained investment is a key indicator of health and future potential, and these numbers are shouting optimism from the rooftops. What’s Driving This Unprecedented Crypto Funding Boom? Recent reports highlight an astounding pace of investment. Just last week, seven crypto projects collectively secured over $141 million. This impressive figure has pushed the total funding for crypto startups this year to nearly $11 billion, according to DL News, citing data from DefiLlama. What’s truly remarkable is that this sum already surpasses the total funding recorded for all of 2023 by more than $1 billion! This isn’t just about breaking records; it’s about setting new benchmarks for growth. The current trajectory suggests that the industry is well on its way to exceeding PitchBook’s annual funding forecast of $18 billion. This surge isn’t accidental; it’s a culmination of several factors converging to create a fertile ground for investment. Here’s a closer look at what’s fueling this remarkable influx of capital: Market Recovery and Maturation: Following a period of consolidation, the crypto market has shown significant signs of recovery. Key events like the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the Bitcoin halving have injected renewed optimism and legitimacy, drawing in both retail and institutional investors. Clearer Use Cases: Projects are no longer just speculative; they’re solving real-world problems. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to gaming (GameFi), and from supply chain management to digital identity, the practical applications of blockchain technology are becoming increasingly evident. Institutional Confidence: More traditional financial institutions are entering the space, either directly through investments or by offering crypto-related services. This institutional validation brings substantial capital and expertise. Innovation Across Sectors: New sectors within crypto, such as Real World Assets (RWA), DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks), and the convergence of AI with blockchain, are attracting significant attention and capital. The Evolution of Blockchain Investment: Where is the Capital Flowing? The nature of blockchain investment is evolving. It’s no longer just about backing the next big token; it’s about funding foundational infrastructure, innovative applications, and projects that demonstrate long-term viability. A particularly interesting trend noted by DL News is that two of the five largest fundraisers last week are actively adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This move signals a strategic shift, where companies are not just raising capital in fiat or stablecoins, but are also accumulating Bitcoin as a treasury asset, reflecting deep conviction in its future value and role as digital gold. This trend highlights a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a robust and appreciating asset, rather than just a volatile speculative instrument. It also suggests that companies are looking beyond immediate operational needs, adopting a long-term strategy that incorporates digital assets directly into their financial reserves. Key Areas Attracting Significant Blockchain Investment: Investment Area Description & Why It’s Hot DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Still a powerhouse, focusing on scalable, secure, and user-friendly protocols for lending, borrowing, and trading without intermediaries. Attracts capital for its potential to revolutionize traditional finance. Gaming & Metaverse (GameFi) Merging gaming with blockchain to create play-to-earn models and true digital ownership. Investments are pouring into high-quality game development and metaverse infrastructure. Infrastructure & Layer 2 Solutions Projects building the foundational layers, scaling solutions (e.g., rollups), and interoperability protocols that enable the entire ecosystem to function more efficiently and at a larger scale. Essential for widespread adoption. Real World Assets (RWA) Tokenization Bridging traditional assets (like real estate, bonds, commodities) to the blockchain. This unlocks liquidity and efficiency, attracting significant interest from institutional investors. AI + Blockchain Synergy Projects exploring how AI can enhance blockchain (e.g., for security, data analysis) or how blockchain can decentralize AI (e.g., decentralized AI training, data marketplaces). A rapidly emerging and exciting field. Are Web3 Startups Leading the Charge? Absolutely. The term Web3 startups encompasses a vast array of innovative companies pushing the boundaries of decentralized technology. These are the pioneers building the next generation of the internet, characterized by decentralization, user ownership, and token-based economies. The significant capital flowing into these ventures indicates a strong belief in the long-term vision of Web3. From decentralized social media platforms to new forms of digital identity, and from robust data privacy solutions to creator economy tools, Web3 startups are attracting investment because they promise to fundamentally shift power dynamics from centralized entities to individual users. This aligns with a broader societal push for more equitable and transparent digital interactions. Key Characteristics of Funded Web3 Startups: Solving Real Problems: Moving beyond hype, these startups address issues like data privacy, censorship, and lack of ownership. Strong Teams: Investors prioritize teams with proven track records, technical expertise, and a clear vision. Scalability and User Experience: Focus on building products that can handle large user bases and offer intuitive interfaces, crucial for mainstream adoption. Sustainable Tokenomics: Designing token models that align incentives and ensure long-term viability for the project and its community. How Does This Impact Overall Digital Asset Growth? The influx of capital directly correlates with broader digital asset growth . When startups receive significant funding, it fuels innovation, development, and expansion. This leads to: Increased Innovation: More resources mean faster development of new technologies, protocols, and applications. Talent Attraction: Well-funded projects can attract top talent, further accelerating growth and quality within the ecosystem. Infrastructure Development: Capital is deployed to build more robust, secure, and scalable infrastructure, benefiting the entire digital asset landscape. Market Liquidity and Adoption: As more projects launch and gain traction, they contribute to overall market liquidity and drive greater mainstream adoption of digital assets. Enhanced Trust and Legitimacy: Significant venture capital backing signals to the wider market that these projects are serious, well-vetted, and have long-term potential, fostering greater trust. Essentially, this funding surge acts as a powerful accelerator, propelling the entire digital asset ecosystem forward and paving the way for new use cases and greater utility for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. What Role is Venture Capital Crypto Playing in This Evolution? Venture capital crypto firms are the primary drivers behind this funding boom. These specialized VCs understand the unique nuances of the crypto market, possess deep industry connections, and are willing to take calculated risks on nascent technologies. Their strategic investments are not just about providing capital; they often come with mentorship, networking opportunities, and strategic guidance that are invaluable for young startups. The shift in venture capital focus from purely speculative bets to more utility-driven and revenue-generating projects is a clear sign of the industry’s maturation. VCs are now looking for sustainable business models, strong governance, and clear pathways to adoption, rather than just hype. This discerning approach ensures that the capital is directed towards projects with the highest potential for long-term success and impact. Challenges and Considerations Amidst the Boom: While the funding surge is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in various jurisdictions can still pose challenges for global crypto projects. Market Volatility: Despite signs of recovery, the crypto market remains inherently volatile, which can impact investor sentiment. Talent Wars: The demand for skilled blockchain developers and professionals is high, leading to intense competition for talent. Project Dilution: A rapid influx of new projects could lead to dilution of attention and resources, making it harder for truly innovative projects to stand out. However, the sheer volume of investment suggests that the benefits and opportunities far outweigh these risks in the eyes of sophisticated investors. The Future is Bright: What Does This Mean for You? This unprecedented surge in crypto funding paints a remarkably positive picture for the future of the digital asset space. It signifies that smart money is flowing into foundational technologies and innovative applications, paving the way for a more decentralized, efficient, and user-centric digital world. For entrepreneurs, this means more opportunities for groundbreaking projects to secure the capital needed to thrive. For developers, it means a robust job market and exciting challenges. For users, it promises more refined, secure, and impactful blockchain-powered products and services. The industry’s trajectory towards surpassing $18 billion in funding this year is not just a financial milestone; it’s a testament to the enduring power and transformative potential of blockchain technology. It underscores a collective belief that digital assets and decentralized systems are not just a fleeting trend, but a fundamental shift in how we interact with technology, finance, and each other.

Ethereum Foundation’s ETH Sale Sparks Debate, But Focus Stays on Ecosystem Growth The Ethereum Foundation confirmed its latest ETH sale, noting that proceeds from the transaction would be used to support its core operations. These include ongoing protocol research, community grants, and the development of infrastructure critical to the Ethereum ecosystem. The Foundation, which has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, plays a central role in guiding and supporting Ethereum’s development. Its sales of ETH are relatively infrequent and typically aimed at raising funds for continued network improvements. 0/ Earlier this week, the EF finalized the terms of a 10,000 ETH sale at an average price of $2,572.37 via OTC. For this sale, our OTC counterparty was @SharpLinkGaming . — Ethereum Foundation (@ethereumfndn) July 11, 2025 Sharplink’s direct purchase of ETH from the Foundation—rather than through traditional exchanges or OTC desks—represents a rare and strategic move. The transaction indicates the company’s alignment with Ethereum’s long-term goals and its support for the network through staking and restaking commitments. Joseph Lubin, Chairman of Sharplink and also a co-founder of Ethereum and CEO of Consensys, described the decision as more than a financial transaction. “At a time when Ethereum is entering a new era of institutional relevance, we are proud to support the network’s long-term strength and decentralization mission,” Lubin said. “Sharplink is acquiring, staking, and restaking ETH as responsible industry stewards.” According to Lubin, this marks the beginning of a broader model where mission-aligned organizations directly invest in and support the networks they depend on. The move is intended to reduce circulating supply and help reinforce Ethereum’s security and stability. Earlier today, blockchain data revealed that a suspected Ethereum Foundation address, 0xd779, sold 100 ETH via CoW Protocol. The ETH was first moved from a Gnosis Safe and swapped for 336,475 DAI, which was then transferred to a known Foundation address, 0x9eE4.

Despite the criticisms, on-chain data shows the Foundation still holds approximately 269,000 ETH, valued at just over $900 million. The Foundation has maintained transparency around its treasury management. While some interpret these sales as market-negative, the stated purpose remains ecosystem-focused, aimed at sustaining long-term development and community funding. Ethereum Rally Gains Momentum as Institutional Flows and Supply Shock Fuel $10K Price Target Ethereum’s broader market narrative is quickly aligning with a potential surge in ETH price, with analysts and investors pointing toward $10,000 as a realistic target.

The move comes as Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally past $118,000 lifts sentiment across the crypto market.

2025-07-11T16:35:04,"Why Bitcoin is On Fire And Everyone’s Going HYPER About Bitcoin Hyper Token","The Bitcoin price is on fire ($118,000) and Bitcoin Hyper’s (HYPER) Layer 2 solution token is just what the market’s been waiting for to take the Bitcoin ecosystem to the next level. Some say the Bitcoin price breakout has been building for a while, while others think the return of tariff angst is shining a favorable macro light on the top crypto. Others point to the flood of new money coming into crypto from retail, in addition to the demand shock pressure of institutions loading up, as the creation of Bitcoin treasury public companies threatens to hoover up what remains of the limited supply. Whatever the exact cause of the price melt-up, the results are crystallizing a formidable market setup for Bitcoin Hyper token . Bitcoin Hyper has raised nearly $2.4 million and is available to purchase and stake today at the low price of $0.012225. Staking rewards are a super generous 348%. The staking yield is changes dynamically depending on how much deposits there are in the smart contract staking pool, so it pays to move fast. Bitcoin Hyper utilizes a non-custodial bridge, where users deposit Bitcoin on one side. After verifying using zero-knowledge proof cryptography, a wrapped version of BTC is unlocked on the Layer 2 side of the bridge through a minting process. Bitcoin Hyper is an elegant and practical solution to the problem of lack of scalability and the governance quagmire that has prevented Bitcoin from developing its full programmability potential. Bitcoin to $150,000 before the summer ends – HYPER token into hyperspace In the past 24 hours there has been a five-fold increase in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows ($1.175.6 billion) to the second-highest level ever, and open interest in bitcoin options are seeing bets converge on a price target of $150,000 by the end of August.

Glassnode’s accumulation trend score metric signalled that Bitcoin has been in an accumulation regime since the end of April, but has failed to replicate the steep trajectory of the previous two such phases (see chart below). According to Glassnode analysts, the tight trading range of the past couple of months suggested a “moderately strong accumulation regime”, in which market participants saw the price (prior to yesterday’s explosion) as “offering relatively compelling value”.

XRP is now up by an impressive 16% in a week and by 23% in the past fortnight, while its return over the last 12 months has now risen to 480%. These are very bullish percentages, and they come as XRP wallets top 7 million , with XRP Ledger having added 840,000 new addresses in the past six months alone. It’s currently adding somewhere in the region of 7,000 new wallets daily , and given its fundamentals and the direction of the wider market, the medium- and long-term XRP price prediction looks very promising. XRP Price Prediction: 7,000 New Wallets Added Daily as Adoption Explodes – Could XRP Hit $100 Sooner Than Expected? XRP is therefore witnessing a surge in demand and adoption, and if crypto has entered another bull market, then its on-chain metrics are only going to improve over the coming weeks and months.

Larger traders and institutions are clearly buying into XRP in a big way, as we can also see from recent CoinShares Digital Asset Fund Flows reports . And if we look at its chart today, we see that it has decisively begun a breakout, with its indicators all flashing ‘buy.’ Not only has its RSI (yellow) risen above 70, but its moving average convergence divergence (orange, blue) has just turned positive. Source: TradingView What’s particularly bullish about this is that the MACD is still some way from hitting the overbought levels it witnessed in late November and January. As such, there’s plenty of time left before the current rally runs out of steam, with the XRP price potentially rising more or less consistently for the next few weeks. The longer-term picture is even more positive, given that we’re waiting on the approval of numerous XRP ETFs , which could send the altcoin flying. Based on this, the XRP price could hit $3 by the end of July, and potentially end the year at $10, if not higher. TOKEN6900 Presale Passes $300,000 As Hype for Edgy Meme Coin Grows Assuming that a fully fledged bull market is kicking off, now may be a very opportune time to diversify into newer tokens as well, given the positive volatility they can often display. This includes presale tokens, which can sometimes generate enough momentum to produce big rallies when they list for the first time. One example with a good chance of doing this is TOKEN6900 (T6900), an ERC-20 meme coin that opened its presale only a couple of weeks ago. brain made of pop rocks and mint button pic.twitter.com/NPlTUJaiIy — Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 10, 2025 It has already raised more than $330,000, a reassuring sign of how popular it could become once it launches. What’s bullish about TOKEN6900 is that it’s billing itself as a pure, unadulterated meme coin, one without any pretension of ‘fundamentals’ or ‘utility.’ Its website proudly declares that it’s about “Delusion, Irony, And The Collective Hallucination Of Terminally Online Traders,” and that it’s a “Crypto Presale Fantasy.” In other words, it will lean on marketing, hype and FOMO more than any particular use case, with the coin aiming to build an online community of champions and evangelists. Much like the popular SPX6900, it has taken on the trappings and stylings of the infamous dot-com boom, with its website and socials revolving around retro graphics. Its token, T6900, will have a max supply of 930,993,091 tokens, with holders able to stake the coin for a passive income stream. Investors can join its presale by going to the official TOKEN6900 website , where T6900 costs $0.006525.

2025-07-11T16:26:00,"Hyperliquid ($HYPE) Soars 24% to All-Time High Amid Growing Interest for DeFi Derivatives","Hyperliquid ($HYPE) recently rallied to a new all-time high of $46.22 after rising more than 10% in the past 24 hours, although it has slipped back to trade at about $45.59 at press time. Over the last week, bullish momentum lifted the token from a $37.18 trough to its recent peak of $46.22, an impressive 24% rally reflecting growing demand for DeFi derivatives on Hyperliquid’s HyperBFT network. Despite recent profit-taking, volatility remains elevated as traders eye a fresh breakout or a deeper pullback. Source: CoinGecko Hyperliquid runs its own Layer-1, bypassing gas-fee congestion while offering central-exchange speed and on-chain order books. There are 333.92 million $HYPE tokens in circulation with a market cap of about $15.2 billion, fueling deep liquidity and institutional interest. The on-chain platform currently has $463.28 million locked in bridged TVL , underscoring its scale as a decentralized perpetual exchange. In early June, Tony G Co-Investment Holdings deployed $438K into $HYPE , becoming the first public company to add it to its treasury, signaling institutional confidence. Validator staking rules now require 10,000 $HYPE self-delegation, ensuring robust network security and aligned incentives. Hype around an #Altseason has been brewing since late May, when former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes made a bold price prediction for Hyperliquid’s $HYPE token. Hayes backed legendary trader James Wynn’s massive bet on the platform, amplifying the momentum. Legendary!

Bitcoin’s recent climb to become the world’s fifth-largest asset again, surpassing $2.36 trillion in market value as of July, boosts investor appetite for leverage platforms and altcoins. The rising tide has already lifted $HYPE’s 24-hour trading volume by 3.79%, setting the stage for the next breakout. $HYPE/$USDT Soars Above $45 After Parabolic Rally — Price Faces Decision Zone The 4-hour chart for $HYPE/$USDT shows a striking parabolic advance that began after a mid-range consolidation near the $37–$39 zone. $HYPE oscillated in a broad sideways channel for nearly two weeks, coiling beneath key resistance as buyers gradually absorbed supply. This slow accumulation phase created the conditions for the explosive breakout that followed. HYPE/USDT price chart, July 11 (Source: TradingView) The pivot began on July 9, where $HYPE broke above minor resistance at $39.7 with a strong bullish candle. This move was supported by increasing volume, indicating that large players were stepping in. Once $41.50 was cleared, a vertical climb ensued. $HYPE posted a series of large-bodied green candles, each one closing near the high, a clear sign of aggressive buyer control with little resistance overhead. By July 11, the price had jumped to an all-time high of $46.09, representing a nearly 20% move in less than 48 hours. One thing to note is that no significant pullbacks were observed during the rally, reinforcing the urgency behind the buying. Ideally, parabolic run-ups are bullish, but they are often followed by a cooling-off period during which the new supports can be tested. Immediate resistance lies near $46.50–$47.00, with RSI likely entering overbought territory. $HYPE traders will now be watching closely for a potential flag or consolidation range to form, which is a healthy pause that could offer continuation if demand persists. A break above $47 could open the gates toward $50 and beyond, but failure to hold above $44.80 might trigger profit-taking. Short-term support is expected near $42.50 and then $40.

An attacker exploited a vulnerability in the platform’s first version, stealing over $40 million worth of cryptocurrency. However, in a surprising turn of events, the attacker has now started returning the stolen funds . This happened after GMX offered a white-hat bounty worth $5 million and promised no legal consequences. A Costly Breach Hits GMX V1 Earlier this week, the attacker targeted GMX’s original trading system, known as GMX V1, on the Arbitrum blockchain. The hacker took advantage of a weakness in GMX’s OrderBook contract. This allowed the bad actor to change the short trading price of Bitcoin (BTC) and increase the value of the GLP token. The inflated token value was then used to cash out and make a profit. The attack affected several digital coins, including USDC, Frax, Wrapped Bitcoin, and Wrapped Ethereum. In total, the hacker stole over $40 million worth of crypto. As seen in many similar cases , GMX responded quickly to the attack. The team stopped trading and token minting on its V1 system across both the Arbitrum and Avalanche networks. It is important to note that GMX V2 and the platform’s primary token were not affected by the attack. A White-Hat Bounty Turns the Tide To reduce the damage and avoid a prolonged loss, GMX took a bold step. The GMX team sent a message to the attacker using the blockchain. They offered a 10% white-hat reward of $5 million if the stolen funds were returned within 48 hours. The team also promised not to take legal action if the attacker cooperated. Soon after, a reply came through the blockchain, saying the funds would be returned. The attacker kept that promise and sent back two large batches of money. First, $5.5 million worth of Frax was returned, followed by another $5 million. These were sent directly to the GMX deployer wallet. Soon after, the attacker also returned around 9,000 ETH, worth approximately $27 million. This brought the total amount returned close to the full sum stolen. This kind of move by GMX is not unusual in the crypto world and is often used to encourage cooperation after a significant breach. Market Reaction and Project Response After the attack, GMX’s token dropped by over 28%, hitting a low of $10.52. However, once the attacker agreed to return the funds, the price quickly bounced back and went up by more than 13%. The GMX team thanked the attacker on-chain for returning the money and started working to protect the platform going forward. To prevent such hacks from recurring, the team has permanently disabled GLP minting and redemption on Arbitrum. Affected users would be able to close their positions, and leftover funds will be used to compensate those impacted.

2025-07-11T16:09:04,"99Bitcoins Q2 Report Unveils What’s Powering the 2025 Crypto Boom","The crypto market has been on a tear in 2025, and the latest 99Bitcoins Q2 State of Crypto Market Report, authored by Manisha Mishra and sponsored by KCEX, lays it all out. The quarter saw institutional demand surge, Bitcoin ($BTC) hit a then-ATH of $111,980, and crypto hiring spike 753%. Despite the rally, the total market cap was still 12% below its $3.7 trillion peak, hinting at room to run. With stablecoin adoption booming and long-term holders stacking, Q2 may have been the real start of this cycle’s breakout. Read the full report here: State of Crypto Q2 2025 – 99Bitcoins A Record-Breaking Quarter for Bitcoin Bitcoin lit up Q2 with a 25.66% gain, smashing past resistance to hit a then-record $111,980 on May 22. That put it well ahead of gold’s 7.21% rise and most equity indices, marking a sharp reversal from Q1’s pullback. According to 99Bitcoins’ Q2 report, the rally was driven by institutional inflows, ETF demand, and growing sovereign interest, with governments now holding 2.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Meanwhile, spot ETF flows consistently outpaced miner issuance, tightening supply just as demand surged. Chris Wright of 21Shares summed it up: “We believe that Bitcoin ETFs will attract 50% more inflows this year compared to last year. This would result in net inflows of approximately $55 billion in 2025, representing an increase of around $20 billion year-over-year.” A golden cross in late May confirmed the uptrend, following a clean breakout from months of consolidation. It’s a textbook bullish structure. With price action and fundamentals in sync, Q2 marked the clearest shift yet: Bitcoin is back, but powered by institutions, not retail. Institutions Took the Wheel, Retail Turned to Altcoins According to the 99Bitcoins report, this bull run has a different driver behind the wheel. And it’s not Reddit. 9 out of 10 experts interviewed in the Q2 report said retail traders have shifted their focus to the best altcoins, chasing faster gains while institutions quietly accumulated Bitcoin. The on-chain data backs it up. Glassnode shows that 30% of $BTC’s supply is now held by centralized entities, with large players dominating inflows. Meanwhile, Google Trends reveals that retail interest in “Bitcoin” searches stayed surprisingly low throughout Q2, even as $BTC hit new highs. Confidence among long-term holders also climbed. UTXO activity dropped, and the amount of BTC in long-term storage kept rising. A sign that serious capital isn’t looking to sell anytime soon. Stablecoins and DeFi Picked Up Steam If Q2 proved anything, it’s that stablecoins aren’t just stable, they’re also scaling. The Circle IPO popped 168% on day one, marking the first stablecoin issuer to go public and signaling TradFi’s growing appetite for crypto exposure without the volatility. According to 99Bitcoins, 81% of crypto-aware SMBs now want to use stablecoins for daily ops, and the number of Fortune 500s planning to integrate them has tripled since last year. On the DeFi side, Ethereum ($ETH) held L1 dominance, Chainlink ($LINK) led dev activity, and $HYPE – the native token of Hyperliquid – saw serious traction, fueled by the DEX’s rise to 70%+ of all perp DEX volume. While others chased memes, HYPE rallied on actual utility. In short: DeFi’s still cooking, and stablecoins are fueling the fire. Memecoin Mayhem After tanking in Q1, the memecoin market bounced back slightly in Q2, though volatility stayed extreme and price action remained erratic. Q2 saw the meme coins hit new heights, with over 5.9 million new tokens launched and most of them churned out via pump.fun. It was chaotic, noisy, and pure degen energy. While most faded instantly, tokens like $FARTCOIN and $SPX kept riding the wave. That said, the surge in token activity came with a dark side: phishing and wallet-targeted hacks climbed, especially among memecoin holders. Regulatory Wins and Macro Shifts Driving Confidence If Q2 had a theme, it was relief on both the policy and economic fronts. The U.S. pulled back on crypto enforcement, scrapped IRS reporting rules for DeFi, and signaled a more constructive stance overall. Meanwhile, the Fed held rates steady for the fourth straight time, hinting at a possible cut in July. With unemployment flat and growth slowing, capital started flowing into safe-haven assets, and this time, Bitcoin was firmly on that list. The result? Confidence surged. Bitcoin ETF inflows accelerated, volatility dropped, and $BTC’s macro narrative strengthened. It’s no longer just a risk asset; it’s becoming part of the defensive playbook. Elsewhere, $XRP finally closed its long-running legal battle with the SEC, potentially clearing the runway for a new ATH later this year. What’s Next for Q3? Back in Q2, 99Bitcoins forecasted that if BTC could flip $111K–$112K resistance, the path to $120K would open, with $135K as a stretch target. Fast forward to now, and that prediction is aging well: Bitcoin is already trading at above $118K, edging toward that psychological milestone. The report also noted $BTC was holding firm above $103K support, forming a bullish structure backed by rising miner wallet balances, shrinking exchange reserves, and growing illiquid supply – all signs of confidence from long-term holders. Still, Q3 isn’t without risk. ETF inflows could slow, and macro headwinds, from global conflict to sudden rate hikes, remain on the radar. But if institutional flows stay hot and the Fed delivers a rate cut, $135K no longer feels like a moonshot. It’s just part of the next leg up. Final Thoughts: A Bull Market With Depth The 99Bitcoins Q2 report by Manisha Mishra paints a clear picture: this bull market isn’t built on retail hype. Institutions, regulatory tailwinds, and real product traction are powering it. From ETF inflows to stablecoin adoption and supply-side tightening, the signals all point toward a more mature, resilient crypto cycle. And with Bitcoin already pushing towards $120K, many of the Q2 projections are already playing out. If momentum holds, and macro conditions don’t throw a curveball, Q4 could be the real breakout.

2025-07-11T16:00:44,"Bitcoin Dominance Falls: 9 Factors To Watch For That Says The Altcoin Season Has Begun","Bitcoin’s price is holding firm despite growing chatter about the end of its market dominance. However, analysts are turning their attention not to Bitcoin’s price but to its waning market share as signs that altcoins may finally be ready to take center stage in what could become a full-blown altcoin season. A post on X has highlighted a specific breakdown structure in BTC dominance, which is linked to nine factors indicating that the altcoin season has begun. Technical Factors Showing Fall Of Bitcoin Dominance According to the analyst, Bitcoin dominance reached a peak of exactly 66% on June 27, 2025, a date he calls significant for its esoteric code 434 and its occurrence on a new moon. From a technical perspective, the 66% mark coincided precisely with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement level, a region many traders consider a reversal zone. More importantly, several warning signals are flashing for Bitcoin traders. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says The analyst’s post on the social media platform X features a few price charts to emphasize how the Bitcoin dominance might be fading, alongside nine factors. From a purely technical lens, the dominance chart looks increasingly exhausted. The first factor is the most recent highest monthly RSI in the history of the Bitcoin dominance chart. This event has created an overbought condition, and the next outlook is a possible crash of the RSI. The MACD, in fact, has already crossed into bearish territory. Furthermore, the histogram has turned negative, and the faster line has moved below the slower one, which is a classic signal of an impending downtrend. Another interesting factor is that Bitcoin dominance has now broken a key diagonal support line that held firm through much of 2024 and 2025, which is another possible structural breakdown. Fundamental Factors Show Strong Rotation Into Altcoin Pairs While the technical picture is deteriorating, the fundamentals are also stacking in favor of altcoins very quickly. The first fundamental factor is the importance of upcoming altcoin spot ETFs, which have the possibility to redirect institutional flows from Bitcoin into Ethereum, XRP, and others. Related Reading: Time To Forget Altcoin Season? Bitcoin Dominance At This Level Is This Only Hope ETFs such as the Spot XRP, Dogecoin, and Solana ETFs could rapidly increase inflows into the rest of the crypto market, similar to how Spot Bitcoin ETFs caused massive inflows into Bitcoin. The analyst also highlighted the likelihood of upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts, which would tilt market conditions in favor of altcoins over Bitcoin. Momentum has also begun to shift in some trading pairs, particularly XRP/BTC and ETH/BTC, both of which are showing reversal signs from critical levels. The XRP/BTC chart displays repeated failed attempts to break above 0.0000215 BTC, a horizontal resistance that has now been tested five times on the daily candlestick timeframe chart. At the time of writing, the XRP/BTC pair has returned to this level yet again, and based on this pattern, any clean breakout here could confirm a decisive rotation into XRP. Likewise, Ethereum has begun to recover from long-term oversold conditions when measured against Bitcoin. The rounded bottom pattern forming on the ETH/BTC weekly chart shows a reversal from undervaluation, which in past cycles has caused substantial gains for Ethereum relative to BTC.
