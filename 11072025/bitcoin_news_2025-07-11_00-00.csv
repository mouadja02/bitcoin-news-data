2025-07-10T21:55:48,"Bitcoin Price Tops $116,000, Massive Short Squueze Approaches $1 Billion","Bitcoin’s price is expanding to the upside and has charted a new all-time high at around $116,400. With this latest move, BTC is up 4.6% in the past 24 hours and more than 5.5% over the past seven days with a massive $50 billion daily trading volume. Source: TradingView The move comes at the expense of short traders, who lost a combined total of around $940 million in the past day, according to data from Coinglass. This has caused a massive short squeeze, which is a common term used to describe a situation where short traders get liquidated and, as they do, this pushes the price upwards even further. At the time of this writing, the total liquidations are at about $1 billion and 94% of that accounts for sellers, which is pretty indicative of the absolute domination by the buyers. The rest of the market is also charting considerable gains – ETH is approaching $3,000, XRP is trading close to $2.6, while the total cryptocurrency market capitalization is almost $3.7 trillion.

Schiff warned investors who saw this rise as an opportunity, arguing that Bitcoin did not offer a basic business model. “The logic behind Bitcoin or Ethereum treasury companies is to exploit naive investors who are willing to buy shares of companies with no real business model at higher premiums,” Schiff said in his statement. But those who aim to profit from this speculation are likewise “fools themselves,” according to Schiff. Related News: Watch Out: Grayscale Announces the Possible Addition of 29 New Altcoins to its Investment Products - There Are Big Surprises, Here's the List The renowned economist claimed that these levels are the perfect time to sell Bitcoin and buy silver, saying: “With Bitcoin reaching new highs today, it's a great time to sell some and buy silver. Even if Bitcoin continues to rise for a while, silver is likely to rise even higher. Furthermore, while Bitcoin could easily crash, the downside risk in silver is quite limited.” However, despite all his hostility towards BTC, Schiff recently sold an NFT collection of his own on the Bitcoin network. At the time of Schiff's announcement, Bitcoin reached a new record high of $113,833.84, according to CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-10T21:00:58,"Dogecoin Is Coiling For A 500% Move—Analyst Sees $1 Target","Crypto analyst VisionPulsed believes Dogecoin’s months-long torpor is disguising the build-up to what could be the memecoin’s final and most dramatic surge of the cycle. In a livestream dated 9 June, the analyst argued that a constellation of macro and on-chain signals is converging on an upside resolution that could propel DOGE “around 90 cents to a dollar,” a move of roughly 500 percent from its current corridor near 17–20 cents. Dogecoin Blow-Off Top By November? “This will be the largest move, probably 500 to 600 percent, which would put Doge around 90 cents to a dollar,” VisionPulsed told viewers after noting that each bull-market thrust since 2020 has exceeded the magnitude of the one before it. The analyst anchored his conviction in the hash ribbons indicator , an algorithm that compares short- and long-term mining hash rates to identify miner capitulation and subsequent recoveries. Historically, a hash-ribbons buy signal in Bitcoin has coincided with broad-based market advances. This cycle, however, the first buy signal was followed by fresh weakness, a deviation VisionPulsed called “the first time I think it actually got hash ribbons buy signal and it didn’t go up.” While that atypical response sowed doubt about the indicator’s efficacy, the channel now shows a second capitulation phase that is poised to print another buy trigger. VisionPulsed framed the repetition as cumulatively bullish: if the next signal fires, the market will have absorbed two waves of miner stress without surrendering its broader up-trend foundations. Beyond on-chain data, the analyst spotlighted a quartet of macro factors—euro-dollar dynamics, global M2 money supply growth, the distance from Bitcoin’s April halving , and record S&P 500 closes—as forces that “say we should go higher on a macro scale.” Each element, he suggested, keeps liquidity conditions and risk appetite broadly constructive even as individual coins mark time. Yet Dogecoin’s five-day stochastic RSI remains mired in oversold territory. VisionPulsed thinks that paradoxically strengthens, rather than weakens, the case for an explosive move once momentum finally reverses: “It’s very difficult, or almost impossible, for Dogecoin to explode higher” while the oscillator is pinned low, but “when this does finally curl around, you’re probably going to see a larger move to the upside.” For now, Dogecoin has drifted sideways for roughly three months, a pattern the analyst deems “extremely bullish” precisely because it is so uneventful. “If you bought in March, it’s the same price as it was now,” he said, describing the 17–20 cent channel as a pressure cooker. The longer the market remains range-bound, the sharper the eventual breakout is likely to be, he contended, pointing out past instances where identical flat periods preceded 30 percent relief rallies—even if those bursts failed to satisfy long-term holders. Plotting the projected trajectory on his chart, VisionPulsed’s template would deliver the upside resolution sometime between October and December—a window that coincides with the historical peak of Bitcoin’s four-year cycle . “Historically November, December, October has been the top … so that would indicate that if we do get one final move, it will probably be the final move,” he observed. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.18.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coiling-for-500-move-1-target/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price",cryptocompare
2025-07-10T21:00:21,"XRP Flashes Signal That Last Time Preceded A 464% Rally, Analyst Says","In a new video released June 9, crypto analyst CryptoInsightUK issued a extremely bullish XRP update, citing a convergence of technical signals that he believes could set the stage for a powerful upward move. Drawing parallels to previous market cycles, the analyst points to the reappearance of a signal that once preceded a 464% rally in XRP, and says this may mark the beginning of a similar explosive breakout. XRP Breakout Confirmed? Yesterday, XRP recorded its highest 4-hour close since May 23, breaking out of a prolonged range. The token has entered what he called a “dense area of liquidity,” an important technical zone that has historically preceded impulsive price action. In a notable divergence from typical market dynamics, XRP is leading Bitcoin, rather than following it. “XRP is currently leading Bitcoin on this move,” he said. “Something I’ve been calling for a while is for XRP to lead alts and lead a potential alt season.” CryptoInsightUK sees further confirmation in Bitcoin’s setup. BTC is still consolidating but pushing above the $111,000 liquidity zone. A move into that zone, he said, would “give us confluence that the price action XRP’s displaying is not a fakeout.” Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP’s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated Structurally, XRP’s trend remains intact. Despite recent pullbacks, the token has maintained its higher-low formation, a signal of technical strength. More importantly, XRP/BTC is beginning to show momentum reversal. “We’ve just had the highest 4-hour close since the 24th of May. This is showing the momentum to the downside is waning.” He highlights a specific line on the XRP/BTC chart referenced by fellow analyst Credible Crypto as the “Gandalf line”—a level that has acted as a pivot point for years. XRP has now closed above it on the 4-hour chart. “We’ve wicked into it, bounced off it. We lose it, we get pushed down hard. We break it, we normally really go for it.” Zooming out, he points to the weekly RSI (Relative Strength Index) on XRP’s price chart. If the current weekly candle closes above the RSI’s simple moving average, it would be the first time since XRP’s breakout off the lows—an event that previously triggered a 464% move to $2.70. “If we get the bullish cross close… 464% from this [level] would take us to $13.05,” he explained. “I think we’re going to about $12 on this push.” Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 50% “Moonshot” For XRP Price If This Line Breaks Moreover, the analyst anticipates a 325% move in XRP/BTC based on historical ratios and a potential surge in XRP dominance toward 14%, with an even more aggressive Elliott Wave count pointing to a possible move to 20% dominance. “We’ve completed a Wyckoff accumulation. We’re in the sign of strength phase. Last point support… we’re going into phase E,” he said, referencing classical technical accumulation structures. Still, despite the bullish setup, the analyst made clear he plans to de-risk between $8 and $13, emphasizing capital preservation after a potential 20x move from 50 cents. “The risk-to-reward on the downside is just too large at that point,” he noted. “Even if it goes significantly higher… anyone who’s done a 20x on something should be taking some money off the table.” He concluded the analysis with cautious optimism: “Don’t start counting your Lambos yet, but also probably start scrolling the magazine.” For now, all eyes are on XRP’s price action and Bitcoin’s staying power above $111,000. If both confirm, as he put it: “It’s game on.” At press time, XRP traded at $2.44.

2025-07-10T20:53:58,"Bitcoin price prediction July 2025: Will BTC hit new all-time highs this summer?","Bitcoin – the OG of all cryptocurrencies – kicked off the whole crypto revolution and still leads the pack. It sets the pace for the entire market. About a month and a half ago, at the end of May 2025, BTC hit a fresh all-time high, just shy of $112,000. Since then, it hasn’t dipped below the $100K mark. So, what’s next for BTC in July? Is Bitcoin a good investment? Where’s the price headed, what should we expect, and what are the key factors that could drive it up (or down)? Let’s break it all down in our Bitcoin price prediction for July 2025. Table of Contents BTC price factors for July Bitcoin crypto price prediction: general outlook Bitcoin price prediction: July 2025 BTC price factors for July Institutional demand continues to be one of the biggest drivers for Bitcoin ( BTC ) this month. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are seeing massive inflows helping stabilize demand and reduce volatility. The Trump administration is showing strong support for the crypto space, nominating pro-crypto figures to top regulatory roles at the SEC and CFTC. Meanwhile, BTC recently broke through a key resistance at $108,000, opening the door to a move toward the $110K-$115K zone. Strong bids and limit orders around $100K-$103K are providing a solid price floor and adding to market stability. Momentum is also being fueled by fresh corporate interest. Trump Media’s application to list a Truth Social Bitcoin & Ethereum ETF is currently under SEC review. And just announced , France-based Sequans Communications closed a $384 million private placement backed by over 40 institutional investors — with most of the capital going straight into Bitcoin. It’s the most aggressive corporate Bitcoin play since Michael Saylor’s bold move in 2020. His firm now holds 597,325 BTC, worth over $64 billion, with $22 billion in unrealized gains. So, what can we expect from BTC in July? Will Bitcoin go up or down? Bitcoin crypto price prediction: general outlook As of today, July 10, 2025, Bitcoin is trading at around $113K. Over the past 24 hours, it’s up 2.4%, and it’s gained about 3.41% over the last week. BTC 1-day chart, July 2025 | Source: crypto.news But here’s where things get interesting : Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands — which track price volatility — are the tightest they’ve been in over a year. That kind of squeeze usually means a big move is coming. And given the overall bullish momentum in the market, most signs are pointing to an upside breakout. Analysts are watching this setup closely. Similar squeezes in the past (like back in early 2024) led to major rallies — one of them saw BTC jump over 70%. If we see a clean breakout above $110K, it could open the door for a run toward $115K, or even higher. Some more aggressive forecasts are throwing around numbers like $150K-$190K if momentum really kicks in. So while price action’s been calm lately, this could just be the calm before the storm. You might also like: Analysis: Bitcoin’s Bollinger Bands squeeze hints at bullish breakout What does the Bitcoin price prediction for July 2025 look like according to analytical sites? Bitcoin price prediction: July 2025 According to CoinCodex’s Bitcoin coin price prediction, BTC could keep moving up this month, with a potential 7.64% gain that might push it to a new all-time high of $117.3K by August 6. The BTC price prediction for July 8 is also looking pretty bullish — 24 technical indicators are pointing to a possible rebound, while only 4 are flashing warning signs. According to DigitalCoinPrice’s Bitcoin price forecast, BTC might see a 2.52% bump by the end of July, which would put it around $111.76K. Wallet Investor’s BTC projections are also looking upbeat — they think Bitcoin could hit a high of $120.98K by early August. Should you invest in Bitcoin? With everything going on — strong institutional inflows, bullish technicals, and supportive policy moves — expectations for BTC this month are looking pretty solid. It’s holding above $100K, eyeing a breakout, and most forecasts point toward more upside, with targets as high as $117K-$121K by early August. Of course, it’s still crypto — nothing’s guaranteed. But if you’re thinking about getting in or adding to your stack, the outlook for July looks promising. Just stay smart, don’t FOMO, and keep an eye on the charts.

2025-07-10T20:30:33,"CONY: High Yield Has Offset Price Declines But More Downside Possible","Summary I maintain a hold rating on CONY due to Coinbase and Bitcoin trading near all-time highs, increasing risk of a pullback. CONY offers massive distributions (currently ~73% yield), but suffers from significant price decay and capped upside potential. The fund’s synthetic option strategy generates income but exposes investors to greater downside risk and underperforms COIN over time. CONY’s tax-efficient distributions and potential for 'house money' status favor patient, income-focused investors, but long-term growth is limited. Overview I've covered a ton of different YieldMax products over the last few months but YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) is unique to me because it's the first option ETF I've managed to achieve house money status on. When I previously covered CONY, I issued a hold rating because I was becoming cautious on a shift in the momentum of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). However, Bitcoin just recently crossed $112,000 for the first time this week so perhaps my cautionary approach was not well timed. Now that I've held CONY for over a year, I wanted to revisit the ETF to provide some updated insights into its performance, distribution utility, and overall health. Looking at the performance over the last twelve months, we can see that CONY's price has deteriorated by nearly 50%. The fund's poor price resilience is something that I wish could be improved going forward and I hope that management finds a way to soften the downside risk. When including all distributions that were paid out to shareholders, the total return sits around 28.5% over the same period. This positive return can be attributed to the large starting dividend yield of approximately 73% . New distributions are announced every four weeks so the estimated yield can be different by the time you read this article. Data by YCharts Since my last coverage, there have been a lot of positive catalysts for Coinbase ( COIN ). For example, the company was added to the S&P 500 index and experienced several other favorable events that can drive revenues higher. As a result, I believe that CONY will be able to continue efficiently harnessing COIN's volatility and rewarding shareholders with large distributions. As Bitcoin becomes less volatile over time, this may smooth out the price of COIN and CONY as well. However, there are some downsides to CONY that I believe can be improved. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying fund strategy that the ETF implements to generate its distributions. Fund Strategy If you aren't familiar with the fund, CONY operates as a synthetic option ETF that aims to deliver large distributions from the premiums it collects on its underlying option strategy. The fund is capable of harnessing the underlying volatility of Coinbase to execute options. The term 'synthetic' simply means that CONY doesn't actually own any underlying common shares of COIN, so it is writing options against an asset that it doesn't actually own. This can significantly increase the risk profile of CONY because the fund can see much larger price losses compared to what COIN actually experiences. If we look at the holdings below, we can see that CONY doesn't have common shares of COIN listed. Instead, the fund is backed by treasuries and there are several different options listed. Since CONY doesn't actually own any underlying shares, it implements a creative approach to provide investors with a daily price change that mimics the movements of Coinbase. This is achieved by simultaneously purchasing ATM (at-the-money) call options and selling put options to replicate the daily price movement of COIN. In order to generate the option premiums that are used to fuel distributions, CONY sells OTM (out-of-the-money) call options that typically have a strike price somewhere between 0% to 15% above the current market price of COIN. The summary prospectus has a helpful breakdown that highlights all of the option strategies that the fund uses. CONY Holdings (Seeking Alpha) Despite using an OTM option strategy, CONY is likely to alwaysunderperform COIN from a price perspective. This is because the upside price momentum is capped at the selected strike price. Additionally, the upside is capped but the downside is not, so CONY will feel the full impact of price declines. This is my least favorite aspect of YieldMax funds because you are usually better off simply owning the underlying stock, rather than focusing on income. Looking at the chart below, we can see how Coinbase is up over 372% since CONY's inception. Meanwhile, CONY's price is down over 51.6% since its inception. Data by YCharts Performance & Risks: The Early Advantage CONY has an inception dating back to August 2023, and has a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. Looking at the performance since inception, CONY has been able to provide a total return of over 172%, which includes all distributions that were paid out to shareholders. Unfortunately, the price has deteriorated by more than 51.6% over the same time frame. The significant price deterioration really limits the appeal of the fund but this is just the risk that investors must be aware of when it comes to these single-stock synthetic option ETFs. Data by YCharts Looking at the total return comparison between CONY and COIN below, we can see that common shares of Coinbase has provided a total return of over 372%. In this context, CONY's total return of 172% no longer seems that impressive since it was severely outperformed by the common shares. CONY essentially captured less than 50% of COIN's total return but to CONY's credit, COIN experienced a significant rise from ~$80 per share up to ~$373 per share over this period. This sort of price growth is unusual and CONY's documents clearly lays out that it will experience a capped upside so there shouldn't be any surprises here. Coinbase also had a few different catalysts to help drive the price significantly higher over the last few months. Some of the notable catalysts include: Inclusion in the S&P 500 index. Coinbase secured MiCA license to offer crypto services in EU. Coinbase to deploy USDC stablecoin as collateral in US futures trading. US Senate passes stablecoin legislation . Data by YCharts The unfortunately truth is that nearly all the YieldMax funds eventually suffer from the same fate and this is my main issue. The large distributions and capped upside potential makes it very unlikely for these funds to ever experience large price swings upward over time. No matter what the catalyst is, many of these funds will never experience price gains. Just as an example, here are some different YieldMax ETFs and their respective price change since inception. YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF ( APLY ) YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF ( TSLY ) YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF ( NVDY ) YieldMax META Option Income Strategy ETF ( FBY ) As we can see below, all of these funds have seen their price deteriorate over time. Nvidia ( NVDA ) recently became the first company to be valued at over $4T but that milestone is not reflected in the YieldMax fund. Meta Platforms ( META ) currently trades near its all time high, but that is also not reflected in the YieldMax fund. Data by YCharts The reality is that the investors that were able to best capitalize on these YieldMax funds were able to capitalize on the first movers advantage. If you initiated a position in these funds shortly after inception, you probably performed the best. However, that is simply because you would have allowed more time to receive distributions that can offset these declines. After all, CONY offers a massive distribution rate of nearly 73%. So technically, investors should be able to collect back their initial investment within a year and a half. 73% x 1.5 years = 109% in distributions return to shareholders. So despite all its flaws, I believe that patience and time can offset these large declines. A fund like CONY becomes more forgiving the longer you hold it. I went back and calculated all distributions that have been paid out to shareholders over the fund's lifetime. The fund launched at a share price of $20. When including all distributions paid since inception, we can see how early investors would now be sitting at 'house money' status. House money refers to the cross point where you receive more in distributions than what you paid per share. 2023 - $4.7479 in total distributions 2024 - $20.2980 in total distributions 2025 - $4.8392 in total distributions YTD Grand Total: $29.8851 Once you cross into house money status, you've essentially recovered your initial investment back through dividends. Therefore, your risk is significantly reduced going forward since you've now recovered your initial investment but you still hold the shares that pay you distributions every four weeks. However, Coinbase and Bitcoin now trades within territory of both their respective all time highs. A significant downward retraction from the highs will cause CONY's price to retract even further. Data by YCharts Dividend Utility As of the most recently declared distribution of $0.5354, the current distribution rate is about 73% annually. A new payout is declared every four weeks, so the estimated yield can be a lot different based on the time you are reading this. Looking at the dividend payout history below, you'll see one of the biggest issues I have with YieldMax funds. As the price and underlying NAV declines, so do the payouts. In CONY's prime, the largest payout was nearly $2.8 per share. Now that the price has fallen to its current range, I do not see the payouts ever returning to those levels. CONY Dividend History (Seeking Alpha) However, I wanted to specifically talk about the tax-efficiency of the distributions and how the ETF is flexible in terms of what accounts it can be utilized within. If you haven't already, I would highly recommend using the contact form on YieldMax's site and requesting to get added to their distribution list. This is the most accurate way to get the updated distribution every Wednesday for the different YieldMax funds. In the distribution table they provide, there is a column for ROC (return of capital). YieldMax Return of capital distributions aren't classified as income, and therefore aren't taxed as such. Instead, a return of capital distribution reduces an investor's cost basis and allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale. Just for an example, let's imagine that you buy into a stock at $20 per share and it pays you a $2 per share dividend using return of capital. Instead of being taxed on that $2 per share dividend, your cost basis would be reduced to $18 per share. So with CONY, you are technically able to hold onto a long-term position until your cost basis reaches $0. At that point, all distributions received would be classified as long-term capital gains. The use of return of capital can be controversial because investors can interpret this as your own capital being paid back to you. However, this isn't necessarily the case all of the time. If YieldMax has a successful period of generating premiums with options, the distributions are still fueled by the premiums. The label of return of capital is simply a tax classification. Therefore, a position in CONY can be efficiently utilized within a regular brokerage account, which increases its overall flexibility. However, it should be noted that there are still portions of the distributions that are funded by net investment income, which has the least favorable tax treatment. Unfortunately, there's no clear way to know how much of the distribution will be taxable until your brokerage releases tax documents at the end of the year. Takeaway In conclusion, I maintain a hold rating on CONY at this time due to Coinbase and Bitcoin both trading near all time highs. I anticipate that a pullback in Coinbase would cause CONY's price to see a deeper downward move over the short term. The distributions can be tax-efficient and the fund becomes more forgiving the longer you hold it. Despite the tax-efficient distributions that can be received from the fund, I really dislike the continued price decay over time. CONY has been one of the least price resilient funds compared to its peers. If you don't have a specific need for income, I wouldn't suggest a position in CONY since it caps the upside price potential. If you are long on Coinbase, it would be much better to hold the underlying shares instead.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800388-cony-high-yield-has-offset-price-declines-but-more-downside-possible?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|BTC|REGULATION","BTC-USD|COIN|CONY",cryptocompare

2025-07-10T20:08:33,"Solana price prediction this week: can $160 spark the next leg up?","A clean break above $160 could confirm Solana’s bullish reversal, but resistance remains stiff. With trading volume up 19%, ETF momentum rekindling, institutional capital pouring in, and staking demand rising, the odds of a breakout are improving. The question is whether SOL can sustain the momentum. On July 10, Solana ( SOL ) surged over 4%, climbing from an intraday low of $153 to reach $159.60 by press time, marking one of the token’s strongest single-day moves in recent weeks. The uptick came amid a sharp rise in market activity, with 24-hour trading volume jumping 19% to nearly $4.9 billion, suggesting that traders are positioning for a potential breakout. Beyond the charts, institutional interest in Solana is heating up, adding fresh weight to a potential bullish scenario as smaller cryptocurrencies rally on the back of Bitcoin’s sprint to a new all-time high. You might also like: Sui price rally gains steam after a highly bullish Grayscale report Institutional pressure builds as SOL tests critical levels Despite this week’s move, Solana remains significantly below its January peak near $294. Trading nearly 46% beneath its all-time high, the token has struggled to reclaim momentum above key resistance zones for much of the year. Like most altcoins, SOL felt pressure from regulatory uncertainty and investor preference for Bitcoin ETFs. But Solana has also faced internal challenges, network outages, decentralization concerns, and growing competition from rival smart contract platforms. These factors have held the token back. Until now. The tide appears to be turning. DeFi Dev Corp, which recently increased its holdings to over 846,000 SOL (worth more than $133 million), has emerged as one of the most visible corporate buyers, signaling conviction in Solana’s long-term potential. BIT Mining’s recent $300 million pivot into Solana is another major vote of confidence. Unlike passive accumulation, these firms are actively staking, validating, and integrating into the Solana ecosystem, a level of engagement that the market is watching closely. Meanwhile, the ETF drumbeat has returned with force. While the SEC’s recent request for revisions to Solana ETF filings might seem like a setback, analysts like Bloomberg’s James Seyffart still peg approval odds at 95% by October. Here are mine and @EricBalchunas ' most recent odds on spot crypto ETF approvals by the end of 2025. We expect a wave of new ETFs in this second half of 2025. pic.twitter.com/H3pxJhqMy3 — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) June 30, 2025 The very prospect of a Solana ETF has already shifted sentiment. SOL is now included in the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF’s portfolio, holding an 8% allocation alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Then there’s Solana’s on-chain renaissance. Robinhood’s rollout of SOL staking in the U.S. brings the token directly into retail investor pipelines, just as interest in passive yield strategies rebounds. Solana’s booming network activity, coupled with staking-enabled platforms and streamlined integrations, is starting to chip away at Ethereum’s dominance in the proof-of-stake economy. The verdict: breaking out or faking out? Solana’s price path to $200 hinges on two factors: a decisive break above $160 and sustained institutional inflows. The technical setup is primed: rising volume, bullish chart patterns, and a clear resistance level to conquer. But the real fuel comes from the fundamentals: staking demand, ETF speculation, and a wave of institutional adoption that’s harder to dismiss as fleeting hype. If SOL price flips $160 into support, the next targets are clear: $180 first, then $200. But if resistance holds, expect consolidation between $140 and $160 until the next catalyst emerges. Either way, Solana isn’t just riding Bitcoin’s coattails anymore. The token carving its own path, and this week could determine whether that path leads to a summer rally or another false start.

2025-07-10T20:07:07,"Developers Clarify the Reason Behind the Significant Price Drop in an Altcoin – Did They Sell Their Tokens?","Following the 41% sudden drop in the SOON token on July 5, 2025, the team behind the project released a detailed analysis report. The report stated that the incident was a coordinated market manipulation and that official market makers and foundation wallets had nothing to do with the attack. According to a preliminary report published by the SOON team, the attack occurred between 4:00 PM and 9:00 PM on July 5th. During this period, 22 million SOON tokens, withdrawn from Bitget, were systematically sold on exchanges like Bithumb, Upbit, Gate, and others. At the same time, significant profits were made from the price drop through short positions opened on platforms like Binance, Bybit, and OKX. This aggressive selling drove the SOON price from $0.22 to $0.13. SOON price has still not fully recovered despite the overall market rally after the recent crash. Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks All-Time High Again — Here's Why and What Analysts Think Will Happen Next In-depth analysis noted that these transactions resulted in funding rates in derivatives markets falling by as much as -500% to -600%.

The analyst pseudonymously known as Rekt Capital tells his 550,400 subscribers on the social media platform X that the Bitcoin bull market could end in two or three months if history repeats itself. According to the pseudonymous analyst, the Bitcoin bull market typically hits the peak around 518 to 546 days after the halving, suggesting it could occur between mid-September and mid-October. The fourth Bitcoin halving took place in April 2024. On what is in store for Bitcoin’s price over the coming weeks and months, the widely followed analyst says , “If Bitcoin really does have two to three months left in its Bull Market… Then this current period truly is the calm before the storm.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,386 at time of writing. Rekt Capital further says that even if the bull market extends beyond October, trying to capture the potential gains would be a high-risk and low-reward endeavor. “The risk versus reward of that upside will likely not be worth heavy participation. Is it worth capturing an additional +20 – 30% uptrend while risking a -60 to -70% Bear Market?” On altcoins, the widely followed analyst says they could enjoy a rally once Bitcoin rises above the current all-time high of just under $112,000. “When Bitcoin broke out into Price Discovery Uptrend 1 in November 2024… Altcoins rallied exponentially during that time.

2025-07-10T19:59:44,"Bitcoin has broken $114,000 for the first time, with traders now betting on a $120,000 target","Bitcoin just smashed past $114,000, and traders on Deribit are already piling into contracts that bet it’ll hit $120,000 before the month ends. The bets didn’t come out of nowhere. Open interest has surged around strike prices of $115K and $120K, with longer-term options aiming even higher to $140K in September, $150K by December. This all unfolded as Bitcoin logged its second day of a record-breaking rally. The trigger? A combination of institutional demand and political expectations. Bitcoin is already up 20% this year. That’s alongside the S&P 500, which has soared 30% from its April lows. Both charts are pointing straight up. Shorts liquidated as traders crowd into bullish positions Deribit isn’t the only place traders are showing their hands. Chris Newhouse, head of research at Ergonia, a DeFi trading firm, said the breakout followed the biggest short liquidation event since May 7. “Yesterday’s move to all-time highs came after the largest short liquidation event since May 7th, with approximately $447 million in positions liquidated,” Chris said . Bears had built up too much exposure, and the market punished them. The wipeout slowed down slightly afterward. When Bitcoin crossed $112K on Wednesday, it triggered a wave of panic covering. But in the following 12 hours, only $76.5 million in liquidations took place—down sharply from the day before. Those numbers came from Coinglass, which tracks exchange activity. Traders who bet against the rally were forced out, and the rest leaned even harder into the upside. The funding rate for Bitcoin perpetuals is still positive. That matters because it shows traders are paying to stay long, literally. It’s one of the clearest signs that bullish bets are dominating the futures market. No hesitation. People are riding this. Trump’s comments and corporate demand lift confidence The rally on Thursday had an extra kick. Donald Trump went on Truth Social and dropped a series of pro-crypto posts. Coming from the sitting president, it only added to the already bullish tone. Investors are banking on his administration to ease the pressure on crypto regulation, and his public stance is feeding that narrative. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, the CSO and co-founder of Ledn, said the rally is also being driven by corporate buyers. A wave of crypto treasury companies is loading Bitcoin onto their balance sheets. These firms are selling shares or issuing debt to get the funds, trying to turn themselves into Bitcoin proxies for public markets. “Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high on the back of relentless demand from investors and corporations,” Mauricio said. This is all happening while tensions rise globally. Trump’s administration is preparing tariffs set to drop in August, adding more stress to an already tense trade environment. But Roshan Roberts, CEO of OKX US, said Bitcoin isn’t flinching. “As trade tensions flare and altcoins stumble, institutions are treating BTC as a macro hedge and a maturing asset class. July will test markets, but Bitcoin looks built for it,” Roshan said. Prediction markets are buying into that view. Polymarket currently gives Bitcoin a 76% chance of hitting $115,000 by the end of July. With equities roaring, again, S&P 500 up 30% from April, risk assets have momentum on their side. But in crypto, it’s Bitcoin that’s leading the charge.

In a new strategy session, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 139,600 followers on the social media platform X that Pudgy Penguin ( PENGU ), the native asset of a non-fungible token (NFT) collection with the same name, appears ready to skyrocket aided by the launch of its upcoming exchange-traded fund (ETF). “Slap yourself if you are sleeping on PENGU. This is a textbook bullish retest. $0.060 by August is just the start. Once the ETF gets approved, who knows how far this can go.” Source: Ali Martinez/X PENGU is trading for $0.019 at time of writing, a 31.4% increase during the last 24 hours. A rise to Martinez’s target would represent a 216% gain for the asset. Moving on to the popular meme asset DOGE, Martinez says that every time it forms a specific pattern, its price tends to rise. The analyst says he envisions the dog-themed digital asset rising to between $0.20 and $0.25. “Every time Dogecoin forms this pattern, price takes off. Right now, Dogecoin is sitting at the bottom of a parallel channel. A buying spike here could send Dogecoin to $0.20 and maybe even $0.25.” DOGE is trading for $0.179 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Concluding his analysis with the smart contract platform Solana, Martinez notes that the asset has broken through its resistance zone and is on its way to a price tag of $164 by the end of the week. “Solana is forming a symmetrical triangle, and an 8% move could be next. A close above $153 could send Solana above $164.” SOL is trading for $156 at time of writing, a 1.6% gain on the day.

2025-07-10T19:51:31,"Strategy’s tax exposure is a head-on collision with a cash flow gap","For years, Michael Saylor has proudly declared that Strategy would “never sell” its Bitcoin. That mantra faces a stern test with new taxation laws. Fresh SEC filings and tax rules mean some of the coins in Strategy’s 597,325 BTC (roughly $67 billion at current prices) treasury may have to go. In a July 7 Form 8‑K , Strategy laid out a new headache: under accounting standard ASU 2023‑08, it must mark its Bitcoin to market each quarter, recording unrealized gains as income. Risk: Tax bills may force BTC sales Strategy writes: ""We may need to liquidate some of our bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity securities to raise cash sufficient to satisfy our tax obligations."" In plain terms: if tax hits, BTC may need to be sold. pic.twitter.com/6ENYrQhhTf — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 10, 2025 That boost to paper profits carries a downside. Starting in 2026, the U.S. will slap a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) on companies with over $1 billion in adjusted income, potentially crystallizing billions in tax bills on gains the company hasn’t sold. Strategy once reported Bitcoin at purchase cost, shielding those sky‑high gains from its income statement. Now, every uptick in Bitcoin’s price inflates taxable income, whether the company moves a single coin or not. In practical terms, Saylor’s empire could face a multi‑billion‑dollar tax hit, even if its Bitcoin stash stays untouched. A thread on X (formerly Twitter) by analytics firm CryptoQuant, posted Thursday, July 10, 2025, summarized the risk in stark terms. “The company might owe cash taxes on unrealized BTC gains,” the firm wrote, adding that Strategy’s own disclosures admit it may need to liquidate some of its Bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity to meet those obligations. Strategy’s tax exposure is a head-on collision with a cash flow gap Strategy’s own filings admit that its software business doesn’t generate enough cash to cover these new obligations. The company already carries $8.2 billion in convertible debt and $3.4 billion in preferred stock, which together demand well over $350 million a year in interest and dividends. If cash from operations falls short, Strategy may need to borrow more, tap equity markets, or, contrary to its long‑held vow, sell Bitcoin. Indeed, the company spells it out unflinchingly: “We may need to liquidate some of our bitcoin holdings or issue additional debt or equity securities to raise cash sufficient to satisfy our tax obligations.” This raises a key question: if the company cannot raise new capital through debt or equity issuance, will it be forced to tap into its Bitcoin reserves? Yes, they've sold BTC before. Despite the “we never sell” meme… 📉 They sold BTC in Q4 2022 (as disclosed in prior SEC filings). A reminder: nothing is off the table if liquidity is tight. pic.twitter.com/xdiaYOQ0Kr — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 10, 2025 Custodial risk is another issue outside Saylor’s control Strategy acknowledged that even its custodial arrangements for Bitcoin may not be bulletproof. If a custodian fails, they may not be able to access their Bitcoin, as the company warned that its tokens could be treated as part of the custodian’s estate, effectively rendering Strategy a general unsecured creditor. To its credit, Strategy has been transparent in outlining these threats. “This is not intended to spread fear, uncertainty, or doubt,” CryptoQuant wrote in its final post on the topic. “It simply summarizes what’s written by Strategy themselves in their official SEC filing.” Strategy’s bitcoin holdings represent roughly 3% of the token’s total circulating supply. Any move under distress, whether to cover taxes or obligations, could considerably impact the market. For now, Strategy remains one of the largest and boldest corporate holders of Bitcoin. But the company’s own documents suggest that it understands that its Satoshi-centric model, while immensely profitable on paper, is also vulnerable. However, if anyone has the answers to these doubts, it’s probably Saylor. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-07-10T19:39:07,"After Bitcoin's ATH, Smart Money Turns to Avalanche vs. Polkadot: Which Will Outperform in 2025?","Bitcoin's peak has sparked a keen interest in the crypto world. Now, attention is shifting to other promising contenders. Spotlight on Avalanche and Polkadot as they vie for dominance. Explore the potential growth of these two coins and see which might lead the way by 2025. Discover the smart money's next move in the evolving crypto landscape. Avalanche Price Action: Analyzing Past Performance and Current Dynamics Avalanche experienced a 5.38% increase over the last week, yet it faced a significant decline of 10.98% over the past month and a steep 46.75% drop in the past six months. Recent price movements reflect short-term gains amidst persistent bearish pressure, while the longer-term trend indicates a consistent downturn. Despite a few temporary rebounds, the asset's ongoing fluctuations have kept traders on high alert, with the market remaining cautious following substantial losses over an extended period. Currently, Avalanche trades within a range of $14.82 to $21.92. Immediate support is at $11.69, and the nearest resistance is at $25.89, while a secondary support lies at $4.59, with upper resistance at $32.99. The momentum indicator shows a slight upward force at 1.58, although the Awesome Oscillator reads slightly negative at -0.145. With the Relative Strength Index at 55.93, the asset is balanced but not in extreme territory. This situation results in mixed bullish and bearish pressures, prompting traders to watch for breakouts above $25.89 or downturns below $11.69 as they consider their next moves. Polkadot's Price Movements: Analyzing Recent Trends and Opportunities Polkadot experienced a noticeable decline over the past month with prices falling about 11.54% and a steeper drop of 45.32% over six months. Recent moves showed a modest recovery with a 3.66% gain in the past week, highlighting short-term resilience despite the longer-term downtrend. Price volatility has defined its performance, with market sentiment reflected in cautious indicators and occasional positive shifts. Historical price swings underline the challenge of regaining lost strength and pave the way for renewed activity if market dynamics turn favorable. Polkadot currently trades within a narrow band between $2.83 and $4.16, setting a clear stage for tactical maneuvering among market participants. Immediate resistance is spotted at $4.92, which serves as a hurdle that price must clear before a move towards the higher barrier of $6.25 can be considered. Downside protection is anchored by a primary support level of $2.26, with additional safety near $0.93. The current technical indicators offer mixed signals; the Awesome Oscillator is slightly negative at -0.131, while the momentum indicator reads 0.28 and the RSI hovers at 54.47. Bulls and bears are locked in a contest, resulting in an absence of a clear long-term trend. Traders might consider strategies focusing on established boundaries, such as short positions near resistance or buying on dips at support levels when confirmation appears. Conclusion Both AVAX and DOT show strong potential for growth by 2025. AVAX boasts quick transaction speeds and a secure platform. DOT focuses on connecting various blockchains and fostering interoperability. Investors might find AVAX appealing for its efficiency, while DOT’s strength lies in its ability to connect different systems. Both coins are in a good position for future development and could be key players in the coming years. The choice between AVAX and DOT depends on an investor's preference for speed or connectivity.

2025-07-10T19:36:27,"Beyond the Bitcoin ATH: Why the Real-World Asset (RWA) Rally Is Just Getting Started","Bitcoin's latest peak has captured attention, but a new trend is quietly emerging. Real-World Assets (RWA) in the crypto space are beginning to surge, hinting at a significant movement ahead. This article explores which specific coins are poised for growth and why savvy investors are eyeing this sector closely. Stay tuned; the insights could be game-changing. Ondo Price Trends: Short-Term Gains vs Long-Term Slide Ondo experienced a -2.92% decline over the past month and a sharp -33.16% drop over the last six months. A recent one-week surge of 8.10% indicates brief buyer activity amid significant volatility. Long-term weakness contrasts with occasional short-term recoveries, reflecting cautious sentiment among holders. The coin's price history shows notable fluctuations, hinting at renewed interest in the near term. Current trading sees Ondo moving between $0.62 and $0.92, with near-term resistance at $1.07 and support at $0.47. Despite long-term bearish pressure, short-term buyers have stepped in, as indicated by the recent surge. The asset may bounce at the lower support level if selling pressure eases, while moves toward $1.07 could signal buyer attempts to push higher. Bulls have control on a weekly basis, but the market remains range-bound without a clear trend. Traders should consider entering positions near support and taking profits near resistance. Rebound Crypto Signal: Algorand Poised for Bullish Opportunity Past month figures show a modest decline of -1.97% alongside a recent recovery marked by an 8.27% weekly gain. ALGO has experienced a significant drop of -47.84% over the past six months, reflecting ongoing bearish pressure despite short-term strength. Price fluctuations indicate a volatile environment with occasional upward movements within a generally downward trend. The current price trades between $0.16 and $0.21 with clear levels to watch. Resistance exists near $0.24 and again at $0.29, while support stands at $0.13 with an additional safety net around $0.07. Indicators like the RSI at 59.26 suggest buyers are starting to enter, but the modest momentum indicator of 0.01 and an Awesome Oscillator at 0.00267 indicate caution. The lack of a definitive trend suggests traders consider short-term positions near the $0.24 resistance, while dips toward $0.13 may offer better entry points for bullish traders. Quant's Mixed Past and Promising Key Levels Spur Cautious Optimism Over the past month, Quant has seen a nearly 10% decline in price, while the six-month change shows a modest improvement of around 7%. Price action maintained a range between roughly $87 and $127. Variability during this period revealed short-term dips against a gradual recovery. Recent figures indicate that selling pressure affected the coin in the short run, yet longer periods suggest buyers are slowly stepping in. The price movements align with market cycles typical for altcoins during bullish phases, with corrections paving the way for upward trends. These shifts reflect both risk and opportunity as the market anticipates emerging catalysts from global crypto conditions. At present, Quant trades within a defined corridor marked by key levels. The price oscillates between $87 and $127, facing near-term resistance around $146 while support holds near $66. Secondary resistance is at $186, with support as low as $26. Current indicators show a balance between buyers and sellers, with a moderately positive RSI near 58 and a rising momentum index at 3.42. The data does not reveal a clear, sustained trend but presents opportunities for trades within these bounds. Bulls might push as prices test the $146 level, while bears watch for drops near support. Traders could consider short-term buying near the lower edge and set protective stops just below. Conclusion With ONDO , ALGO , and QNT gaining traction, the rally appears to gain momentum. These coins address different needs in finance and technology. ONDO focuses on stability and returns. ALGO prioritizes speed and efficiency. QNT integrates multiple blockchains. As these assets grow in adoption and functionality, their future looks promising. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-10T19:34:45,"The Ultimate Catalyst: Bitcoin's New All-Time High Could Send Top Memecoins Parabolic","Bitcoin is on the verge of a momentous milestone , and its impact could go beyond just the leading cryptocurrency. The surge could potentially trigger meteoric gains in popular memecoins. This article delves into which memecoins might benefit the most, offering insights that could unlock substantial growth opportunities for savvy investors. Prepare to discover the potential big winners. Dogecoin Market Analysis: Key Levels, Past Trends, and Current Dominance Dogecoin experienced a modest decline of about 6.55% in the past month, accompanied by a week showing a 6.59% increase, indicating mixed short-term movements. Over the last six months, the coin faced a significant drop of nearly 45.80%, reflecting a prolonged bearish period. Price fluctuations during these windows reveal a volatile recovery that sparked brief bullish momentum before a sharper downturn took hold. The current trading range is between $0.14 and $0.20, with the coin testing a resistance level at $0.23 and resting on key support around $0.11. A second resistance at $0.30 and lower support near $0.05 provide a framework for tactical trades. Bulls maintain some control in the short term, but the overall trend is unclear as the price hovers between these benchmarks. Monitoring a push past the resistance could indicate a rally, while any dip below support should trigger caution. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Trends, Key Levels, and Trading Strategies SHIB price action over the last month and six months displays mixed signals with notable volatility. In the past month, the coin's price fell by around 3.89%, following a more significant drop of 41.51% during the half-year period. A slight one-week recovery of 6.77% indicates some short-term buying interest after larger bearish movements. These fluctuations highlight market uncertainty in a general downturn, suggesting that while long-term bearish sentiment remains, there may be short-term opportunities for trades. The current price range is between $0.00000977 and $0.00001334, nearing a key resistance level at $0.00001527 and a support at $0.00000813. Bulls are gradually entering the market, with the Relative Strength Index at 58.59 indicating moderate upward momentum, although the overall trend lacks strong direction. Traders might consider targeting the second resistance at $0.00001884 if a breakout occurs. Conversely, maintaining positions near support can help mitigate risks of a dip towards the second support at $0.00000456. Short-term long positions could be beneficial, with stop losses to secure profits amid potential renewed bearish trends. Dogwifhat’s Mixed Signal: Caution and Opportunity Amid Volatility Over the past month, Dogwifhat showed a modest weekly rebound of 5.80% following a 6.21% drop, indicating brief strength amid overall weakness. Over the half-year, the coin’s price fell by 38.30%, reflecting persistent downward pressure and uncertainty among investors. The price path during these periods has been erratic, with sharp declines outweighing small gains. This history points to a market still in recovery mode, with investors testing support levels and remaining cautious despite minor recoveries. The coin currently trades between $0.64 and $1.08, with the nearest resistance at $1.30 and a second barrier at $1.74, while support rests at $0.42. Bulls may push the price upward if they can secure the $1.30 level, but bears continue to exert influence amid lingering uncertainty. The indicators are subdued; the Awesome Oscillator is at 0.04 and the Momentum Indicator at 0.10, while the RSI sits at a neutral 58.64. Moving average and oscillator signals also indicate low activity, hinting at a market waiting for clear direction. Trading within these limits calls for patience, with buyers considering dips near support levels and sellers planning exits as resistance approaches. Conclusion Bitcoin reaching a new peak could trigger massive gains for top memecoins. DOGE and SHIB may see significant price increases as they follow Bitcoin's momentum. Newer players like WIF might also experience rapid growth, driven by the overall market excitement. Investors are showing increased interest in these coins, anticipating strong performance. The potential ripple effect of Bitcoin’s success might lead to substantial rises in the value of these memecoins, making them ones to watch closely.

2025-07-10T19:33:09,"What's the Next Top for Bitcoin? After Clearing $112k, Analysts Set Their Sights Higher. But When Will the Time for Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP Come?","Bitcoin has broken the $112,000 mark , catching the attention of market analysts. The cryptocurrency is reaching new heights, but Bitcoin is not the only one with potential. Other major players like Ethereum, Cardano, and XRP may be next in line. The article explores which coins could see significant growth soon and what could trigger these changes. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Steady Growth, Defined Levels, and Trading Prospects Bitcoin recorded a 2.06% increase over the past week and a modest 0.80% rise over the last month. Over the six months, growth reached 17.22%, reflecting a steady progression that highlights gradual recovery. Price movements over these periods indicate stable long-term development despite small fluctuations in the short term. Historical performance suggests that the market has maintained a positive direction with incremental gains over varied intervals, indicating a general upward trend during recent months. Current prices hover between $100,193 and $112,335, with the nearest resistance at $117,502 and support at $93,218 offering clear target levels. The secondary resistance of $129,644 and support at $81,076 further define the trading range for Bitcoin. Bulls appear to be pushing prices upward, creating a balanced atmosphere where sideways moves are common. Trading ideas include looking for entries near support levels and steering positions toward the higher resistance while monitoring momentum indicators that are rising alongside an RSI reading of 61.86. This setup favors a cautious but optimistic stance, allowing for well-placed stop losses to protect positions as the market tests defined boundaries. Ethereum Price Trends: Resilience Amid Long-Term Challenges Ethereum recorded a moderate price increase over the last week with a gain of 7.94% and a steady rise of 3.64% over the past month. In contrast, the six-month performance showed a decline of nearly 15%, indicating a period of lower long-term momentum. Short-term price gains hint at investor optimism, yet the longer timeline underscores a divergence between daily rallies and overall downward pressure. The price behavior reflects short-term recovery amid ongoing challenges, revealing volatility with bursts of increased activity against a backdrop of caution. The current price is trading between $2110.94 and $2870.47, with bulls pushing the asset upward near overbought levels. Immediate resistance stands at $3254.35, with a higher hurdle at $4013.88, while supports are found at $1735.29 and further down at $975.76. Technical indicators suggest bullish forces in the short term, despite mixed longer-term sentiments. There is no clear long-term trend; traders are marking the zone between support and resistance for potential entry and exit points. Caution remains key, with opportunities for swing trades around these pivotal levels. Cardano's Volatility: Short-Term Rally Amid Long-Term Decline ADA price experienced a 10.62% dip over the past month following a 7.86% weekly surge, showing mixed market behavior. Over the last six months, Cardano registered a 32.15% decline, signaling a longer-term downward trend despite intermittent recoveries. Weekly gains provided brief optimism while the cumulative six-month performance has been challenging for holders and short-term traders alike. Cardano's price action has been volatile, with fluctuations reflecting a tug-of-war between temporary bullish pushes and overarching bearish pressure. The current price sits within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, with key resistance levels at $0.83 and $1.05 and support at $0.38 and a secondary boundary near $0.163. The relative strength index is at 57.025, indicating moderate buying interest. The momentum indicator at 0.059 and an almost neutral Awesome Oscillator of -0.008 suggest market uncertainty. Bulls show some pressure as prices test higher levels, but bears maintain influence due to the recent downtrend. Traders may consider positions near the support of $0.38 for potential reversals while watching for a break above $0.83 to signal upward momentum. XRP Market Snapshot: Past Gains and Present Key Levels XRP experienced steady gains over the past month with a rise of about 5.66% and maintained modest upward momentum over the last six months with an approximate growth of 4.74%. Price variations have remained within a narrow range as the coin demonstrated resilience during periods of market adjustments. Weekly shifts, such as a near 9.67% increase, indicate that XRP has seen bursts of activity, while its longer-term movement has been more gradual. Data shows a mix of slight surges and consolidations that collectively suggest a stable growth pattern without dramatic volatility. Past performance highlights cautious optimism among traders as XRP steadily rebuilt value over time. The current trading range for XRP falls between $1.99 and $2.41, with first support at $1.73 and resistance at $2.59. Above these, a second support near $1.31 and resistance close to $3.02 further define critical price boundaries. Bulls seem to hold some control as momentum and moving averages suggest a bias toward upward movement, although the summary rating remains neutral. A break above the $2.59 resistance level could spark fresh bullish interest, while a retreat toward the $1.73 support calls for careful short-term action. Trading around these levels offers opportunities; traders could look for entries when prices touch support in anticipation of a bounce while cautiously avoiding overextended moves near resistance. Conclusion Bitcoin has surpassed $112k , and now analysts are looking at even higher targets. As BTC continues its rise, attention will eventually turn to other cryptocurrencies. ETH , ADA , and XRP have shown strong potential and could see significant gains. While Bitcoin sets new records, these coins may soon experience their moment in the spotlight.

2025-07-10T19:30:26,"Bitcoin Investment: KULR Technology Group’s Astounding $10M Acquisition Boosts Crypto Confidence","In a move that has captured the attention of both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world, NYSE-listed KULR Technology Group recently announced a significant expansion of its Bitcoin (BTC) reserves. This latest KULR Bitcoin acquisition, valued at $10 million, brings the company’s total holdings to an impressive 1,021 BTC. It’s a powerful statement from a technology company, signaling a growing trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption that could reshape corporate treasury strategies worldwide. KULR Technology Group’s Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy Unveiled KULR Technology Group, a leading developer of thermal management and battery safety solutions, has been quietly building its Bitcoin portfolio, and this latest announcement puts their commitment front and center. According to CEO Michael Mo, who shared the news on X (formerly Twitter), the company’s total Bitcoin acquisitions now stand at approximately $101 million. This substantial sum underscores a deliberate and long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. The average purchase price for KULR’s 1,021 BTC is reported at $98,627 per coin. While this figure might seem high compared to Bitcoin’s current market price, it reflects the company’s consistent accumulation over time, perhaps indicating a dollar-cost averaging approach. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s notorious volatility by spreading purchases over a period, rather than trying to time the market. What drives a company like KULR, primarily focused on aerospace and defense, to allocate such a significant portion of its balance sheet to a volatile asset like Bitcoin? The answer lies in a combination of factors: Inflation Hedge: Many corporations view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, a store of value in an era of quantitative easing and depreciating fiat currencies. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Belief in Bitcoin’s future as a global digital reserve asset, with potential for substantial long-term price appreciation. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings like cash and bonds can enhance portfolio resilience. Innovation and Forward Thinking: Aligning with cutting-edge technology and demonstrating a progressive stance to investors. Unpacking the Latest KULR Bitcoin Acquisition: What Does it Mean? The addition of another $10 million in Bitcoin is not just a footnote; it’s a reinforcement of KULR’s conviction in the digital asset. This move follows a broader trend where publicly traded companies are increasingly exploring the integration of digital assets into their financial frameworks. For KULR, this recent acquisition solidifies its position among the ranks of corporate entities embracing cryptocurrency. Michael Mo’s public announcement on X is also noteworthy. By using social media to share this significant financial decision, KULR is engaging directly with a wider audience, including the crypto community, which often follows such corporate developments closely. This transparency can build trust and attract a new segment of investors who are enthusiastic about companies with exposure to digital assets. The 1,021 BTC now held by KULR places it in a notable position, though still behind giants like MicroStrategy, which holds over 200,000 BTC. However, KULR’s consistent accumulation, despite market fluctuations, suggests a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. This is not a speculative short-term play but appears to be a strategic long-term treasury management decision. The Rise of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Growing Trend? KULR’s actions are part of a much larger narrative: the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Over the past few years, we’ve witnessed a paradigm shift, with more and more traditional financial institutions and public companies allocating capital to Bitcoin. This trend signifies a maturing market and a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Consider companies like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin accumulation. Their aggressive strategy has paved the way for others to consider similar moves. Beyond MicroStrategy, other companies such as Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and various investment funds have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets or offer Bitcoin-related services. This surge in corporate BTC holdings is driven by several factors: Macroeconomic Climate: Concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies push companies to seek alternative stores of value. Accessibility: Improved infrastructure for buying, selling, and custody of Bitcoin makes it easier for institutions to participate. Regulatory Clarity (Evolving): While still a work in progress, increasing regulatory discussions and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions lend more legitimacy to the asset. Investor Demand: A growing number of investors, particularly younger generations, are interested in companies that embrace digital assets. The entry of more institutions provides liquidity, reduces volatility (in the long run, though short-term volatility remains), and strengthens Bitcoin’s position in the global financial landscape. Navigating Corporate BTC Holdings: Benefits and Challenges While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, companies like KULR must carefully weigh the benefits against the inherent challenges of holding such a volatile asset. Understanding these aspects is crucial for any firm considering a similar Bitcoin investment strategy. Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Potential for Significant Returns: Bitcoin has historically outperformed many traditional assets, offering substantial upside potential. Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets can help diversify a corporate treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Enhanced Brand Image: Embracing innovative technologies like Bitcoin can position a company as forward-thinking and technologically advanced, appealing to a modern investor base. Inflation Protection: As a decentralized asset with a capped supply, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflationary pressures. Challenges and Risks of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which can impact a company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, posing potential risks related to compliance, taxation, and future restrictions. Custody and Security: Securely storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires specialized expertise and robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require Bitcoin to be treated as an intangible asset, leading to potential impairment charges if its value drops below the purchase price. Public Perception: Some traditional investors might view Bitcoin holdings as overly speculative, potentially affecting investor confidence. KULR’s management team likely has a sophisticated understanding of these factors, having made multiple acquisitions. Their continued commitment suggests they believe the long-term benefits outweigh the risks. Beyond KULR: Understanding Bitcoin Investment Strategy in the Corporate World KULR’s strategic move is more than just a company buying Bitcoin; it’s a bellwether for how corporate treasuries are evolving. This shift is not just about speculation but about adapting to a changing financial world where digital assets play an increasingly prominent role. For investors, understanding the motivations behind such corporate BTC holdings can offer valuable insights. What actionable insights can we glean from KULR’s actions and the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption? Market Signal: Each corporate acquisition of Bitcoin reinforces its legitimacy as an asset, potentially attracting more traditional capital. Due Diligence: For investors, it becomes increasingly important to understand a company’s treasury strategy, including its exposure to digital assets. Long-Term Vision: Companies embracing Bitcoin are often doing so with a long-term vision, looking beyond short-term market fluctuations. Diversification of Risk: For individual investors, KULR’s strategy might inspire a re-evaluation of personal portfolio diversification to include digital assets. The narrative of Bitcoin moving from a niche internet currency to a corporate treasury asset is powerful. As more companies like KULR Technology Group make such bold moves, the line between traditional finance and the crypto economy continues to blur, paving the way for a more integrated financial future. Conclusion: KULR’s Bold Step in a Shifting Financial Landscape KULR Technology Group’s recent $10 million Bitcoin acquisition, boosting its corporate BTC holdings to 1,021 BTC, is a significant event that resonates far beyond the company’s balance sheet.

2025-07-10T19:28:23,"Here’s why Bitcoin hit an all-time high and can run to $120k","Bitcoin recently broke its all-time high, and experts believe that a move to $120,000 could be possible. On July 10, Bitcoin (BTC) reached $113,833, breaking its ATH for the second day in a row and causing a boom in the entire market. Now, bullish momentum is building, crypto analysts from B2BINPAY shared with crypto.news. Moreover, altcoins could be the biggest winners in this cycle. After weeks of trading around $106,000 and $110,000, Bitcoin finally broke through a key level at $112,000. According to analysts at B2BINPAY, this also led to over $280 million in liquidations in just one hour. “Bitcoin’s latest breakout above $112,000 confirms the market has broken out of its ‘indecisive’ phase,” B2BINPAY analysts said, adding that “there’s clear evidence of renewed spot demand and conviction buying,” they added.

Strong ETF demand, exchange outflows into cold storage, and corporate treasuries are all giving bullish signals for the Bitcoin market. “Structurally, the chart now points toward the $115,000-$120,000 zone, with strong momentum behind it,” B2BINPAY analysts. You might also like: BREAKING: Bitcoin price hits record high as ETF demand overwhelms bearish market setup Will altcoins follow Bitcoin’s rally? With Bitcoin’s dominance at multi-year highs, questions arise about the opportunity for altcoins. While capital remains concentrated in Bitcoin, altcoins may have a major opportunity for a rally. According to B2BINPAY analysts, a potential altcoin rally will likely come down to macroeconomic factors. “Right now, the trend favors Bitcoin. But just beneath it, altcoins are quietly positioning for a late-summer rotation,” B2BINPAY analysts stated. “But if macro shocks hit (a hawkish Fed pivot or geopolitical escalation), Bitcoin could spike in dominance as risk appetite vanishes,” they added. While Bitcoin remains relatively resilient when it comes to macro shocks, altcoins are much more sensitive. Any development that lowers risk appetite among traders will likely have a major negative effect on the altcoin market.

2025-07-10T19:20:26,"Bitcoin: DDC Enterprise Unveils Colossal $100M Strategy with Animoca Brands","The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and a recent development has sent ripples through both the e-commerce and Web3 sectors. NYSE-listed DDC Enterprise , a prominent player in the e-commerce world, has announced a groundbreaking partnership with Web3 gaming giant Animoca Brands . This strategic alliance commits an astounding $100 million towards enhancing DDC’s Bitcoin holdings, marking a significant step towards mainstream corporate adoption of digital assets. This isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about a meticulously planned Bitcoin strategy designed to optimize corporate treasury management and embrace the future of finance. What Does This Game-Changing Bitcoin Strategy Entail? At its core, this partnership between DDC Enterprise and Animoca Brands is formalized through a memorandum of understanding (MOU). The commitment of up to $100 million is earmarked specifically for increasing DDC’s Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation. But it goes beyond simple acquisition. The collaboration aims to leverage Animoca Brands’ extensive expertise in the blockchain and digital asset space to develop sophisticated strategies for DDC’s corporate Bitcoin treasury management. This signifies a move by DDC Enterprise to not only hold Bitcoin but to actively manage it as a strategic asset within its financial framework. This initiative represents a fusion of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital economy. DDC Enterprise, a seasoned e-commerce company, is tapping into the innovative prowess of Animoca Brands, a company synonymous with the cutting edge of Web3 gaming and the metaverse. The synergy is clear: DDC brings its established market presence and financial acumen, while Animoca provides the technical know-how and strategic insights into navigating the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. This bold Bitcoin strategy sets a new precedent for corporate engagement with digital assets. Why is DDC Enterprise Betting Big on Bitcoin? The decision by DDC Enterprise to commit such a substantial sum to Bitcoin is a testament to the cryptocurrency’s growing appeal as a legitimate store of value and a hedge against inflation. In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, corporations are increasingly looking for alternative assets to diversify their portfolios and preserve capital. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” offers a decentralized, borderless, and increasingly recognized solution. Here are some key motivations behind DDC’s significant investment in its Bitcoin strategy : Inflation Hedge: With its capped supply and decentralized nature, Bitcoin is seen by many as a robust hedge against the erosive effects of inflation, unlike traditional fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to their treasury provides DDC Enterprise with an asset class that often moves independently of traditional markets, offering portfolio diversification benefits. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth trends, attracting investors seeking significant capital appreciation. Embracing Digital Transformation: This move positions DDC Enterprise as a forward-thinking company, embracing the digital economy and the future of finance. It signals their readiness to integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into their core operations. Strategic Corporate Treasury Management: Beyond simple holding, the partnership aims to develop sophisticated strategies for managing these assets, including potential yield generation or strategic deployment to optimize their financial position. How Does Animoca Brands Propel This Bitcoin Strategy? Animoca Brands is not just any partner; they are a titan in the Web3 gaming and metaverse space, with a vast portfolio of investments and expertise in blockchain technology. Their role in this partnership is crucial, extending far beyond merely facilitating Bitcoin purchases. Animoca Brands brings a wealth of experience in: Blockchain Technology Integration: They possess a deep understanding of the underlying blockchain technology, ensuring secure and efficient management of digital assets for DDC Enterprise . Digital Asset Strategy: Their expertise lies in navigating the complexities of digital asset markets, including market dynamics, advanced security protocols, and evolving regulatory considerations, which are vital for substantial Bitcoin holdings . Web3 Ecosystem Insights: As a leader in Web3, Animoca Brands can provide DDC Enterprise with invaluable insights into the broader decentralized economy, opening doors for future innovations and strategic alignments. Network and Partnerships: Their extensive network within the crypto and blockchain industry can be leveraged for strategic advantages in Bitcoin accumulation and sophisticated corporate Bitcoin treasury management . This collaboration highlights the increasing convergence of traditional industries with the decentralized world. Animoca Brands is not just a gaming company; they are architects of the open metaverse, making them an ideal guide for DDC Enterprise as it ventures deeper into digital asset management and a comprehensive Bitcoin strategy . What Are the Broader Implications for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings? The partnership between DDC Enterprise and Animoca Brands sends a powerful signal to the global corporate community. It underscores a growing trend of companies recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset for their balance sheets. While early adopters like MicroStrategy paved the way, DDC Enterprise’s move, especially as a NYSE-listed e-commerce company, adds significant weight to the institutional adoption narrative. However, venturing into corporate Bitcoin treasury management is not without its challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price fluctuations can be significant, requiring robust risk management strategies and a long-term perspective. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across jurisdictions, posing potential compliance challenges that necessitate careful navigation. Security Concerns: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge, cutting-edge infrastructure, and vigilant protocols to guard against hacks and theft. Accounting and Tax Implications: Complexities arise in how Bitcoin holdings are accounted for and taxed in different regions, necessitating expert financial and legal advice. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits—from capital appreciation to enhanced brand perception as an innovator—are clearly outweighing the risks for companies like DDC Enterprise . This strategic move could inspire other e-commerce giants and traditional businesses to explore similar ventures, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a global reserve asset for corporations and accelerating the mainstream adoption of Web3 gaming principles in broader business contexts. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards the Future of Finance The $100 million Bitcoin strategy forged between DDC Enterprise and Animoca Brands is more than just an investment; it’s a statement. It’s a clear indication that digital assets, particularly Bitcoin , are moving from the periphery to the core of corporate financial planning. This collaboration leverages the strengths of both a seasoned e-commerce leader and a pioneering Web3 gaming powerhouse to navigate the complexities and capitalize on the immense opportunities within the decentralized economy. As DDC Enterprise accelerates its Bitcoin holdings and refines its corporate Bitcoin treasury management , the eyes of the financial world will undoubtedly be watching. This partnership serves as a compelling blueprint for how traditional businesses can strategically embrace blockchain technology and digital assets, paving the way for a more integrated and digitally native future for global commerce. It’s an exciting time to witness such bold moves shaping the financial landscape.

2025-07-10T19:16:36,"US Treasury Officially Scraps Crypto Broker Reporting Rules After Congressional Vote","The US Treasury Department officially scrapped crypto broker reporting rules on Thursday, following a vote by Congress to revoke them under the Congressional Review Act, which President Trump signed in April. BREAKING: CRYPTO TAXES The US Treasury has removed crypto broker reporting rules — including Form 1099‑DA It was designed to require crypto brokers, including DeFi platforms, to report users’ digital asset transactions to the IRS for tax compliance Let’s gooo! pic.twitter.com/dpGOASbW3Y — Real World Asset Watchlist (@RWAwatchlist_) July 10, 2025 The regulation titled “Gross Proceeds Reporting by Brokers that Regularly Provide Services Effectuating Digital Asset Sales” was published December 30, 2024, and is intended to require certain decentralized finance industry participants to file information returns as brokers effective February 28, 2025. Source: federalregister.gov Under Public Law 119-5 and the Congressional Review Act, the final rule has no legal force or effect and is considered null and void, as if it had never taken effect. The Treasury is removing the rule from the Code of Federal Regulations and reverting to the previous text, which excluded entities solely engaged in validating distributed ledger transactions or selling hardware for private key control from broker reporting requirements. Republicans in Congress successfully challenged the Biden-era rule that would have classified DeFi platforms as brokers, requiring extensive data collection and reporting obligations. The Treasury estimated that billions in crypto-related taxes were going uncollected annually, but industry advocates argued that the requirements were technically impossible for decentralized platforms to implement. The regulation faced widespread criticism for misunderstanding decentralized technology and potentially driving innovation overseas, prompting legal challenges from the Blockchain Association and Texas Blockchain Council . Congressional Battle Over DeFi Innovation and Tax Compliance Senator Ted Cruz led the Congressional Review Act resolution alongside Representative Mike Carey, arguing the rule represented government overreach that would stifle American cryptocurrency innovation. Cruz stated the regulation “ directly and immediately would harm American cryptocurrency innovation and drive development overseas. “ 1/ @SenTedCruz ’s CRA resolution to roll back the DeFi Broker Rule – anti-crypto, anti-privacy IRS midnight rulemaking – is critical to providing clarity for crypto and DeFi in the US. Congress should vote YES on the CRA. This has been a long battle… How did we get here? — Kristin Smith (@KMSmithDC) February 12, 2025 The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated repealing the rule could cost the government nearly $4 billion over ten years in lost tax revenue. Despite projected losses, lawmakers supporting repeal prioritized privacy, technical feasibility, and innovation over tax collection efficiency. House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill also condemned the proposal as excessive government intervention, arguing that defining DeFi software providers as brokers would create costly reporting obligations for entities that never take custody of user funds. The regulation threatened to push American digital asset development overseas while undermining technological progress. White House Crypto Czar David Sacks supported the repeal effort, calling the regulation an “ 11th-hour attack on the crypto community by the Biden administration. ” The White House is pleased to announce its support for the CRA introduced by @SenTedCruz and @RepMikeCarey to rescind the so-called Broker DeFi Rule, an 11th hour attack on the crypto community by the Biden administration. pic.twitter.com/T7Hxasb4aC — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) March 4, 2025 The administration positioned itself as strongly supportive of crypto industry concerns while establishing federal working groups on digital asset regulation. The successful repeal prevents the IRS from reintroducing similar proposals in the future, marking a significant victory for DeFi advocates. Broader Regulatory Shifts Signal Pro-Crypto Policy Direction The Treasury Department separately announced exemptions that will free banks and brokerage firms from reporting customers’ crypto holdings on financial statements, contingent upon demonstrating effective digital asset risk management capabilities. The SEC began issuing guidance clarifying that some crypto arrangements might not qualify as liabilities for reporting purposes. These regulatory relief measures came amid sustained Congressional pressure to revise the controversial SAB 121 accounting bulletin. While the Senate voted to overturn SAB 121 in May with 60 senators supporting repeal, President Biden’s veto prevented the measure from taking effect. States continue advancing Bitcoin legislation independently of federal action, with 23 states introducing Bitcoin reserve bills and 35 proposals under consideration. In fact, following that, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed the “Bitcoin Rights” bill into law . Beyond the United States, Japan’s Senate has also recently approved legal amendments that give crypto brokerage firms increased operational freedom through new “intermediary business” categories, which come with reduced regulatory barriers. The legislation creates customer safeguards while promoting innovation, requiring the Prime Minister’s approval for crypto operators to hold assets domestically.

2025-07-10T19:06:10,"Binance CEO Richard Teng Speaks After Bitcoin Breaks Record After Record","Speaking on 'Mornings with Maria', Binance CEO Richard Teng described it as “exciting” that countries are starting to accept cryptocurrencies as part of their strategic reserves. Touching on many topics from his trip in Bhutan to new regulations in the US, Teng said that global crypto adoption is accelerating. Speaking about his visit to Bhutan, Teng noted that thanks to a partnership with the country's Ministry of Tourism and the local DK Bank, Bitcoin payments are now available at over 1,000 businesses. Teng explained that cryptocurrency is used for a wide range of transactions, from accommodation and airline tickets to tour guide payments and souvenir shopping. “This system is secure, cost-effective, and highly effective for both users and local businesses,” he said. Teng noted that Bhutan has embraced crypto not only in terms of usage but also in terms of reserves. He explained that the country began mining Bitcoin using green energy five years ago and currently holds a substantial Bitcoin reserve. He also explained that assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin (BNB) have been included in strategic reserves within Bhutan's special economic zone, the GMC. Teng also touched on developments in the US, saying, “President Trump is strategically approaching future technologies like blockchain and artificial intelligence. His vision for the US to be the center of the crypto world offers great opportunities not only for economic growth but also for high-value-added employment and foreign direct investment.” Related News: BREAKING: Bitcoin (BTC) Breaks All-Time High Again — Here's Why and What Analysts Think Will Happen Next According to Binance CEO, Congress is preparing to vote on new legislation regarding stablecoins and market structure as part of “Crypto Week” in mid-July, heralding a new era for the sector. “These developments demonstrate that the US is moving away from its past repressive approach and embracing a supportive approach to innovation,” Teng said, adding that the establishment of a clear regulatory framework will make responsible innovation possible. Teng, who announced that Binance's user base has surpassed 280 million, stated that this growth is largely due to institutional investors entering the crypto market. “It's not just individual investors; corporate treasuries, foundations, family offices, and even sovereign wealth funds are also showing interest in crypto. Global crypto adoption is currently only at 7%, but the next 10% increase will come much faster,” he said. Teng also addressed a new proposal being floated in the US. Under the plan, supported by President Trump, institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would consider crypto assets in their creditworthiness analysis. “The American dream has traditionally been defined by homeownership,” he said. “Including crypto assets in this process not only increases financial inclusion but also increases the mainstream adoption of crypto.” According to Richard Teng, regulatory clarity and political support in the US will push other countries to follow suit. “If the US leads, the rest of the world will not want to miss this opportunity,” he said. “It is now clear that crypto offers a strategic advantage in economic competition.” The Binance CEO concluded his speech by saying, “We are now entering a new dawn. Global adoption will accelerate, and crypto will be integrated into every aspect of life.” *This is not investment advice.
