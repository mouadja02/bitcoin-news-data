The spot Ethereum ETF has now seen a total of $6.1 billion in inflows, and is way ahead of its eight competitors. Additionally, it was the second-best day for aggregate inflows for the products since they launched with $383 million or 129,500 ETH. We have a *new* daily inflow record for iShares Ethereum ETF… $300+mil. 2nd best day for spot eth ETFs overall since July 2024 launch. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 11, 2025 Institutional Interest in Ethereum BlackRock’s ETHA fund posted record volume over the last two days, with over $800 million each day, which is four times the average, reported Bloomberg ETF specialist Eric Balchunas. “Given the price is also up, probably see some chunky flows next couple of days,” he added . Almost $900 million has entered Ethereum ETFs in just six trading days so far this month, according to Farside Investors. In total, there have been more than $5 billion in inflows since launch, despite Grayscale’s fund hemorrhaging $4.2 billion.

WE ARE SO BACK pic.twitter.com/79KMoQenjV — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) July 11, 2025 Spot Bitcoin ETFs have also been on a roll with a whopping $1.17 billion in aggregate inflows on Thursday, the largest inflow day since early November and the second best since launch. The lion’s share went into BlackRock’s fund as usual, which saw $448.5 million in inflows, bringing its total inflow to a staggering $53.4 billion. It was a “huge volume day for IBIT,” said Balchunas, observing twice the average volume of $5 billion. “When IBIT sees big volume surges on up price days, it portends big boy flows,” he added, stating that there is a good chance that they’ll reach $1 billion over the next day or so. Financial advisors, who control an enormous amount of money, have barely even begun allocating to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, said Nate Geraci before adding: “Major platforms such as Vanguard are still gatekeeping these ETFs (which is laughable IMO). And we’re still seeing near-record inflows.” ETH Reaches $3,000 Ethereum has finally broken out of its multi-month sideways channel in a push towards the psychological $3,000 price level, reaching $3,005 at the time of writing. It is the first time the asset has been over $3,000 since early February. ETH has surged 8% on the day following a week of bullish news regarding corporate treasury adoption and stablecoin foundations for the asset.

2025-07-11T08:49:35,"Bitcoin Short-Sellers Crushed as Price Hits New ATH","Bitcoin short-sellers faced a brutal shakeout on Thursday as the world’s largest cryptocurrency surged to fresh all-time highs, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations within 24 hours. According to CoinGlass data , crypto markets saw $1.01 billion in short positions liquidated. This included around $570 million in Bitcoin shorts and nearly $207 million in Ether shorts, as Bitcoin hit $116,500 and Ether touched $2,990 on Thursday. The surge marks Bitcoin’s second consecutive day of setting new records, with Wednesday’s peak at $112,000 being swiftly surpassed. The rally lifted the total crypto market capitalization by 6% over the past day to $3.68 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Traders React to the Massive Short Squeeze The swift upward move caught many in the market off guard. “Bears in disbelief,” crypto analyst Miles Deutscher posted on X, while trader Daan Crypto Trades described the price surge as a “MASSIVE Short squeeze on BTC & ETH.” Velo, another market commentator, highlighted the scale of the liquidations, noting, “Lots of emails are being sent.” This liquidation event, while significant, was smaller than the one recorded on February 3, when over $2.24 billion in positions were wiped out amid fears of a global trade war following import tariff announcements by US President Donald Trump. Despite these past shakeouts, Thursday’s squeeze was notable for the speed at which Bitcoin moved past its previous record levels. Split Sentiment Before the Breakout Earlier in the week, analysts were divided on Bitcoin’s near-term potential to break new highs. Bitfinex analysts noted on Tuesday that BTC was showing a “lack of follow-through strength,” with bulls appearing hesitant without a clear macro catalyst, as the asset hovered around $108,500. Their report stated that traders were waiting for fresh momentum before pushing the price significantly higher. However, others, including MN Trading Capital founder Michael van de Poppe, were more optimistic. “The inevitable breakout to an ATH on Bitcoin might even happen during the upcoming week,” van de Poppe predicted on June 30. For now, market participants are watching closely to see if BTC can hold above its new highs or push further. If Bitcoin retraces to Wednesday’s level of $112,000 , around $2.11 billion in long positions could be at risk of liquidation, adding another layer of tension as traders recalibrate in the face of BTC’s latest historic climb.

2025-07-11T08:41:10,"A Night of Records for Bitcoin! All-Time High Broken Again! What's the Target? Here Are the Details","Bitcoin (BTC) extended its rally for a second day, hitting an all-time high of $118,000. Investors in the options market are also eyeing even higher prices. Bitcoin Reaches $118,000, Options Market Focuses on $120,000 Target Open interest on the Deribit exchange is concentrated around call options at $115,000 and $120,000, while interest has also increased in long-term options due September 2025 and December 2025. These options have target prices of $140,000 and $150,000. According to data platform CoinGlass, $543 million worth of short positions were liquidated in the last hour alone, bringing the total liquidation in the last 12 hours to $762 million. Experts attribute this rise to institutional demand and positive market sentiment. Favorable funding rates in perpetual futures contracts are supporting the rise in investor sentiment. This upward trend coincides with developments such as the “Crypto Week” held in the US and many companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves. Bitcoin's rally above $116,000 continues the dramatic price cycles the asset has undergone since 2009. What's notable, however, is that volatility has begun to decrease over time. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced at least four major bear markets, with average declines of 45%—similar to the price movements experienced by the Nasdaq after the Dotcom bubble in the early 2000s. The most notable decline occurred in December 2017. The price of Bitcoin fell 25% in a single day, from $20,000 to $11,500, before recovering to $12,800 by evening. However, each cycle has created higher price floors, from a low of $0.30 in 2011 to a high of over $3,000 since 2018, suggesting growing long-term confidence in Bitcoin among institutional investors. While the recent $116,000 breakout, coupled with $543 million in short liquidations, suggests the market is still vulnerable to high momentum moves, it also signals that Bitcoin is becoming a more mature and resilient asset. Bitcoin's new high is a result of growing interest not only from retail investors but also from institutional investors. According to a Coinbase survey, one-third of 250 institutional investors increased their crypto holdings in 2023, with over 60% planning to increase their holdings further in the next three years. According to research by KPMG, 50% of financial services companies now offer crypto products, with corporate crypto exposure rising from 31% in 2021 to 40% in 2023. This surge of demand is being fueled by regulated investment vehicles like spot Bitcoin ETFs. Such products were unavailable in previous bull cycles. This makes it easier for institutional investors, especially those with long-term investment intentions, to enter the market. Furthermore, the fact that “companies with crypto treasures” are becoming Bitcoin-indexed financial instruments by offering their shares or bonds to investors is a development parallel to corporate strategies emphasized by institutions such as EY and Fidelity. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-11T08:35:22,"EXCLUSIVE: Bitcoin Solaris Launches 72-Hour Price Rollback as XRP News Today Highlights Market Volatility","The post EXCLUSIVE: Bitcoin Solaris Launches 72-Hour Price Rollback as XRP News Today Highlights Market Volatility appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s hard to ignore the timing. As XRP headlines stir up waves of uncertainty across the market, Bitcoin Solaris has fired back with one of the boldest moves in its presale journey. A 72-hour price rollback. That’s right. In a market where most coins are fumbling for direction, BTC-S just handed investors a second chance at early-stage pricing. And the timing? Surgical. XRP Rattles, But Bitcoin Solaris Roars XRP, long the topic of legal suspense and speculative optimism, finds itself in another round of media whirlwinds. The token’s reputation for fast remittances remains intact, but the rollercoaster of court updates has exhausted even its most loyal backers. While XRP’s community waits for clarity, Bitcoin Solaris is delivering action. And that’s why many are pivoting. Meet Bitcoin Solaris: The Wealth Engine Gaining Steam Bitcoin Solaris is not trying to outpace XRP in legal finesse. It’s sprinting toward actual usability and investor upside. The project is building a next-generation blockchain that doesn’t just promise scale, it achieves it. This isn’t another clone. BTC-S is packing serious tech: Dual-layer architecture with Proof of Work and Delegated Proof of Stake. Blazing 10,000 TPS performance with sub-2-second finality. The upcoming Solaris Nova app is for mobile-first mining accessibility. Energy efficiency slashes power consumption by over 99 percent compared to Bitcoin. And while these are big headlines, the real story is how it translates to personal wealth creation. The mining model alone, through the upcoming Solaris Nova app, has already attracted thousands of early participants. It’s simple, adaptive, and engineered for mobile use with energy-smart algorithms that scale according to device strength. One visit to the Bitcoin Solaris mining calculator shows just how powerful this shift is for regular users. The 72-Hour Rollback: One Rare Window Bitcoin Solaris is currently in Phase 11 of its presale. The current price? $11 per token. The launch price? $20. That’s a projected 150 percent return at minimum, assuming no post-launch upside. But for the next 72 hours, Bitcoin Solaris is initiating a Price Rollback. The token will temporarily return to $5. Not a discount. Not a bonus. A true rollback to early pricing, and only for those jumping in now. BTC-S Slashes Its Price Back to $5. Phase 11 Just Flipped the Game This move isn’t just rare. It’s almost unheard of at this stage of a presale, especially when the momentum is already building. And with over 14,150 users already onboard and more than $6.6 million raised, the window is narrow. To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using wallets like Trust Wallet or Metamask for seamless delivery. Buzz From the Crypto World Crypto YouTube is lighting up with reactions to Bitcoin Solaris. Several major influencers have already dropped full breakdowns on why this project could become the next big wealth creation engine. The detailed review by Crypto Show dives into how the technical architecture gives BTC-S a leg up over most L1 competitors. Crypto League called it “the smartest token rollout of the year.” Crypto Vlog focused on the Price Rollback, calling it the most aggressive reward window in recent presale history. The sentiment is spreading across platforms, with Telegram and X communities exploding in real time. Join the conversation on Telegram or follow updates on X . Security, Audits, and Peace of Mind It’s not just hype. Bitcoin Solaris has gone the distance in ensuring credibility. The project has undergone smart contract audits by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , adding another layer of investor confidence. The code is clean, secure, and fully transparent, built to last and adapt. Community-Grown Rewards: The Referral Angle Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just rewarding early adopters through price. It’s doubling down on community through its Double Rewards Referral Program . Referrers earn 5 percent commissions in BTC-S. Referred buyers get 5 percent extra tokens added to their purchase. Everything is automated and credited directly into presale accounts. This structure creates a shared win between participants and helps drive natural growth without artificial incentives. Final Verdict As XRP wrestles with headlines and legal clarity, Bitcoin Solaris is doing something far more potent. It’s a building. It’s expanding. And for the next 72 hours, it’s giving investors a rare shot at early pricing before a major exchange debut. The price rollback is not just a flash deal. It’s a signal. The market is watching. And Bitcoin Solaris is ready to lead.

2025-07-11T08:35:15,"Smarter Web Company boosts Bitcoin holdings to 1,275 BTC as BTC hits new ATH","The Smarter Web Company has added 275 BTC to its treasury, pushing total holdings to 1,275 BTC as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high. The Smarter Web Company, a London-listed Bitcoin treasury company, announced on July 11 the purchase of an additional 275 Bitcoin ( BTC ). The recent acquisition was made at an average price of £79,563 ($108,182) per BTC, totaling approximately £21.88 million. With this purchase, the company’s total Bitcoin holdings have risen to 1,275 BTC, acquired at an average price of £78,516 ($106,719) per BTC, with a total investment of about £100.1 million. This latest purchase follows the company’s July 7 acquisition of 226.42 BTC, which pushed its total holdings to 1,000 BTC , marking a major milestone in its treasury strategy. At that point, the firm reported a year-to-date BTC yield of 26,242%. With the latest addition of 275 BTC, that figure has now climbed to 31,263%, as Bitcoin itself hits a new all-time high of $118,000 , with further upside momentum expected. Additionally, The Smarter Web Company reported a 30-day BTC yield of 497% and confirmed that it has roughly £31 million in cash reserves available for further Bitcoin purchases.

In April this year, the company also adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy and has since actively deployed surplus cash into Bitcoin on a rolling basis, using BTC yield to measure accretive value for shareholders. Through its “10 Year Plan,” the company aims to steadily accumulate BTC as both a hedge against currency debasement and a potential growth asset. The move comes amid growing adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategies, pioneered by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, with more European firms following suit. Meanwhile, alternative corporate crypto treasury strategies involving Ethereum ( ETH ), and more recently Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and Binance Coin ( BNB ), are also beginning to gain traction.

2025-07-11T08:30:56,"Research Predicts $160,000 Bitcoin By EOY—If Treasury Firms Hold","A sweeping new research report by Ben Harvey and Will Clemente III, commissioned by market maker Keyrock, projects that Bitcoin could reach $160,000 by the end of 2025—but only if the capital structure supporting Bitcoin Treasury Companies (BTC-TCs) remains intact. The research, “BTC Treasuries Uncovered: Premiums, Leverage, and the Sustainability of Proxy Exposure,” dissects the capital structures, market impact, and debt profiles of the fast-growing cohort of “Bitcoin Treasury Companies” (BTC-TCs), led by Strategy (the renamed MicroStrategy). The Impact Of Bitcoin Treasury Firms Harvey and Clemente open with a startling figure: “Bitcoin Treasury Companies have accumulated around 725,000 BTC, equivalent to 3.64 percent of the entire BTC supply.” Much of that hoard sits with Strategy’s 597,000-coin trove, but the analysts track more than a dozen follow-on players—from Marathon Digital and Metaplanet to newer entrants such as Twenty One Capital—whose combined exposure now outstrips US spot-ETF holdings by more than half. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is One Candle Away From $141,300 Breakout, Chart Master Warns Yet the report’s headline forecast is explicitly conditional. Keyrock’s bull case assigns a thirty-percent probability that global liquidity remains flush, institutional demand accelerates, and Bitcoin rallies fifty percent past today’s levels, “pushing BTC to over $160 k by EOY.” That outcome rests on the fragile flywheel of net-asset-value premiums: BTC-TC equities still trade, on average, at a seventy-three-percent premium to the dollar value of the coins they custody. Those premiums let boards issue new shares “accretively,” convert sentiment into fresh BTC, and—crucially—service the $33.7 billion in debt and preferred stock the sector has rung up to fund its buying binge. No company illustrates the reflexive loop better than Strategy. Since August 2020, Michael Saylor has driven Bitcoin-per-share (BPS) up eleven-fold, an annualized sixty-three-percent run rate that dwarfs the 6.7 percent CAGR needed to justify the firm’s current ninety-one-percent NAV premium. “If an investor believes that Strategy’s BPS growth rates will hold long-term,” the authors contend, “holding MSTR would be far more beneficial in BTC terms than holding spot BTC.” Still, that calculus assumes the equity premium stays afloat; if sentiment turns, dilution flips from accretive to punitive overnight. Debt maturities pose the next stress point. BTC-TCs owe a wall of convertible notes in 2027-28. Harvey and Clemente calculate that Strategy alone has issued $8.2 billion of the cohort’s $9.5 billion in debt; Marathon follows at $1.3 billion. Most instruments carry zero-to-low coupons and conversion prices well below current share levels, but a deep Bitcoin drawdown could drive equities under those strikes, forcing firms to repay in cash or refinance at far harsher terms. “Since many BTC-TC valuations are tightly correlated to Bitcoin price performance,” the authors warn, “a sharp BTC drawdown could drive down equity value, increasing the risk that conversion thresholds are breached.” Related Reading: Last Time This Happened, Bitcoin Jumped $50,000—Is History Repeating? The report splits the universe into cash-flow-generative names such as Metaplanet, CoinShares, and Boyaa Interactive—each with eight or more quarters of runway—and capital-dependent players like Marathon, Nakamoto, and DeFi Technologies, which could face dilution above three percent per quarter merely to stay solvent if premiums persist. Should those premiums compress, equity issuance “becomes purely dilutive,” and treasury companies could be forced to sell Bitcoin, undermining the proxy thesis that justifies their existence. The Base Case Keyrock’s base case, to which it assigns the highest probability, envisions Bitcoin finishing 2025 around $135,000, with NAV premiums cooling into a thirty-to-sixty-percent range. In that environment, well-managed treasuries still out-perform spot, but the leverage trade loses its shine. The bear scenario—assigned the lowest but non-trivial odds—combines a twenty-percent Bitcoin drawdown with a glut of new treasury listings that flood the market with supply. In that world, premiums vanish, refinancing windows slam shut, and “the entire investment case for BTC-TCs comes under pressure.” Harvey and Clemente do not dismiss the BTC-TC model; rather, they frame it as a high-beta overlay that amplifies both the upside and the solvency risk inherent in Bitcoin itself. They credit Saylor’s “Bitcoin yield” thesis—using premium-funded share issuance to compound coin holdings—as a demonstrably effective strategy to date, but caution that it relies on a delicate equilibrium of bullish sentiment, cheap capital, and meticulous execution. “The premium to NAV is of the utmost importance here,” the study concludes, “assuming a BTC-TC doesn’t have a core operating business that can cover debt payments, or is entirely free of debt payments altogether.” Whether Bitcoin can sprint to $160,000 by 31 December hinges less on hash-rate projections or macro modeling than on the continued faith of equity investors willing to pay a dollar-fifty for a dollar of embedded BTC. If those investors blink—if premiums fade or convertible maturities collide with a broad risk-off shift—the leverage that has propelled treasury companies to date could flip, turning “one of the best performing equities on the planet” into the market’s most crowded exit. For now, Keyrock’s research leaves readers with a simple countdown: hold the line, and the path to price discovery remains intact; lose it, and the proxy trade could unwind long before the New Year’s fireworks. At press time, BTC traded at $117,788.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, Robinhood’s U.S. staking launch continues to push Solana. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $163.62 with an intraday gain of 3.5%.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. With the $166.56 resistance now tested, SOL could trend higher if momentum holds. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-11T08:29:39,"Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest Sells $6.5M Coinbase and $5.8M Robinhood Amid Bitcoin Rally","Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest sold $6.5 million worth of Coinbase Global shares and $5.8 million of Robinhood shares on Thursday, even as both stocks rose alongside bitcoin’s recent surge. Key Takeaways: Ark Invest sold $6.5 million of Coinbase and $5.8 million of Robinhood shares despite both stocks rising. Coinbase and Robinhood stocks rallied alongside bitcoin reaching a new high above $118,000. Robinhood faces regulatory scrutiny in the US amid plans to launch blockchain-based stock tokens in Europe. According to Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) filings , the fund offloaded 16,627 Coinbase shares and 58,504 Robinhood shares. It also sold roughly $1.7 million in Block Inc. stock. Coinbase’s stock climbed 4% to close at $388.96, while Robinhood gained 4.4%, finishing at $98.70. Block’s shares slipped 0.36% to $68.76. Coinbase and Robinhood Stocks Rise as Bitcoin Hits $118K The rally in Coinbase and Robinhood stocks came amid bitcoin reaching new all-time highs, hitting $118,080 early Friday — up 6.4% in 24 hours. Ethereum also jumped 8.5% to $3,011. Coinbase recently announced a partnership with Perplexity AI, an AI-driven search engine, to launch a real-time crypto data service. The move represents a growing trend of collaboration between blockchain firms and artificial intelligence companies. Meanwhile, Robinhood is engaged in discussions with European regulators regarding its tokenization initiative, which aims to offer blockchain-based stock tokens. BREAKING: Ark Invest just trimmed its crypto-related holdings! Amidst a booming crypto market, Cathie Wood's firm sold $6.5M in Coinbase ($COIN) & $5.8M in Robinhood ($HOOD) shares. Are they taking profits or rebalancing? — Chenna kesavan (@kesavantcm) July 11, 2025 However, Robinhood faces scrutiny in the U.S., as Florida’s attorney general opened an investigation into the company’s crypto division over claims it marketed itself as the “least expensive way to purchase crypto.” So far, ARK is the only major Circle investor to significantly reduce exposure post-IPO. As reported, ARK Invest begun cashing in on its stake in stablecoin issuer Circle just 11 days after the company’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The firm sold 342,658 shares of Circle (CRCL) on June 16 and another $44.7 million worth on June 17 , according to trade disclosures. Other backers, including BlackRock, reportedly eyeing a 10% stake in the company, have not disclosed any sales. Executives at Circle, however, have sold portions of their holdings. CEO Jeremy Allaire, co-founder Sean Neville, and CFO Jeremy Fox-Geen were listed in the prospectus as planning to sell 8%, 11%, and 11% of their holdings, respectively. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs Drive Record Inflows Bitcoin spot ETFs recorded their second-largest daily inflow of $1.18 billion on July 10, driving Bitcoin’s price to a new high of $116,664 before briefly surpassing $118,450. The cumulative net inflows into Bitcoin spot ETFs have now exceeded $51 billion, underscoring strong and sustained institutional demand. Seven out of 12 Bitcoin funds reported net inflows on the same day, with BlackRock’s IBIT leading at $448.49 million and Fidelity’s FBTC following closely with $324.34 million. Ethereum spot ETFs also posted significant inflows, totaling $383 million, marking their second-highest daily record. Ether ETFs have accumulated $5.10 billion in total net inflows so far. E Crypto analyst Rachael Lucas described this trend as a “defining moment” in the institutional adoption of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. She emphasized that the influx of capital is driven by asset managers, corporate treasuries, and wealth platforms, not retail speculation, signaling a more mature and sustained phase of crypto investment.

2025-07-11T08:26:26,"AI Forecasts Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price for July 31, 2025","Shiba Inu (SHIB), one of the most popular digital assets, has continued to gain attention in the cryptocurrency market. With SHIB currently trading at $0.00001354, reflecting a 14.99% increase from last week, market participants are increasingly curious about its future trajectory. To address this curiosity, we asked ChatGPT for a prediction of SHIB’s price by July 31, and the AI-powered Large Language Model (LLM) gave a detailed breakdown with optimistic projections. Projected Price Range and Most Likely Scenario According to ChatGPT, SHIB’s price by late July 2025 is projected to fall within a range of $0.0000145 to $0.0000350. The model identifies a most likely price point of $0.0000217, representing a moderate bullish case. Although this target is lower than Google Gemini’s recent forecast , its upper boundary suggests it could surpass Gemini’s target. ChatGPT explains, “This assumes SHIB continues its steady burn mechanisms , utility improvements (like Shibarium adoption), and Bitcoin leading a mild bull run in mid‑2025.” The upper boundary of the range ($0.0000350) reflects an optimistic scenario where the SHIB ecosystem achieves greater adoption and benefits from a broader altcoin rally. Conversely, the lower boundary ($0.0000145) represents a more conservative outcome, assuming limited ecosystem progress and muted market conditions. However, ChatGPT expects growth despite the outcome. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Factors Supporting the Forecast The forecast is based on three key factors: token supply reduction, market cycle trends, and utility expansion. First, ChatGPT highlights SHIB’s ongoing burn initiatives, noting that “By mid‑2025, SHIB’s burn rate could eliminate tens of trillions of tokens if Shibarium and community burns stay consistent.” Shiba Inu recently unveiled a new mode in its Shiba Eternity game that could accelerate burns even more. However, ChatGPT cautions that burning tokens alone may not trigger extreme price movements without concurrent demand growth. Second, the timing of the next market cycle is expected to play a role. Crypto markets historically experience bullish trends following Bitcoin’s halving events. 2025 is the post-halving year, which is historically bullish for altcoins, and SHIB could ride this wave to higher targets. Third, potential utility expansion within the SHIB ecosystem could influence prices. Developments such as Shibarium, which recently hit a milestone record , the SHIB Metaverse, SHIB’s AI initiatives, and broader payment use cases are seen as catalysts for additional demand.

2025-07-11T08:17:54,"Short liquidations hit $1 billion as Bitcoin trades at $118k","Short liquidations reached over $1B as BTC charted new records above $118,000. For the year to date, this is the biggest short liquidation event, mostly affecting BTC and ETH markets. The most recent price action for BTC liquidated short positions accrued all the way to $118,000. In the past 24 hours, BTC short liquidations reached 655.46M, with remaining short liquidity all the way to $118,800. The new price record expanded the year-on-year growth, as BTC spent July 2024 with sideways trading, at around $55,000. Most of the liquidations happened late on July 10, during US trading hours. In general, traders remained more cautious in 2025, rarely causing significant liquidations. The recent rally remained mostly unaffected by the weekly options expiry on Deribit, as the contracts expired under current market prices. Short liquidations reached the highest level for 2025, with a significant batch liquidated at the $112,000 level late on Thursday. | Source: CoinGlass . The current levels of over $1B in 24 hours are an anomaly, mostly tied to the exuberant market move for BTC. Short liquidations reached over $965M, while long liquidations reached just 10% of the total. The biggest single wallet liquidation was for $88.55M on HTX. The near-vertical rally was also caused by a batch of 5,000 BTC getting liquidated on Binance. One of the big waves of liquidations happened as BTC decisively breached the previous all-time high above $112,000, liquidating up to $340M. Above those levels, traders are yet to allocate liquidity, and a short squeeze to $120,000 becomes less probable. BTC traders are rebuilding liquidity rapidly despite the liquidations, with derivative open interest back to $38B . Futures volumes for BTC remained above $59B in the past 24 hours, once again getting ahead of Ethereum (ETH) activity . BTC dominance remains near its 2021 levels at 62.6%, still getting more attention than ETH. At the same time, ETH managed to recover the $3,000 level, with $258M in short liquidations for the past 24 hours. BTC rally causes top whale liquidations For some traders, the BTC rally was nearing its end, and some of the high-profile traders reopened short positions. Both James Wynn and @qwatio , two of the most watched whales, set up short positions just before the rally. Wynn got liquidated for a small 40X leveraged short on BTC, as the leading coin did not backtrack from its peak levels. James Wynn Again 🚨 @JamesWynnReal LIQUIDATED Again , He Deposite $27,555 $USDC into Hyperliquid And Claimed $3960 Referral Reward, then went all in with 40X $BTC short Position, The Position Got fully LIQUIDATED right now 😓 pic.twitter.com/URGZe9LhGA — Mr.Bull🚀 (@Danameer12) July 11, 2025 The other whale, @qwatio, currently closed all perpetual futures positions. The Hyperliquid whale liquidations were mostly for show, as the positions were created shortly before the BTC rally. Wynn and @qwatio shorted BTC while the market still flashed a ‘greed’ indicator , turning the short positions into a publicity stunt. However, @qwatio has accrued real losses from attempts to short BTC in the past weeks, with overall losses of $16.72M . Leveraged trading becomes riskier as BTC remains in price discovery territory, aiming for milestone prices. For now, the trading profile has not shifted to extreme greed, as other days of market frenzy remain a possibility. The recent BTC trading and accumulation activity have mostly left retail behind, and reflect the decisions of institutions and whales. BTC is once again seen as a safe haven asset, though combined with the potential for unlimited upside and price discovery.

2025-07-11T08:03:08,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Back on Their Feet! But There's a Problem: ""A $5 Billion Options Earthquake Will Happen in BTC and ETH Today!""","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) has been racing from record high to record high over the past two days. At this point, BTC surged above $118,000, while Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins also experienced significant gains. As the bullish mood in the market continues, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. According to data for the second week of July, $4.3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $710 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on July 11 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 1.05, the maximum loss point is $108,000 and the notional value is $4.3 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 1.11, a maximum loss point of $2,600, and a notional value of $710 million. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin's price following the $4.3 billion options expiration on July 11th. While the maximum pain point is at $108,000 for BTC and $2,600 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. Greeks.live analysts stated that the rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum in a short period of time points to a major bull market. Analysts said that with such a large short-term rally, the options market is still far from FOMO and institutional investors are hesitant to buy and consider the reality of the rally. “The smell of a major bull market, with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high and Ethereum briefly returning to the crucial $3,000 mark, is a rare improvement in market sentiment.

2025-07-11T08:00:54,"Bitcoin Hit ATH Right After Retail Gave Up—Classic Contrarian Move?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin retail investors had been showing an exodus in the leadup to the breakout to a new all-time high (ATH). Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders Saw A Decrease Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment , there has been a drop in Bitcoin retail investors recently. The metric of interest here is the “ Total Amount of Holders ,” which measures, as its name suggests, the total number of addresses on the BTC network that are carrying some non-zero balance. When the value of this metric rises, it can be due to a number of reasons. New investors joining the network and old ones who had sold earlier returning both naturally lead to an uptick in the indicator. Similarly, existing users creating multiple wallets to manage their holdings or for a purpose like privacy also adds to the trend. In general, all of these factors can be assumed to simultaneously be at play to some degree, which means that a net amount of adoption can be considered to be occurring whenever the Total Amount of Holders registers an increase. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders has recently been on the way down, indicating that a net amount of holders have been liquidating their wallets, potentially to exit the market. Which type of investors are these likely to be? The answer is retail. These holders massively outweigh the larger entities like whales in population, so the trend in the Total Amount of Holders tends to represent the behavior of the retail investors. The latest exodus from the small hands has led into BTC’s breakout to a new ATH beyond the $113,000 level. From the chart, it’s visible this is not actually an unusual trend, as past periods of selling from the retail cohort have also preceded bullish price action in the cryptocurrency. As Santiment notes, When retail shows FUD (whether through fear or impatience), these are usually prime spots for smart money to move in and accumulate. This time has been no different. This pattern is another case of the Bitcoin market being probable to move in the direction that the crowd least expects. An excess of fear usually tends to lead into bullish reversals, while overhype may result in tops. It now remains to be seen how the Total Amount of Holders trend would shift now that BTC is rallying. A sharp reversal in the metric could naturally imply the retail crowd is now feeling Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO).

2025-07-11T07:59:35,"Bitcoin ETF inflows hit billions as BTC smashes new all-time highs","The crypto giant’s latest price surge is fueling a wave of demand and trading activity across U.S. spot exchange-traded funds. Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows on July 10, 2025, according to SoSoValue data . The numbers marked the funds’ sixth consecutive day of positive flows and the largest single-day inflow in months, a level last seen in November 2024. Among the top performers was BlackRock’s IBIT, which once again led the charge with approximately $448.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely with $324.34 million, and Ark 21Shares with $268.7 million. Other issuers, including Bitwise, VanEck, and Valkyrie, saw smaller inflows under $100 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC moved the opposite way, logging $40.2 million in outflows. You might also like: BlackRock fuels BTC stash with another $126M, closes in on Satoshi as ETF booms IBIT also led all 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs in trading activity by a wide margin, pulling in $5 billion in volume, twice its daily average and up from $3.5 billion the day before. The strong influx of funds came alongside fresh momentum in Bitcoin’s price. On the same day, BTC ( BTC ) extended the upward trend it kicked off earlier in the week, shattering multiple all-time highs. Bitcoin’s price movement | Source: crypto.news Trading over $118,100 at the time of writing, the crypto market giant is up roughly 6.3% in the past 24 hours, sharpening positive investor sentiment. But what’s driving the surge? Why Bitcoin is climbing The bullish setup in BTC is powered by a mix of rising institutional interest and supportive macro conditions, reversing the bearish mood that earlier gripped the markets. More financial institutions are betting on Bitcoin’s long-term reserve value. Q2 saw over 159,100 BTC purchased across 125 public companies, which now collectively hold 847,000 bitcoins, worth just under $100 billion at current prices. Like the ETFs, these institutional inflows provide more stable momentum for Bitcoin’s performance than traditional rally drivers like retail interest and market hype. Macro economic backdrop is contributing to the rally. The U.S. economy is showing unexpected strength, with June nonfarm payrolls adding 147,000 jobs and the unemployment rate falling to 4.1%. This data prompted traders to rethink the pace of Fed rate cuts, with odds of a July cut dropping to just 5%, down sharply from 24% earlier in the week, per CME FedWatch. Bitcoin’s rally also coincides with a rising stock market. The Dow Jones rose 270 points, or 0.61%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.28%, signaling broader risk appetite across markets. Analysts expect the current trend to continue and forecast that the combination of positive factors will establish a stronger foothold above $118K. According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, the current move is likely just an “interim high,” echoing broader market predictions that see Bitcoin on a path toward $200,000.

The breakout comes as ETF inflows resume and institutional interest picks up, supported by the prospect of Federal Reserve rate cuts in Q3. Technicals now show BTC entering a high-momentum phase, with potential targets around $120,000 and beyond. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, Bitcoin price has cleanly broken out of a broad descending channel that held price action between $100,000 and $111,000. The breakout candle on July 10 came with strong body expansion and follow-through volume, confirming bullish intent. BTC has also reclaimed the 20/50 EMA cluster and is trading well above the Bull Market Support Band, currently near $109,250–$108,420. This upside resolution has invalidated the prior range and pushed BTC into a new structural leg. With $111,000 now flipped into support, the broader trend bias has turned aggressively bullish.

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025. Table of Contents Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano Price Today Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Cardano Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis FAQs Cardano Price Today Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $ 0.71122915 12.62% Market Cap $ 25,169,118,626.3386 Trading Volume $ 1,646,671,781.5338 Circulating Supply 35,388,198,743.3986 All-time High $3.10 on 02nd Sept 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on 02nd Oct 2017 Cardano Price Prediction for July 2025 The Cardano price is trapped in a long bleeding range in the entire H1 2025, but showed signs of recovery in late June, triggered by the ceasefire in the Iran-Israel-US short-term war. Over the last 20 days, it has recovered nearly 22% from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector during the second week of July, ADA price has been uplifted to $0.63 with growing hopes of an ADA ETF and global sentiment rising as BTC jumped beyond its June high. ADA is now inching towards the range’s upper border, and a sustained bullish momentum could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch in July is $0.72. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $0.86, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.10 by July end. Moreover, in the past 30-day span, Spot volume has peaked at $1.44 billion, daily active addresses have increased, and addresses holding between “10 million ADA to 100 million ADA” coins have peaked at 13.13 billion from a low of 12.81 billion. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum. However, failure to stay above $0.60 could send ADA back to $0.55, with a deeper decline possible toward $0.40. Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends. Scenario Potential Low Average Price Potential High Without ETF Approval $0.85 $1.10 $1.25 With ETF Approval + Retail Surge $1.20 $1.65 $2.05 Bullish Breakout (with ETF & macro support) $1.50 $2.05 $2.80 Cardano (ADA) Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2026 2.75 3.00 3.25 2027 4.50 4.75 5.00 2028 5.25 5.50 5.75 2029 6.75 7.25 7.75 2030 9.00 9.75 10.25 This table, based on historical movements, shows ADA prices to reach $10.25 by 2030 based on compounding market cap each year.

2025-07-11T07:51:07,"New Bitcoin Record At $118K: On-Chain Clues Reveal This Rally Is Different","Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to a fresh all-time high above $ 118,000, after gaining more than 6% over the past day. Despite this, on-chain data suggests the current rally remains far from overheated and instead hints at further growth potential. Room for Further Growth During the previous peaks in March and December 2024, the MVRV ratio climbed above 2.7 as speculation intensified. The current high, on the other hand, comes with a more moderate reading of 2.2 and reflects a steadier market environment. According to CryptoQuant, UTXO data show that short-term holders (under one month) now make up just 15% of the market. This is down from 30% during previous highs, which indicates limited new capital inflows and a cautious investor profile. At the same time, the SOPR for short-term holders means that recent buyers are not aggressively selling, but are keeping sell-side activity muted. The Miner Position Index (MPI) also continues its downward trend, which points to restrained selling activity as many mining firms opt to accumulate Bitcoin rather than liquidate. Such behavior contrasts sharply with past cycles when rising prices led to rapid distribution as spot and derivatives traders rushed to exit. Instead, this rally appears to be backed by strategic adoption from nation-states and corporations, and therefore, suggests the possibility of a structurally different bull cycle. CryptoQuant went on to explain, “As a result, analyzing on-chain data today requires deeper and more contextual interpretation, rather than relying solely on repetitive historical patterns. Because this recent breakout to a new high occurred without signs of overheating, there is solid potential for further price appreciation in the mid-to-long term.” This pattern of cautious optimism extends further. Data reveals that even amid the price surge, traders remain hesitant to move coins back to exchanges. Traders Are Holding Tight Bitcoin has posted almost a 20% price rise since its June 22nd local bottom, yet traders are not rushing to move coins back onto exchanges, according to Santiment. Instead, holders continue to shift Bitcoin into self-custody wallets. In the past four months alone, exchange balances have dropped by 315,830 BTC, which is a 21% decline. The five-year picture is even more significant. Since July 2020, 1.88 million Bitcoin have moved away from exchanges, thereby reducing balances by 61%. With fewer coins on exchanges, sudden mass sell-offs become less likely. This means that long-term investors are choosing personal storage over potential short-term trades.

2025-07-11T07:47:50,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.58476866 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction July XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.58476866 5.41% Market cap $ 152,677,600,987.41 Circulating Supply 59,068,187,926.00 Trading Volume $ 7,275,513,430.0586 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction July In H1 2025, the XRP price action shifted from a decline to a consolidation phase. In Q2, after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May, it fell to hold above a key swing low support at $2.10. The upside potential has been limited due to worsening geopolitical conditions Many anticipated a catalyst on June 16th with a favorable lawsuit update, but it resulted in a 60-day pause in appeals. On June 17th, the SEC delayed Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF amid geopolitical tensions. The U.S. bombing of Iranian nuclear sites during the third weekend of June shook market sentiment completely, XRP dipping to $1.94, but a ceasefire in the fourth week helped the market rebound. Source: Tradingview On June 23rd onwards, XRP climbed from $1.94, rising over 15% after the ceasefire announcement, turning it into a short-term battle. The fourth week was full of bullish developments, as Ripple’s CEO announced on June 28th that they would drop the cross-appeal against the SEC. Experts now expect, if the SEC also drops its appeal, it would formally conclude a four-year conflict. Investor sentiment has improved, showing less panic in short-term among traders. A strong “buy-the-dip” mentality has emerged amid the chaos. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s recent decision a turning point, increasing the odds for XRP ETF approval, with BlackRock potentially entering soon . Meanwhile, another positive development in July reveals that Ripple has applied for a U.S. banking license , enhancing credibility. The market sentiment has shifted, and with a wave of optimism sweeping through in July, the upper border of the falling wedge has been breached near the key $2.40 resistance. This surge was fueled by strong momentum as Bitcoin crossed the $112,000 mark , reaching a new all-time high of $117,985. Also, a short-term golden cross has formed between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs in the XRP price chart, which signals robust momentum. As XRP crypto approaches mid-May’s peak, a break above $2.60 could ignite a rally toward $2.95 in the short term, with the potential to retest the all-time high of $3.40 later in July. Source: Tradingview The recent 20-day momentum is supported by increasing investor interest and positive developments, leading to a rise in exchange outflows. Technical indicators on the XRP price chart reveal a spike in money inflows, pushing the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) value up to 0.19 from this week’s low of 0.04. Meanwhile, the MACD and Awesome Oscillator (AO) histograms have turned bullish, suggesting a sustained short-term rally. However, caution is warranted as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 74, indicating overheated conditions. This suggests that XRP may need to consolidate to cool down before making another upward move in the short term. If XRP price fails to generate enough bullish momentum, it could retest the strong support at $2.40. A failure to hold above this level could lead to a flash crash, pushing XRP’s price lower. In the event that selling pressure resumes, the critical support at $2.10, which aligns with the 200-day EMA, becomes essential. Losing this support could result in a decline to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T07:32:02,"XRP Price Prediction as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High","The post XRP Price Prediction as Bitcoin Hits New All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP looks bullish right now . In the last seven days, the token has surged by 15.7%, with a 7% gain in the past 24 hours alone, pushing its price to $2.59. This upward momentum is turning heads across the crypto market, with analysts now hinting that $3 could be the next major target. CasiTrades, a well-known crypto analyst, shared a post on X noting that XRP is defying short-term bearish indicators and may be gearing up for a significant breakout. His analysis points to a larger move building under the surface despite bearish signals flashing on short-term timeframes. XRP Market Overview: Strong Momentum in Q3 2025 So far, 2025 has been an eventful year for XRP. In Q1, the price saw only a minor gain of 0.45%. Q2 showed stronger momentum with a 7.12% increase. But it’s Q3 where XRP has truly come alive—so far, the token has jumped 15.7%, with most of the rally coming after July 8. At the start of this month, XRP traded at $2.17. For the first week of July, it remained within a narrow range of $2.17 to $2.27. However, since July 8, the price has climbed steeply, gaining over 14%. In the last hour alone, XRP added another 1%, confirming strong short-term momentum. XRP Breaks Out: Analyst Sees Little Resistance Ahead According to CasiTrades, XRP has ignored signs of market exhaustion typically found on the 1-hour chart, indicating that a much larger move could be forming. He explains that XRP’s ability to push higher, despite bearish technical signals, is a sign of strength. Currently trading at $2.59, XRP is just 4% below the next key resistance level at $2.69. CasiTrades highlights that there is very little resistance between these levels, suggesting the token could reach $2.69 quickly if the bullish momentum continues. What’s the Ideal Entry Point for XRP? While the breakout is exciting, CasiTrades advises caution when chasing pumps. He recommends waiting for a solid pullback, ideally to the $2.45 zone. Historically, XRP has retraced to the 0.236 Fibonacci level after new highs, and this area could offer a low-risk entry. However, once XRP reaches $2.69, there are two likely outcomes. The price could either retrace to $2.45 or break above resistance and rally toward $3 or beyond. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025) , XRP Bull Run Ahead From a technical standpoint, XRP is showing strong momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 74.12, indicating the token is overbought. But XRP continues to trade above all its major moving averages, including the 50-day ($2.22), 100-day ($2.21), and 200-day ($2.36) lines. Despite the rally, volatility remains relatively low with an Average True Range (ATR) of 0.1021. This means the price action is steady and trending, rather than erratic, often a good sign in the early stages of a longer move. Conclusion XRP is clearly in breakout mode, outperforming much of the crypto market this month. With strong technicals, growing momentum, and minimal resistance ahead, all eyes are on the $2.69 level. If XRP clears that barrier, the road to $3 may come faster than expected. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-11T07:19:45,"Bitcoin surges past $118K all-time high without overheating as on-chain data signals more upside","Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $118,399 early on July 11 during Asian trading hours, marking another major milestone in the ongoing bull market. Yet, unlike past euphoric peaks, this breakout appears fundamentally calmer and more structurally sound. In a June 11 analysis , CryptoQuant contributor Avocado Onchain noted that several important indicators point to the market not being overheated. The MVRV ratio, which compares Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) market value to its realized value, currently stands at 2.2. That’s well below the overheated levels of 2.7 seen during the March and December 2024 highs, pointing to relatively moderate speculation. There’s also been a noticeable shift in investor behavior. During earlier bull market tops, short-term holders, wallets that held BTC for less than a month, made up around 30% of the market. Today, that number has dropped to 15%. Fewer short-term players often means less volatility and a lower risk of sudden selloffs. Similar conclusions can be drawn from other indicators. There appears to be little sell pressure based on the lack of a significant spike in the Short-Term Holder SOPR, which measures profit-taking among recent buyers. You might also like: Here’s why Bitcoin hit an all-time high and can run to $120k Meanwhile, miners, often early sellers during market tops, are staying relatively quiet. The Miner Position Index has been drifting lower, and some mining firms appear to be accumulating rather than selling. Retail investors are also missing from the picture, according to another CryptoQuant analysis . Their “Spot Retail Activity Through Trading Frequency Surge” metric remains in the gray zone, a signal that retail traders have yet to re-enter the market. Retail frenzy has historically been associated with late-stage bull market peaks. Given that institutions and exchange-traded funds are still driving the trend, the current absence might indicate that the top is still a long way off. Looking ahead, short-term support levels may offer clues about where the market heads next. The $106,500 and $101,200 zones, which represent the average cost basis for holders who purchased Bitcoin in the previous one to three months, are being watched by analysts. The upward trend may continue if Bitcoin maintains its position above those levels. A drop below could trigger short-term selling but might also bring in new buyers. Overall, this rally appears to be more sustainable than previous ones. Bitcoin may have more room to rise without the chaos that frequently occurs near the top, as long as there is steady institutional interest, calm on-chain signals, and retail still largely on the sidelines.

2025-07-11T07:10:40,"Cryptocurrency rally: why did crypto go up today?","The cryptocurrency rally accelerated this week, with Bitcoin nearing the crucial resistance level of $120,000 and the Fear and Greed Index moving into the greed zone of 67. This article answers a common question: “why did crypto go up today?” Chinese crypto trading hopes The first main catalyst for the ongoing cryptocurrency rally is the optimism that Chinese companies will get involved in the industry. This optimism pushed most brokerage stocks to their highest levels in months. Further, a Shanghai regulator said that it would explore and intensify research on the industry. This is a significant development, as China banned cryptocurrencies a few years ago. Therefore, analysts expect that the country will ease rules for investing and trading these coins. Such a move will lead to higher volume since most of the Chinese trading happens “illegally.” Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP ETF demand The other main reason why crypto is going up today is the ongoing surge in demand for cryptocurrency ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs had a whopping $1 billion in inflows on Thursday, bringing the cumulative figure to over $51.3 billion. Similarly, Ethereum ETFs have over $383 million in inflows, pushing the cumulative figure to over $5.1 billion for the first time on record. BlackRock’s ETHA ETF has over $5.6 billion in assets, while Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH have over $3.2 billion and $1.5 billion. The other top crypto ETFs have also added more assets in the past few months. For example, the Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP (XXRP) has over $189 million in assets, while the newly launched REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) has added $61 million in assets. These numbers indicate a substantial demand for these coins among investors. Analysts expect the SEC will approve several altcoin ETFs, including XRP, Solana, Bonk, and Dogecoin. Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows are happening at a time when data shows that their supply on exchanges are in a strong downward trend. As such, high demand and low supplies will often lead to higher supplies. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts Cryptocurrency prices are also going up because of the rising hopes that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates later this year. In a statement on Thursday, Christopher Waller , a member of the Fed’s Board of Governors, said that he supported cutting interest rates later this month. Donald Trump has called for the bank to cut rates by 300 basis points. This is notable since Trump is set to appoint the next Fed Chair who will replace Jerome Powell when his term ends. Powell may decide to either quit or remain at the Fed, where he will serve as governor. Trump will likely select a Fed Chair who will commit to drop interest rates sharply. He has even hinted that he may appoint a Fed Chair long in advance in a move to undermine Powell. Risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies often do well when the Fed is cutting rates. Bitcoin price strong technicals BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Crypto is going up because of Bitcoin’s strong technicals. It has formed a cup-and-handle pattern and a bullish flag. Also, it has remained above all moving averages, while top oscillators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD have all rallied. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance level at $150,000. Such a move will likely lead to more crypto market rally.

2025-07-11T07:09:26,"Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025)","The post Why Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Prices are Up Today (11th July, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has staged a powerful rally today, with the total market cap climbing over 5.24% in the past 24 hours to $3.65 trillion. Trading volumes exploded by 47.14%, reaching a staggering $208.23 billion, signaling massive participation behind the move. While the Fear & Greed Index holds at a neutral 67, momentum is clearly favoring the bulls. Why is the Crypto Market Up Today? We had numerous fundamental drivers today, ranging from record-breaking ETF inflows to aggressive short liquidations. Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $1.17 billion in net inflows on July 10 alone, while Ethereum continued to benefit from the momentum around its staking ecosystem and ETF developments. Meanwhile, marketers are closely watching the upcoming “Crypto Week” in the U.S. Congress on July 14, which could shape long-term regulatory clarity. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Bitcoin has led the charge with an impressive breakout to a new all-time high of $118,339.82, posting a 6.11% gain over the past 24 hours. The price pierced through the resistance at $117,000, on the back of aggressive short liquidations worth $570 million. This move triggered a cascade of stop losses and short covers, pushing BTC sharply higher. The record $1.2 billion in ETF inflows added fuel to the rally, effectively tightening the available supply on exchanges. Technically, the daily chart reveals an ascending triangle breakout with strong volume confirmation. If this trend continues, Bitcoin could test the $121,000 to $122,500 range in the next 24 hours. That being said, we cannot rule out the immediate support near $114,800, which could act as a retest level before another leg up. Check out our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Ethereum, too, saw significant upside today, climbing 8.76% to trade at $3,024.90. ETH saw a 32.7% jump in daily volume, hitting $37.26 billion. The recent rally was triggered in part by short covering, as the token reclaimed levels above the $2,600 “max pain” point from recent options expiry. Additionally, on-chain data reveals that whales accumulated $358 million worth of ETH in the past 24 hours, a strong sign of growing institutional confidence. Looking at the chart, Ethereum is breaking out of a cup-and-handle pattern on the 4-hour chart. With momentum on its side and RSI still below extreme overbought territory, ETH appears poised to test the $3,120 to $3,180 zone in the near term. Support is now seen at $2,920, which was a key resistance flipped into support. Also read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Ripple XRP Price Prediction: XRP is no laggard either, climbing 6.55% on the day to trade at $2.58, supported by strong buying interest and a surge in trading volume to $6.83 billion. The main catalyst appears to be growing optimism around a final resolution in the long-running Ripple vs. SEC case. Reports hint at the final terms of the settlement being reached, boosting investor confidence. Technically speaking, XRP price broke above the key resistance level of $2.50 with increasing volume, triggering a bullish flag breakout. The MACD indicator on the hourly chart has flipped bullish, and price structure suggests continuation toward the $2.75 to $2.80 level in the short term. Support now rests at $2.45, which is likely to attract dip-buyers if the price pulls back. FAQs Why are crypto prices up today? The Crypto prices are rising today due to a combination of record ETF inflows, over $1 billion in short liquidations, whale accumulation in ETH, and optimism ahead of U.S. regulatory discussions set for July 14. Will Bitcoin price break out to another all-time high? Yes, if the bullish momentum sustains, BTC price could eye another ATH above $121k. How much is 1 XRP for?

According to a report by the Inner City Press, a New York federal judge revised Truglia’s initial 18-month sentence to 12 years on July 10 after he failed to pay the mandated $20 million in restitution to his victim, crypto investor and promoter Michael Terpin. The new sentence exceeds federal guidelines by a significantly large margin, more than eight times the original sentence. The law recommends an extended sentencing to be between 51 and 63 months. However in Truglia’s case, he allegedly moved his stolen funds around and converted them to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and took a cut for himself, thereby violating his terms. A damning video of him speaking in a masked voice about how he would still get to keep his stolen crypto even after being in prison for 10 years convinced the judge to extend it to 12 years in prison. “If ten years are okay, I’ll be sentencing you to twelve [years],” said Senior Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.

He would then be returned to the Southern District of New York courthouse the following day and transported to a correctional center in Essex. Nicholas Truglia’s arrest chronology Nicholas Truglia was initially released from prison after serving 12 months of his sentence, under the condition that he had to repay the $20 million in damages to Michael Terpin. However, he failed to do so even after his release. Truglia was arrested again in May 2023 for allegedly violating terms of his supervised release after evidence surfaced of him moving around his crypto funds and purchasing luxury goods. Despite a contempt order, Truglia was released in November 2024 after the presiding judge allowed him to roam free as long as he was committed to paying his $20 million restitution. Instead he failed to do so and retained approximately $673,000 from cuts made. Back in December 2022, then-25-year-old Nicholas Truglia was sentenced to prison for 18 months for his participation in a SIM swap crypto scam that stole over $20 million worth of cryptocurrency from crypto investor Michael Terpin. He was able to gain access to the victim’s emails and other accounts by hijacking the Terpin’s phone number by replacing it with a SIM card he controlled.

2025-07-11T07:00:37,"Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs Above December 2024 Levels, Here’s What Happened Last Time","The Bitcoin open interest has risen rapidly once again, with the price pushing above previous peaks to new all-time highs. The BTC price has also stayed over the $100,000 mark for an extended period of time, triggering a new wave of confidence that the cryptocurrency has found its bottom. This has led to crypto traders making their bets and driving the open interest up, pushing it back above December 2024 levels and May 2025 peaks. Bitcoin Open Interest Crosses $70 Billion Again Back in December 2024, the Bitcoin open interest had recorded a new milestone after the volume rose to over $70 billion, marking a new all-time high at the time. The Bitcoin price had also risen sharply at this time and was able to hit $100,000 for the first time in history, triggering even more interest in the asset. Related Reading: Last Crash Before The Surge: Why Bitcoin Is Set To Drop Below $107,000 However, once both the price and the open interest hit these milestones, it wasn’t long before the shorters began to take over the market. The Bitcoin price quickly plummeted back down below $100,000, and over the next few months, open interest would crash back down to the $40 billion territory, resulting in a 40% loss by May 2025. Now, once again, the Bitcoin open interest has crossed the $70 billion mark, sitting close to the $77 billion peak recorded back in May 2025, data from Coinglass shows. In the same vein, the BTC price has been able to maintain above $100,000 and has hit a new all-time high of $117,000. Going by historical performance, it is likely that the Bitcoin price will continue to rise from here, but this break to new all-time highs could carry bearish implications. This is because it is possible that the trend from December 2024 could play out once again. If this happens, then the Bitcoin price could retrace after hitting new highs, an expected correction as shorts pile up. BTC Price Risks Another Crash As the Bitcoin open interest continues to rise and the price has already broken out to new highs, the expectations of a downtrend have become stronger. NewsBTC reported that crypto analyst FriendlyRox expects the Bitcoin price to crash by almost 50%, putting the target as low as $60,000 by the time it’s done. Related Reading: Pundit Says XRP’s Rise To $1,000 Will Happen A Lot Sooner Than Anticipated Crypto analyst and market expert Capo of Crypto has also joined the train, predicting a notable crash event that will send Bitcoin below $100,000 and obliterating altcoins in the process.

2025-07-11T06:46:01,"Here’s why Hyperlane price has surged over 100% today","Hyperlane’s native token, HYPER, extended its rally for a second consecutive day following its listing on two premier South Korean exchanges. According to data from crypto.news, Hyperlane ( HYPER ) rallied to an all-time high of $0.66 on July 11, morning Asian time, before stabilizing near $0.61 at the time of writing. This marks a 100% gain in the past 24 hours and a cumulative increase of over 450% over the last two trading sessions. The rally unfolded in a markedly high-volume trading environment, with daily turnover exceeding $4.1 billion, an increase of more than 3,000% from prior averages. Concurrently, open interest in HYPER futures contracts climbed 147% to a record $186.5 million, indicating growing speculative interest and positioning from derivatives traders anticipating further upside. This sharp price appreciation is primarily attributed to the token’s listing in KRW trading pairs on both Upbit and Bithumb . While HYPER had previously been available in BTC and USDT pairs on Upbit since late May, the earlier listings led to only modest gains . The new KRW pairings, however, seem to have enhanced accessibility and liquidity for South Korean investors, resulting in an immediate surge in buying activity . You might also like: Bitcoin price prediction July 2025: Will BTC hit new all-time highs this summer? The strong demand for the KRW trading pair among South Korean investors is clear from the fact that most of today’s trading volume came from Upbit, which recorded $2.6 billion. Binance and Bithumb followed with $384 million and $246 million, respectively. For the uninitiated, Hyperlane functions as a permissionless interoperability protocol, offering modular messaging and bridging solutions across Layer 1 chains, rollups, and app-specific chains. It enables developers to deploy freely, configure tailored security models, and build cross‑chain applications with ease. The HYPER token powers the protocol by supporting validator staking, protocol governance, and usage incentives. Hyper price analysis From a technical perspective, HYPER’s price broke out of a descending resistance trendline, invalidating over three months of bearish structure. HYPER 1-day price chart — July 11 | Source: crypto.news Momentum indicators, including the RSI and MACD, are both at multi-month highs, signaling strong bullish momentum. Importantly, neither indicator has produced a bearish divergence yet, supporting the case for continued upward movement. HYPER MACD and RSI chart — July 11 | Source: crypto.news The next significant resistance level lies at the psychological $7 mark, which, if broken, could open the path for further price discovery. However, the rally may face short-term resistance as exchange wallet balances have jumped by 34% in the last 24 hours, according to Nansen, now holding 34.54 million tokens. This is often a sign that early investors may be positioning to lock in profits, which could introduce some selling pressure in the short term.

While Bitcoin’s fresh all-time high helped, there’s more to this rally than just market momentum. According to popular crypto analyst Dr Altcoin, Pi may have already hit its lowest price, and we might never see $0.40 again. Here’s what’s giving him that confidence. Dr Altcoin Says $0.40 Was Pi’s Final Bottom Dr Altcoin believes Pi Coin’s recent dip to $0.40 may have been its last major low. It’s now been over a week since it touched that zone, and he sees no signs of it falling back, especially with a major shift happening in its token supply. According to Pi Scan data , the amount of unlocked Pi hitting the market will shrink by about 30%, dropping to just 116 million coins by the end of August. That means fewer coins available for selling, which could reduce pressure on the price and help it move higher naturally. It has been over a week since Pi dropped to the $0.4 range. It is unlikely to fall further, especially as we approach the end of August, when the amount of unlocked Pi is expected to decrease by at least 30%.

Bitcoin’s Rally Pushes Pi Higher Bitcoin’s rally to a new all-time high has also lifted the entire crypto market, and Pi is riding the wave. It recently broke above $0.45 and is now holding strong at $0.52. This is the token’s first real upward momentum this month, and many see it as a sign that Pi is entering a new phase of growth. Supporting this outlook, the MACD ( Moving Average Convergence Divergence ) indicator just flashed a bullish crossover. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pi is currently around $0.52, and some forecasts suggest it could reach $5–$22 by 2025, depending on adoption and market trends. What will be the price of 1 Pi in 2030? If growth continues, Pi could trade between $22 and $50 by 2030, especially with expanding AI integration and ecosystem use. What will be the value of PI in 2040? By 2040, bullish models predict Pi could exceed $100 if it sees mass adoption and captures a significant share of digital markets. Can Pi reach $100? It’s possible long term, but reaching $100 would require major adoption, utility growth, and sustained market confidence.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-pi-network-price-up-today/,"TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
