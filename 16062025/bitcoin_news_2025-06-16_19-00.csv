2025-06-16T16:55:34,"Fraud Mastermind Executes $547,455 Business Email Scam, Duping Victims Into Sending Fraudulent Transfers: DOJ","A 54-year-old man from Ohio is facing nearly five years in prison for his involvement in an email spoofing scheme that scammed companies in the US. According to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Mississippi , Gabriel Waters was engaged in a wire fraud and money laundering scheme where criminals sent emails that imitated the corporate accounts of employees who control the finances of the victim companies. The perpetrators bought domain names that look very similar to the legitimate domain names owned by businesses and used imitation email accounts to direct the victim companies’ employees, customers or partners to send money to a bank account that they controlled under the guise of a legitimate transaction. Waters played a crucial role in the scheme, according to the DOJ. He set up bank accounts in the US, received money directly from the victims and then laundered the funds to different accounts before eventually converting them to cryptocurrency to transfer to the email fraudsters overseas. US District Judge Sharion Aycock sentenced Waters to 57 months of imprisonment, which will be followed by five years of supervised release. She also ordered the payment of $547,455.80 in restitution to the victims. An accountant and adjunct business instructor from Pennsylvania was also recently sentenced to federal prison for laundering $800,000 of proceeds from a similar scheme. The victims received spoofed emails while in the process of making large wire and automatic clearinghouse (ACH) transfers, directing them to transfer the funds to bank accounts controlled by the fraudster.

2025-06-16T16:25:12,"XRP Price Prediction: Cardano Founder Confirms XRP Support – New Partnership Coming?","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has confirmed that ADA will integrate with the XRP Ledger, marking a major milestone in cross-chain collaboration. The news has helped the XRP price recover to $2.20 today, reinforcing investor confidence despite a modest dip of 1.5% in the past week and 7% over the month. Combined with recent developments — including public companies adding XRP to reserves and multiple XRP ETFs awaiting approval — this adds fuel to a bullish long-term XRP price prediction . As Ripple’s ecosystem expands, XRP is increasingly positioned as one of the most promising altcoins heading into 2025. XRP Price Prediction: Cardano Founder Confirms XRP Support – New Partnership Coming? If nothing else, Hoskinson’s confirmation of XRP support is an indication that he and Input Output believe that the token has good prospects for the future. There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi and the RealUSD talks. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 14, 2025 This isn’t the first time that Hoskinson has talked about XRP in recent weeks, with the Cardano founder (and Ethereum co-founder) mentioning only a few days ago that he would “love for Cardano Midnight to be the DeFi layer of the XRP ecosystem.” As such, we can expect Cardano to increasingly integrate with XRP over the coming months, although it’s worth pointing out that Ripple haven’t said anything reciprocally about Cardano. Regardless, bringing XRP into the Cardano ecosystem could help boost most tokens over time, although XRP doesn’t need as much help in this regard as Cardano (which still has a relatively low TVL of $284 million ). Not only have the past few weeks witnessed several companies – Webus, VivoPower and Trident – announcing strategic XRP reserves, but Ripple itself has been expanding its business, obtaining a license and also approval for RLUSD in Dubai , for example. This puts XRP on a very strong footing, and if we look at its chart today we see that it may be close to a breakout. Source: TradingView Its resistance (red) and support (green) levels have been converging for several months now, while the coin’s RSI (purple) has been in an oversold position for too long. Of course, macro issues – such as tariffs and the threat of further escalation between Israel and Iran – could drag down prices across the board. But as Cardano’s desire to integrate with XRP indicates, the latter is very much a token on the up, with the XRP price likely to hit $3 by August. And if current momentum holds through Q4, a breakout toward the $10 level by year-end could be within reach. Bitcoin Bull Tops $7 Million As Anticipation for Deflationary Meme Coin Grows Traders shouldn’t put all of their eggs in one basket, however, with a sensible trading strategy involving some degree of diversification. This means diversification into smaller coins, with some of the most promising assets on the market being presale tokens. In the right conditions, such tokens can rally vigorously when they list for the first time, particularly if they’ve had big, popular sales. One example fitting this bill is Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL), an ERC-20 token that has raised over $7 million in its ICO. Last chance to buy BTCBULL before launch! The countdown ends on June 30th. Here’s what’s coming: BTCBULL token burns BTC airdrops at price milestones BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K Join the herd: https://t.co/FQZXEzFwWu pic.twitter.com/aeUmLJcSOC — BTCBULL_TOKEN (@BTCBULL_TOKEN) June 2, 2025 Bitcoin Bull is shaping up to be one of the most exciting new cryptocurrencies in the market, with the coin having deflationary tokenomics linked to Bitcoin (BTC) itself. With a hard cap of 21 billion BTCBULL, Bitcoin Bull will host regular token burns, doing so whenever BTC reaches certain price milestones. This will begin with $125,000 and continue with each additional $25,000 added for the first time. Yet the fun doesn’t stop there, since Bitcoin Bull will also host BTC airdrops, with the first happening when Bitcoin hits $150,000 (and repeating with each $50,000). This could make BTCBULL a very profitable token to hold, with investors able to join its sale by going to the Bitcoin Bull website . The sale will end in 14 days, so new investors should act quickly.

2025-06-16T16:17:33,"France Mulling Bitcoin Mining to Reduce Energy Waste","France is looking at a new way to use Bitcoin mining in its energy strategy. According to reports , French National Assembly lawmakers have proposed that the government explore how Bitcoin mining could help manage excess electricity and stabilize the country’s power grid. This plan will tackle France’s problem of excess electricity production while turning Bitcoin’s energy needs into a possible benefit. The French Strategic Growth: A Focus on Efficiency and Expansion Furthermore, the proposal suggests that the government create a detailed report to explore how adding Bitcoin mining to the national energy system could improve energy use. Notably, Bitcoin mining uses a lot of electricity, but it might be a way to use extra energy that would otherwise be wasted. This method could change how individuals view energy consumption, turning it from a problem into a helpful tool for managing energy supply and demand. France’s electricity excess stems from its strong nuclear power plants and increasing renewable energy sources. When demand is low and production is high, this extra power often goes to waste or is sold at lower prices to neighboring countries. As such, some lawmakers believe that Bitcoin mining farms could use this surplus electricity during these times, thereby stabilizing the power grid. If adopted, this initiative could place France as a leader in innovative energy management, using blockchain technology to tackle modern energy issues. Bitcoin Miners Push Ahead Despite Mining Difficulty Bitcoin mining difficulty has recently declined following a record high, offering some relief to miners grappling with rising costs and reduced block rewards. As reported by TheCoinRise, mining difficulty now stands at around 126.4 trillion, just below the all-time high of 126.9 trillion recorded on May 31. However, amid heightened margins, some major publicly traded mining firms are not only staying afloat but thriving. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) , one of the largest U.S.-based Bitcoin miners, reported a 35% increase in BTC production in May 2025. CleanSpark, another prominent public miner known for its commitment to clean energy, also reported production gains . HIVE Digital Boost Bitcoin mining Recall that HIVE Digital, the global crypto miner leader, secured a major deal last year with Canaan Creative Global (CCG), the Singapore-based subsidiary. This marked a pivotal shift in HIVE’s plans to strengthen its Bitcoin mining capabilities and create a more efficient, eco-friendly infrastructure. While upgrading its hardware, HIVE invests in a long-term strategy to ensure its operations remain sustainable. The company is building a 100MW mining facility in Paraguay, which is projected to be fully operational by Q3 2025. It is also worth noting that the Executive Chairman, Frank Holmes, emphasized that disciplined capital management allows HIVE to make smart moves.

SRM announced via a press release on June 16, 2025 that the company had secured a commitment from a private investor for a $100 million in equity investment. The securities purchase agreement between SRM and the private investor will see the $100 million allocated toward acquiring TRON ( TRX ), marking the first step in SRM’s broader treasury strategy. TRX is the native token of the TRON blockchain, founded by Justin Sun founded in 2017. As part of the deal, Sun will join SRM as an advisor. “As blockchain technology gains wider adoption globally, TRON has become the industry leader for cross border settlement in US dollar stablecoin. We are excited to invest into the future of the world’s next generation financial infrastructure,” said Rich Miller, chief executive officer of SRM. You might also like: USD1 stablecoin launches on TRON amid major governance update The move comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission halted its investigation into the Sun-led project, removing a major regulatory overhang. Notably, SRM is working with New York-based boutique investment bank Dominari Securities as the placement agency for its 220 million convertible offering. According to the Financial Times , Dominari has ties to Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, sons of U.S. President Donald Trump and key figures behind several major crypto-related projects linked to Trump. Earlier this year, Sun invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed crypto initiative. Sun, who is an advisor at World Liberty Financial , is now set to play a crucial role in SRM Entertainment’s plans to buy and hodl TRX. SRM, poised to rebrand as Tron Inc., will pursue a treasury strategy that mirrors that of Strategy – formerly MicroStrategy. SRM’s treasury strategy will incorporate a dividend policy once it successfully adds TRX staking.

How far can they go? $ETH up 3.5% on the day Source: TradingView $ETH is up 3.5% on the day so far after the price broke past the descending trendline. The next positive price impulse is now in play and it just remains to be seen whether the bulls can put on a real spurt and force the price up and past the last swing high at $2,879. If the bulls fail to accomplish this there could be yet another peak and trough of sideways price action to come. That said, this wouldn’t be a bad thing in the long run for $ETH, as the more sideways price action that takes place, the larger the escape velocity is likely to be if and when $ETH heads up for the next step higher. $XRP at critical breakout level Source: TradingView The daily chart for $XRP reveals that the price is up against not only the 0.382 Fibonacci level, but also the descending trendline which stretches back to mid-January. This is a very critical point where the bulls and the bears are likely to battle fiercely. If the bulls win, breakout is achieved and the price can up towards $2.50. If the bears win, the price is rejected once again, and the descending trendline will continue to push $XRP lower. Upside targets for $XRP can be taken from the Fibonacci levels in the chart. $SOL at resistance Source: TradingView The daily chart for $SOL illustrates how the price has come up against the $157 resistance level. If this can be broken and held as support, and the descending trendline can be breached, the bulls can set their sights on the $187 local high. Given that a lower low was recently put in, the higher high at $168 would put the $SOL price back on an upward trajectory. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 $BTC acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/BOs3GOaUva — Strategy (@Strategy) June 16, 2025 This latest investment raises Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 592,100 BTC, solidifying its standing as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The firm continues executing on its “buy and hold” strategy, fueled by proceeds from equity and debt financing, rather than using its at‑the‑market programs. Importantly, Strategy did not sell any stock or Bitcoin in the days surrounding the acquisition. Continued Confidence in Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value In the filing, Strategy’s management stresses its unwavering conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, although they acknowledge the volatility and risks associated with such a concentrated treasury allocation. The filing explicitly warns that the absence of diversification heightens exposure to Bitcoin’s short-term price fluctuations: “The concentration of our assets in Bitcoin limits our ability to mitigate risk that could otherwise be achieved by holding a more diversified portfolio.” Strategy notes that this strategy “has not been tested over an extended period of time or under different market conditions.” Financing and Risk Factors The 8‑K also discloses that Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions are financed primarily through debt and equity, making the company dependent on favorable financing conditions to sustain its accumulation trajectory. Strategy also flags counterparty and custody risks, acknowledging that if custodians were to undergo insolvency, access to stored bitcoin might be impeded. This purchase follows a recent 10-for-1 stock split in August 2024, ensuring that per-share metrics in the Form 8‑K reflect adjusted, post-split figures. With Bitcoin hovering around $104k, Strategy’s entry is striking for its size and continued commitment amid a volatile macroeconomic environment.

The talks, described by officials as a “landmark discussion,” brought Saylor together with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib . The agenda focused on how Bitcoin could be used in sovereign reserves and monetary policy. Meanwhile, Pakistan is accelerating efforts to become a digital asset leader in the Global South. “Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation, and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” said Aurangzeb, who also chairs the Pakistan Crypto Council.

2025-06-16T15:46:09,"A Critical Week in Bitcoin: How Will the Fed Decision Affect the Price? Is the Next Stop for BTC a New ATH? Analysts Explained!","Bitcoin (BTC), which was affected by the tension and geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran and fell to the $100,000 level, continues to recover. At this point, while Bitcoin has climbed above $106,500, there is still some uneasiness in the market about the direction of the price. Speaking to The Block, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas explained her updated Bitcoin analysis. Is the New ATH the Next Stop for Bitcoin? Stating that Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties, Rachael Lucas said that despite this, BTC recovered quickly. Lucas noted that Bitcoin price is currently being shaped by a combination of three factors: corporate flows, macroeconomic data, and geopolitical risk. The analyst also said that the fear and greed index currently stands at 61, indicating a moderate outlook. The recent recovery against this figure reflects optimistic yet cautious investor sentiment, he said. Finally, the analyst stated that he expects a new ATH and said: “Geopolitical uncertainty often drives Bitcoin down. This was the case in the Israel-Iran case. However, BTC usually recovers quickly as investors use Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. At this point, the recent breakout of the $106,406 resistance in Bitcoin shows that the bullish momentum continues, and the next important target will be the all-time high. All or Nothing for Bitcoin and Ethereum! Apart from Rachael Lucas, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu also evaluated BTC's recent movements. Liu, who predicted that Bitcoin would make a breakout after the uncertainty and tensions ended, said, “Bitcoin is seeing strong global liquidity and institutional demand, which could pave the way for a breakout once the dust settles in the market.” However, Liu stated that a much more important event awaits us, and said that this is the FED interest rate decision. According to Liu, this meeting could mean “all or nothing” for BTC and Ethereum. *This is not investment advice.

That transaction figure marks a massive jump when from the near 4 million transactions a day processed earlier in the year, according to Nansen data. PancakeSwap, the network’s main decentralized exchange, played a key role with $2.7 billion in daily volume . In aggregate, BSC handled over $104 billion in DEX volume over the last month, outpacing both Solana and Ethereum, according to DeFiLlama data . This growth helped BNB push through volatility sparked by the clashes between Israel and Iran, which temporarily dragged bitcoin under $104,000. BNB saw strong buying interest throughout the day, holding firm at the $646 level and topping out at $658. That strength was backed by unusually high volume and what appeared to be institutional interest. Technically, BNB is benefiting from a string of higher lows, a sign of a building uptrend, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. Analysts also pointed to consistent above-average volumes, suggesting more than just retail enthusiasm. Open interest in BNB derivatives has fallen 6.9% week-over-week to $750 million, signaling caution among traders. Yet the broader Fear & Greed Index sits at a neutral 51, suggesting sentiment hasn’t tipped bearish despite geopolitical jitters.

In an announcement on June 16, Chaos Labs said Avalanche ( AVAX ) will leverage the Proof-of-Reserves system to provide transparent verification for bridged assets in the Avalanche DeFi stack. This includes ecosystem top coins for cross-chain liquidity, such as Avalanche Bridged Bitcoin (BTC.b) and bridged Wrapped Ethereum (WETH.e) on Avalanche. Beyond cross-chain liquidity, bridged assets like BTC.b and WETH.e unlock collateral utility. They also enable deeper liquidity for decentralized finance features like trading, lending, and structured products. Chaos Labs’ Proof-of-Reserves adds an on-chain system that allows users to monitor and verify the reserves backing these bridged assets. With Chaos Labs’ Proof-of-Reserves architecture, Avalanche can now track reserve data across canonical bridges and custodial solutions. The on-chain validation of attestations enables public monitoring of the Bitcoin and Ethereum that back the BTC.b and WETH.e supplies. Users can verify whether bridged assets on Avalanche have full reserves on their native chains, Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network and Ethereum on the Ethereum network. Importantly, DeFi users on Avalanche, as well as developers and protocols, no longer have to rely on third-party providers to verify tokenized or collateralized assets.

The CEO explained that individuals could and should buy and hold Bitcoin alone. Yakovenko added that altcoin teams should buy low-risk assets like Treasury bills. The CEO of Solana Labs, Anatoly Yakovenko, dismissed the plans of altcoin teams holding Bitcoin for their users. Yakovenko claimed that individuals did not require a team to invest in Bitcoin. The Solana Labs top executive explained that individuals could and should hold Bitcoin for themselves. The CEO recommended that altcoin projects buy and hold enough short-term assets, such as U.S. T-bills, to cover three years of operating expenses. Cardano plans to convert $100 million of ADA into BTC This is so dumb. Projects should keep 18-36 months of post kill list runway in short term tbills but that’s about it. Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts. — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) June 16, 2025 Yakovenko’s comment came after Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, said his firm would consider converting $100 million worth of ADA into BTC and other stable assets. According to Hoskinson, the proposal wouldn’t hurt his firm’s ecosystem. The Cardano co-founder added that the plan would help grow its treasury with time through yield. Hoskinson argued that yields from BTC would help the team buy back more ADA. Hoskinson explained that if the plan succeeded, they would continue the strategy on an annualized basis for 5 to 10 years. The Cardano executive expressed his belief that the strategy had the potential to grow to over a billion dollars. Hoskinson previously said Bitcoin did not have the right to be considered the only sound money blockchain. The Cardano executive recently stated that the firm would not allow the maxi and the Bitcoin ecosystem to take the lead. Hoskinson argued that the biggest threat to BTC’s dominance was and would always be Cardano. The crypto community has weighed in on the matter. Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest stated that subpar altcoins ditching their digital assets to create a Bitcoin treasury was not on his 2025 bingo card. DeFi platform Alva argued that Cardano’s idea of turning $100 million worth of ADA into BTC was a bit risky. Alva, however, claimed that the move could strengthen Cardano’s position in decentralized finance. Cardano joins Polkadot in the BTC strategy race Cardano’s plan to convert some of its ADA into Bitcoin and other stable assets came barely a week after the Polkadot community revealed plans to introduce a crypto reserve. Members of the Polkadot community have suggested the establishment of a BTC reserve for the Polkadot Treasury . The proposal intends to change 500,000 DOT into Threshold BTC (tBTC) in a year with the help of Hydration’s rolling DCA feature. Polkadot has previously explored diversification by introducing stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Polkadot community members said they want the capital to be offered as liquidity to Omnipool so that the funds could be put to use. The community members also suggested an extra 1,000 DOT be reserved for transaction fees. The proposers revealed that Bitcoin was highlighted in the main diversification proposal as an asset that could help reduce volatility and also maintain the value of the Polkadot Treasury. The Polkadot community members proposed tBTC for its decentralization, transparency, and liquidity. The proposal recommends selling a fixed amount of DOT for every trade instead of buying a fixed amount of tBTC. The members agreed that the total number of DOT tokens would first be converted into a yield-bearing collateral token and distributed into the Hydration Borrow functionality. The proposers revealed that the Polkadot Treasury will gain yield on the dormant DOT while also improving the DOT supply available for borrowing. The proposal outlined that portions of 0.005 tBTC will be introduced as liquidity into the Hydration Omnipool following a brief accumulation period. The community anticipates that this approach will contribute to diversifying the Polkadot Treasury’s holdings.

Key Takeaways: Affluent has launched as Telegram’s first native DeFi app, offering lending and yield strategies on TON. The project targets both retail savers and institutional liquidity providers within Telegram’s vast user base. A new points program aims to boost engagement, starting with deposits into the TON multiply vault. The project officially launched Monday, offering users lending pools and crypto yield strategies in a streamlined format designed to function within the Telegram interface, the project said on X . Co-founded by Justin Hyun, a former director of the TON Foundation, and Hyung Lee of DeFi R&D group B-Harvest, Affluent aims to transform Telegram into a financial super app. Affluent Targets Retail Savings and Institutional Liquidity in DeFi Push The project promises to simplify crypto savings for retail users while offering deep liquidity access for institutional players. Affluent aims to “bring real, trustless asset management to Telegram’s billion-user ecosystem,” the project said on X, positioning the app as a “smart bank for crypto.” The strategy mirrors the success of super apps like WeChat, which seamlessly blend messaging, payments, and financial services in a single user environment. By embedding DeFi functionality directly into a platform with over 900 million users, Affluent sidesteps many of the usability challenges that have long hampered broader DeFi adoption. Telegram users will now be able to access lending and yield products without leaving the app. “Affluent is launching a points program to incentivize users for various activities. The first action is to deposit into the TON multiply vault,” the project said. 6/ What’s next? • USDT Multiply Vault: Stablecoin denominate delta-neutral engine for risk-adjusted yield • Strategy Vaults composable with BTC, Gold, U.S. Treasury, Tokenized Private Credit • Payment from your vault: Collateralization and payment from your vault tokens •… — Affluent (@AffluentOrg) June 16, 2025 Although Telegram distanced itself from TON after regulatory issues forced it to shelve its original blockchain ambitions in 2020, the platform formally backed TON in September 2023. That endorsement has since accelerated development across the ecosystem, with Affluent now marking a notable step forward in integrating DeFi into Telegram’s daily user experience. Telegram Shuts Down Channels Linked to Xinbi and Huione In May, Telegram took down thousands of channels tied to the Chinese-language marketplaces Xinbi Guarantee and Huione Guarantee after a report by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic exposed their role in over $35 billion worth of illicit transactions, largely using Tether (USDT). Xinbi alone has seen at least $8.4 billion in USDT since 2022, while Huione accounts for at least $27 billion, offering services ranging from fake IDs to money laundering. These marketplaces operate openly within Telegram’s group infrastructure, connecting vendors and buyers for illegal goods and services. Huione, reportedly linked to Cambodia’s ruling elite, sells everything from personal data to intimidation-for-hire services. Xinbi, with over 233,000 users, offers services in categories like crypto laundering, forged documents, SIM cards, and access to stolen databases. The platforms have become a go-to for laundering proceeds from pig butchering scams , which are frauds that combine romance or investment lures to steal large sums in crypto.

The purchase occurred during market volatility triggered by escalating Israel-Iran tensions, as Bitcoin dropped from $110,000 to an intraweek low of $103,639. The deal puts Strategy’s year-to-date Bitcoin yield at 19.1%, much closer to the company’s target of 25% by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, BlackRock, too, has been steadily building its BTC position, buying a staggering $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin in recent weeks. Different approaches Strategy operates as a corporate treasury play, with CEO Michael Saylor positioning Bitcoin as the company’s primary asset and using various financing methods to acquire more. The company recently debuted its third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, STRD, on Nasdaq to raise an additional $250 million for further Bitcoin purchases. BlackRock, on the other hand, accumulates Bitcoin through its exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) structure, pooling investor capital to build massive positions. The firm aims to become the world’s leading digital asset manager by 2030, aiming to manage at least $50 billion in crypto within five years. As both institutions maintain their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategies, the frontrunner may keep shifting. What’s certain is that together, BlackRock and Strategy now control over 1.3 million Bitcoin, representing roughly 6% of the total supply and demonstrating the massive institutional adoption that has transformed the entire crypto sector.

He said it is a realistic path forward. During an interview with Bradley Kimes of Digital Perspective at the XRP Las Vegas conference, Giancarlo outlined how digital assets are increasingly viewed as viable components of public finance by both federal and local governments. Giancarlo’s growing interest among U.S. policymakers in utilizing cryptocurrencies in public finance. He noted that conversations in Washington are increasingly considering how various levels of government could acquire, hold, and even issue financial instruments based on crypto assets. He believes this is not confined to the federal level but could also include state and local governments exploring similar strategies.

One of the most important 4:22… pic.twitter.com/JjzG5ER8YU — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) June 12, 2025 Shifting Federal Strategy Toward Digital Asset Retention Giancarlo highlighted a notable shift in the President Trump administration’s handling of confiscated digital assets. He has positively impacted the crypto market so far. Rather than liquidating seized cryptocurrencies, federal agencies are retaining them as long-term strategic holdings. As a result, some have speculated that the government could hold XRP via Ripple’s penalty in the legal battle with the SEC. Giancarlo criticized previous administrations for selling off assets prematurely, arguing that holding them could have yielded significant gains and helped reduce financial burdens. He emphasized that this change does not require congressional approval, as executive agencies already have the authority to retain seized digital assets. Giancarlo proposed that digital assets could serve a role similar to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is used to stabilize markets and enhance economic resilience. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that digital assets could bolster national influence, especially amid BRICS efforts to challenge the dollar’s dominance. Drawing parallels to China’s stockpiling of strategic resources, Giancarlo argued the U.S. should build reserves of Bitcoin, XRP, and other digital commodities. Establishment of Cryptocurrency Reserves This vision is already taking shape. In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , which now holds over 200,000 BTC, primarily obtained through forfeitures. It is positioned as a long-term store of value, akin to digital gold. Notably, the administration also launched the Digital Asset Stockpile to hold Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This reserve allows for controlled asset management and greater flexibility. Kimes concluded that digital reserves could be used as instruments of market influence, much like oil reserves, to steer financial policy and respond to economic threats.

Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold Bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts?” This is so dumb. Projects should keep 18-36 months of post kill list runway in short term tbills but that’s about it. Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts. — toly (@aeyakovenko) June 16, 2025 Cardano Sparks Debate With Proposal to Turn ADA Treasury Into Bitcoin Yield Engine Yakovenko’s comments were in response to a June 13 video posted by Cardano founder and Input Output Global CEO Charles Hoskinson. @IOHK_Charles proposed converting $100 million in ADA from Cardano’s treasury into stablecoins and Bitcoin. #ada #cardano https://t.co/WRtEpiTO4q — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 In the video, Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA from Cardano’s treasury into a mix of Bitcoin and stablecoins. Hoskinson said the move could support stablecoin liquidity and help grow Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, which he noted has a much lower stablecoin-to-TVL ratio compared to Ethereum and Solana. He argued that holding Bitcoin and stablecoins would allow Cardano to generate yield, reinvest in ADA, and create a more resilient treasury over time. The goal, according to Hoskinson, is to create yield that could later be used to buy back ADA, helping to strengthen the protocol’s position and DeFi ecosystem over time. “I do believe that it will not materially impact Cardano by doing a conversion of 5–10% of the treasury,” Hoskinson said. “And in doing this, we will create yield, and this yield… can be used to purchase ADA and over time replenish the treasury.” Hoskinson described the long-term plan as a way to grow Cardano’s treasury into a “billion-dollar-plus” pool of stablecoins and Bitcoin, similar to how sovereign wealth funds operate. Yakovenko’s response reflects a broader skepticism in parts of the crypto community about projects managing Bitcoin on behalf of users. His view is that individual holders should manage BTC exposure on their own, not through protocol-level holdings. The debate has also drawn reactions from the broader crypto community. One X user, “ y00thereum ,” mocked the shift, saying, “Remember how dis clown was always sayin that his shtcoin Cardano is better than Bitcoin? Now he wants to dump $1.2B in ADA for BTC and stables. Hahaha, you can’t make this sht up.” Remember how dis clown was always sayin that his sh*tcoin Cardano is better than Bitcoin ? now he wants to dump $1.2B $ADA for $BTC and stables. hahaha you can't make this sh*t up https://t.co/cquNc91QCk pic.twitter.com/GpezrdLrNg — y00thereum (@y00thereum) June 16, 2025 Others defended the idea. A user named TJ Coosh pointed out that Cardano is building interoperability for Bitcoin in DeFi. “The BTC converted from the treasury would be to inject some BTC liquidity into DeFi pools on the Cardano side, allowing bitcoiners a smoother DeFi experience,” he said. As altcoin projects look for ways to strengthen their ecosystems and navigate uncertain markets, the question of whether to hold Bitcoin or stick to T-bills remains up for debate. Yakovenko has made his position clear. Whether Cardano’s plan works out is something only time will tell. Polkadot Joins Treasury Diversification Trend as Cardano Hits Staking Milestone Cardano’s $100 million Bitcoin treasury proposal isn’t an isolated move; it’s part of a growing trend across major blockchains experimenting with multi-asset treasury strategies. Polkadot is weighing a similar move. Recently, a Polkadot community member p roposed selling 500,000 DOT (~$1.95 million) to build a Bitcoin reserve via a dollar-cost averaging strategy. Supporters argue BTC can help stabilize treasuries as DOT’s price continues to lag in 2025. @Polkadot members divided as a proposal to convert 500,000 DOT into Bitcoin for a strategic hedge sparks debate. #Polkadot #Bitcoin https://t.co/KBdEelN2nW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 However, some question the timing, given Bitcoin’s current all-time highs above $106,000. Meanwhile, Cardano’s network fundamentals remain strong. The ADA token gained 3% over the past day, following news that staking participation has surpassed 1.3 million addresses, solidifying its position among the most actively staked chains. JUST IN: Cardano $ADA has surpassed 1.3 million staking addresses, highlighting its status as one of the world’s most actively staked blockchain networks. pic.twitter.com/HDUnJ8mmRH — TapTools (@TapTools) June 16, 2025 As treasury debates heat up, more protocols are considering formal fund oversight, including elected boards and cross-chain deployment, signaling a shift in how on-chain capital is managed in the maturing DeFi ecosystem.

2025-06-16T15:02:26,"Home on the (BTC) Range","Hi. I’m Andy Baehr with the CoinDesk Indices team. Question: Bitcoin is stuck in a range. Is that a bad thing or a good thing? Even casual BTC watchers will have noted the ten percent channel that has held for more than a month. As of today, in fact, it has been 40 days since we entered the ~$101K - ~$111K range, with no catalyst forcing a breakout through either boundary. Good or bad thing? The macro muddle supports range-trading. Our anchor bitcoin macro factor remains expectations for future real interest rates--nominal rates minus inflation. Recent cross-currents create an unclear picture: inflation expectations from surveys have been elevated (though recent releases seem less concerning), while hopes for Fed relief were dim until the market began pricing in two 2025 cuts more assertively. Too muddled for a breakout. Bitcoin is doing what it should. For the store-of-value thesis, range-trading is actually fine. As bitcoin accumulates more days of ""not unexpected"" behavior, it supports the narrative of relative independence from other risk assets and improved stability. (The S&P 500 has also kept an 8% range through the same 39 days, so bitcoin isn't alone in this holding pattern, although recent news flows might have knocked a younger bitcoin off the track.) But traders are getting restless. Bitcoin's basement-level thirty-day realized volatility below 30% crimps opportunity. Implied vols are also down as option buyers grow fatigued and sellers grab yield more confidently. Like any market, a range that holds too long creates complacency—making the eventual exit more ""exciting"" than it would otherwise be. The stalled mood is hurting breadth. Without bitcoin providing leadership, other digital assets are wilting. The CoinDesk 20 Index has trailed bitcoin by about 5% over the past month, as the lack of sentiment has stalled the late-April rally, even in ETH, which had bounced strongly. How does this compare historically? With some truly unattractive vibe coding (I take the blame), we studied bitcoin's longest streaks of holding 10% ranges. The current 40-day stretch isn't the longest—that was 42 days—but it's close. Similar streaks occurred in 2018, 2020, and 2023. Given bitcoin's evolved ownership structure (ETFs, MSTR) and more accessible spot and derivatives markets, would a 50-day streak surprise anyone? Not sure.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/16/home-on-the-btc-range,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T15:00:04,"Bitcoin Is The Plan: Metaplanet’s $210-M Bond Issuance Sends Strong Signal","Metaplanet, a Tokyo‑listed company often called Japan’s ‘Strategy,’ has just raised $210 million in zero‑interest bonds to add more Bitcoin to its treasury. The board signed off on the 18th series of ordinary bonds on Monday. Those notes, bought only by the Cayman Islands firm Evo Fund, come with an early‑redemption option and mature on December 12, 2025. According to public filings, every dollar collected will go straight into more BTC. Bond Issue For Bitcoin Buy Metaplanet tapped debt markets for the fresh funds without taking on any interest costs. That move shows strong confidence in Bitcoin’s outlook. The bonds sit alongside earlier issues that have funded past coin purchases. With no coupons to pay, Metaplanet can use every cent of the $210 million for crypto. *Metaplanet Issues 210 Million USD in 0% Ordinary Bonds to Purchase Additional $BTC * pic.twitter.com/cglQAFDKUi — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 16, 2025 Rising Bitcoin Holdings Based on reports from Bitcoin Treasuries , Metaplanet now holds nearly 8,890 BTC. This round added 1,088 coins at recent market rates. At today’s prices, that stash is almost $450 million. The firm’s balance sheet is turning into a crypto playbook. It follows the strategy championed by Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy , which first inspired this approach. $210M. 0% interest. All Bitcoin.2億1,000万ドル。金利0%。すべてビットコイン。 https://t.co/CYiwmq8zDW — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 16, 2025 Market Reaction And Risks Investors have piled into Metaplanet stock over the past year, sending shares up more than 4,500%. Yet hedge funds have made it the most‑shorted stock in Japan. Short sellers are betting on a Bitcoin fall or a shift in global interest rates that could change bond markets. If big swings hit BTC prices, Metaplanet could face pressure on both its debt and equity fronts. Seamus Rocca, CEO at Xapo Bank, said this week that firms allocating to Bitcoin need to focus on what they can hold for at least five years. He warned against chasing trends or building big bets you can’t stick with when prices wobble. Companies like Metaplanet and Strategy represent outliers with high conviction in their plans. Patience and a clear framework matter most, he added. Yen Weakness Adds Context Japan’s currency has slipped against the dollar this week amid doubts over future Bank of Japan policy. A weaker yen makes dollar‑priced assets like Bitcoin even more tempting for local firms. Based on reports, Metaplanet sees an edge in buying now while the currency is soft, aiming for gains over the bonds’ one‑and‑a‑half‑year life. Overall, Metaplanet’s all‑in Bitcoin bet is drawing plenty of attention. The zero‑interest deal and 8,888‑coin haul show it’s doubling down.

Targets Launching Bitcoin Treasuries in Asia’s US$25 Trillion Public Market Universal Digital Inc. (the “Company” or “Universal Digital”) (CSE: “LFG”, FSE: 8R20) is pleased to announce the launch of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, which will form a core pillar of the Company’s capital allocation framework. As an initial step, the Company has commenced the orderly divestment of its existing altcoin holdings, with the proceeds to be reallocated toward Bitcoin accumulation under a new reserve model. The goal of this strategy is to enhance long-term net asset value and align the Company with global trends in institutional digital asset adoption. Universal Digital views Bitcoin as a complementary reserve asset and plans to implement the strategy in a transparent and phased manner. As part of this initiative, the Company plans to collaborate with publicly-listed companies across Asia to implement Bitcoin treasury models, leveraging the region’s growing institutional and retail interest in digital assets and its increasing openness to blockchain-based financial innovation. According to Chainalysis, Eastern Asia accounted for approximately 8.9% of global on-chain cryptocurrency transaction volume between July 2023 and June 2024, with the bulk of activity driven by institutional and professional investors in markets like Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In furtherance of this regional focus, on June 12, 2025, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with GFA Co., Ltd. (“GFA”), a Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed diversified financial and technology group (TSE: 8783).

Under the MOU, the companies will jointly explore: Introducing Bitcoin reserve models to Japanese listed companies; Structuring capital raising tools such as warrants and market-based offerings to fund Bitcoin acquisitions; and Enhancing governance, investor relations, and custody frameworks for digital assets. The MOU also sets the stage for broader collaboration in Japan’s digital economy, including joint investments in public companies, the development of blockchain-based corporate structures, initiatives that connect Bitcoin adoption with cultural IP and Web3-driven consumer ecosystems. The MOU was entered on an arm’s length basis and there are no related party interests between Universal Digital and GFA. “Our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy marks a deliberate shift in how we manage capital — by holding Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset, we aim to enhance balance sheet strength and align with the evolving global financial landscape,” said Tim Chan, CEO of the Company. “The framework we’ve established with GFA enables us to explore extending this model to Asia, where digital assets are gaining traction among public companies and institutional investors.” “Universal Digital’s and its management’s experience with the crypto and Bitcoin treasury combined with our expertise on the Japanese markets makes us a strong team. I look forward to working closely with Universal Digital to introduce bitcoin reserve model to Japanese listed companies.” Stated Gen Matsuda, CEO of GFA Co., Ltd.

2025-06-16T14:56:12,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Stable Amid Ongoing Middle East Conflict","With no sign of the Israel/Iran conflict growing any less belligerent, Bitcoin is continuing to recover from its correction below $103,000, and is currently riding high again at over $106,600. Can Bitcoin continue to buck the market trend, or will a nervous U.S. stock market start to drag on the number one cryptocurrency? $BTC continues to bounce with alacrity Source: TradingView The 8-hour chart view above shows how the $BTC price went all the way down to touch the support at just below $103,000. This occurred when Israel started to launch strikes into Iran. However, since that time the $BTC price has bounced with alacrity, adding $4,400 while the conflict has raged. Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold $106,800 and turn it into support. If they can do so, this will be a real feather in their cap, given that this is an important level for price structure and would be a good platform for building upon. Positive indicators in the daily chart Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it can be seen that both the Stochastic RSI and the RSI are posturing to make positive crosses of their indicator lines. If these lines are able to cross, this could supply the momentum needed for the bulls to flip that $107,000 resistance level into support again. Weekly Stochastic RSI turning back positive? Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows the price traveling sideways in a narrow range. If the bulls can prevent the price from confirming under the $104,400 support it is possibly just a matter of time before the next break higher. Of huge importance, at the bottom of the chart, is the weekly Stochastic RSI. A cross down of the indicators a few weeks ago could have presaged a fall to much lower prices, and even a potential end to the bull market, but as can be seen, the blue indicator line is possibly shaping up to cross back above the orange indicator line. This could be the initial bounce from the 80.00 level that could see these indicator lines traveling sideways perhaps for an extended period of time. If this takes place, there could be a lot more upside price action in this bull market yet. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Across North America And Asia Vancouver, Canada, June 16th, 2025, Chainwire Company Begins Bitcoin Accumulation And Signs Non-binding Strategic Mou With Japan’s Gfa Co., Ltd. Targets Launching Bitcoin Treasuries in Asia’s US$25 Trillion Public Market Universal Digital Inc. (the “Company” or “Universal Digital”) (CSE: “LFG”, FSE: 8R20) is pleased to announce the launch of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, which will form a core pillar of the Company’s capital allocation framework. As an initial step, the Company has commenced the orderly divestment of its existing altcoin holdings, with the proceeds to be reallocated toward Bitcoin accumulation under a new reserve model. The goal of this strategy is to enhance long-term net asset value and align the Company with global trends in institutional digital asset adoption. Universal Digital views Bitcoin as a complementary reserve asset and plans to implement the strategy in a transparent and phased manner. As part of this initiative, the Company plans to collaborate with publicly-listed companies across Asia to implement Bitcoin treasury models, leveraging the region’s growing institutional and retail interest in digital assets and its increasing openness to blockchain-based financial innovation. According to Chainalysis, Eastern Asia accounted for approximately 8.9% of global on-chain cryptocurrency transaction volume between July 2023 and June 2024, with the bulk of activity driven by institutional and professional investors in markets like Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In furtherance of this regional focus, on June 12, 2025, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with GFA Co., Ltd. (“GFA”), a Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed diversified financial and technology group (TSE: 8783). The MOU sets out a partnership framework for jointly advancing Bitcoin-based corporate finance models in Japan. Under the MOU, the companies will jointly explore: Introducing Bitcoin reserve models to Japanese listed companies; Structuring capital raising tools such as warrants and market-based offerings to fund Bitcoin acquisitions; and Enhancing governance, investor relations, and custody frameworks for digital assets.
