Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Across North America And Asia","June 16th, 2025 – Vancouver, Canada Company Begins Bitcoin Accumulation And Signs Non-binding Strategic Mou With Japan’s Gfa Co., Ltd. Targets Launching Bitcoin Treasuries in Asia’s US$25 Trillion Public Market Universal Digital Inc. (the “Company” or “Universal Digital”) (CSE: “LFG”, FSE: 8R20) is pleased to announce the launch of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, which will form a core pillar of the Company’s capital allocation framework. As an initial step, the Company has commenced the orderly divestment of its existing altcoin holdings, with the proceeds to be reallocated toward Bitcoin accumulation under a new reserve model. The goal of this strategy is to enhance long-term net asset value and align the Company with global trends in institutional digital asset adoption. Universal Digital views Bitcoin as a complementary reserve asset and plans to implement the strategy in a transparent and phased manner. As part of this initiative, the Company plans to collaborate with publicly-listed companies across Asia to implement Bitcoin treasury models, leveraging the region’s growing institutional and retail interest in digital assets and its increasing openness to blockchain-based financial innovation. According to Chainalysis, Eastern Asia accounted for approximately 8.9% of global on-chain cryptocurrency transaction volume between July 2023 and June 2024, with the bulk of activity driven by institutional and professional investors in markets like Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In furtherance of this regional focus, on June 12, 2025, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with GFA Co., Ltd. (“GFA”), a Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed diversified financial and technology group (TSE: 8783). The MOU sets out a partnership framework for jointly advancing Bitcoin-based corporate finance models in Japan. Under the MOU, the companies will jointly explore: Introducing Bitcoin reserve models to Japanese listed companies; Structuring capital raising tools such as warrants and market-based offerings to fund Bitcoin acquisitions; and Enhancing governance, investor relations, and custody frameworks for digital assets. The MOU also sets the stage for broader collaboration in Japan’s digital economy, including joint investments in public companies, the development of blockchain-based corporate structures, initiatives that connect Bitcoin adoption with cultural IP and Web3-driven consumer ecosystems. The MOU was entered on an arm’s length basis and there are no related party interests between Universal Digital and GFA. “Our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy marks a deliberate shift in how we manage capital — by holding Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset, we aim to enhance balance sheet strength and align with the evolving global financial landscape,” said Tim Chan, CEO of the Company. “The framework we’ve established with GFA enables us to explore extending this model to Asia, where digital assets are gaining traction among public companies and institutional investors.” “Universal Digital’s and its management’s experience with the crypto and Bitcoin treasury combined with our expertise on the Japanese markets makes us a strong team. I look forward to working closely with Universal Digital to introduce bitcoin reserve model to Japanese listed companies.” Stated Gen Matsuda, CEO of GFA Co., Ltd. The MOU is non-binding and provides a framework for further negotiations and joint structuring discussions. About Universal Digital Inc.

2025-06-16T14:31:21,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: Weak Volume Could Be a Warning Sign – Or a Perfect Setup","The Trump Coin price has recovered to $10.13 today , after a weekend that saw cryptocurrency prices decline in response to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran . Despite this, TRUMP remains down by 2% in a week and by 19% in the past month, with the meme token also nursing a steep 86% loss since reaching an ATH of $73.43 in January. These are concerning percentages, and what’s also troubling is that TRUMP’s trading volume currently stands at a lowly $213 million, a 99.4% decline from peaks recorded back in January. It’s therefore arguable that TRUMP is suffering from a terminal decline, although its low volume and liquidity could enable it to pump hard if a whale swoops in. Trump Coin Price Prediction: Weak Volume Could Be a Warning Sign – Or a Perfect Setup Looking at TRUMP’s chart, we at least see that the coin may be close to bottoming out, implying that a rally could be on its way. Of particular note is its 30-period average (orange), which formed a death cross with the 200-period (blue) at the start of June. Source: TradingView We also see that TRUMP’s relative strength index (purple) has been below 50 since the final third of May, which again points to an approaching recovery. On the other hand, the aforementioned low volume is a big issue, and indicates a serious lack of interest in the meme token. In fact, we’ve seen evidence of big traders shorting the token in recent weeks , while one-time whales have declined to repurchase the token while buying other meme coins . This is all very ominous for the coin, and would suggest that it doesn’t have long-term viability. However, given Donald Trump’s penchant for self-promotion, we can’t rule out the possibility that he and/or his team will announce something big to pump the token in the coming days or weeks. $TRUMP Fractal Signals Huge Upside? TRUMP is showing the same setup that led $PEPE to a 934% rally. Read Details: https://t.co/5nnEfx5PBv pic.twitter.com/bQWTxRPIs0 — CoinsProbe (@CoinsProbe) June 13, 2025 The Trump Coin price could potentially return to $12 in the next few weeks, before passing $16 by the end of July. It will need more favorable macroeconomic and political conditions to achieve this, while it will also need its trading volume to improve, but it’s certainly not out of the question. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $1.3 Million for Cutting-Edge Layer-Two Network Because TRUMP looks pretty questionable right now, many traders may already want to turn to alternatives, with several presale coins showing promise as investment vehicles. One of these is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum- and Solana-based layer-two project that has now raised more than $1.3 million in its ongoing sale. Given that it launched this sale only a few weeks ago, this figure is a strong sign of Bitcoin Hyper’s future potential. Indeed, Bitcoin Hyper is preparing to launch a layer-two for Bitcoin that will reduce the latter’s transaction fees while massively boosting its throughput. It’s basically aiming to become a big DeFi layer for Bitcoin, with the L2 introducing a range of dapps and DEXes that will attract significant trading volume. Its protocol will operate using zero-knowledge proofs, while it will also make use of Ethereum and Solana virtual machines, for maximum compatibility. As its native token, HYPER will be necessary to pay for transaction fees, while it will also be open to staking and governance. It could therefore grow massively upon launch, with investors able to join its sale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a wallet. HYPER currently costs $0.0119, but this will rise later today, and will continue to rise periodically until the sale ends.

2025-06-16T14:30:13,"Analyst Sees Ethereum (ETH) Igniting 60% Rally Despite Dip, Says Final Major Resistance for Bitcoin (BTC) Getting Weaker","A widely followed crypto analyst and trader says that Ethereum ( ETH ) could skyrocket by 60% despite its recent downturn. In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,400 followers on the social media platform X that the top altcoin is holding a key level that has historically sparked rallies afterwards. “Ethereum continues to maintain $2,500 as support despite the dip. Historically, holding $2500 as support has enabled moves to $4,000 over time. Ethereum needs to keep demonstrating stability here, just like it has done for the past five weeks now.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum is trading for $2,517 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day. A rise to Rekt Capital’s price target would be about a 60% increase for ETH. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, the analyst says Bitcoin ( BTC ) last line of resistance appears to be getting weaker after the crypto king closed last week above $105,000. “Bitcoin has rejected from the final major weekly resistance. But how strong will this rejection be? Rejection from a few weeks ago caused a -8% dip. Thus far, this rejection caused a -5.8% dip. If this dip is shallower, resistance [is] getting weaker.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The trader also notes that the best thing for the crypto king’s price tag is to avoid a daily close below $106,000, followed by a subsequent rejection. “On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin found support at this local green area yesterday. What price needs to avoid doing is daily closing below the green box and rejecting from it like in the previous red circle.” Source: Rekt Capital/X BTC is trading for $106,788 at time of writing, an over 1% increase on the day.

2025-06-16T14:30:00,"Could Bitcoin Power the Future of Stablecoin Payments?","USD1, a stablecoin by World Liberty Financial, reached a $2.1 billion market cap just 60 days after its 2025 launch. It outpaced the early growth of USDT and USDC. Its success has revived interest in using Bitcoin as a settlement layer for stablecoins . The rapid rise of stablecoins, particularly World Liberty Financial’s USD1, is reshaping industry conversations. Launched in March 2025, USD1 reached a $2.1 billion market cap within just two months, an explosive debut that’s drawn renewed attention to Bitcoin’s potential as a host for stablecoin payment rails. According to a blog post by crypto analyst Norbert, USD1’s growth is fueling broader speculation about Bitcoin evolving from a store of value into a transactional backbone for digital dollars.

2025-06-16T14:22:22,"Justin Sun’s Tron to Go Public in the US: Report","The report by the Financial Times on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter, informs that the Justin Sun-founded blockchain project has partnered with Dominari Securities, an investment firm with ties to the US President, Donald Trump, to manage the deal. The joint entity will buy and hold Tron’s native token, TRX, in a move that will resemble, to a large extent, what Michael Saylor’s Strategy is doing with Bitcoin. Eric Trump, one of the POTUS’s sons, will have a role in the new firm, although the FT didn’t provide any specifics. These developments are in stark contrast to Justin Sun’s history with the former presidential administration and the Gary Gensler-led SEC. Just over two years ago, Sun and his companies were charged by the securities watchdog for fraud and other law violations. However, the Tron founder has established a closer and friendlier relationship with the 47th US President, Donald Trump. Recall that the blockchain executive attended a special dinner event organized by Trump’s team for the largest holders of Official Trump, the meme coin linked to the President. Sun has been openly praising the current administration, saying in an interview with CoinDesk after the TRUMP dinner that haters should really pay attention to what’s going on in the US.

Here Are the Latest Entries into Bitcoin and Ethereum","Despite geopolitical tensions weighing on risky assets, digital asset investment products saw new inflows worth $1.9 billion last week. Digital Asset Investments Strengthen with $1.9 Billion Inflows Despite Geopolitical Tensions With this figure, positive inflows were experienced for the ninth consecutive week, while total net inflows in 2025 reached a new record level of 13.2 billion dollars. Bitcoin is on the rise again: Bitcoin, which experienced a strong inflow of $1.3 billion after two weeks of mild increases, showed that investors are regaining confidence. Short Bitcoin products also saw limited inflows of $3.7 million, but the total assets under management of these products remain at $96 million. Ethereum’s biggest weekly inflow since February: Ethereum products had their strongest weekly performance of the year last week with net inflows of $583 million, a rise that made up the latest batch of inflows totaling $2 billion, accounting for 14% of the asset under management. Interest in altcoins is increasing again: XRP, which has experienced three consecutive weeks of growth, saw an inflow of $11.8 million in investors; Sui products also saw a positive flow of $3.5 million. The US stood out in regional distribution: Almost all of the total inflows came from US-based investors ($1.9 billion), while Switzerland ($20.7 million), Germany ($39.2 million) and Canada ($12.1 million) also made positive contributions. On the other hand, Hong Kong and Brazil experienced outflows of $56.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Resistance parallel to gold: It seems that digital assets, just like gold, are beginning to be perceived as a “safe haven” in a geopolitical risk environment. Analysts state that investors have increased their interest in crypto assets in the face of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. These data show that digital assets are becoming an increasingly attractive and resilient alternative for institutional investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-16T14:17:50,"Trump’s Truth Social joins ETF race with dual Bitcoin and Ethereum product","Truth Social’s newly filed ETF aims to simplify crypto investing by bundling BTC and ETH. Sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, could this be the next big ETF approval? On June 16, Truth Social operator, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., announced that it has filed a registration statement on Form S‑1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a dual exchange-traded fund combining Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exposure. The fund, Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, will comprise 75% of assets invested in BTC and 25% in ETH, offering investors a single-ticker way to gain exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. According to the statement, the ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital and custodied by Crypto.com, which will also handle staking and liquidity services. If approved, shares would debut on NYSE Arca under the ticker B.T., marking a major step in Trump Media’s expansion into financial services. You might also like: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as investors bet on Israel-Iran peace deal Why a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF? Truth Social’s decision to bundle into one fund, rather than launching separate products, can be seen as a strategic move betting on market trends and investor psychology. While standalone Bitcoin ETFs have dominated inflows since their January 2024 debut, demand for Ethereum exposure has quietly surged, with institutions eyeing ETH’s staking yields and deflationary tokenomics. With a 75% BTC / 25% ETH split, Truth Social’s B.T. fund will allow investors to benefit from simplified exposure to both “digital gold” and the utility-rich world of Ethereum without juggling separate issuers, custodians, or learning the different mechanics needed to balance the two volatile assets manually. But the subtext is unmistakably political. Unlike BlackRock, WisdomTree, or Fidelity’s vanilla crypto ETFs, the B.T. fund arrives wrapped in the Trump Media ecosystem, tapping into a base that views cryptocurrency as both an investment and a rebellion against traditional finance. Because the B.T. fund is steeped in both Trump branding and post-election optics, its approval process could ignite a highly politicized debate about crypto’s role in regulated markets. Some may champion it as an innovation, while skeptics will accuse it of weaponizing financial products for political gain. Either way, B.T. stands poised to become a litmus test, not just for enabling broader crypto adoption, but for defining how far politics can extend into finance.

The new addition followed Michael Saylor’s X message on preferring “bigger orange dots,” representing larger purchases. Strategy tapped over $1B for its weekly BTC purchase, acquiring 10,100 BTC after a few weeks of smaller inflows. The latest purchase is bigger than the entire treasury of Metaplanet . During a volatile week, Strategy acquired BTC at an average price of $104,080. The purchase followed a pre-announcement by Michael Saylor, in spite of the short-term volatility. Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 $BTC acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/n7q77DmqCY — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 16, 2025 Saylor remains the most relevant corporate BTC accumulator The latest purchase raised the average purchase price for Strategy to $70,666, with the total BTC treasury expanding to 592,100 BTC. In total, Strategy has already spent over $41.8B for its treasury, remaining the leader in total holdings among corporate treasuries. Strategy still lags behind the holdings of BlackRock’s ETF, extending above 669K BTC. ETFs remain the more active and faster buyers, but the wallets are more volatile and also have days of rapid outflows. Saylor, on the other hand, is committed to long-term holding. In terms of BTC per share, Strategy is also ahead of other corporate buyers, with 20X the coins per share compared to Metaplanet . As usual, Saylor’s moves inspired other corporate buyers, increasing both the treasuries and the number of companies announcing acquisitions. It has also spilled over into altcoins, with small companies aiming to boost their shares by announcing SOL or XRP treasuries. Still, Strategy remains the undisputed leader with the most significant exposure to BTC. Bitcoin purchases help MSTR stabilize For companies building BTC treasuries, one of the effects is a positive move for the stock price. In the case of MSTR, the shares recovered above $382, retaining the higher baseline just under $400. MSTR shares recovered close to $400, though still waiting for a breakout to new highs. | Source: Google Finance MSTR is closely watched for a potential recovery and a stronger rally, as it now trades below the all-time high of $473.83 achieved on November 20, 2024. MSTR has seen lower volumes in the past few weeks, though the shares are still seen as outperforming. MSTR has also acquired partial meme status, with traders going long in expectation of ongoing rallies. Strategy is also making its structure more complex, with additional sales of convertible perpetual stock. Its BTC treasury approach continues to face criticism for creating systemic risk, which may spill over to the stock market. The latest purchase followed three rounds of share sales, with no new MSTR issued. Saylor raised $48.4M from STRK shares, and another $30M from STRF. The latest issue of preferred stock also means no new dilution for MSTR holders. Strategy has over $18B to deploy through common stock issuance, though the last few operations happened through preferred stock sales. Previously, Strategy also completed the round of its new convertible Stride (STRD) shares with 10% dividend, raising over $979M. The round allowed the firm to accelerate its buying, after two relatively slow weeks of BTC additions.

2025-06-16T14:06:26,"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as investors bet on Israel-Iran peace deal","Global stocks edged slightly higher on Monday, June 16, as investors appeared upbeat about a limited escalation of the Israel–Iran conflict. Risk assets were higher in early trading on Wall Street after the Israeli attack on Iran prompted Tehran to respond with missile strikes on Tel Aviv and other locations. Despite the initial negative reaction in the stock market , futures rose as the new week began with optimism that Middle East tensions would not escalate into a full-blown war. This sentiment saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average open 250 points, or 0.6%, higher, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite opened 1% higher. U.S. equities edging higher also coincided with a spike in Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the global crypto market capitalization increased 2.4% over $3.2 trillion.

The flagship cryptocurrency maintained its position above $105,000 despite facing selling pressure, indicating that traders are buying the dip. Analysts have predicted that BTC will decline thanks to the ongoing Middle East crisis but will register a strong rebound if tensions de-escalate. Metaplanet Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced the purchase of 1,112 BTC , taking its total holdings past the 10,000 BTC mark. The company made its latest acquisition at an average price of $105,000 per coin, making the total purchase worth $117 million. The average purchase price for Metaplanet’s holdings is $96,000 per Bitcoin. The latest acquisition has taken the firm past Coinbase’s 9,627 BTC , according to data from Bitbo. The latest purchase comes after the firm became the eighth largest holder of the asset, and the same day it announced that its board of directors planned to raise $210 million via no-interest bonds to buy more Bitcoin . Metaplanet has drastically revised its Bitcoin strategy in recent months and plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The company’s stock has also soared following the announcements, rallying over 22% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Metaplanet’s stock has seen an increase of over 417% year-to-date. Crypto ETPs Register Inflows As Bitcoin Rebounds Crypto investment products continued their inflow streak as Bitcoin (BTC) crossed $110,000 last week, while Ethereum (ETH) briefly crossed $2,800. Global crypto exchange-traded products registered inflows worth $1.9 billion the week ending Friday. The products have registered inflows for nine consecutive weeks, taking the total to $12.9 billion, according to data from CoinShares. The latest inflows mean crypto ETPs have registered a historic record of year-to-date inflows worth $13.2 billion. Meanwhile, the total assets under management in crypto ETPs rose from $175 billion to $179 billion. Bitcoin investment products led the inflows, registering $1.3 billion in inflows, while Short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $3.7 million. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the week positively as the flagship cryptocurrency brushed off a sluggish weekend to rise above $107,000 on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $107,263. BTC has traded downwards since crossing $110,000 last week. While analysts and investors expected a move to new all-time highs, geopolitical tensions sent the price into bearish territory. BTC , which was already losing momentum on Wednesday, plunged nearly 3% on Thursday, dropping to $105,828. Despite growing bearish sentiment, BTC maintained its position above $105,000 over the weekend, indicating that traders are buying the dip. BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday as it plunged to a low of $102,832. Price action remained bearish and subdued over the weekend as buyers struggled to gain a foothold. On the other hand, crude oil prices rose over 14%, while gold rose nearly 2%. However, analysts expect BTC to bounce back after a period of decline. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder, and chief operating officer at RedStone, stated that the attack and market sell-off caught traders off-guard, highlighting significant liquidations across Bitcoin futures. “Bitcoin dropped as much as 5% to $102,900, falling below the psychologically important $103,000 level. Ethereum shed even more, declining almost 7.6% at its worst point.” However, he highlighted that similar incidents in the past were followed by strong rebounds, referring to a similar scenario in April 2024. “Those moments turned out to be great buying opportunities. However, the current situation carries higher stakes given Israel’s direct targeting of Iran’s nuclear program and vows to continue operations indefinitely.” While the flagship cryptocurrency is showing signs of a recovery, it is forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting growing indecision among buyers and sellers. However, while there is near-term uncertainty, analysts and traders are bullish on the long-term prospects of BTC , expecting the price to rally past $140,000 and higher. Popular trader Alan Tardigrade stated on X, “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge. This pattern has recently formed for weeks and is expected to reach $170k levels.” BTC registered a marginal drop on Tuesday (June 3) and fell nearly 1% on Wednesday, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. BTC rallied on Monday, surging over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251.

Vietnam Legalizes Crypto Under New Law Vietnam’s National Assembly has approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry, effectively bringing digital assets under regulatory oversight. The legislation will come into effect January 1, 2026, and lays the groundwork for broader digital innovation across the country. It clarifies digital assets into two categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both asset types require encryption or digital technologies for validation and transfers. However, neither includes securities, digital fiat currencies, or other financial instruments. The government must outline specific business conditions, classifications, and oversight mechanisms for the asset types. The new law also mandates cybersecurity and anti-money laundering safeguards in line with international requirements, likely to address concerns raised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The legislation also outlines Vietnam’s ambitions to become a global tech and digital powerhouse. It introduces incentives for companies working on AI, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. These incentives include tax breaks, land-use benefits, and R&D support, particularly for firms building core technologies like chip design and AI data centers. The Vietnamese government released a statement saying, “With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry.” Michael Saylor Indicates Imminent Bitcoin Purchase Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has suggested a Bitcoin (BTC) purchase may be imminent. Saylor posted the Bitcoin chart that typically indicates the company is about to make a big BTC purchase. The move comes despite mounting geopolitical tensions and an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Saylor posted the chart signaling an impending purchase with the following quote, “Bigger Dots are ₿etter.” Strategy currently holds 582,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder of the asset. Saylor’s intention to make another BTC purchase indicates growing investor confidence in the asset. The asset’s price has held steady at around $105,000 despite worsening market sentiment, suggesting strong support at lower levels. However, price action could be impacted if the conflict escalates and impacts energy prices. Invesco, Galaxy Register Solana ETF Trust Invesco and Galaxy Digital have confirmed the registration of a trust in Delaware for the proposed Solana ETF. The move marks the first steps towards launching a Solana ETF in the United States. However, the registration does not guarantee a listing or approval. The ETF structure mirrors filings by VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and others in recent months as asset managers expand to crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH. Delaware security trusts are generally used for commodity and digital asset funds. The registration sets the stage for an eventual S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a 19b-4 submission through a national exchange. A Solana ETF would give investors access to the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the market without the complexities of managing a private wallet. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Stays In Greed Territory The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks the overall sentiment in the crypto market, remained in “greed” despite rising geopolitical tensions and an escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict. The index registered a score of 60 on Sunday, maintaining its position in the greed territory despite BTC declining to $103,000 over the weekend. The update came after Israel launched strikes on Tehran, with Iran reportedly retaliating on Friday. While maintaining its position in the “greed” territory, the index has declined from 71 on Thursday. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week positively, with the price up over 1% during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $106,000 during the current session after a sluggish weekend during which BTC struggled to maintain its position above $105,000. BTC has traded mostly in the red since Thursday as it lost momentum after crossing $110,000. Despite sluggishness and bearish sentiment, BTC has maintained its position above $105,000, suggesting that traders are buying the dip. However, some analysts believe BTC will see a notable drop due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. With the prospect of a regional war increasing, BTC and other cryptocurrencies are feeling the pressure. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp decline on Friday and remained in bearish territory over the weekend as buyers struggled to gain a foothold. Meanwhile, crude oil prices rose over 14%, and gold rose nearly 2%, a typical trend during Middle East tensions. However, analysts expect BTC and the broader crypto market to bounce back after a decline. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder, and chief operating officer at RedStone, stated that the attack and market sell-off caught traders off-guard, highlighting significant liquidations across Bitcoin futures. “Bitcoin dropped as much as 5% to $102,900, falling below the psychologically important $103,000 level. Ethereum shed even more, declining almost 7.6% at its worst point.” However, he highlighted that similar incidents in the past were followed by strong rebounds, referring to a similar scenario in April 2024. “Those moments turned out to be great buying opportunities. However, the current situation carries higher stakes given Israel’s direct targeting of Iran’s nuclear program and vows to continue operations indefinitely.” Meanwhile, analysts at Bitunix have a different view and believe BTC will benefit from the conflict, with investors viewing it as a safe asset. An analyst explained in a note to investors, “The conflict between Israel and Iran has pushed up the demand for risk aversion, and short-term geopolitical conflict risk aversion capital may flow into the crypto asset market. If geopolitical conflicts continue to rise, we cannot rule out the possibility of Bitcoin challenging the $110,350 liquidity target.” However, traders and analysts are unanimous about a new all-time high, with many feeling BTC will surge to new highs after a consolidation phase. Popular trader Alan Tardigade stated on X, “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge. This pattern has recently formed for weeks and is expected to reach $170k levels.” BTC’s price action turned bearish on Tuesday (June 3) when it fell 0.44% to $105,436.

2025-06-16T13:58:40,"Can Hyperliquid rise to $50 in June?","Hyperliquid continues to display strong bullish momentum after breaking into all-time high territory. With consistent higher highs and higher lows, price action remains firmly bullish, and a Fibonacci extension now points to $50 as the next upside objective. Hyperliquid ( Hype ) has sustained an exceptionally clean uptrend since establishing a macro swing low. Price action has remained impulsive throughout, forming consecutive higher lows and higher highs on all timeframes. Now trading above both the $34 support region and ATH levels, technical indicators remain aligned for further upside, with $50 marked as the next key level if current strength continues. Key technical points Strong Support at $34: The $34 region, previously resistance, is now confirmed support with multiple counter-closes, aligning with the value area high. 20-Day MA Acting as Dynamic Support: The 20-day moving average is tracking below price and holding as support, offering structure for a higher low. Fibonacci Extension Targets $50: A trend-based 0.618 Fibonacci extension projects $50 as the next key level, assuming price holds above ATH. HYPEUSDT (2D) Chart, Source: TradingView After an aggressive rally off the swing low, Hyperliquid has reclaimed and held key levels, particularly the $34 zone, which has now flipped into support. This level is in confluence with the value area high from the prior trading range and has seen several daily candle closes above it. This signals clear buyer commitment and reaffirms the region as a structurally important floor. Adding strength to the bullish case is the 20-day moving average, which continues to rise in tandem with price. Price action is currently using this moving average as dynamic trend support, confirming that the uptrend remains intact. As long as this level is respected, the structural expectation leans toward another leg higher. You might also like: XRP’s 2025 outlook: Potential peaks, exit timing, and an emerging challenger With price now trading above its former ATH, traders are turning to Fibonacci-based targets to project the next move. A 0.618 trend-based extension, measured from the most recent swing low to the ATH breakout, gives a clean upside target of $50. This aligns with the pace of the current rally and will remain valid as long as support levels, particularly $34, continue to hold. What to expect in the coming price action Hyperliquid remains technically strong. As long as price stays above the $34 support region and confirms daily closes above ATH, the path toward $50 becomes increasingly probable. Unless market structure shifts, the current rally appears poised to continue in the immediate short term.

2025-06-16T13:57:50,"Kidnappers Beat Crypto Influencer, Then Let Him Go As They Find Out He’s Broke","A 26-year-old TikTok crypto influencer was kidnapped and beaten in Essonne, France over the weekend, only to be released after his attackers discovered he didn’t have the crypto funds they were after. Key Takeaways: A TikTok crypto influencer was kidnapped in France but released after his wallet was found nearly empty. France is seeing a rise in “$5 wrench attacks”—physical assaults targeting crypto holders for ransom. Experts warn that crypto ransoms are often futile, as transactions are traceable and funds can be frozen. According to a report from Europe1 , four men abducted the influencer and demanded a ransom of €50,000 ($58,000), to be paid in cryptocurrency. However, after checking his digital wallet and finding it nearly empty, they let him go. Surge in “$5 Wrench Attacks” Targeting Crypto Holders The case adds to a growing trend of “$5 wrench attacks,” a term coined in crypto circles to describe the use of physical violence to bypass digital security. France has seen a surge in such crimes. MP Paul Midy recently introduced a bill aiming to prevent public figures in the crypto space from being easily located via official registries. This weekend’s attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. Authorities arrested twelve suspects in that case, including individuals tied to other kidnapping attempts across the city. Earlier this month, police captured the alleged mastermind behind several crypto-targeted kidnappings. The man, wanted by Interpol, had been linked to multiple cases involving crypto ransom demands. Wallet manufacturer Trezor weighed in on the recent surge in crypto-motivated attacks, calling the kidnappers “misguided.” A 26 year old TikTok influencer was kidnapped by 4 men in… you guessed it… France but was released after they realized he didn’t have as much money as he said he did online. Fake PnL screenshots are never worth it pic.twitter.com/PMDmGbTYxG — Beau (@beausecurity) June 15, 2025 The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions are traceable and that stablecoins like USDT can be frozen or reversed, offering little utility for criminals. Trezor cited the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland, whose ransom was demanded in USDT. Authorities ultimately recovered 95% of the funds. France has become a hotspot for these crimes, with 14 out of 50 global wrench attacks recorded there over the past year. Moroccan police this week arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials. Crypto Execs Hire Bodyguards Amid Influencer Kidnapping Concerns As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnapping. The rise in inquiries came a after spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnappings attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement.

2025-06-16T13:56:31,"Trump Media and Technology Group Files to Launch Spot Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF","Trump Media, the US President-linked company operating Truth Social, Truth+, and TruthFi, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a combined ETF tracking the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. If approved, the financial vehicle will hold BTC and ETH directly, with 75% of its AUM going toward the leading digital asset, while the remaining 25% will be for the largest altcoin. Today’s press release by the Trump Media Group confirms previous reports that Crypto.com will serve as the exclusive BTC and ETH custodian of the ETF. Moreover, the exchange will be “prime execution agent, as well as staking and liquidity provider.” Yorkville America Digital will be the ETF’s sponsor, which wil be listed on the NYSE Arca if approved by the US SEC. The announcement distinguished the proposed ETF from being called a “security,” as the Shares “may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.” The US securities watchdog has a new and friendlier leadership under the Trump administration, which raises the chances of a potential green light. The current POTUS has undertaken a highly different approach when it comes down to the crypto industry, and one of the companies linked to him filing to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF is just another addition to the growing pro-digital asset initiatives .

The total crypto trading volume is at $76.7 billion, nearly half of what we’ve been seeing in the latter part of last week. TLDR: The crypto market has turned green, with nearly all top 100 coins recording increases; While initially impacted by Iran’s attack on Israel, the market has seen an uptick today; Bitcoin is recovering, reclaiming the $106,000 level, still climbing at press time; Sentiment is still retreating towards the fear zone; Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility; US spot ETH ETFs broke their 18-days inflow streak, spot BTC ETFs recorded $301.62 million in inflows; The rally has the potential to continue, but keep an eye on geopolitical developments.

Traders Aggressively Positioning for Upside or Volatility Analysts at Glassnode have found that BTC 25 Delta Skew (a metric focusing on option contracts expiring in one week) has turned bullish. “Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility,” they commented today. Over the past week, $BTC 25 Delta Skew has flipped decisively bullish – especially in short-dated options – despite a slight price decline. 1-week: -2.6% → +10.1% 1-month: -2.2% → +4.9% Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility. pic.twitter.com/8R3TvckxUp — glassnode (@glassnode) June 16, 2025 They also noted that demand growth is keeping pace with BTC’s maturation, describing it as “an impressive sign of sustained investor appetite.” Others were focused on the regulatory impacts. Przemysław Kral, the CEO of the zondacrypto exchange, commented on the regulations opening doors to massive players to enter the space – but also their drawbacks. “Regulations attract major players to the market,” he said. MiCA is a major one. It does impose limitations, but these are necessary for crypto to go mainstream. “However, we’re already seeing one major systemic drawback of MiCA,” says the CEO. “If you wanted to start a crypto business from scratch today, MiCA makes that impossible. The directive’s requirements can only be met by large, established players. So, the resolution has eliminated my competition. MiCA cements and consolidates the market.” That said, MiCA offers a level playing field. Until now, any exchange in Europe could choose the “softest” jurisdiction and compete on cost rather than quality, he says. “Now, everyone must meet the same security standards, so users benefit.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,734. At the time of writing, this is the highest 24-hour point, up from the intraday low of $104,627. Also, it’s currently down 4.6% from the all-time high of $111,814. It’s trying to hold the current level so to attempt higher points. Notably, BTC’s overall stability holds despite headlines about retail and banking giants (potentially) launching stablecoins, which may be seen as bearish for BTC. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum, currently trading at $2,615, pulled itself up from its intraday low of $2,494. At the time of writing, it’s still rising to retake the $2,500 zone and possibly continue upwards. Moving above $2,630 would open doors for the $2,700 level. However, dropping below $2,570 could lead to further downside. Notably, it was revealed on Friday that SharpLink Gaming became the largest publicly traded ETH holder after purchasing 176,271 ETH. Moreover, Ethereum whales increased their exposure to the asset over the past month, while smaller investors decided to sell during price stagnation. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH added 1.49 million ETH over the past 30 days – a 3.72% increase. Also, as reported on Sunday, a whale purchased 48,825 ETH at an average price of nearly $2,605, taking advantage of the recent dip. There are currently 6,392 wallets holding between 1K and 100K Ethereum. Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit.

Currently, it’s still standing within the neutral zone, but it has fallen from 54 seen on Friday to 50 today . If fear starts pushing prices down, it may create buying opportunities for both new and existing investors.

Of this amount, BlackRock saw $238.99 million. Others are in green as well, albeit with smaller amounts. However, US ETH spot ETFs broke their 19-day inflow streak on Friday with $2.18 million in outflows. Grayscale took in $6.67 million, and Fidelity bled out $8.85 million. Others saw no flows. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market turned another green corner over the past 24 hours. Stocks were down on their previous workday. The S&P 500 decreased by 1.13% by Friday closing time, the Nasdaq-100 was down 1.29%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.79%. This was the result of the tensions between Israel and Iran, and Israel’s subsequent attack on Iranian cities and population. Is this rally sustainable? The short answer is yes, but there are ‘buts’. This uptick is a continuation of the rally that led to BTC hitting an ATH in May. It will continue to see short-term pullbacks, as is typical. However, the prices may be more significantly hit by escalating geopolitical issues.

2025-06-16T13:45:00,"VanEck Analyst Warns of “Extractive Dilution” as Semler’s Stock Falters and Metaplanet Rallies","A sharp divergence is emerging between Bitcoin-holding companies like Semler and Metaplanet. Investors are punishing firms that trade below their Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Japan’s Metaplanet is succeeding after acquiring 10,000 BTC with sharp execution. A stark divide is emerging among public companies with Bitcoin on their balance sheets. As BTC hovers near all-time highs, investors are rewarding firms with aggressive yet well-aligned BTC strategies, while penalizing those perceived to be mismanaging treasury growth or shareholder value. The divergence is being reflected not just in price charts, but in company fundamentals, most notably in the growing focus on market cap to net asset value (NAV) ratios.

2025-06-16T13:43:09,"Interesting Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late","TL;DR Industry participants believe XRP could soon break out, targeting $2.80 and even $8. One X user speculated that Ripple might secure a banking license, spreading additional enthusiasm across the community. Explosion Brewing? The price of Ripple’s cross-border token might be down on a weekly and monthly scale, but multiple analysts remain optimistic that a bull run could be on the way. The popular X user CRYPTOWZRD claimed that an explosion might be “brewing,” envisioning a bullish breakout to as high as $2.80. Currently, XRP trades at around $2.23 (according to CoinGecko’s data), and such a move would represent a 25% increase. Several hours later, the analyst chipped in again. They suggested that the asset’s price dynamics would be heavily influenced by Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming week, adding that geopolitical conditions will continue to play a key role. Crypto Beast, who has over 700,000 followers on the social media platform X, argued that XRP hasn’t yet reached its market peak, setting a minimum target of $8. They reminded about the developments in the case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing they might cause a further price spike for XRP. “XRP holders are about to make A LOT of money. When it’s time to sell, I will announce it here publicly,” they added. Awaiting These News The legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC has seemingly reached its final point , but an official conclusion is yet to be announced . Last week, both sides announced a proposed deal to settle the remaining financial aspects of the case. Under the deal, Ripple would pay $50 million to the SEC, while $75 million held in escrow would be returned to the crypto firm. To finalize the matter, the entities requested that the magistrates remove the August 2024 injunction tied to the original $125 million penalty. Back then, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple had breached certain securities laws. Some XRP proponents have speculated that the case could finally become history today (June 16). However, as of this writing, there isn’t anything official yet. The X user John Squire spread another rumor. He suggested that Ripple might secure a banking license and turn into “a full-on bank.” Such a development would likely have a positive impact on the company’s native cryptocurrency, with Squire wondering whether it could become “the new financial backbone.” The post Interesting Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/interesting-ripple-xrp-price-predictions-as-of-late/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price",cryptocompare

2025-06-16T13:30:54,"Bitcoin Gears Up For A Major Surge Amid Fading Whale Sentiment","Bitcoin has taken a hit after its recent surge to the $110,000 price mark last week, as the market shifted toward a more bullish sentiment. While BTC has fallen sharply from this level, its price is still holding strong above the $100,000 threshold. With BTC’s current resilience, market experts are predicting an impending rally even as optimism wanes among key investors. A Massive Rally Brewing For Bitcoin As Bitcoin’s price moves toward a bullish direction again, Trader Tardigrade, a technical expert and investor, foresees an impending notable bounce in the short term. BTC’s price action in the 1-hour time frame shows that the asset is poised for a bullish run due to past trends. In his analysis shared on the X platform, the expert highlighted that BTC is trending upward in a key chart pattern, particularly an Ascending Broadening Wedge formation. The emergence of this chart is an indication of a resurgence of Bitcoin’s recent upswing above the $100,000 threshold. Looking at Trader Tardigrade’s chart, the crucial setup has appeared multiple times since 2023. Each time the formation emerged, it has preceded a notable upward move, increasing the likelihood of an upsurge. With the pattern reappearing once again, the analyst is confident that a similar result could unfold, pushing Bitcoin’s price toward unprecedented levels . This trend suggests that the ongoing bearish action is a healthy retrace as the flagship asset looks toward making another historical move. According to Trader Tardigrade, the ascending broadening wedge formation has formed for weeks, indicating growing momentum. Considering the robust performance and past scenarios, the analyst expects the pattern to trigger a major spike to the $170,000 milestone. In the 4-hour time frame, crypto expert Ali Martinez also highlighted that Bitcoin is trending within an ascending triangle pattern. An Ascending triangle pattern is considered a bullish continuation setup, which suggests a possible rise in price. Martinez believes that a close above the upper line of the pattern at $106,100 or below $104,800 is likely to determine the subsequent direction of the next breakout . BTC Whales Are Stepping Back Even as Bitcoin’s price prepares for a major rally, whale investors appear to be stepping back. Ali Martinez revealed in a post on X that wallet addresses holding over 1,000 BTC have begun to reduce their holdings. Data shows that these key holders have been persistently declining since BTC recently reached a new all-time high in May. This waning sentiment among large investors indicates weakening confidence in BTC’s current uptrend or a shift toward a more cautious stance. However, this behavior may pave the way for renewed accumulation for lesser or retail investors . Historically, persistent buying pressure from retail holders has preceded short-term spikes, which signal a possible brief upside move for Bitcoin.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-eye-a-major-surge/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|Ali Martinez|Ascending Broadening Wedge Pattern|Ascending Triangle Pattern|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|bitcoin whales|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Trader Tardigrade",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T13:30:36,"Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What’s Next","Bitcoin’s current trading range is all part of a consolidation move before a return above $110,000. Although the leading cryptocurrency has largely held above the $105,000 support zones in recent days, its rally has taken a hit in the past two weeks. Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action, when overlapped with the Global M2 Money Supply metric, shows that it is only a matter of time before it enters into a new all-time high. Global M2 Offset Models Says Something Interesting According to a detailed post by crypto analyst Colin, also known as “The M2 Guy,” on the social media platform X, Bitcoin’s price action appears to be tracking the global M2 money supply with a high degree of correlation when the data is offset by 68 to 76 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Two separate charts presented by Colin reveal this trend vividly, showing how Bitcoin price movements have followed the trajectory of the Global M2 Money Supply when adjusted for time. The short-term 68-day offset chart aligns closely with Bitcoin’s behavior since April 2025, while the 76-day offset chart offers a longer-term view of the relationship. In both cases, the analyst highlighted that the M2 curve is pointing upward, where Bitcoin has yet to play out, implying a similarly bullish trajectory for its price action. Colin describes this as a form of confluence, noting that when two correlated indicators show the same directional outcome, the probability of that outcome increases. Particularly, the average correlation across both charts is around 76.6 to 76.9%, both of which are very high and lend statistical weight to the prediction. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? The 68-day offset chart shows Bitcoin trailing the M2 curve with high precision since April, with the highest 89.9% degree of accuracy on the 90-day timeframe. Similarly, the 76-day offset, while less accurate in the short term, displays a strong correlation over longer intervals of 92.2% over one and a half years and 86.2% across two years. These correlation values shows that Bitcoin is increasingly sensitive to global liquidity trends, especially now that its price movement is tied to inflows/outflows surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? This relationship becomes even more notable considering the M2 money supply itself has been climbing within a rising channel. If the alignment continues, Bitcoin may soon follow suit, lifting it back above the $110,000 level and breaking above its all-time high. Bitcoin’s price action will be very interesting to follow in the next few days. In Colin’s view, this next move up is not only likely but could happen within days. If Bitcoin follows this alignment, the projection shows that Bitcoin will continue to move within a channel of higher highs and higher lows before eventually crossing above $150,000 in August. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $106,549, up by 1% in the past 24 hours.

2025-06-16T13:30:03,"Vietnam’s Historic Move to Legalize Crypto Could Add Rocket Fuel to These Top Altcoins","Did the next major move in blockchain technology just come from Vietnam? Developing nations are becoming key crypto drivers, with Vietnam and Pakistan emerging in recent days as potential leaders. Establishing country-level crypto standards like Vietnam has done, or developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, the way Pakistan is doing, can only boost crypto adoption at home and abroad. It also showcases how Bitcoin and broader blockchain technology can help emerging economies fuel growth and innovation. As we’ll discuss later, it could also add rocket fuel to some of the top altcoins . Vietnam, Saylor, Pakistan: 4 Takeaways What do the moves in Pakistan and Vietnam mean for the broader crypto economy? Here are four takeaways: Groundbreaking Legal Clarity in Vietnam On June 14, 2025, Vietnam passed its Law on Digital Technology Industry, effective January 1, 2026, categorizing crypto as a distinct, regulated asset class. This law affects 17M crypto holders and $105B in inflows over 2023–24, and provides much-needed stability, boosting investor confidence. Frameworks that Foster Innovation Vietnam’s approach goes beyond crypto legalization. The law introduces incentives, such as tax breaks, R&D support, and land-use benefits for sectors like AI and blockchain infrastructure, signaling a national pivot toward a tech-first economy. Pakistan’s Strategic Crypto Pivot Pakistan followed Vietnam’s lead a day later, on June 15, 2025, when Michael Saylor engaged with Pakistan’s finance leadership to champion Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset. Pakistan launched the Pakistan Crypto Council in March 2025, developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, along with crypto mining infrastructure. Emerging Economies Leading the Way? Vietnam and Pakistan’s moves reflect a global trend: emerging economies are leveraging digital assets to level up economically, rather than merely following Western nations. Demonstrating a greater appetite for crypto’s revolutionary potential, Pakistan, Vietnam, and others are pushing the limits of crypto’s potential in ways that could send leading altcoins soaring. Let’s investigate how top altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper , Uniswap, and Snorter Token could fare as global adoption grows. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s First-Ever Layer 2 Launches with SVM Bitcoin’s great, we can all agree – 230% AAR, a $2T+ market cap, etc. But could that be just the start? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unleashes Bitcoin’s full potential. While right now, $BTC is one of the world’s best store-of-value assets, when it comes to crypto applications, it’s somewhat limited due to its original architecture. Bitcoin Hyper builds a Layer 2 on top of Bitcoin, leveraging the Bitcoin Relay Program on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to verify Bitcoin block headers and transaction proofs for any $BTC deposited to Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge. The result is lightning-fast transaction resolution and the ability to build out an entire DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin. There’s a growing interest in Layer 2 solutions; another hot crypto presale – Solaxy ($SOLX) – just smashed through $50M raised with a Solana Layer-2. Could $HYPER surpass that with its Layer-2 solution for the world’s largest crypto asset? $HYPER tokens cost $0.0119, with $1.3M raised in the presale so far. Check out the whitepaper , or learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper , and see why we think the token could go from $0.0119 to $0.02595 for 118% gains. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale page . 2. Uniswap ($UNI) – Utility Token for Leading DeFi Protocol Seeks to Regain Previous Highs It’s a leading DEX, with over $1.78B traded in the past 24 hours. But Uniswap is also the 27th-largest crypto token, with a market cap of $4.91B . That’s impressive enough, but could $UNI be ready to make another run? The token trades well below its all-time high of $44.97 in the heady days of the 2021 bull run. But $UNI is on the list of assets currently held by the US government – and therefore eligible for the US Digital Assets Stockpile. Uniswap officials have also been involved in talks with the US Congress over pending legislation and decentralized finance. Add in global shifts towards more formal, organized crypto frameworks, and $UNI might be ready to make big moves. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Dominate the New World of Solana Meme Coins with Snorter Bot With new meme coins launching on Solana daily, some of the best opportunities to 10x your investment live underground. Finding and trading them takes time and effort, but $SNORT and the Snorter Bot make the process easy. The Snorter Bot sniffs out the best trading opportunities. Find them, snipe them, and stay safe from rug pulls and honeypots – all with the Snorter Bot. The $SNORT token facilitates lightning-fast swapping with the lowest fees possible on Solana. As DeFi grows alongside crypto adoption, it could set the stage for tokens like $SNORT. The meme coin market is flourishing, even as traders get more and more sophisticated. Give your meme coin trading a leg up with $SNORT, currently priced at $0.0953. The presale has raised over $1M so far, showing rapid investor interest. Visit the Snorter Token ($SNORT) presale page. Vietnam, Pakistan Embrace Crypto, Set Stage for Altcoins As countries like Vietnam and Pakistan take the lead in embracing crypto, the message is clear: digital assets are no longer just speculative tools, but strategic economic levers. Vietnam’s legislative clarity and Pakistan’s sovereign Bitcoin ambitions show that emerging economies are helping define the future of finance. Whether it’s foundational DeFi tokens like Uniswap, revolutionary Layer-2s like Bitcoin Hyper , or cutting-edge trading tools like Snorter Token , the next wave of growth could be here. Don’t take our word for it – do your own research.

Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 47.01% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

The RSI near 48 hints at the start of recovery but lacks strong momentum. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight.

Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

The Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T., was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 16, 2025, under filing number 333-*, according to the Form S-1 registration statement . The fund is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, LLC, based in Mountainside, New Jersey. Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. Source: SEC This marks the first time Truth Social or any Trump-affiliated venture has directly entered the ETF race. The filing proposes a trust format that would hold both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), a dual exposure product that breaks from the usual single-asset structure dominant in the U.S. spot ETF market. ETF registration Notably, the registration places the ETF under the Securities Act of 1933, similar to how spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and Fidelity’s FBTC were filed. However, it’s unclear whether this new vehicle will aim for full spot holdings or operate under a hybrid or futures-backed model. While details are still limited, the move signals that Truth Social is attempting to pivot beyond social media into financial productization, leveraging the brand’s visibility and user base for capital market initiatives. The ETF appears to be backed operationally and legally by Yorkville America Digital, which has not previously sponsored a crypto ETF. As of now, the SEC has not commented on the filing.

2025-06-16T13:00:37,"Ripple Price Analysis: Bearish Structure Remains as XRP Fails to Break Out of Consolidation","After months of consolidation and a clear underperformance against Bitcoin, XRP remains under bearish pressure on both USD and BTC pairs. Despite brief attempts at reclaiming higher levels, the charts show no decisive bullish structure yet, with XRP continuing to hover near key support areas. The price action has been largely reactive, with market participants cautious amid broader Bitcoin dominance and overall market uncertainty. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair The XRP/USDT pair continues to compress inside a large descending channel, capped by a strong trendline resistance dating back to the early 2025 highs. The price recently lost both the 100 and 200-day moving averages, located around the $2.3 mark, signaling weakening momentum. Yet, the RSI remains neutral around 48, suggesting indecision. The moving averages are also starting to flatten, which further confirms the lack of a strong directional bias in this phase. On the downside, the $2 psychological zone acts as the immediate support, with the broader support base at $1.6 remaining critical. A break below this level could trigger a cascade down to the $0.9 demand zone. On the upside, the buyers need to flip the higher boundary of the pattern and the $3 resistance zone. Until then, structure remains bearish-neutral within this wide range. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP continues to weaken. The asset is currently trading around 2,070 SAT, hovering just below a major resistance band. XRP/BTC is seemingly now targeting the lower trendline of the multi-month descending channel. The 100-day moving average is also sloping downward following a bearish crossover, while the 200-day MA has flattened just above the current price, indicating that bearish momentum has outpaced mean reversion attempts. Notably, there’s a visible fair value gap (FVG) in the 1,600–1,000 SAT zone, left behind from the December 2024 breakout. This could act as a demand zone for price if the pair fails to hold current support. Moreover, the RSI at 43 shows weak momentum, reinforcing the lack of buying pressure. Therefore, XRP will need a strong reclaim above 2,200 SAT and a confirmed breakout from the descending channel to regain relative strength against Bitcoin. For now, the path of least resistance remains to the downside.
