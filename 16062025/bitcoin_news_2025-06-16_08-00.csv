In the meeting, Saylor said he’s open to acting as an advisor for Pakistan’s national crypto strategy. They discussed the idea of including Bitcoin in the country’s reserves and building a solid policy framework for digital assets. This signals Pakistan’s growing interest in crypto, with support from one of the space’s most well-known advocates.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/crypto-live-news/michael-saylor-backs-pakistans-crypto-vision/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC","Short News|Fintech Company",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T05:38:22,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Eases Slightly After Record High","Despite rising operational costs, leading miners like Marathon Digital and CleanSpark are not only expanding production but also choosing to hold their mined BTC. This could mean that miners have long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Meanwhile, institutional players like Strategy and its co-founder Michael Saylor also continue accumulating. Market sentiment is also still bullish, supported by strong ETF inflows and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as an alternative to gold and Treasuries. Analysts warn, however, that geopolitical shocks could still challenge this momentum. Mining Difficulty Slips but Bitcoin Miners Still Battle Bitcoin's mining difficulty saw a slight decline, dropping to approximately 126.4 trillion after reaching a record high of 126.9 trillion on May 31. This adjustment, while minor, happened amid increasing financial pressure on miners due to reduced block rewards after the April 2024 halving, rising energy costs, and sustained high network hashrate. These combined factors are pushing up competition and production costs, testing the profitability and resilience of mining operations. Bitcoin mining difficulty (Source: CryptoQuant ) Despite these headwinds, some publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are not only managing to stay afloat but are expanding aggressively and adopting a new approach by holding onto their mined Bitcoin instead of selling it. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is a major player in this trend. In May, the company boosted its Bitcoin output by 35% by mining 950 BTC during a month that was marked by record hashrate levels and heightened market volatility. MARA’s decision to keep all the Bitcoin it mined pushed its corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC, which made it one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. “Record production month for MARA — and we sold zero Bitcoin,” CFO Salman Khan said in a post on June 3. CleanSpark, another publicly listed mining company focused on sustainable energy, also reported gains . The firm produced 694 BTC in May, which was up 9% from April, and now holds 12,502 BTC in reserves. According to CEO Zack Bradford, CleanSpark increased its operational hashrate to 45.6 exahashes per second by the end of May, representing a 7.5% increase from the previous month. Bitcoin miners are some of the top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The shift in strategy by companies like MARA and CleanSpark could mean that there is a deeper confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Saylor Signals New BTC Buy Mining companies are not the only institutions interested in hoarding Bitcoin. For now, BTC is holding steady above $105,000 despite escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, including Israeli airstrikes on Tehran and concerns over potential disruptions to global oil supply. The relative price stability of Bitcoin comes at a time when global financial markets are bracing for increased volatility when trading resumes on Monday. In a move that suggests continued confidence in Bitcoin, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted a BTC chart that many see as a sign of another imminent Bitcoin purchase by the company. Strategy’s most recent acquisition took place on June 9, when it bought 1,045 BTC worth around $110 million. This brought the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 582,000 BTC. According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy is now up more than 50% on its Bitcoin investment, which translates into over $20 billion in unrealized gains. Saylor’s timing is interesting, as the announcement was made during a weekend of heightened conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite these geopolitical developments, Bitcoin only experienced a minor 3% dip since the conflict escalated. This price stability has been supported by strong investor interest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which recorded more than $1.3 billion in net inflows over the past week. According to Farside Investors , BTC ETFs saw five straight days of capital inflows, which means that there is sustained demand for exposure to Bitcoin. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) Market sentiment is also still bullish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index standing at 61 . This suggests that investors are still optimistic in the face of global uncertainty. However, not all analysts share this confidence. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin warned that if Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz—a crucial passage for 20% of the world’s oil shipments—it could cause a spike in energy prices. Such a development would have huge ripple effects across global markets, and could potentially drag down risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, due to increased economic pressures. While Bitcoin’s current performance points to its role as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil, the events in the Middle East and their broader economic consequences will still be key variables influencing market sentiment over the next few days. Woes Push Investors Toward Bitcoin Overall, Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable alternative to traditional stores of value like gold and US Treasuries, according to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley . In a recent statement, Horsley shed some light on Bitcoin’s total addressable market as not only the $16 trillion gold market but also the $30 trillion-plus held in US Treasury securities by institutions and individual investors. His comments came in response to economist Mohamed El-Erian , who explained that US Treasury flows are no longer a reliable indicator of investor sentiment during times of market stress. Instead, El-Erian suggested that analysts look to flows into gold and silver, traditional safe havens, for clues about where capital is moving during rising uncertainty. Bitcoin’s positioning as a digital alternative to gold has gained momentum, especially as investors seek tools to hedge against geopolitical risks, inflation, and market instability. With its decentralized design and capped supply, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a savings technology that offers protection from the risks tied to fiat currencies and government-managed financial systems. The recent geopolitical developments and fiscal concerns have only strengthened this narrative. In the United States, President Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” has come under scrutiny for its projected $2.5 trillion in deficit spending, which adds to the country’s already staggering $37 trillion national debt. Critics, including Elon Musk and other fiscal conservatives, argue that the bill undermines the long-term financial stability of the country. The bond market reacted sharply to these concerns in April of 2025, particularly after Trump’s proposed trade tariffs and the growing debt load. Investors dumped government bonds, which led to a spike in yields as they demanded higher returns to offset the perceived risk of holding US debt. Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, said that the market was clearly rattled by Trump’s fiscal policies and that calming the situation would require a major shift in economic strategy. Against this backdrop of fiscal instability and geopolitical tension, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a potential safe haven.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9573/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-eases-slightly-after-record-high,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T05:27:32,"Will SUI Price Hit $10?","The post Will SUI Price Hit $10? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SUI has been making headlines in 2025 with its impressive price action. With rising adoption, TVL, and institutional interest, SUI could be eyeing long-term price targets of $5, $10, or even higher in the coming months. SUI started the year strong as it briefly crossed the $5 mark. But it further dropped over 65% as the selling pressure kicked in. Despite the drop, the buyers quickly stepped in and helped the price recover. The interest is growing again now and the momentum looks set to continue. SUI is currently trading at $3.07, up 2.9% in the last 24 hours. It is showing mixed technical signals with most moving averages bearish. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 41, indicating that momentum has cooled, and the MACD also points to a slowdown. If SUI holds above $3.10, it could climb to $3.50 this week. A rise above $3.50 may trigger a bigger rally; but if it drops below $3.00, then more selling could follow. Will SUI End June at $4? SUI started off the month slow and is stuck in a tight range as bears tried to push the price down. However, buying pressure is expected to rise in the next few days breaking past its resistance levels. The outlook for June remains bullish, with SUI likely to end the month between $3.80 and $4.00. Analysts said that SUI is shaping up to be a major player in the next bull run. The network now ranks 8th in total value locked (TVL) across all blockchains. A big part of this momentum comes from Suilend, Sui’s leading lending platform, which recently saw its TVL surge by 90% to $700 million in just one month. $SUI remains to be one of the core pillars of the upcoming bull cycle. Interesting metrics: – 8th highest TVL across chains – Suilend has become the largest lending protocol with a 90% increase in the past month –> $700M in TVL. – Over 10% of SUI's TVL is in #Bitcoin -related… pic.twitter.com/t8kypcZeQd — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 9, 2025 Additionally, over 10% of SUI’s TVL is now in Bitcoin-related assets. This kind of cross-chain functionality is drawing in new users and liquidity. The institutional interest in SUI is also on rise as several firms have filed for SUI ETF. With all these factors in play, a new all-time high for SUI may not be too far. SUI Outperforms SOL SUI is also outperforming Solana, and the trend may continue over the next 12 to 24 months. If Sui keeps up the same uptrend, it could trade between $5 and $8 in 2026. According to CoinCodex , the price outlook for SUI from 2025 to 2030 is bullish. It is expected to reach an average price of $3.80 in 2025, and could climb as high as $5.20. By 2030, SUI could even climb to $11, if the demand and adoption keeps rising.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-sui-price-hit-10/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SOL|TRADING|SUI","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare

As reported earlier, Metaplanet’s stock surged more than 4,800% over the past year, after its pivot to Bitcoin investment strategy. Metaplanet is now Japan’s most shorted stock, says CEO as Bitcoin bulls warn of a global short squeeze. “Really bad timing to be short,” says Blockstream’s Adam Back. #Bitcoin #Metaplanet https://t.co/aWGJO2iQGi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 21, 2025 Seamus Rocca, CEO at Xapo Bank, shared his perspective on the rising corporate Bitcoin allocations recently. In an email to Cryptonews, he said that the increase in corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is “significant.” However, “it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions,” Rocca added. “It’s about allocating what a business can afford to hold over a five-to-ten-year horizon, without being forced to sell into volatility.” Further, he said that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet “represent high-conviction outliers,” with bold strategies that align with their unique business plans. “In this space, patience and discipline can be underrated virtues,” he told Cryptonews. “Our view has been, and remains, that Bitcoin deserves serious consideration—but with a disciplined, long-term framework: focus on the asset itself, avoid speculative trading, and size positions responsibly.” Company Adapts Strategy Amid Yen Depreciation Metaplanet’s recent announcement to issue $210 million in 0% ordinary bonds comes at a time when Japan is facing economic challenges, characterized by high debt levels and yen depreciation. As a result, the strategy underscores Metaplanet’s commitment to leveraging Bitcoin’s potential for long-term appreciation. The Japanese Yen kicked off the week on a weaker note. However, the anticipation that the Bank of Japan might push for tighter monetary conditions, along with trade-related uncertainties, lends some support to the safe-haven Japanese Yen.

Saylor reportedly met with top Pakistani officials over the weekend to explore how crypto could help reshape the country’s financial future. The talks, described by officials as a “landmark discussion,” brought Saylor together with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib . The agenda focused on how Bitcoin could be used in sovereign reserves and monetary policy. Meanwhile, Pakistan is accelerating efforts to become a digital asset leader in the Global South. “Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation, and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” said Aurangzeb, who also chairs the Pakistan Crypto Council. Pakistan Finds an Ally in MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Saylor, who heads the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, welcomed Pakistan’s outreach.

The meeting comes after a series of bold steps by Islamabad. In March, the government established the Pakistan Crypto Council to create a legal framework for digital assets. Then in April, it introduced the country’s first national crypto policy, designed to align with FATF standards. Soon after, the government created the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. In addition, it announced a state-backed strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. With Support from Zhao and Trump Allies, Pakistan’s Crypto Plan Gains Weight Saylor is not the only high-profile figure showing interest. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was appointed a strategic advisor to the PCC in April. His addition, despite past legal controversies, is seen by officials as a signal of global credibility. Others from US political and financial circles have also entered the picture. Gentry Beach Jr., a close ally of President Donald Trump, visited Islamabad as part of a US delegation helping shape the council’s structure. Meanwhile, Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump associate and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, signed a deal in April between his firm, World Liberty Financial, and the PCC. The agreement aims to embed blockchain technology into Pakistan’s financial systems. Additionally, the company is reportedly linked to the Trump family, with Eric, Donald Jr. and Jared Kushner holding a controlling stake.

2025-06-16T05:00:00,"Brazil and Vietnam Reshape Crypto Markets with Landmark Regulations","Two of the world’s most closely watched emerging markets have taken significant steps to formalize their positions on digital assets. Brazil has eliminated long-standing tax exemptions on crypto gains, replacing them with a flat 17.5% capital gains tax as part of a broader fiscal reform. Meanwhile, Vietnam passed a first-of-its-kind law recognizing digital assets and setting the stage for a nationwide digital technology strategy. Vietnam Passes Groundbreaking Law Recognizing Crypto Assets, Aims to Become Digital Tech Powerhouse The National Assembly of Vietnam officially approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14, ushering in a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets, artificial intelligence, and advanced technologies. The law , scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, positions Vietnam as the first country globally to enact a standalone law dedicated entirely to the digital technology industry. The new legislation provides long-awaited legal clarity for the crypto industry in Vietnam, recognizing digital assets and dividing them into two primary categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Although both are based on encryption or digital technologies for their verification and transfer, they explicitly exclude securities, fiat-backed digital currencies, and other conventional financial instruments. Vietnamese lawmakers vote to approve the Law on Digital Technology Industry (Source: VGP ) Under the new framework, the Vietnamese government is now responsible for defining specific business conditions and regulatory mechanisms for both asset categories, signaling a shift from a loosely regulated market to a structured environment that could attract institutional interest and innovation. The law emphasizes strict compliance with cybersecurity standards and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, aligning Vietnam with international regulatory benchmarks, particularly those set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Vietnam has been on the FATF’s “gray list” since 2023 due to concerns over money laundering and terrorist financing. The introduction of these new safeguards is expected to be a major step in addressing those issues. By bringing crypto assets under formal supervision, the Vietnamese government hopes to mitigate risks associated with scams, fraudulent investment schemes, and unregulated platforms—issues that have plagued the country’s digital asset ecosystem in recent years. A Response to Rising Crypto Crime Vietnam’s crypto sector has experienced significant abuse by malicious actors, underscoring the urgency for regulatory reform. Earlier this year, Vietnamese authorities dismantled BitMiner, a fake crypto mining platform that defrauded over 200 investors of approximately 4 billion Vietnamese dong ($157,300). The operation claimed to be based in Dubai and sold fictitious mining packages and training programs. In another major crackdown in December 2024, Hanoi City police intervened just in time to prevent 300 potential victims from investing in the “Million Smiles” crypto scam. That scheme promoted a fake in-house digital currency called QFS (Quantum Financial System), tricking more than 100 businesses and 400 individuals out of nearly 30 billion dong ($1.17 million) through fraudulent claims that included ties to ancestral treasures and spiritual guarantees. Such cases have shown the need for robust consumer protections and legal definitions for crypto-related businesses—something this new law aims to deliver. While the legal recognition of crypto assets has grabbed headlines, the law’s implications go far beyond digital currencies. It forms the cornerstone of Vietnam’s larger strategy to become a regional and global leader in digital innovation. The legislation lays out broad incentives for companies working in critical areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and digital infrastructure. These include tax reductions, land-use incentives, and government-backed research and development grants. In particular, firms focused on core technologies like chip design and AI data centers are expected to benefit. Provincial governments will also be required to launch programs that support workforce development, offering subsidies, scholarships, and training initiatives tailored to digital technologies. Moreover, Vietnam plans to overhaul its education system by integrating digital technology skills into national curricula, ensuring that students are equipped with the competencies needed for the digital age. Vietnam's Role in the Emerging Digital Economy Vietnam’s latest legislative initiative places it at the forefront of a global trend where emerging markets are leading the charge in crypto adoption. A recent survey by Consensys highlighted Vietnam as one of the fastest-growing digital asset markets, supported by a young, tech-savvy population and growing smartphone penetration. International companies are already taking notice. Earlier this year, crypto derivatives exchange Bitget launched BitEXC, a custom-built trading platform tailored for Vietnamese users—an indication that global firms are preparing for a more regulated and accessible market. As the country prepares for the law’s implementation in 2026, businesses and regulators alike are watching closely. If successful, Vietnam could become a model for digital policy frameworks, offering a blueprint for how to simultaneously foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold international financial standards. Brazil Ends Crypto Tax Exemptions with New Flat 17.5% Rate Under Provisional Measure 1303 Meanwhile, in a sweeping shift that could reshape the financial strategies of both retail and institutional investors, the Brazilian government has eliminated its longstanding tax exemption for small-scale crypto gains and implemented a flat 17.5% capital gains tax on all digital asset profits. The change comes under Provisional Measure 1303, part of a broader government initiative to increase public revenue through financial market taxation. Provisional Measure 1303 (Source: Brazil Government ) Previously, Brazilian residents were exempt from paying income tax on crypto sales under 35,000 Brazilian reals (roughly $6,300) per month. Above that threshold, capital gains were taxed on a progressive scale ranging from 15% to 22.5%, with the highest bracket applying to trades exceeding 30 million reals. Effective as of June 12, 2025, the new regime removes these thresholds, enforcing a uniform 17.5% tax rate across the board—regardless of transaction volume, wallet size, or investor type. Impact on Retail and Wealthy Investors The move marks a dramatic departure from a system that many small traders had relied on for tax relief. Under the old rules, small monthly trades went untaxed, allowing casual or beginner investors to explore crypto markets without immediate tax burdens. Now, even modest gains will be subject to the new flat rate, raising the barrier for entry and dampening enthusiasm among low-capital participants. Conversely, high-net-worth individuals and institutional traders may benefit from the flat tax, which could lower their effective tax liability. Under the previous system, large transactions—particularly those above 5 million reals—were subject to tax rates up to 22.5%. With the 17.5% cap now in place, Brazil's wealthier investors could see reduced tax bills on large-scale crypto activity. Perhaps more significantly, Provisional Measure 1303 expands the tax base to include self-custodied crypto wallets and foreign-held digital assets, making it harder for investors to sidestep local tax obligations through offshore strategies. According to local reporting from Portal do Bitcoin, the measure introduces quarterly tax assessments, giving investors the ability to offset losses over a rolling five-quarter period. However, this window will be reduced starting in 2026, tightening loss recovery options. The inclusion of self-custody wallets means that even crypto not held on centralized exchanges—long considered a regulatory gray area—will now be monitored for capital gains. Investors who previously stored funds in private wallets to avoid surveillance may now be compelled to declare holdings and gains under stricter transparency requirements. Other Financial Sectors Affected The government’s changes are not limited to crypto. Several once-exempt financial instruments are also being pulled into the tax net. Profits from Agribusiness and Real Estate Credit Letters (LCAs and LCIs) as well as Receivables Certificates (CRIs and CRAs) will now face a 5% income tax, ending their tax-free status. Meanwhile, revenue generated from betting and gambling has also been hit, with tax rates rising from 12% to 18%, further reflecting the government’s aggressive stance on extracting revenue from non-traditional financial sectors. These updates follow political backlash from an earlier attempt by Brazil’s Finance Ministry to increase the Financial Transaction Tax (IOF)—a plan that was ultimately abandoned amid strong opposition from both Congress and financial industry stakeholders. Brazil’s tax overhaul comes at a time when global regulators are tightening their grip on the cryptocurrency sector, particularly in emerging economies with large unbanked populations and rapidly growing crypto user bases. As the world’s seventh-largest crypto market, Brazil has historically embraced digital assets as tools for financial inclusion and inflation protection. But this latest pivot demonstrates the Brazilian government’s growing concern over unregulated capital flows, offshore tax evasion, and rising crypto-linked fraud, all while seeking new avenues to fund social programs and infrastructure. Bitcoin for Wages? Brazil Considers Crypto Salaries In March 2025, Brazilian lawmakers introduced a bill proposing that employers be allowed to pay up to 50% of wages in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. The bill, still under discussion, would prohibit full crypto-based salary payments for standard employees but permit full payment in digital assets for foreign workers and independent contractors, provided agreements are contractually defined. All payments would need to reference official exchange rates determined by institutions authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil, ensuring price stability and transparency in salary conversions. While the bill has not yet passed, it represents the country’s dual-track approach: tighten regulation while enabling innovation. If approved, it could make Brazil one of the first major economies to formally embrace crypto-denominated wages under a centralized regulatory structure.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9574/brazil-and-vietnam-reshape-crypto-markets-with-landmark-regulations,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

(@Metaplanet_JP) June 16, 2025 The latest purchase was financed through the issuance of a new $210 million bond to EVO Fund, also announced on June 16. These zero-interest bonds are scheduled to mature in December 2025 but can be redeemed earlier. The entire amount raised is being directed toward buying more Bitcoin, continuing the company’s focused approach to BTC accumulation. While the firm expects little impact on its full-year earnings, it has said it will update the market if anything changes.

That final figure would represent 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Alongside its Bitcoin buying, the company uses internal performance metrics to track progress. One of these, BTC Yield, measures how much Bitcoin is held per fully diluted share and is designed to reflect the impact of both buying BTC and issuing shares. As of June 16, the yield for the current quarter was 87.2%. Past quarters have seen even sharper increases, including a 309.8% rise in Q4 2024. To finance its expansion, Metaplanet has also raised money through stock sales. It granted EVO Fund 21 million new share rights in five tranches in January, with flexible pricing and no discounts. The firm’s aggressive capital raise and BTC acquisitions have positioned it as Asia’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the eighth largest holder globally.

This was revealed in response to a user asking whether RLUSD would be added to Cardano. There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi and the RealUSD talks. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 14, 2025 Charles replied that there is already a full XRP integration package in the works. “There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi, and the RealUSD talks,” he said. Glacier Drop to Include XRP Support and Midnight Airdrop The Glacier Drop is Midnight’s multi-chain airdrop, which was revealed during Consensus 2025 in Toronto. It will target around 37 million blockchains, including the XRP Ledger, but only retail users will be eligible for it. As part of the Glacier Drop, Midnight will airdrop two tokens: NIGHT (governance) and DUST (privacy-focused). XRP holders can qualify by storing their tokens in eligible wallets. Lace Wallet Set to Add XRP Hoskinson recently confirmed that Lace Wallet, Cardano’s lightweight, multi-chain wallet, will soon support XRP. This would allow users to send, receive, and store XRP alongside assets like ADA and Bitcoin. He has shown strong support for Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD. Launched in December, Real USD (RLUSD) currently runs on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, but Cardano may soon be added in the future. XRP DeFi Use Cases XRP’s integration into Cardano could bring fresh DeFi use cases like lending and borrowing, and other financial services within the Cardano ecosystem. In late 2024, Hoskinson said Cardano could offer XRP some “amazing” DeFi tools. In February, a Wanchain bridge went live, allowing native XRP to connect to Cardano. The update turned heads, given Hoskinson’s past disagreements with the XRP community.

2025-06-16T01:34:12,"Bitcoin mining difficulty dips slightly after record highs","Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has dropped slightly after reaching its highest level ever at the end of May. On Saturday, June 15, the network recorded a small but notable decrease in difficulty, bringing it down to approximately 126.4 trillion. This follows the all-time peak of 126.9 trillion on May 31, according to data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. The drop is slight, but that’s a landmark for mining. Bitcoin’s difficulty is automatically adjusted approximately every two weeks to reflect changes in the total hashrate, the sum of all miners’ computing power aiming for solutions to the Bitcoin network . When additional miners join the network, the difficulty increases to help maintain block production at regular intervals. When miners go offline because of cost or inefficiency, the difficulty drops in adjusting. The hashrate is still robust, surpassing a psychological barrier of 1 zetahash per second (ZH/s) in April. Rising costs challenge miners While it remains a tad less tough, several miners struggle with heavier workloads. The April 2024 halving, a scheduled phenomenon that cuts Bitcoin’s block reward in half every four years, slashed the reward for successfully mining a block to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC for miners, which translates into half the revenue for the same work. Factors such as surging electricity prices, rising hardware costs, and the pressure to stay updated with the latest technological turnover have caused many smaller or medium mining operations to be on the brink. Production costs are expensive for some small-scale miners, particularly in regions with relatively high electric power prices or relatively inefficient power supply systems. For those miners, keeping operations going is burning cash, a high-stakes wager, given that they either have access to cheap energy or anticipate a sharp rise in the price of Bitcoin shortly. Big players grow despite headwinds While many miners are scrambling , larger publicly traded companies do the opposite: ramping up and holding onto Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) said it produced roughly 35% more Bitcoin mined in May despite facing industry headwinds. The firm also mined 950 BTC for the month, an increase from April’s amount. Rather than liquidating coins into fiat to cover costs — as many miners often tend to do — MARA decided to hold onto those obtained through Bitcoin mining and increased the size of their corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC. “Record production month for MARA, and we sold zero Bitcoin,” said Salman Khan, Marathon’s chief financial officer, in a June 3 post on X . CleanSpark, another major mining company with a degree of emphasis on renewable energy, also reported solid results. The company reportedly mined 694 BTC during the month, an increase of approximately 9% from the prior month. CleanSpark’s capacity of hashrate, an essential performance measure, rose to 45.6 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the end of May. CleanSpark CEO Zack Bradford said that the increase was attributable to continued investment in cleaner forms of energy and improved mining hardware. He added that they had intentionally scaled their footprint over the years to remain profitable in tough macroeconomic environments. Both companies are part of a new breed of miners who consider Bitcoin a revenue source and a strategic financial asset. It has boiled down to holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet, a decision increasingly adopted by the corporate treasuries experimenting with crypto.

But while the spotlight stays on this frog-themed token, investors are also turning eyes to under-the-radar DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) priced at $0.03. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 12,000 investors. More than $10.6 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 2x profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Pepe Coin Forecast: Steady Climb into Q3 Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading around $0.000012, rebounding slightly, up about 2.1% in 24 hours, after a recent dip that left prices roughly 12% lower than the May highs. Technical indicators point to consolidation, with analysts projecting a short-term bounce toward 0.000016, a potential 25% upside, if current support holds. Beyond that, broader bullish scenarios suggest PEPE could reach as high as $0.00004 by late 2025, assuming meme-coin momentum reemerges and BTC continues its upward trend. This positions PEPE as a meme-coin contender to watch, while new DeFi plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly emerge on investors’ radars. Mutuum Finance Presale Explodes Past $10.6M, 12,000+ Investors Already In The presale frenzy around Mutuum Finance is turning heads in the DeFi world, with over $10.6 million raised and a community of 12,000+ holders, it’s clear something huge is brewing. Right now, MUTM tokens are going for just $0.03, but the next presale round jumps to $0.035. That’s an instant 16.67% gain for phase 5 investors. And when it officially launches at $0.06, those in early could 2x their money. DeFi Disruption Incoming: Mutuum’s Dual-Lending Model Why settle for average returns when you can have both control and passive income? Mutuum’s hybrid lending system is rewriting DeFi playbooks with: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Deposit USDT into smart contracts and watch passive income roll in, fully automated, zero headaches. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): For users looking for full control, P2P allows setting loan terms and is privacy-focused. Audited and Transparent: Mutuum’s Security Game is On Another Level In a space full of risk, Mutuum Finance is prioritizing security. Backed by a Certik audit and running on fully transparent, open-source contracts, the project is built for trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to launch a USD-pegged, fully collateralized stablecoin, engineered to avoid the collapse risks that wrecked algorithmic alternatives. This is stability that DeFi desperately needs. $100,000 Up for Grabs, Will You Be One of the 10 Lucky Winners? Mutuum isn’t just offering killer returns, it’s giving back big. A $100,000 giveaway , is live, and 10 winners will each bag $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This is your shot to join the movement, win huge, and ride the next potential DeFi rocket before it takes off. Early Access for Maximum Gains Mutuum Finance is quickly setting itself apart in a crowded crypto market, securing over $10.6 million from 12,000+ early investors, all before its official launch.

2025-06-16T00:50:23,"Asia Morning Briefing: Risk of Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict Keeps BTC Around 105K Says QCP","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia opens the trading week, BTC is changing hands at around $ 105,000, stuck in this range due to market uncertainty about whether the Israel-Iran conflict will escalate into a broader regional war, according to a recent note from trading firm QCP. QCP wrote in a Friday note published on Telegram that risk reversals have ""flipped decisively,"" with front-end BTC puts now commanding premiums of up to 5 volatility points over equivalent calls, a clear indicator of heightened investor anxiety and increased hedging against downside risks. The firm said that despite this defensive shift in positioning, BTC has demonstrated notable resilience. Even amid recent volatility, which saw over $1 billion in long positions liquidated across major crypto assets, on-chain data shows that institutional buying continues to provide meaningful support. QCP emphasizes that markets remain ""stuck in a bind,"" awaiting clarity on geopolitical outcomes, and warns that the digital asset complex will likely remain tightly linked to headline-driven sentiment shifts for the foreseeable future. With all that in mind, however, Glassnode data provides some reassurance to investors concerned about longer-term directionality. Although recent volatility underscores short-term anxiety, bitcoin’s current cycle gain of 656%, while lower than previous bull markets, is notably impressive given its significantly larger market capitalization today. Previous cycles returned 1076% (2015–2018) and 1007% (2018–2022), suggesting investor demand is still pacing closely with BTC’s maturation, even as near-term macro jitters dominate market sentiment. Galaxy Research Says OP_Return Debate Wasn't That Important The OP_Return debate was less important than what a ""loud but small group of critics"" wanted everyone to think, Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn wrote in a recent note. Thorn described critics' reactions as ""wild accusations of the 'death of Bitcoin'"" and argued that such hyperbole was misplaced given historically low mempool congestion. On-chain data shows that the mempool is virtually empty compared to a year ago, and the notion that a congested blockchain is suffocating BTC, as was the prevailing narrative in 2023, now appears significantly overstated. In the note, Thorn further highlighted the irony of labeling arbitrary data as ""spam,"" reminding observers that Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, famously included arbitrary text, the ""chancellor on brink of second bailout"" headline, in the Bitcoin’s blockchain's very first block. Instead, Thorn argued, Bitcoin's community attention would be better focused on potential upgrades like CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), a proposed opcode enabling strict spending conditions (""covenants""). ""We continue to believe [CTV] is a conservative but powerful opcode that would greatly enhance the ability to build better, safer methods of custody,"" he wrote, noting that around 20% of Bitcoin’s hashrate already signaled support for the upgrade. Bitcoin upgrades require extensive consensus-building, reflecting its open-source ethos, and Thorn emphasized that cautious, deliberate evolution remains critical for broader adoption and scalability. ByBit Launches Byreal, a Solana-Native Decentralized Exchange Bybit is entering the decentralized exchange space with Byreal, an on-chain trading platform built on Solana, Ben Zhou, Bybit's CEO announced via X over the weekend. Byreal's testnet is scheduled to launch on June 30, with the mainnet rollout expected later this year. Zhou said that Byreal is designed to combine centralized exchange features such as high liquidity and fast execution with the transparency and composability of DeFi. The platform will also include a fair launchpad system and curated yield vaults linked to Solana-native assets like bbSOL. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin held near $105,000 after more than $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, led by a $200 million long on Binance, as rising Israel-Iran tensions triggered a sharp selloff, a flight from altcoins, and a brief but intense bout of volatility. ETH: Ethereum rose 2% to around $2,550 after finding strong support at $2,510, showing resilience amid Israel-Iran tensions and broader market volatility, with continued institutional inflows supporting the uptrend. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday, led by Japan's Nikkei 225 gaining 0.87 percent, as investors weighed escalating Israel-Iran tensions, while oil and gold prices surged on safe haven demand. Gold: Gold climbed to $3,447 in early Asian trading Monday, hitting a one-month high as Middle East tensions and rising expectations of a September Fed rate cut outweighed strong U.S. consumer sentiment data.

2025-06-16T00:01:00,"Crypto price predictions: Polyhedra Network (ZKJ), Marinade, Useless Coin","The crypto market was mixed on Monday morning, with most tokens being in the green as traders focused on the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. Bitcoin’s price held steady above $105,000, while Ethereum’s was slightly above $2,500. This article provides a forecast for some of the most active cryptocurrencies, including Polyhedra Network (ZKJ), Marinade Finance (MNDE), and Useless Coin (USELESS). Polyhedra Network (ZKJ) price technical analysis ZKJ price chart | Source: TradingView Polyhedra Network was the worst-performing tokens on Monday morning as it crashed by over 83%. ZKJ tumbled by over 83%, erasing over $300 million in value, mirroring the Mantra price crash a few months ago. The developers insisted that the network’s fundamentals were strong, citing its “community” and its technology. They attributed the plunge to a series of abnormal on-chain transactions on the ZKJ/KOGE pair. In another post, Binance, the biggest crypto exchange, attributed the crash to large holders removing on-chain liquidity, leading to a surge of liquidations. Binance @binance · Follow Binance is aware that ZKJ and KOGE have experienced significant price volatilities and our initial findings indicate the developments were a result of large holders removing on-chain liquidity, and liquidation cascade in the market.In order to maintain market fairness and 7:56 PM · Jun 15, 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter The ZKJ price crash may attract traders buying the dip because it has become a fairly cheap one. However, the reality is that, as Mantra showed, catching a knife can be dangerous. Therefore, the most likely scenario is where the token continues crashing as most holders dump and buyers remain in the sidelines Another scenario is where the token stages a triple-digit rebound in the near term. Such a move, which Mantra also did, would be a dead-cat bounce, which is also known as a bull trap. A dead-cat bounce is a situation where an asset in a free fall experiences a brief comeback and then resumes the downtrend.

A double bottom is one of the most bullish reversal patterns in technical analysis. The token has then bounced back, reaching a high of $0.1650 as the total value locked (TVL) jumped to over 11 million SOL. Marinade has over 153,619 holders and a stalking yield of 8%. Its rally mirrored that of Jito, the biggest liquid staking platform on Solana. MNDE price has moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and the MACD indicators have all pointed upwards. Therefore, more MNDE price gains will be confirmed if the token moves above the important resistance point at $0.1760. Such a move will push it higher, potentially to the key resistance level at $0.2350, its highest swing on December 9. Useless Coin Price Analysis USELESS chart by TradingView Useless Coin is a fairly new, fast-growing meme coin on the Solana network. Its token has surged by over 1,500% from its lowest point this year, bringing its market capitalization to over $84 million. The four-hour chart shows that the Useless Coin price surged to a record high of $0.097 during the weekend and then retreated to $0.085 today. Useless price formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side was at $0.04734 and the lower side was at $0.0051. A C&H pattern mostly leads to more upside over time. In this case, the token had a depth of about 90%, and measuring the same distance from its upper side gives a target of $0.090.

2025-06-16T00:00:49,"Trader Says One Layer-1 Altcoin ‘Destined’ for New All-Time High, Warns of Potential 50% Correction for WIF and POPCAT","A widely followed trader believes that a layer-1 decentralized exchange (DEX) altcoin is gearing up for rallies to new all-time highs. Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 248,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) looks very strong despite the recent marketwide correction. The trader sees HYPE consolidating close to the highs for now before igniting a fresh leg up en route to a new record high. “HYPE has insane strength right now, this one got bought up quickly. wouldn’t be surprised to see a bit more chop around here but $50+ is destined, even in these crazy times.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, HYPE is worth $40.44. While Altcoin Sherpa is bullish on HYPE, he says he’s bearish on two Solana ( SOL )-based memecoins. The trader notes that dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Popcat ( POPCAT ) are both in the midst of a downtrend and may drop to much lower levels if BTC fails to print new all-time highs. “Moment of truth for many of these [coins] soon; that could have just been a lower high formed. It’s all going to be dependent on BTC. If we see it blast through the highs, we’re going up again. If not, alts probably go [down] another 30-50%. Can see some examples with WIF, POPCAT.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that POPCAT could fall to as low as $0.22. At time of writing, POPCAT is worth $0.31. Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that WIF could plunge to $0.60. At time of writing, WIF is trading for $0.839.

2025-06-15T23:30:36,"Investor Projects 462,800% XRP Price Rally. Here’s the Timeline","A crypto investor known as Remi Relief (@RemiRelierX) has predicted that XRP could reach $10,000 by 2029. According to him, the timeline is not arbitrary. It marks what would be Donald Trump’s final year in office following his re-election in 2024. In his post on X, Remi argued that Trump, now in his second and final term, will seek to establish a lasting economic legacy and that this could involve helping XRP reach extreme valuations. He claims the motivation isn’t to reward holders but to reinforce the U.S. government’s financial strength, which he says is increasingly tied to Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In that context, a dramatic revaluation of XRP would serve broader national goals and support the long-term credibility of U.S.-led financial systems. XRP to $10,000 By 2029 … First let me preface this by saying XRP has a set price. I’ve been telling everyone this for months. How much is it? I don’t know but I think there will be a set “base price” of $10,000. I spoke about this in an earlier post which I’ll re-post… pic.twitter.com/1SbB2c5OFp — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 14, 2025 A Belief in a Fixed Price Model At the heart of Remi’s view is the belief that XRP has, or will soon have, a fixed or pre-determined base price. Though he acknowledges he does not know the exact number, he believes $10,000 is a realistic figure. This outlook stands in contrast to traditional market-based pricing, relying instead on the idea that price could be institutionally guided based on strategic utility. He has expressed this view previously and shares the explanation for his optimism. He referenced Quincy Jones, a developer for the XDC network, who once said XRP could theoretically reach $1 million depending on how much global debt it is used to settle. Remi agrees with that principle, stating he “100%” believes it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-Term Strategy and Investor Discipline Remi cautions against selling too early. He warns that many retail investors will offload their holdings at $100 , $500, or even $1,000, thereby missing out on generational wealth, which he believes is XRP’s true potential. “$10,000 x 100 XRP = $1M,” he wrote, suggesting holders should aim to retain at least 100 XRP tokens if possible. He urges followers to store their assets securely, preferably off centralized exchanges. Other experts have advised token holders to store their XRP in cold wallets , and Remi Relief reveals that he uses around 15 cold wallets, two exchanges, and a dedicated crypto phone. His strategy stems from missed opportunities in earlier technological waves, such as the dot-com boom and Bitcoin’s rise, which he says he didn’t take seriously enough at the time. He shared tweets showing people who missed out on Bitcoin in the early days—a tweet from 2027 by someone complaining that they did not hold onto their XRP.

2025-06-15T23:30:00,"Kimchi Coins Booming on South Korean Stablecoin News – But Experts Urge Caution","Kimchi coins, low-cap altcoins popular among some sections of the South Korean crypto community, have seen rapid growth in the past few days. Experts say this is mainly due to the buzz around the country’s new government-led plan to launch a won-backed stablecoi n . But insiders have urged investors to treat the tokens’ rapid rise with caution, noting that previous kimchi coin price rises have proven ephemeral. Kimchi Coins: Riding the Stabelcoin Wave? The South Korean media outlet Biz Watch reported that the new government’s won-pegged stablecoin has become a “hot topic” in both the financial sector and blockchain industry, with “related” coins attracting attention. MEVerse (MEV) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) The outlet noted that while high-cap cryptoassets like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are experiencing price stagnation, “only certain domestic coins have been showing abnormal price surges.” Examples include MEVerse (MEV), which shot up from around KRW 3 to KRW 20 won, as well as fanC (FANC), which rose from KRW 5 to KRW 13 won. fanC (FANC) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) In the same period, Wrapped Nine Chronicle Gold (WNCG) increased from around KRW 29 won to KRW 57 won. Tokens like BORA and Storm X (STMX) have also seen price rises of over 60% on domestic crypto exchanges. Coins Remain Popular in South Korea The outlet explained that MEV is a coin issued by the KOSDAQ-listed gaming and entertainment company Me2On. MEVerse (MEV) prices on the Coinone crypto exchange over the past three months. (Source:Coinone/TradingView) FanC, meanwhile, was issued by CELEBe, a Seoul-based startup that specializes in mobile app and social media-related services. In both cases, 99% or more of the coins’ global trading volume takes place on domestic exchanges like Bithumb and Coinone. Biz Watch wrote: “Many of these coins have been ignored by investors for a long time. Their trading volumes and market prices have been at rock bottom. As market interest has cooled, it has become harder to find information about project activity levels and technological capabilities.” Experts Issue Warning Apywa is a South Korean analyst that provides evaluation grades for domestic and international projects. It grades FANC at C- , with 41.48 points out of 100. By contrast, it rates BTC at A+ with almost 95 points. MEV scores 45.83 points (grade C), with STMX receiving a B- and BORA a B. Apywa deducts points for coins that show relatively low levels of community activity and development activity. Bank of Korea governor is likely to discuss the quick issuance of Won-based stablecoins with the country's commercial bank heads. #BankofKorea #Stablecoin #KoreaStablecoin https://t.co/wmeoChNMkC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 11, 2025 While it is unclear if any of the projects have any relationship with the government’s own stablecoin plans, experts think the price rise may be attributable to possible relationships with overseas stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC) . In other instances, these projects’ coins may have certain payment and/or settlement functions that have caught the eye of some traders. At the time of writing, MEV trading volumes on Bithumb were outstripping those of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) . The top seven coins by trading volume on Bithumb over the past 24 hours. (Source: CoinGecko) Lessons from the Past? However, experts told the same media outlet they were concerned about market confusion and possible investor damage risks. An unnamed securities firm employee said: “With the government’s push to issue a won-denominated stablecoin, fintech and blockchain companies are announcing business plans, one after another. They are claiming relevance, and their prices are rising.” Nine Chronicles (WNCG) prices over the past seven days. (Source: CoinMarketCap) A crypto industry insider added: “In the past, projects like Paycoin (PCI) soared when local government stablecoins were a big thing. They then went on to drop by more than 30% in a few days. In the same way, coins related to won stablecoins could also plummet at any time. Investors should carefully consider the operational status and business viability of projects. People should invest with caution.” The post Kimchi Coins Booming on South Korean Stablecoin News – But Experts Urge Caution appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/kimchi-coins-booming-on-south-korean-stablecoin-news-but-experts-urge-caution/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Altcoin News|Altcoin|South Korea",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T22:45:39,"NFT Market Bounces Back As Bitcoin Gains Strength","The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) sector shows strong signs of recovery after months of slow growth . Reports show that the digital collectible market had its most significant weekly gain in a long time. NFTs Market Sees Increased Trading Activity and Participation Notably, this happened as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price increased to $105,000, and Ethereum (ETH) also saw a slight increase. The global crypto market cap grew slightly from $3.28 trillion to $3.29 trillion. Activity in the NFT space has grown significantly. The number of buyers increased by over 50%, reaching over 1 million. Sellers also increased, and the number of trades increased by nearly 8%. This shows that more people are getting back into the NFT market. Immutable Surpasses Ethereum in NFT Blockchain Sales This rise in activity comes as Immutable (IMX), a blockchain used for NFTs, became the top-selling platform this week, beating the Ethereum blockchain for the first time in months. It made $41.7 million in sales, jumping over 150%. Ethereum dropped to second place but still grew by around 7%. The Bitcoin network stayed third with $19.4 million in sales after a 22% rise. Polygon also saw strong growth and is now close to Bitcoin. Other blockchains, like Mythos, BNB Chain, and Solana, also had more NFT buyers. Polygon had the biggest jump in buyers, followed by Solana and Bitcoin. New NFT Market Collections on the Rise Immutable’s growth has helped bring attention to fresh Non-Fungible Token collections. Guild of Guardians Heroes was the top-selling NFT collection this week. It made $24.7 million in sales, doubling its previous performance. This collection runs on Immutable, which helped it grow fast. On the Polygon network, Courtyard came second with $17.2 million in sales. Another Guild of Guardians collection, Avatars, came third with $10.3 million. DMarket held onto fourth place, and Bitcoin’s Ordinals, a new entry, made it into the top five with a massive increase in sales. These changes in rankings show that newer collections and platforms are gaining ground while older names, like CryptoPunks, are beginning to fade. Surprisingly, CryptoPunks dropped out of the top five collections, even though some NFTs sold for high prices. In late March, CryptoPunks saw the highest growth, as sales spiked by a staggering 141% to reach $6.3 million. Amid the collection’s success, CryptoPunk #2967 made the top individual NFT sale of the week, selling 420 ETH for $843,070. However, new NFT collections are taking over, and CryptoPunks are no longer in the spotlight.

2025-06-15T22:22:35,"From Zero Hardware to Daily Bitcoin & Dogecoin Profits: HASHJ Cloud Mining in 2025","In 2025, Bitcoin mining is no longer the domain of cavernous server rooms and late-night kernel hackers. Cloud mining has turned a once hardware‑heavy pursuit into something anyone can start with a smartphone, a modest budget, and a few taps. But can zero hardware really compound into nearly a million dollars? Absolutely—provided you choose the right provider. Below are five cloud‑mining services that have stood out this year for regulatory compliance, consistent payouts, and global scale. Together they show how US $100 can, in the right circumstances, snowball toward six—or even seven—figures. 1. HASHJ — Ultra-Short 1- to 3-Day Contracts for Rapid Gains Minimum deposit: US $100 • Peak daily return: Up to US $9,600 (investment‑dependent) • Payout mode: Daily auto‑credit in BTC or USDT, with zero hidden fees Licensed in multiple jurisdictions, HASHJ offers 2‑factor authentication, custodial wallets, and 24/7 live support. Its stripped‑down interface lets newcomers get started in under five minutes. How to begin: 1. Head to https://hashj.com and unlock an instant US $18 welcome bonus when you register. 2. Select a 1‑ to 3‑day contract. 3. Top up your account with crypto. 4. Let the platform handle the mining and watch daily revenue land in your wallet. 2. StormGain — Free Cloud Mining Plus Spot Trading in One App StormGain fuses zero‑cost cloud mining with a full spot‑trading terminal inside a single mobile app—no leverage, options, or other derivatives to complicate risk. The built‑in profit calculator, live price panel, and flexible contract lengths let users scale hash power up or down at will. Global, high‑efficiency data centers keep uptime high and temperatures low, making StormGain a one‑stop choice for miners who want the option to sell, HODL, or stake their freshly minted coins the moment they receive them. 3. Bitdeer — Enterprise‑Grade Hash Power, Retail‑Friendly Interface With heavyweight miner manufacturer Bitmain behind it, Bitdeer funnels data-center–level hash power directly into the hands of everyday crypto investors. Choose from shared mining pools, fixed‑term contracts, or large bespoke packages—perfect for everyone from small holders to institutions with deep capital. 4. hashj Mining — Legacy Stability for Conservative Investors A veteran of the cloud‑mining scene, hashj Mining (not to be confused with HASHJ’s ultra‑short product above) boasts years of operational history and a worldwide node network. Its yields are deliberately less aggressive than newer entrants, but its emphasis on rock‑solid uptime and stringent security standards makes it a favourite for risk‑averse users seeking reliable, predictable returns. 5. ViaBTC — Dual Engine of Mining Pool & Cloud Contracts ViaBTC operates one of the world’s largest public mining pools and offers cloud‑contract purchasing on the same platform. Investors can buy hash power outright or plug existing rigs into the pool for fee sharing. Comprehensive analytics and diverse withdrawal methods offer the perfect blend of instant liquidity and sustainable mining returns. The Bottom Line: Million‑Dollar Cloud Mining Isn’t Fantasy Turning a small stake into life‑changing capital may sound far‑fetched, but with a compliant provider, verifiable hash power, and transparent payout logic, it’s within reach. Actual results depend on contract choice, market cycles, and your reinvestment strategy—but these five names, especially the fast‑cycle model of HASHJ, prove that you don’t need hardware or coding skills to tap the digital gold rush.
