2025-06-16T15:51:26,"Michael Saylor’s Strategy Snaps Up $1.05B in Bitcoin – Debt-Fueled Bet or Masterstroke?","Strategy disclosed in a Form 8‑K filed June 16 that it has purchased an additional 10,100 Bitcoin at a cost of approximately $1.05 billion, representing an average acquisition price of about $104,080 per bitcoin. Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 $BTC acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/BOs3GOaUva — Strategy (@Strategy) June 16, 2025 This latest investment raises Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to approximately 592,100 BTC, solidifying its standing as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders globally. The firm continues executing on its “buy and hold” strategy, fueled by proceeds from equity and debt financing, rather than using its at‑the‑market programs. Importantly, Strategy did not sell any stock or Bitcoin in the days surrounding the acquisition. Continued Confidence in Bitcoin’s Long-Term Value In the filing, Strategy’s management stresses its unwavering conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, although they acknowledge the volatility and risks associated with such a concentrated treasury allocation. The filing explicitly warns that the absence of diversification heightens exposure to Bitcoin’s short-term price fluctuations: “The concentration of our assets in Bitcoin limits our ability to mitigate risk that could otherwise be achieved by holding a more diversified portfolio.” Strategy notes that this strategy “has not been tested over an extended period of time or under different market conditions.” Financing and Risk Factors The 8‑K also discloses that Strategy’s Bitcoin acquisitions are financed primarily through debt and equity, making the company dependent on favorable financing conditions to sustain its accumulation trajectory. Strategy also flags counterparty and custody risks, acknowledging that if custodians were to undergo insolvency, access to stored bitcoin might be impeded. This purchase follows a recent 10-for-1 stock split in August 2024, ensuring that per-share metrics in the Form 8‑K reflect adjusted, post-split figures. With Bitcoin hovering around $104k, Strategy’s entry is striking for its size and continued commitment amid a volatile macroeconomic environment. Michael Saylor Extends Hand to Pakistan’s Crypto Ambition This weekend, Michael Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy, reportedly met with top Pakistani officials to explore how crypto could help reshape the country’s financial future. The talks, described by officials as a “landmark discussion,” brought Saylor together with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib . The agenda focused on how Bitcoin could be used in sovereign reserves and monetary policy. Meanwhile, Pakistan is accelerating efforts to become a digital asset leader in the Global South. “Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation, and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” said Aurangzeb, who also chairs the Pakistan Crypto Council.

2025-06-16T15:46:09,"A Critical Week in Bitcoin: How Will the Fed Decision Affect the Price? Is the Next Stop for BTC a New ATH? Analysts Explained!","Bitcoin (BTC), which was affected by the tension and geopolitical tension between Israel and Iran and fell to the $100,000 level, continues to recover. At this point, while Bitcoin has climbed above $106,500, there is still some uneasiness in the market about the direction of the price. Speaking to The Block, BTC Markets analyst Rachael Lucas explained her updated Bitcoin analysis. Is the New ATH the Next Stop for Bitcoin? Stating that Bitcoin is extremely sensitive to geopolitical uncertainties, Rachael Lucas said that despite this, BTC recovered quickly. Lucas noted that Bitcoin price is currently being shaped by a combination of three factors: corporate flows, macroeconomic data, and geopolitical risk. The analyst also said that the fear and greed index currently stands at 61, indicating a moderate outlook. The recent recovery against this figure reflects optimistic yet cautious investor sentiment, he said. Finally, the analyst stated that he expects a new ATH and said: “Geopolitical uncertainty often drives Bitcoin down. This was the case in the Israel-Iran case. However, BTC usually recovers quickly as investors use Bitcoin as a geopolitical hedge. At this point, the recent breakout of the $106,406 resistance in Bitcoin shows that the bullish momentum continues, and the next important target will be the all-time high. All or Nothing for Bitcoin and Ethereum! Apart from Rachael Lucas, Kronos Research CIO Vincent Liu also evaluated BTC's recent movements. Liu, who predicted that Bitcoin would make a breakout after the uncertainty and tensions ended, said, “Bitcoin is seeing strong global liquidity and institutional demand, which could pave the way for a breakout once the dust settles in the market.” However, Liu stated that a much more important event awaits us, and said that this is the FED interest rate decision. According to Liu, this meeting could mean “all or nothing” for BTC and Ethereum. *This is not investment advice.

In an announcement on June 16, Chaos Labs said Avalanche ( AVAX ) will leverage the Proof-of-Reserves system to provide transparent verification for bridged assets in the Avalanche DeFi stack. This includes ecosystem top coins for cross-chain liquidity, such as Avalanche Bridged Bitcoin (BTC.b) and bridged Wrapped Ethereum (WETH.e) on Avalanche. Beyond cross-chain liquidity, bridged assets like BTC.b and WETH.e unlock collateral utility. They also enable deeper liquidity for decentralized finance features like trading, lending, and structured products. Chaos Labs’ Proof-of-Reserves adds an on-chain system that allows users to monitor and verify the reserves backing these bridged assets. With Chaos Labs’ Proof-of-Reserves architecture, Avalanche can now track reserve data across canonical bridges and custodial solutions. The on-chain validation of attestations enables public monitoring of the Bitcoin and Ethereum that back the BTC.b and WETH.e supplies. Users can verify whether bridged assets on Avalanche have full reserves on their native chains, Bitcoin on the Bitcoin network and Ethereum on the Ethereum network. Importantly, DeFi users on Avalanche, as well as developers and protocols, no longer have to rely on third-party providers to verify tokenized or collateralized assets.

The CEO explained that individuals could and should buy and hold Bitcoin alone. Yakovenko added that altcoin teams should buy low-risk assets like Treasury bills. The CEO of Solana Labs, Anatoly Yakovenko, dismissed the plans of altcoin teams holding Bitcoin for their users. Yakovenko claimed that individuals did not require a team to invest in Bitcoin. The Solana Labs top executive explained that individuals could and should hold Bitcoin for themselves. The CEO recommended that altcoin projects buy and hold enough short-term assets, such as U.S. T-bills, to cover three years of operating expenses. Cardano plans to convert $100 million of ADA into BTC This is so dumb. Projects should keep 18-36 months of post kill list runway in short term tbills but that’s about it. Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts. — toly 🇺🇸 (@aeyakovenko) June 16, 2025 Yakovenko’s comment came after Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, said his firm would consider converting $100 million worth of ADA into BTC and other stable assets. According to Hoskinson, the proposal wouldn’t hurt his firm’s ecosystem. The Cardano co-founder added that the plan would help grow its treasury with time through yield. Hoskinson argued that yields from BTC would help the team buy back more ADA. Hoskinson explained that if the plan succeeded, they would continue the strategy on an annualized basis for 5 to 10 years. The Cardano executive expressed his belief that the strategy had the potential to grow to over a billion dollars. Hoskinson previously said Bitcoin did not have the right to be considered the only sound money blockchain. The Cardano executive recently stated that the firm would not allow the maxi and the Bitcoin ecosystem to take the lead. Hoskinson argued that the biggest threat to BTC’s dominance was and would always be Cardano. The crypto community has weighed in on the matter. Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest stated that subpar altcoins ditching their digital assets to create a Bitcoin treasury was not on his 2025 bingo card. DeFi platform Alva argued that Cardano’s idea of turning $100 million worth of ADA into BTC was a bit risky. Alva, however, claimed that the move could strengthen Cardano’s position in decentralized finance. Cardano joins Polkadot in the BTC strategy race Cardano’s plan to convert some of its ADA into Bitcoin and other stable assets came barely a week after the Polkadot community revealed plans to introduce a crypto reserve. Members of the Polkadot community have suggested the establishment of a BTC reserve for the Polkadot Treasury . The proposal intends to change 500,000 DOT into Threshold BTC (tBTC) in a year with the help of Hydration’s rolling DCA feature. Polkadot has previously explored diversification by introducing stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Polkadot community members said they want the capital to be offered as liquidity to Omnipool so that the funds could be put to use. The community members also suggested an extra 1,000 DOT be reserved for transaction fees. The proposers revealed that Bitcoin was highlighted in the main diversification proposal as an asset that could help reduce volatility and also maintain the value of the Polkadot Treasury. The Polkadot community members proposed tBTC for its decentralization, transparency, and liquidity. The proposal recommends selling a fixed amount of DOT for every trade instead of buying a fixed amount of tBTC. The members agreed that the total number of DOT tokens would first be converted into a yield-bearing collateral token and distributed into the Hydration Borrow functionality. The proposers revealed that the Polkadot Treasury will gain yield on the dormant DOT while also improving the DOT supply available for borrowing. The proposal outlined that portions of 0.005 tBTC will be introduced as liquidity into the Hydration Omnipool following a brief accumulation period. The community anticipates that this approach will contribute to diversifying the Polkadot Treasury’s holdings.

Key Takeaways: Affluent has launched as Telegram’s first native DeFi app, offering lending and yield strategies on TON. The project targets both retail savers and institutional liquidity providers within Telegram’s vast user base. A new points program aims to boost engagement, starting with deposits into the TON multiply vault. The project officially launched Monday, offering users lending pools and crypto yield strategies in a streamlined format designed to function within the Telegram interface, the project said on X . Co-founded by Justin Hyun, a former director of the TON Foundation, and Hyung Lee of DeFi R&D group B-Harvest, Affluent aims to transform Telegram into a financial super app. Affluent Targets Retail Savings and Institutional Liquidity in DeFi Push The project promises to simplify crypto savings for retail users while offering deep liquidity access for institutional players. Affluent aims to “bring real, trustless asset management to Telegram’s billion-user ecosystem,” the project said on X, positioning the app as a “smart bank for crypto.” The strategy mirrors the success of super apps like WeChat, which seamlessly blend messaging, payments, and financial services in a single user environment. By embedding DeFi functionality directly into a platform with over 900 million users, Affluent sidesteps many of the usability challenges that have long hampered broader DeFi adoption. Telegram users will now be able to access lending and yield products without leaving the app. “Affluent is launching a points program to incentivize users for various activities. The first action is to deposit into the TON multiply vault,” the project said. 6/ What’s next? • USDT Multiply Vault: Stablecoin denominate delta-neutral engine for risk-adjusted yield • Strategy Vaults composable with BTC, Gold, U.S. Treasury, Tokenized Private Credit • Payment from your vault: Collateralization and payment from your vault tokens •… — Affluent (@AffluentOrg) June 16, 2025 Although Telegram distanced itself from TON after regulatory issues forced it to shelve its original blockchain ambitions in 2020, the platform formally backed TON in September 2023. That endorsement has since accelerated development across the ecosystem, with Affluent now marking a notable step forward in integrating DeFi into Telegram’s daily user experience. Telegram Shuts Down Channels Linked to Xinbi and Huione In May, Telegram took down thousands of channels tied to the Chinese-language marketplaces Xinbi Guarantee and Huione Guarantee after a report by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic exposed their role in over $35 billion worth of illicit transactions, largely using Tether (USDT). Xinbi alone has seen at least $8.4 billion in USDT since 2022, while Huione accounts for at least $27 billion, offering services ranging from fake IDs to money laundering. These marketplaces operate openly within Telegram’s group infrastructure, connecting vendors and buyers for illegal goods and services. Huione, reportedly linked to Cambodia’s ruling elite, sells everything from personal data to intimidation-for-hire services. Xinbi, with over 233,000 users, offers services in categories like crypto laundering, forged documents, SIM cards, and access to stolen databases. The platforms have become a go-to for laundering proceeds from pig butchering scams , which are frauds that combine romance or investment lures to steal large sums in crypto.

The purchase occurred during market volatility triggered by escalating Israel-Iran tensions, as Bitcoin dropped from $110,000 to an intraweek low of $103,639. The deal puts Strategy’s year-to-date Bitcoin yield at 19.1%, much closer to the company’s target of 25% by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, BlackRock, too, has been steadily building its BTC position, buying a staggering $1.1 billion worth of Bitcoin in recent weeks. Different approaches Strategy operates as a corporate treasury play, with CEO Michael Saylor positioning Bitcoin as the company’s primary asset and using various financing methods to acquire more. The company recently debuted its third Bitcoin-backed preferred stock, STRD, on Nasdaq to raise an additional $250 million for further Bitcoin purchases. BlackRock, on the other hand, accumulates Bitcoin through its exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) structure, pooling investor capital to build massive positions. The firm aims to become the world’s leading digital asset manager by 2030, aiming to manage at least $50 billion in crypto within five years. As both institutions maintain their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategies, the frontrunner may keep shifting. What’s certain is that together, BlackRock and Strategy now control over 1.3 million Bitcoin, representing roughly 6% of the total supply and demonstrating the massive institutional adoption that has transformed the entire crypto sector.

He said it is a realistic path forward. During an interview with Bradley Kimes of Digital Perspective at the XRP Las Vegas conference, Giancarlo outlined how digital assets are increasingly viewed as viable components of public finance by both federal and local governments. Giancarlo’s growing interest among U.S. policymakers in utilizing cryptocurrencies in public finance. He noted that conversations in Washington are increasingly considering how various levels of government could acquire, hold, and even issue financial instruments based on crypto assets.

One of the most important 4:22… pic.twitter.com/JjzG5ER8YU — Digital Perspectives (@DigPerspectives) June 12, 2025 Shifting Federal Strategy Toward Digital Asset Retention Giancarlo highlighted a notable shift in the President Trump administration’s handling of confiscated digital assets. He has positively impacted the crypto market so far. Rather than liquidating seized cryptocurrencies, federal agencies are retaining them as long-term strategic holdings. As a result, some have speculated that the government could hold XRP via Ripple’s penalty in the legal battle with the SEC. Giancarlo criticized previous administrations for selling off assets prematurely, arguing that holding them could have yielded significant gains and helped reduce financial burdens. He emphasized that this change does not require congressional approval, as executive agencies already have the authority to retain seized digital assets. Giancarlo proposed that digital assets could serve a role similar to the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is used to stabilize markets and enhance economic resilience. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He suggested that digital assets could bolster national influence, especially amid BRICS efforts to challenge the dollar’s dominance. Drawing parallels to China’s stockpiling of strategic resources, Giancarlo argued the U.S. should build reserves of Bitcoin, XRP, and other digital commodities. Establishment of Cryptocurrency Reserves This vision is already taking shape. In March 2025, President Trump signed an executive order establishing the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , which now holds over 200,000 BTC, primarily obtained through forfeitures. It is positioned as a long-term store of value, akin to digital gold. Notably, the administration also launched the Digital Asset Stockpile to hold Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano. This reserve allows for controlled asset management and greater flexibility. Kimes concluded that digital reserves could be used as instruments of market influence, much like oil reserves, to steer financial policy and respond to economic threats.

The goal, according to Hoskinson, is to create yield that could later be used to buy back ADA, helping to strengthen the protocol’s position and DeFi ecosystem over time. “I do believe that it will not materially impact Cardano by doing a conversion of 5–10% of the treasury,” Hoskinson said. “And in doing this, we will create yield, and this yield… can be used to purchase ADA and over time replenish the treasury.” Hoskinson described the long-term plan as a way to grow Cardano’s treasury into a “billion-dollar-plus” pool of stablecoins and Bitcoin, similar to how sovereign wealth funds operate. Yakovenko’s response reflects a broader skepticism in parts of the crypto community about projects managing Bitcoin on behalf of users. His view is that individual holders should manage BTC exposure on their own, not through protocol-level holdings. The debate has also drawn reactions from the broader crypto community. One X user, “ y00thereum ,” mocked the shift, saying, “Remember how dis clown was always sayin that his shtcoin Cardano is better than Bitcoin? Now he wants to dump $1.2B in ADA for BTC and stables. Hahaha, you can’t make this sht up.” Remember how dis clown was always sayin that his sh*tcoin Cardano is better than Bitcoin ? now he wants to dump $1.2B $ADA for $BTC and stables. hahaha you can't make this sh*t up https://t.co/cquNc91QCk pic.twitter.com/GpezrdLrNg — y00thereum (@y00thereum) June 16, 2025 Others defended the idea. A user named TJ Coosh pointed out that Cardano is building interoperability for Bitcoin in DeFi. “The BTC converted from the treasury would be to inject some BTC liquidity into DeFi pools on the Cardano side, allowing bitcoiners a smoother DeFi experience,” he said. As altcoin projects look for ways to strengthen their ecosystems and navigate uncertain markets, the question of whether to hold Bitcoin or stick to T-bills remains up for debate. Yakovenko has made his position clear. Whether Cardano’s plan works out is something only time will tell. Polkadot Joins Treasury Diversification Trend as Cardano Hits Staking Milestone Cardano’s $100 million Bitcoin treasury proposal isn’t an isolated move; it’s part of a growing trend across major blockchains experimenting with multi-asset treasury strategies. Polkadot is weighing a similar move. Recently, a Polkadot community member p roposed selling 500,000 DOT (~$1.95 million) to build a Bitcoin reserve via a dollar-cost averaging strategy. Supporters argue BTC can help stabilize treasuries as DOT’s price continues to lag in 2025. @Polkadot members divided as a proposal to convert 500,000 DOT into Bitcoin for a strategic hedge sparks debate. #Polkadot #Bitcoin https://t.co/KBdEelN2nW — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 13, 2025 However, some question the timing, given Bitcoin’s current all-time highs above $106,000. Meanwhile, Cardano’s network fundamentals remain strong. The ADA token gained 3% over the past day, following news that staking participation has surpassed 1.3 million addresses, solidifying its position among the most actively staked chains.

2025-06-16T15:02:26,"Home on the (BTC) Range","Hi. I’m Andy Baehr with the CoinDesk Indices team. Question: Bitcoin is stuck in a range. Is that a bad thing or a good thing? Even casual BTC watchers will have noted the ten percent channel that has held for more than a month. As of today, in fact, it has been 40 days since we entered the ~$101K - ~$111K range, with no catalyst forcing a breakout through either boundary. Good or bad thing? The macro muddle supports range-trading. Our anchor bitcoin macro factor remains expectations for future real interest rates--nominal rates minus inflation. Recent cross-currents create an unclear picture: inflation expectations from surveys have been elevated (though recent releases seem less concerning), while hopes for Fed relief were dim until the market began pricing in two 2025 cuts more assertively. Too muddled for a breakout. Bitcoin is doing what it should. For the store-of-value thesis, range-trading is actually fine. As bitcoin accumulates more days of ""not unexpected"" behavior, it supports the narrative of relative independence from other risk assets and improved stability. (The S&P 500 has also kept an 8% range through the same 39 days, so bitcoin isn't alone in this holding pattern, although recent news flows might have knocked a younger bitcoin off the track.) But traders are getting restless. Bitcoin's basement-level thirty-day realized volatility below 30% crimps opportunity. Implied vols are also down as option buyers grow fatigued and sellers grab yield more confidently. Like any market, a range that holds too long creates complacency—making the eventual exit more ""exciting"" than it would otherwise be. The stalled mood is hurting breadth. Without bitcoin providing leadership, other digital assets are wilting. The CoinDesk 20 Index has trailed bitcoin by about 5% over the past month, as the lack of sentiment has stalled the late-April rally, even in ETH, which had bounced strongly. How does this compare historically? With some truly unattractive vibe coding (I take the blame), we studied bitcoin's longest streaks of holding 10% ranges. The current 40-day stretch isn't the longest—that was 42 days—but it's close. Similar streaks occurred in 2018, 2020, and 2023. Given bitcoin's evolved ownership structure (ETFs, MSTR) and more accessible spot and derivatives markets, would a 50-day streak surprise anyone? Not sure.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/06/16/home-on-the-btc-range,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Opinion|Opinion",cryptocompare

Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Across North America And Asia","June 16th, 2025 – Vancouver, Canada Company Begins Bitcoin Accumulation And Signs Non-binding Strategic Mou With Japan’s Gfa Co., Ltd. Targets Launching Bitcoin Treasuries in Asia’s US$25 Trillion Public Market Universal Digital Inc. (the “Company” or “Universal Digital”) (CSE: “LFG”, FSE: 8R20) is pleased to announce the launch of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, which will form a core pillar of the Company’s capital allocation framework. As an initial step, the Company has commenced the orderly divestment of its existing altcoin holdings, with the proceeds to be reallocated toward Bitcoin accumulation under a new reserve model. The goal of this strategy is to enhance long-term net asset value and align the Company with global trends in institutional digital asset adoption. Universal Digital views Bitcoin as a complementary reserve asset and plans to implement the strategy in a transparent and phased manner. As part of this initiative, the Company plans to collaborate with publicly-listed companies across Asia to implement Bitcoin treasury models, leveraging the region’s growing institutional and retail interest in digital assets and its increasing openness to blockchain-based financial innovation. According to Chainalysis, Eastern Asia accounted for approximately 8.9% of global on-chain cryptocurrency transaction volume between July 2023 and June 2024, with the bulk of activity driven by institutional and professional investors in markets like Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In furtherance of this regional focus, on June 12, 2025, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with GFA Co., Ltd. (“GFA”), a Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed diversified financial and technology group (TSE: 8783). The MOU sets out a partnership framework for jointly advancing Bitcoin-based corporate finance models in Japan. Under the MOU, the companies will jointly explore: Introducing Bitcoin reserve models to Japanese listed companies; Structuring capital raising tools such as warrants and market-based offerings to fund Bitcoin acquisitions; and Enhancing governance, investor relations, and custody frameworks for digital assets.

The MOU was entered on an arm’s length basis and there are no related party interests between Universal Digital and GFA. “Our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy marks a deliberate shift in how we manage capital — by holding Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset, we aim to enhance balance sheet strength and align with the evolving global financial landscape,” said Tim Chan, CEO of the Company. “The framework we’ve established with GFA enables us to explore extending this model to Asia, where digital assets are gaining traction among public companies and institutional investors.” “Universal Digital’s and its management’s experience with the crypto and Bitcoin treasury combined with our expertise on the Japanese markets makes us a strong team. I look forward to working closely with Universal Digital to introduce bitcoin reserve model to Japanese listed companies.” Stated Gen Matsuda, CEO of GFA Co., Ltd.

2025-06-16T14:56:12,"Bitcoin (BTC) Price Stable Amid Ongoing Middle East Conflict","With no sign of the Israel/Iran conflict growing any less belligerent, Bitcoin is continuing to recover from its correction below $103,000, and is currently riding high again at over $106,600. Can Bitcoin continue to buck the market trend, or will a nervous U.S. stock market start to drag on the number one cryptocurrency? $BTC continues to bounce with alacrity Source: TradingView The 8-hour chart view above shows how the $BTC price went all the way down to touch the support at just below $103,000. This occurred when Israel started to launch strikes into Iran. However, since that time the $BTC price has bounced with alacrity, adding $4,400 while the conflict has raged. Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold $106,800 and turn it into support. If they can do so, this will be a real feather in their cap, given that this is an important level for price structure and would be a good platform for building upon. Positive indicators in the daily chart Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it can be seen that both the Stochastic RSI and the RSI are posturing to make positive crosses of their indicator lines. If these lines are able to cross, this could supply the momentum needed for the bulls to flip that $107,000 resistance level into support again. Weekly Stochastic RSI turning back positive? Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows the price traveling sideways in a narrow range. If the bulls can prevent the price from confirming under the $104,400 support it is possibly just a matter of time before the next break higher. Of huge importance, at the bottom of the chart, is the weekly Stochastic RSI. A cross down of the indicators a few weeks ago could have presaged a fall to much lower prices, and even a potential end to the bull market, but as can be seen, the blue indicator line is possibly shaping up to cross back above the orange indicator line. This could be the initial bounce from the 80.00 level that could see these indicator lines traveling sideways perhaps for an extended period of time. If this takes place, there could be a lot more upside price action in this bull market yet. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Announces Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Across North America And Asia Vancouver, Canada, June 16th, 2025, Chainwire Company Begins Bitcoin Accumulation And Signs Non-binding Strategic Mou With Japan’s Gfa Co., Ltd. Targets Launching Bitcoin Treasuries in Asia’s US$25 Trillion Public Market Universal Digital Inc. (the “Company” or “Universal Digital”) (CSE: “LFG”, FSE: 8R20) is pleased to announce the launch of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, which will form a core pillar of the Company’s capital allocation framework. As an initial step, the Company has commenced the orderly divestment of its existing altcoin holdings, with the proceeds to be reallocated toward Bitcoin accumulation under a new reserve model. The goal of this strategy is to enhance long-term net asset value and align the Company with global trends in institutional digital asset adoption. Universal Digital views Bitcoin as a complementary reserve asset and plans to implement the strategy in a transparent and phased manner. As part of this initiative, the Company plans to collaborate with publicly-listed companies across Asia to implement Bitcoin treasury models, leveraging the region’s growing institutional and retail interest in digital assets and its increasing openness to blockchain-based financial innovation. According to Chainalysis, Eastern Asia accounted for approximately 8.9% of global on-chain cryptocurrency transaction volume between July 2023 and June 2024, with the bulk of activity driven by institutional and professional investors in markets like Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. In furtherance of this regional focus, on June 12, 2025, the Company entered into a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with GFA Co., Ltd. (“GFA”), a Tokyo Stock Exchange-listed diversified financial and technology group (TSE: 8783). The MOU sets out a partnership framework for jointly advancing Bitcoin-based corporate finance models in Japan. Under the MOU, the companies will jointly explore: Introducing Bitcoin reserve models to Japanese listed companies; Structuring capital raising tools such as warrants and market-based offerings to fund Bitcoin acquisitions; and Enhancing governance, investor relations, and custody frameworks for digital assets. The MOU also sets the stage for broader collaboration in Japan’s digital economy, including joint investments in public companies, the development of blockchain-based corporate structures, initiatives that connect Bitcoin adoption with cultural IP and Web3-driven consumer ecosystems. The MOU was entered on an arm’s length basis and there are no related party interests between Universal Digital and GFA. “Our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy marks a deliberate shift in how we manage capital — by holding Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset, we aim to enhance balance sheet strength and align with the evolving global financial landscape,” said Tim Chan, CEO of the Company. “The framework we’ve established with GFA enables us to explore extending this model to Asia, where digital assets are gaining traction among public companies and institutional investors.” “Universal Digital’s and its management’s experience with the crypto and Bitcoin treasury combined with our expertise on the Japanese markets makes us a strong team. I look forward to working closely with Universal Digital to introduce bitcoin reserve model to Japanese listed companies.” Stated Gen Matsuda, CEO of GFA Co., Ltd.

2025-06-16T14:31:21,"Trump Coin Price Prediction: Weak Volume Could Be a Warning Sign – Or a Perfect Setup","The Trump Coin price has recovered to $10.13 today , after a weekend that saw cryptocurrency prices decline in response to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran . Despite this, TRUMP remains down by 2% in a week and by 19% in the past month, with the meme token also nursing a steep 86% loss since reaching an ATH of $73.43 in January. These are concerning percentages, and what’s also troubling is that TRUMP’s trading volume currently stands at a lowly $213 million, a 99.4% decline from peaks recorded back in January. It’s therefore arguable that TRUMP is suffering from a terminal decline, although its low volume and liquidity could enable it to pump hard if a whale swoops in. Trump Coin Price Prediction: Weak Volume Could Be a Warning Sign – Or a Perfect Setup Looking at TRUMP’s chart, we at least see that the coin may be close to bottoming out, implying that a rally could be on its way. Of particular note is its 30-period average (orange), which formed a death cross with the 200-period (blue) at the start of June. Source: TradingView We also see that TRUMP’s relative strength index (purple) has been below 50 since the final third of May, which again points to an approaching recovery. On the other hand, the aforementioned low volume is a big issue, and indicates a serious lack of interest in the meme token. In fact, we’ve seen evidence of big traders shorting the token in recent weeks , while one-time whales have declined to repurchase the token while buying other meme coins . This is all very ominous for the coin, and would suggest that it doesn’t have long-term viability. However, given Donald Trump’s penchant for self-promotion, we can’t rule out the possibility that he and/or his team will announce something big to pump the token in the coming days or weeks. $TRUMP Fractal Signals Huge Upside? TRUMP is showing the same setup that led $PEPE to a 934% rally. Read Details: https://t.co/5nnEfx5PBv pic.twitter.com/bQWTxRPIs0 — CoinsProbe (@CoinsProbe) June 13, 2025 The Trump Coin price could potentially return to $12 in the next few weeks, before passing $16 by the end of July. It will need more favorable macroeconomic and political conditions to achieve this, while it will also need its trading volume to improve, but it’s certainly not out of the question. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $1.3 Million for Cutting-Edge Layer-Two Network Because TRUMP looks pretty questionable right now, many traders may already want to turn to alternatives, with several presale coins showing promise as investment vehicles. One of these is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), an Ethereum- and Solana-based layer-two project that has now raised more than $1.3 million in its ongoing sale. Given that it launched this sale only a few weeks ago, this figure is a strong sign of Bitcoin Hyper’s future potential. Indeed, Bitcoin Hyper is preparing to launch a layer-two for Bitcoin that will reduce the latter’s transaction fees while massively boosting its throughput. It’s basically aiming to become a big DeFi layer for Bitcoin, with the L2 introducing a range of dapps and DEXes that will attract significant trading volume. Its protocol will operate using zero-knowledge proofs, while it will also make use of Ethereum and Solana virtual machines, for maximum compatibility. As its native token, HYPER will be necessary to pay for transaction fees, while it will also be open to staking and governance. It could therefore grow massively upon launch, with investors able to join its sale by going to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connecting a wallet. HYPER currently costs $0.0119, but this will rise later today, and will continue to rise periodically until the sale ends.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Rekt Capital tells his 549,400 followers on the social media platform X that the top altcoin is holding a key level that has historically sparked rallies afterwards. “Ethereum continues to maintain $2,500 as support despite the dip. Historically, holding $2500 as support has enabled moves to $4,000 over time. Ethereum needs to keep demonstrating stability here, just like it has done for the past five weeks now.” Source: Rekt Capital/X Ethereum is trading for $2,517 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day. A rise to Rekt Capital’s price target would be about a 60% increase for ETH. Moving on to the top crypto asset by market cap, the analyst says Bitcoin ( BTC ) last line of resistance appears to be getting weaker after the crypto king closed last week above $105,000. “Bitcoin has rejected from the final major weekly resistance. But how strong will this rejection be? Rejection from a few weeks ago caused a -8% dip. Thus far, this rejection caused a -5.8% dip. If this dip is shallower, resistance [is] getting weaker.” Source: Rekt Capital/X The trader also notes that the best thing for the crypto king’s price tag is to avoid a daily close below $106,000, followed by a subsequent rejection. “On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin found support at this local green area yesterday. What price needs to avoid doing is daily closing below the green box and rejecting from it like in the previous red circle.” Source: Rekt Capital/X BTC is trading for $106,788 at time of writing, an over 1% increase on the day.

It outpaced the early growth of USDT and USDC. Its success has revived interest in using Bitcoin as a settlement layer for stablecoins . The rapid rise of stablecoins, particularly World Liberty Financial’s USD1, is reshaping industry conversations. Launched in March 2025, USD1 reached a $2.1 billion market cap within just two months, an explosive debut that’s drawn renewed attention to Bitcoin’s potential as a host for stablecoin payment rails. According to a blog post by crypto analyst Norbert, USD1’s growth is fueling broader speculation about Bitcoin evolving from a store of value into a transactional backbone for digital dollars. WLFI: From Skepticism to Success Notably, World Liberty Financial launched in September 2024 to mixed reactions.

2025-06-16T14:23:27,"Strategy acquires another 10,100 BTC as Bitcoin shrugs the Israel-Iran conflict","Michael Saylor’s Strategy has once again made headlines with another bold Bitcoin (BTC) acquisition, even as global markets remain on edge over rising geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran. The firm purchased 10,100 BTC, demonstrating unwavering confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, regardless of the surrounding instability in the Middle East. Bitcoin is holding firm amid the ongoing Middle East conflict As reports emerged of Israel targeting Iranian oil and gas facilities, fears briefly mounted over the potential for wider escalation. However, Bitcoin (BTC) defied expectations by climbing from around $104,000 to a peak of $107,000 over the weekend, surprising traders and analysts alike. Oil prices, meanwhile, remained flat at $73 per barrel despite rising Middle East oil shipping costs , suggesting that markets may be pricing in a controlled or limited conflict rather than a full-blown war. Despite threats that the Strait of Hormuz could be closed, which would risk major disruption to global oil flows, markets showed little concern. Some analysts believe that Iran itself would hesitate to block the Strait, as its own oil exports also rely on that crucial route. China’s equity markets, initially rattled by the news, also managed to close the day in the green, with Asian markets looking unfazed by Middle East tensions . Strategy moved swiftly as the market reacted to the Israel-Iran conflict Seizing on the brief dip in Bitcoin’s price following the start of the Israel-Iran ‘war’, Strategy acted swiftly, buying 10,100 BTC at an average price of $104,080. This strategic move brought the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to a staggering 592,100 BTC, purchased at a combined cost of approximately $41.84 billion. Strategy’s average entry price now stands at $70,666 per Bitcoin, and with a 2025 year-to-date return of 19.1%, the company’s investment thesis continues to play out favourably. Michael Saylor confirmed the acquisition via his X account on June 16, noting that the latest purchase was part of a broader commitment to Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Michael Saylor @saylor · Follow Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025.

Through STRD, the company aims to raise $250 million by issuing 2.5 million shares at $100 each, with a 10% annual dividend. The funds raised from STRD will go directly into further Bitcoin purchases, underscoring Strategy’s aggressive and ongoing accumulation strategy. This financial model allows Strategy to tap traditional capital markets to strengthen its crypto position without selling existing BTC holdings. Institutional confidence strengthens Bitcoin’s image amid the conflict between Israel and Iran The timing of Strategy’s purchase during geopolitical turmoil signals more than just market opportunism. It suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly viewed as a resilient asset, capable of weathering not just economic headwinds but geopolitical shocks as well. With both equity and crypto markets brushing aside fears of escalation, institutional moves like Strategy’s reinforce the narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold. As the situation in the Middle East continues to evolve, eyes remain on whether other institutions will follow Strategy’s lead. For now, Strategy’s bold approach appears vindicated, as Bitcoin holds its ground and traditional assets follow suit. In a world where uncertainty dominates headlines, Strategy is betting that Bitcoin remains the one constant worth holding.

2025-06-16T14:22:22,"Justin Sun’s Tron to Go Public in the US: Report","The report by the Financial Times on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter, informs that the Justin Sun-founded blockchain project has partnered with Dominari Securities, an investment firm with ties to the US President, Donald Trump, to manage the deal. The joint entity will buy and hold Tron’s native token, TRX, in a move that will resemble, to a large extent, what Michael Saylor’s Strategy is doing with Bitcoin. Eric Trump, one of the POTUS’s sons, will have a role in the new firm, although the FT didn’t provide any specifics. These developments are in stark contrast to Justin Sun’s history with the former presidential administration and the Gary Gensler-led SEC. Just over two years ago, Sun and his companies were charged by the securities watchdog for fraud and other law violations. However, the Tron founder has established a closer and friendlier relationship with the 47th US President, Donald Trump. Recall that the blockchain executive attended a special dinner event organized by Trump’s team for the largest holders of Official Trump, the meme coin linked to the President. Sun has been openly praising the current administration, saying in an interview with CoinDesk after the TRUMP dinner that haters should really pay attention to what’s going on in the US.

Digital Asset Investments Strengthen with $1.9 Billion Inflows Despite Geopolitical Tensions With this figure, positive inflows were experienced for the ninth consecutive week, while total net inflows in 2025 reached a new record level of 13.2 billion dollars. Bitcoin is on the rise again: Bitcoin, which experienced a strong inflow of $1.3 billion after two weeks of mild increases, showed that investors are regaining confidence. Short Bitcoin products also saw limited inflows of $3.7 million, but the total assets under management of these products remain at $96 million. Ethereum’s biggest weekly inflow since February: Ethereum products had their strongest weekly performance of the year last week with net inflows of $583 million, a rise that made up the latest batch of inflows totaling $2 billion, accounting for 14% of the asset under management. Interest in altcoins is increasing again: XRP, which has experienced three consecutive weeks of growth, saw an inflow of $11.8 million in investors; Sui products also saw a positive flow of $3.5 million. The US stood out in regional distribution: Almost all of the total inflows came from US-based investors ($1.9 billion), while Switzerland ($20.7 million), Germany ($39.2 million) and Canada ($12.1 million) also made positive contributions. On the other hand, Hong Kong and Brazil experienced outflows of $56.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Resistance parallel to gold: It seems that digital assets, just like gold, are beginning to be perceived as a “safe haven” in a geopolitical risk environment. Analysts state that investors have increased their interest in crypto assets in the face of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. These data show that digital assets are becoming an increasingly attractive and resilient alternative for institutional investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-16T14:17:50,"Trump’s Truth Social joins ETF race with dual Bitcoin and Ethereum product","Truth Social’s newly filed ETF aims to simplify crypto investing by bundling BTC and ETH. Sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, could this be the next big ETF approval? On June 16, Truth Social operator, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., announced that it has filed a registration statement on Form S‑1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a dual exchange-traded fund combining Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exposure. The fund, Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, will comprise 75% of assets invested in BTC and 25% in ETH, offering investors a single-ticker way to gain exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. According to the statement, the ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital and custodied by Crypto.com, which will also handle staking and liquidity services. If approved, shares would debut on NYSE Arca under the ticker B.T., marking a major step in Trump Media’s expansion into financial services. You might also like: Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as investors bet on Israel-Iran peace deal Why a dual Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF? Truth Social’s decision to bundle into one fund, rather than launching separate products, can be seen as a strategic move betting on market trends and investor psychology. While standalone Bitcoin ETFs have dominated inflows since their January 2024 debut, demand for Ethereum exposure has quietly surged, with institutions eyeing ETH’s staking yields and deflationary tokenomics. With a 75% BTC / 25% ETH split, Truth Social’s B.T. fund will allow investors to benefit from simplified exposure to both “digital gold” and the utility-rich world of Ethereum without juggling separate issuers, custodians, or learning the different mechanics needed to balance the two volatile assets manually. But the subtext is unmistakably political. Unlike BlackRock, WisdomTree, or Fidelity’s vanilla crypto ETFs, the B.T. fund arrives wrapped in the Trump Media ecosystem, tapping into a base that views cryptocurrency as both an investment and a rebellion against traditional finance. Because the B.T. fund is steeped in both Trump branding and post-election optics, its approval process could ignite a highly politicized debate about crypto’s role in regulated markets. Some may champion it as an innovation, while skeptics will accuse it of weaponizing financial products for political gain. Either way, B.T. stands poised to become a litmus test, not just for enabling broader crypto adoption, but for defining how far politics can extend into finance.

Solana Labs co-founder calls it a “dumb” plan, questioning the need for teams to hold BTC. Community criticized Hoskinson’s strategy since it implies BTC is more valuable. Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has criticized Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson’s proposal to convert portions of the Cardano treasury into Bitcoin and stablecoins. He called the strategy “so dumb” and questioned why projects would hold Bitcoin on behalf of token holders. This is so dumb.

2025-06-16T14:06:52,"Saylor's Strategy delivers on bigger weekly purchase call with 10,100 BTC buy","Strategy logged another larger BTC purchase, this time allocating over $1B for its weekly treasury expansion. The new addition followed Michael Saylor’s X message on preferring “bigger orange dots,” representing larger purchases. Strategy tapped over $1B for its weekly BTC purchase, acquiring 10,100 BTC after a few weeks of smaller inflows. The latest purchase is bigger than the entire treasury of Metaplanet . During a volatile week, Strategy acquired BTC at an average price of $104,080. The purchase followed a pre-announcement by Michael Saylor, in spite of the short-term volatility. Strategy has acquired 10,100 BTC for ~$1.05 billion at ~$104,080 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 19.1% YTD 2025. As of 6/15/2025, we hodl 592,100 $BTC acquired for ~$41.84 billion at ~$70,666 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/n7q77DmqCY — Michael Saylor (@saylor) June 16, 2025 Saylor remains the most relevant corporate BTC accumulator The latest purchase raised the average purchase price for Strategy to $70,666, with the total BTC treasury expanding to 592,100 BTC. In total, Strategy has already spent over $41.8B for its treasury, remaining the leader in total holdings among corporate treasuries. Strategy still lags behind the holdings of BlackRock’s ETF, extending above 669K BTC. ETFs remain the more active and faster buyers, but the wallets are more volatile and also have days of rapid outflows. Saylor, on the other hand, is committed to long-term holding. In terms of BTC per share, Strategy is also ahead of other corporate buyers, with 20X the coins per share compared to Metaplanet . As usual, Saylor’s moves inspired other corporate buyers, increasing both the treasuries and the number of companies announcing acquisitions. It has also spilled over into altcoins, with small companies aiming to boost their shares by announcing SOL or XRP treasuries. Still, Strategy remains the undisputed leader with the most significant exposure to BTC. Bitcoin purchases help MSTR stabilize For companies building BTC treasuries, one of the effects is a positive move for the stock price. In the case of MSTR, the shares recovered above $382, retaining the higher baseline just under $400. MSTR shares recovered close to $400, though still waiting for a breakout to new highs. | Source: Google Finance MSTR is closely watched for a potential recovery and a stronger rally, as it now trades below the all-time high of $473.83 achieved on November 20, 2024. MSTR has seen lower volumes in the past few weeks, though the shares are still seen as outperforming. MSTR has also acquired partial meme status, with traders going long in expectation of ongoing rallies. Strategy is also making its structure more complex, with additional sales of convertible perpetual stock. Its BTC treasury approach continues to face criticism for creating systemic risk, which may spill over to the stock market. The latest purchase followed three rounds of share sales, with no new MSTR issued. Saylor raised $48.4M from STRK shares, and another $30M from STRF. The latest issue of preferred stock also means no new dilution for MSTR holders. Strategy has over $18B to deploy through common stock issuance, though the last few operations happened through preferred stock sales. Previously, Strategy also completed the round of its new convertible Stride (STRD) shares with 10% dividend, raising over $979M. The round allowed the firm to accelerate its buying, after two relatively slow weeks of BTC additions.

2025-06-16T14:06:26,"Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq rise as investors bet on Israel-Iran peace deal","Global stocks edged slightly higher on Monday, June 16, as investors appeared upbeat about a limited escalation of the Israel–Iran conflict. Risk assets were higher in early trading on Wall Street after the Israeli attack on Iran prompted Tehran to respond with missile strikes on Tel Aviv and other locations. Despite the initial negative reaction in the stock market , futures rose as the new week began with optimism that Middle East tensions would not escalate into a full-blown war. This sentiment saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average open 250 points, or 0.6%, higher, while the S&P 500 inched up 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite opened 1% higher. U.S. equities edging higher also coincided with a spike in Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the global crypto market capitalization increased 2.4% over $3.2 trillion.

Weak U.S. economic data also had not significantly disrupted the bullish setup. June, however, has seen the major U.S. indexes slide into bear territory over the past trading week. Investors are betting on a swift end to the escalation — something Trump has also commented on, albeit with the caveat that hostilities may yet “play out” before the two sides agree to end the attacks and counterattacks.

2025-06-16T14:02:15,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Starts Week On A Positive Note, Briefly Reclaims $107,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has made a positive start to the week after a sluggish weekend, reclaiming $107,000 and moving to its current level of $107,100 after an increase of 1.23%. The flagship cryptocurrency maintained its position above $105,000 despite facing selling pressure, indicating that traders are buying the dip. Analysts have predicted that BTC will decline thanks to the ongoing Middle East crisis but will register a strong rebound if tensions de-escalate. Metaplanet Announces Latest Bitcoin Purchase Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced the purchase of 1,112 BTC , taking its total holdings past the 10,000 BTC mark. The company made its latest acquisition at an average price of $105,000 per coin, making the total purchase worth $117 million. The average purchase price for Metaplanet’s holdings is $96,000 per Bitcoin. The latest acquisition has taken the firm past Coinbase’s 9,627 BTC , according to data from Bitbo. The latest purchase comes after the firm became the eighth largest holder of the asset, and the same day it announced that its board of directors planned to raise $210 million via no-interest bonds to buy more Bitcoin . Metaplanet has drastically revised its Bitcoin strategy in recent months and plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. The company’s stock has also soared following the announcements, rallying over 22% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Metaplanet’s stock has seen an increase of over 417% year-to-date. Crypto ETPs Register Inflows As Bitcoin Rebounds Crypto investment products continued their inflow streak as Bitcoin (BTC) crossed $110,000 last week, while Ethereum (ETH) briefly crossed $2,800. Global crypto exchange-traded products registered inflows worth $1.9 billion the week ending Friday. The products have registered inflows for nine consecutive weeks, taking the total to $12.9 billion, according to data from CoinShares. The latest inflows mean crypto ETPs have registered a historic record of year-to-date inflows worth $13.2 billion. Meanwhile, the total assets under management in crypto ETPs rose from $175 billion to $179 billion. Bitcoin investment products led the inflows, registering $1.3 billion in inflows, while Short-Bitcoin products registered modest inflows of $3.7 million. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the week positively as the flagship cryptocurrency brushed off a sluggish weekend to rise above $107,000 on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $107,263. BTC has traded downwards since crossing $110,000 last week. While analysts and investors expected a move to new all-time highs, geopolitical tensions sent the price into bearish territory. BTC , which was already losing momentum on Wednesday, plunged nearly 3% on Thursday, dropping to $105,828. Despite growing bearish sentiment, BTC maintained its position above $105,000 over the weekend, indicating that traders are buying the dip. BTC registered a sharp decline on Friday as it plunged to a low of $102,832. Price action remained bearish and subdued over the weekend as buyers struggled to gain a foothold. On the other hand, crude oil prices rose over 14%, while gold rose nearly 2%. However, analysts expect BTC to bounce back after a period of decline. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder, and chief operating officer at RedStone, stated that the attack and market sell-off caught traders off-guard, highlighting significant liquidations across Bitcoin futures. “Bitcoin dropped as much as 5% to $102,900, falling below the psychologically important $103,000 level. Ethereum shed even more, declining almost 7.6% at its worst point.” However, he highlighted that similar incidents in the past were followed by strong rebounds, referring to a similar scenario in April 2024. “Those moments turned out to be great buying opportunities. However, the current situation carries higher stakes given Israel’s direct targeting of Iran’s nuclear program and vows to continue operations indefinitely.” While the flagship cryptocurrency is showing signs of a recovery, it is forming a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly chart, suggesting growing indecision among buyers and sellers. However, while there is near-term uncertainty, analysts and traders are bullish on the long-term prospects of BTC , expecting the price to rally past $140,000 and higher. Popular trader Alan Tardigrade stated on X, “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge. This pattern has recently formed for weeks and is expected to reach $170k levels.” BTC registered a marginal drop on Tuesday (June 3) and fell nearly 1% on Wednesday, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, falling to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. The price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% and settling at $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. BTC rallied on Monday, surging over 4% to cross $110,000 and settle at $110,251.

Vietnam Legalizes Crypto Under New Law Vietnam’s National Assembly has approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry, effectively bringing digital assets under regulatory oversight. The legislation will come into effect January 1, 2026, and lays the groundwork for broader digital innovation across the country. It clarifies digital assets into two categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Both asset types require encryption or digital technologies for validation and transfers. However, neither includes securities, digital fiat currencies, or other financial instruments. The government must outline specific business conditions, classifications, and oversight mechanisms for the asset types. The new law also mandates cybersecurity and anti-money laundering safeguards in line with international requirements, likely to address concerns raised by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The legislation also outlines Vietnam’s ambitions to become a global tech and digital powerhouse. It introduces incentives for companies working on AI, semiconductors, and digital infrastructure. These incentives include tax breaks, land-use benefits, and R&D support, particularly for firms building core technologies like chip design and AI data centers. The Vietnamese government released a statement saying, “With this move, Viet Nam has become the first country in the world to enact a standalone law specifically dedicated to the digital technology industry.” Michael Saylor Indicates Imminent Bitcoin Purchase Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor has suggested a Bitcoin (BTC) purchase may be imminent. Saylor posted the Bitcoin chart that typically indicates the company is about to make a big BTC purchase. The move comes despite mounting geopolitical tensions and an escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Saylor posted the chart signaling an impending purchase with the following quote, “Bigger Dots are ₿etter.” Strategy currently holds 582,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate holder of the asset. Saylor’s intention to make another BTC purchase indicates growing investor confidence in the asset. The asset’s price has held steady at around $105,000 despite worsening market sentiment, suggesting strong support at lower levels. However, price action could be impacted if the conflict escalates and impacts energy prices. Invesco, Galaxy Register Solana ETF Trust Invesco and Galaxy Digital have confirmed the registration of a trust in Delaware for the proposed Solana ETF. The move marks the first steps towards launching a Solana ETF in the United States. However, the registration does not guarantee a listing or approval. The ETF structure mirrors filings by VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, and others in recent months as asset managers expand to crypto ETFs beyond BTC and ETH. Delaware security trusts are generally used for commodity and digital asset funds. The registration sets the stage for an eventual S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and a 19b-4 submission through a national exchange. A Solana ETF would give investors access to the fifth-largest cryptocurrency in the market without the complexities of managing a private wallet. Crypto Fear & Greed Index Stays In Greed Territory The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks the overall sentiment in the crypto market, remained in “greed” despite rising geopolitical tensions and an escalation in the Iran-Israel conflict. The index registered a score of 60 on Sunday, maintaining its position in the greed territory despite BTC declining to $103,000 over the weekend. The update came after Israel launched strikes on Tehran, with Iran reportedly retaliating on Friday. While maintaining its position in the “greed” territory, the index has declined from 71 on Thursday. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week positively, with the price up over 1% during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency reclaimed $106,000 during the current session after a sluggish weekend during which BTC struggled to maintain its position above $105,000. BTC has traded mostly in the red since Thursday as it lost momentum after crossing $110,000. Despite sluggishness and bearish sentiment, BTC has maintained its position above $105,000, suggesting that traders are buying the dip. However, some analysts believe BTC will see a notable drop due to escalating tensions in the Middle East. With the prospect of a regional war increasing, BTC and other cryptocurrencies are feeling the pressure. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp decline on Friday and remained in bearish territory over the weekend as buyers struggled to gain a foothold. Meanwhile, crude oil prices rose over 14%, and gold rose nearly 2%, a typical trend during Middle East tensions. However, analysts expect BTC and the broader crypto market to bounce back after a decline. Marcin Kazmierczak, co-founder, and chief operating officer at RedStone, stated that the attack and market sell-off caught traders off-guard, highlighting significant liquidations across Bitcoin futures. “Bitcoin dropped as much as 5% to $102,900, falling below the psychologically important $103,000 level.

However, the current situation carries higher stakes given Israel’s direct targeting of Iran’s nuclear program and vows to continue operations indefinitely.” Meanwhile, analysts at Bitunix have a different view and believe BTC will benefit from the conflict, with investors viewing it as a safe asset. An analyst explained in a note to investors, “The conflict between Israel and Iran has pushed up the demand for risk aversion, and short-term geopolitical conflict risk aversion capital may flow into the crypto asset market. If geopolitical conflicts continue to rise, we cannot rule out the possibility of Bitcoin challenging the $110,350 liquidity target.” However, traders and analysts are unanimous about a new all-time high, with many feeling BTC will surge to new highs after a consolidation phase. Popular trader Alan Tardigade stated on X, “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge. This pattern has recently formed for weeks and is expected to reach $170k levels.” BTC’s price action turned bearish on Tuesday (June 3) when it fell 0.44% to $105,436. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price dropped almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, slipping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Bullish sentiment returned on Friday, with the price rising almost 3% to $104,378. Price action remained positive over the weekend as BTC rose 1.15% on Saturday and registered a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Source: TradingView BTC surged over 4% on Monday (June 10), racing past $110,000 and settling at $110,251. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday, falling to a low of $108,335 before reclaiming $110,000 and settling at $110,253. BTC fell 1.42% on Wednesday, settling at $108,687 as selling pressure returned. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell nearly 3% to $105,828. BTC plunged to an intraday low of $102,832 on Friday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $106,106. BTC was back in the red on Saturday, dropping 0.59% to $105,482 before registering a marginal rise on Sunday to settle at $105,562. The current session sees BTC up 1.41%, having reclaimed $107,000 and trading around $107,074. If buyers retain control, the price could reach $110,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) performed relatively better than BTC over the weekend, making a stronger recovery on Sunday despite registering a substantial decline on Friday and Saturday. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has reclaimed $2,600 during the ongoing session and currently trades around $2,627. Despite ETH’s recent price action, on-chain data shows that whales have been scooping up the asset while retail investors are cashing out. According to data from Santiment, ETH wallets holding between 1000 ETH and 100,000 ETH have added 1.49 million ETH over the past 30 days. “Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit.” Whales and sharks now hold 41.61 million ETH, nearly 27% of ETH’s current supply.

2025-06-16T13:58:40,"Can Hyperliquid rise to $50 in June?","Hyperliquid continues to display strong bullish momentum after breaking into all-time high territory. With consistent higher highs and higher lows, price action remains firmly bullish, and a Fibonacci extension now points to $50 as the next upside objective. Hyperliquid ( Hype ) has sustained an exceptionally clean uptrend since establishing a macro swing low. Price action has remained impulsive throughout, forming consecutive higher lows and higher highs on all timeframes. Now trading above both the $34 support region and ATH levels, technical indicators remain aligned for further upside, with $50 marked as the next key level if current strength continues. Key technical points Strong Support at $34: The $34 region, previously resistance, is now confirmed support with multiple counter-closes, aligning with the value area high. 20-Day MA Acting as Dynamic Support: The 20-day moving average is tracking below price and holding as support, offering structure for a higher low. Fibonacci Extension Targets $50: A trend-based 0.618 Fibonacci extension projects $50 as the next key level, assuming price holds above ATH. HYPEUSDT (2D) Chart, Source: TradingView After an aggressive rally off the swing low, Hyperliquid has reclaimed and held key levels, particularly the $34 zone, which has now flipped into support. This level is in confluence with the value area high from the prior trading range and has seen several daily candle closes above it. This signals clear buyer commitment and reaffirms the region as a structurally important floor. Adding strength to the bullish case is the 20-day moving average, which continues to rise in tandem with price. Price action is currently using this moving average as dynamic trend support, confirming that the uptrend remains intact. As long as this level is respected, the structural expectation leans toward another leg higher. You might also like: XRP’s 2025 outlook: Potential peaks, exit timing, and an emerging challenger With price now trading above its former ATH, traders are turning to Fibonacci-based targets to project the next move. A 0.618 trend-based extension, measured from the most recent swing low to the ATH breakout, gives a clean upside target of $50. This aligns with the pace of the current rally and will remain valid as long as support levels, particularly $34, continue to hold. What to expect in the coming price action Hyperliquid remains technically strong. As long as price stays above the $34 support region and confirms daily closes above ATH, the path toward $50 becomes increasingly probable. Unless market structure shifts, the current rally appears poised to continue in the immediate short term.

2025-06-16T13:57:50,"Kidnappers Beat Crypto Influencer, Then Let Him Go As They Find Out He’s Broke","A 26-year-old TikTok crypto influencer was kidnapped and beaten in Essonne, France over the weekend, only to be released after his attackers discovered he didn’t have the crypto funds they were after. Key Takeaways: A TikTok crypto influencer was kidnapped in France but released after his wallet was found nearly empty. France is seeing a rise in “$5 wrench attacks”—physical assaults targeting crypto holders for ransom. Experts warn that crypto ransoms are often futile, as transactions are traceable and funds can be frozen. According to a report from Europe1 , four men abducted the influencer and demanded a ransom of €50,000 ($58,000), to be paid in cryptocurrency. However, after checking his digital wallet and finding it nearly empty, they let him go. Surge in “$5 Wrench Attacks” Targeting Crypto Holders The case adds to a growing trend of “$5 wrench attacks,” a term coined in crypto circles to describe the use of physical violence to bypass digital security. France has seen a surge in such crimes. MP Paul Midy recently introduced a bill aiming to prevent public figures in the crypto space from being easily located via official registries. This weekend’s attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. Authorities arrested twelve suspects in that case, including individuals tied to other kidnapping attempts across the city. Earlier this month, police captured the alleged mastermind behind several crypto-targeted kidnappings. The man, wanted by Interpol, had been linked to multiple cases involving crypto ransom demands. Wallet manufacturer Trezor weighed in on the recent surge in crypto-motivated attacks, calling the kidnappers “misguided.” A 26 year old TikTok influencer was kidnapped by 4 men in… you guessed it… France but was released after they realized he didn’t have as much money as he said he did online. Fake PnL screenshots are never worth it pic.twitter.com/PMDmGbTYxG — Beau (@beausecurity) June 15, 2025 The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions are traceable and that stablecoins like USDT can be frozen or reversed, offering little utility for criminals. Trezor cited the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland, whose ransom was demanded in USDT. Authorities ultimately recovered 95% of the funds. France has become a hotspot for these crimes, with 14 out of 50 global wrench attacks recorded there over the past year. Moroccan police this week arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials. Crypto Execs Hire Bodyguards Amid Influencer Kidnapping Concerns As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnapping. The rise in inquiries came a after spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnappings attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement.

2025-06-16T13:56:31,"Trump Media and Technology Group Files to Launch Spot Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF","Trump Media, the US President-linked company operating Truth Social, Truth+, and TruthFi, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a combined ETF tracking the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. If approved, the financial vehicle will hold BTC and ETH directly, with 75% of its AUM going toward the leading digital asset, while the remaining 25% will be for the largest altcoin. Today’s press release by the Trump Media Group confirms previous reports that Crypto.com will serve as the exclusive BTC and ETH custodian of the ETF. Moreover, the exchange will be “prime execution agent, as well as staking and liquidity provider.” Yorkville America Digital will be the ETF’s sponsor, which wil be listed on the NYSE Arca if approved by the US SEC. The announcement distinguished the proposed ETF from being called a “security,” as the Shares “may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.” The US securities watchdog has a new and friendlier leadership under the Trump administration, which raises the chances of a potential green light. The current POTUS has undertaken a highly different approach when it comes down to the crypto industry, and one of the companies linked to him filing to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF is just another addition to the growing pro-digital asset initiatives .
