2025-06-16T01:34:12,"Bitcoin mining difficulty dips slightly after record highs","Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has dropped slightly after reaching its highest level ever at the end of May. On Saturday, June 15, the network recorded a small but notable decrease in difficulty, bringing it down to approximately 126.4 trillion. This follows the all-time peak of 126.9 trillion on May 31, according to data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. The drop is slight, but that’s a landmark for mining. Bitcoin’s difficulty is automatically adjusted approximately every two weeks to reflect changes in the total hashrate, the sum of all miners’ computing power aiming for solutions to the Bitcoin network . When additional miners join the network, the difficulty increases to help maintain block production at regular intervals. When miners go offline because of cost or inefficiency, the difficulty drops in adjusting. The hashrate is still robust, surpassing a psychological barrier of 1 zetahash per second (ZH/s) in April. Rising costs challenge miners While it remains a tad less tough, several miners struggle with heavier workloads. The April 2024 halving, a scheduled phenomenon that cuts Bitcoin’s block reward in half every four years, slashed the reward for successfully mining a block to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC for miners, which translates into half the revenue for the same work. Factors such as surging electricity prices, rising hardware costs, and the pressure to stay updated with the latest technological turnover have caused many smaller or medium mining operations to be on the brink. Production costs are expensive for some small-scale miners, particularly in regions with relatively high electric power prices or relatively inefficient power supply systems. For those miners, keeping operations going is burning cash, a high-stakes wager, given that they either have access to cheap energy or anticipate a sharp rise in the price of Bitcoin shortly. Big players grow despite headwinds While many miners are scrambling , larger publicly traded companies do the opposite: ramping up and holding onto Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) said it produced roughly 35% more Bitcoin mined in May despite facing industry headwinds. The firm also mined 950 BTC for the month, an increase from April’s amount. Rather than liquidating coins into fiat to cover costs — as many miners often tend to do — MARA decided to hold onto those obtained through Bitcoin mining and increased the size of their corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC. “Record production month for MARA, and we sold zero Bitcoin,” said Salman Khan, Marathon’s chief financial officer, in a June 3 post on X . CleanSpark, another major mining company with a degree of emphasis on renewable energy, also reported solid results. The company reportedly mined 694 BTC during the month, an increase of approximately 9% from the prior month. CleanSpark’s capacity of hashrate, an essential performance measure, rose to 45.6 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the end of May. CleanSpark CEO Zack Bradford said that the increase was attributable to continued investment in cleaner forms of energy and improved mining hardware. He added that they had intentionally scaled their footprint over the years to remain profitable in tough macroeconomic environments. Both companies are part of a new breed of miners who consider Bitcoin a revenue source and a strategic financial asset. It has boiled down to holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet, a decision increasingly adopted by the corporate treasuries experimenting with crypto.

2025-06-16T01:00:00,"Pepe Coin (PEPE) Price Prediction: New PEPE ATH Expected in Q3, But This DeFi Token Might Be the Crypto to Watch","The meme coin market is buzzing as Pepe Coin (PEPE) regains momentum. But while the spotlight stays on this frog-themed token, investors are also turning eyes to under-the-radar DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) priced at $0.03. The Mutuum Finance presale has had over 12,000 investors. More than $10.6 million has been raised. Investors will make as much as 2x profit once the expected launch price of $0.06 is achieved. Pepe Coin Forecast: Steady Climb into Q3 Pepe Coin (PEPE) is trading around $0.000012, rebounding slightly, up about 2.1% in 24 hours, after a recent dip that left prices roughly 12% lower than the May highs. Technical indicators point to consolidation, with analysts projecting a short-term bounce toward 0.000016, a potential 25% upside, if current support holds. Beyond that, broader bullish scenarios suggest PEPE could reach as high as $0.00004 by late 2025, assuming meme-coin momentum reemerges and BTC continues its upward trend. This positions PEPE as a meme-coin contender to watch, while new DeFi plays like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly emerge on investors’ radars. Mutuum Finance Presale Explodes Past $10.6M, 12,000+ Investors Already In The presale frenzy around Mutuum Finance is turning heads in the DeFi world, with over $10.6 million raised and a community of 12,000+ holders, it’s clear something huge is brewing. Right now, MUTM tokens are going for just $0.03, but the next presale round jumps to $0.035. That’s an instant 16.67% gain for phase 5 investors. And when it officially launches at $0.06, those in early could 2x their money. DeFi Disruption Incoming: Mutuum’s Dual-Lending Model Why settle for average returns when you can have both control and passive income? Mutuum’s hybrid lending system is rewriting DeFi playbooks with: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Deposit USDT into smart contracts and watch passive income roll in, fully automated, zero headaches. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): For users looking for full control, P2P allows setting loan terms and is privacy-focused. Audited and Transparent: Mutuum’s Security Game is On Another Level In a space full of risk, Mutuum Finance is prioritizing security. Backed by a Certik audit and running on fully transparent, open-source contracts, the project is built for trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to launch a USD-pegged, fully collateralized stablecoin, engineered to avoid the collapse risks that wrecked algorithmic alternatives. This is stability that DeFi desperately needs. $100,000 Up for Grabs, Will You Be One of the 10 Lucky Winners? Mutuum isn’t just offering killer returns, it’s giving back big. A $100,000 giveaway , is live, and 10 winners will each bag $10,000 in MUTM tokens. This is your shot to join the movement, win huge, and ride the next potential DeFi rocket before it takes off. Early Access for Maximum Gains Mutuum Finance is quickly setting itself apart in a crowded crypto market, securing over $10.6 million from 12,000+ early investors, all before its official launch. While Pepe Coin (PEPE) rides meme momentum, MUTM is delivering real DeFi utility, offering up to 2x gains at launch from its current presale price of $0.03. With a dual-lending model, Certik-audited security, and a USD-pegged stablecoin incoming, Mutuum Finance is building more than hype, it’s building a financial ecosystem.

2025-06-16T00:50:23,"Asia Morning Briefing: Risk of Escalating Israel-Iran Conflict Keeps BTC Around 105K Says QCP","Good Morning, Asia. Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia opens the trading week, BTC is changing hands at around $ 105,000, stuck in this range due to market uncertainty about whether the Israel-Iran conflict will escalate into a broader regional war, according to a recent note from trading firm QCP. QCP wrote in a Friday note published on Telegram that risk reversals have ""flipped decisively,"" with front-end BTC puts now commanding premiums of up to 5 volatility points over equivalent calls, a clear indicator of heightened investor anxiety and increased hedging against downside risks. The firm said that despite this defensive shift in positioning, BTC has demonstrated notable resilience. Even amid recent volatility, which saw over $1 billion in long positions liquidated across major crypto assets, on-chain data shows that institutional buying continues to provide meaningful support. QCP emphasizes that markets remain ""stuck in a bind,"" awaiting clarity on geopolitical outcomes, and warns that the digital asset complex will likely remain tightly linked to headline-driven sentiment shifts for the foreseeable future. With all that in mind, however, Glassnode data provides some reassurance to investors concerned about longer-term directionality. Although recent volatility underscores short-term anxiety, bitcoin’s current cycle gain of 656%, while lower than previous bull markets, is notably impressive given its significantly larger market capitalization today. Previous cycles returned 1076% (2015–2018) and 1007% (2018–2022), suggesting investor demand is still pacing closely with BTC’s maturation, even as near-term macro jitters dominate market sentiment. Galaxy Research Says OP_Return Debate Wasn't That Important The OP_Return debate was less important than what a ""loud but small group of critics"" wanted everyone to think, Galaxy Research's Alex Thorn wrote in a recent note. Thorn described critics' reactions as ""wild accusations of the 'death of Bitcoin'"" and argued that such hyperbole was misplaced given historically low mempool congestion. On-chain data shows that the mempool is virtually empty compared to a year ago, and the notion that a congested blockchain is suffocating BTC, as was the prevailing narrative in 2023, now appears significantly overstated. In the note, Thorn further highlighted the irony of labeling arbitrary data as ""spam,"" reminding observers that Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, famously included arbitrary text, the ""chancellor on brink of second bailout"" headline, in the Bitcoin’s blockchain's very first block. Instead, Thorn argued, Bitcoin's community attention would be better focused on potential upgrades like CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), a proposed opcode enabling strict spending conditions (""covenants""). ""We continue to believe [CTV] is a conservative but powerful opcode that would greatly enhance the ability to build better, safer methods of custody,"" he wrote, noting that around 20% of Bitcoin’s hashrate already signaled support for the upgrade. Bitcoin upgrades require extensive consensus-building, reflecting its open-source ethos, and Thorn emphasized that cautious, deliberate evolution remains critical for broader adoption and scalability. ByBit Launches Byreal, a Solana-Native Decentralized Exchange Bybit is entering the decentralized exchange space with Byreal, an on-chain trading platform built on Solana, Ben Zhou, Bybit's CEO announced via X over the weekend. Byreal's testnet is scheduled to launch on June 30, with the mainnet rollout expected later this year. Zhou said that Byreal is designed to combine centralized exchange features such as high liquidity and fast execution with the transparency and composability of DeFi. The platform will also include a fair launchpad system and curated yield vaults linked to Solana-native assets like bbSOL. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin held near $105,000 after more than $1 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated, led by a $200 million long on Binance, as rising Israel-Iran tensions triggered a sharp selloff, a flight from altcoins, and a brief but intense bout of volatility. ETH: Ethereum rose 2% to around $2,550 after finding strong support at $2,510, showing resilience amid Israel-Iran tensions and broader market volatility, with continued institutional inflows supporting the uptrend. Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets rose Monday, led by Japan's Nikkei 225 gaining 0.87 percent, as investors weighed escalating Israel-Iran tensions, while oil and gold prices surged on safe haven demand. Gold: Gold climbed to $3,447 in early Asian trading Monday, hitting a one-month high as Middle East tensions and rising expectations of a September Fed rate cut outweighed strong U.S. consumer sentiment data.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 248,500 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) looks very strong despite the recent marketwide correction. The trader sees HYPE consolidating close to the highs for now before igniting a fresh leg up en route to a new record high. “HYPE has insane strength right now, this one got bought up quickly. wouldn’t be surprised to see a bit more chop around here but $50+ is destined, even in these crazy times.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, HYPE is worth $40.44. While Altcoin Sherpa is bullish on HYPE, he says he’s bearish on two Solana ( SOL )-based memecoins. The trader notes that dogwifhat ( WIF ) and Popcat ( POPCAT ) are both in the midst of a downtrend and may drop to much lower levels if BTC fails to print new all-time highs. “Moment of truth for many of these [coins] soon; that could have just been a lower high formed.

2025-06-15T23:30:36,"Investor Projects 462,800% XRP Price Rally. Here’s the Timeline","A crypto investor known as Remi Relief (@RemiRelierX) has predicted that XRP could reach $10,000 by 2029. According to him, the timeline is not arbitrary. It marks what would be Donald Trump’s final year in office following his re-election in 2024. In his post on X, Remi argued that Trump, now in his second and final term, will seek to establish a lasting economic legacy and that this could involve helping XRP reach extreme valuations. He claims the motivation isn’t to reward holders but to reinforce the U.S. government’s financial strength, which he says is increasingly tied to Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL). In that context, a dramatic revaluation of XRP would serve broader national goals and support the long-term credibility of U.S.-led financial systems. XRP to $10,000 By 2029 … First let me preface this by saying XRP has a set price. I’ve been telling everyone this for months. How much is it? I don’t know but I think there will be a set “base price” of $10,000. I spoke about this in an earlier post which I’ll re-post… pic.twitter.com/1SbB2c5OFp — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 14, 2025 A Belief in a Fixed Price Model At the heart of Remi’s view is the belief that XRP has, or will soon have, a fixed or pre-determined base price. Though he acknowledges he does not know the exact number, he believes $10,000 is a realistic figure. This outlook stands in contrast to traditional market-based pricing, relying instead on the idea that price could be institutionally guided based on strategic utility. He has expressed this view previously and shares the explanation for his optimism. He referenced Quincy Jones, a developer for the XDC network, who once said XRP could theoretically reach $1 million depending on how much global debt it is used to settle. Remi agrees with that principle, stating he “100%” believes it. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Long-Term Strategy and Investor Discipline Remi cautions against selling too early. He warns that many retail investors will offload their holdings at $100 , $500, or even $1,000, thereby missing out on generational wealth, which he believes is XRP’s true potential. “$10,000 x 100 XRP = $1M,” he wrote, suggesting holders should aim to retain at least 100 XRP tokens if possible. He urges followers to store their assets securely, preferably off centralized exchanges. Other experts have advised token holders to store their XRP in cold wallets , and Remi Relief reveals that he uses around 15 cold wallets, two exchanges, and a dedicated crypto phone. His strategy stems from missed opportunities in earlier technological waves, such as the dot-com boom and Bitcoin’s rise, which he says he didn’t take seriously enough at the time. He shared tweets showing people who missed out on Bitcoin in the early days—a tweet from 2027 by someone complaining that they did not hold onto their XRP.

2025-06-15T22:45:39,"NFT Market Bounces Back As Bitcoin Gains Strength","The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) sector shows strong signs of recovery after months of slow growth . Reports show that the digital collectible market had its most significant weekly gain in a long time. NFTs Market Sees Increased Trading Activity and Participation Notably, this happened as Bitcoin’s (BTC) price increased to $105,000, and Ethereum (ETH) also saw a slight increase. The global crypto market cap grew slightly from $3.28 trillion to $3.29 trillion. Activity in the NFT space has grown significantly. The number of buyers increased by over 50%, reaching over 1 million. Sellers also increased, and the number of trades increased by nearly 8%. This shows that more people are getting back into the NFT market. Immutable Surpasses Ethereum in NFT Blockchain Sales This rise in activity comes as Immutable (IMX), a blockchain used for NFTs, became the top-selling platform this week, beating the Ethereum blockchain for the first time in months. It made $41.7 million in sales, jumping over 150%. Ethereum dropped to second place but still grew by around 7%. The Bitcoin network stayed third with $19.4 million in sales after a 22% rise. Polygon also saw strong growth and is now close to Bitcoin. Other blockchains, like Mythos, BNB Chain, and Solana, also had more NFT buyers. Polygon had the biggest jump in buyers, followed by Solana and Bitcoin. New NFT Market Collections on the Rise Immutable’s growth has helped bring attention to fresh Non-Fungible Token collections. Guild of Guardians Heroes was the top-selling NFT collection this week. It made $24.7 million in sales, doubling its previous performance. This collection runs on Immutable, which helped it grow fast. On the Polygon network, Courtyard came second with $17.2 million in sales. Another Guild of Guardians collection, Avatars, came third with $10.3 million. DMarket held onto fourth place, and Bitcoin’s Ordinals, a new entry, made it into the top five with a massive increase in sales. These changes in rankings show that newer collections and platforms are gaining ground while older names, like CryptoPunks, are beginning to fade. Surprisingly, CryptoPunks dropped out of the top five collections, even though some NFTs sold for high prices. In late March, CryptoPunks saw the highest growth, as sales spiked by a staggering 141% to reach $6.3 million. Amid the collection’s success, CryptoPunk #2967 made the top individual NFT sale of the week, selling 420 ETH for $843,070. However, new NFT collections are taking over, and CryptoPunks are no longer in the spotlight.

2025-06-15T22:22:35,"From Zero Hardware to Daily Bitcoin & Dogecoin Profits: HASHJ Cloud Mining in 2025","In 2025, Bitcoin mining is no longer the domain of cavernous server rooms and late-night kernel hackers. Cloud mining has turned a once hardware‑heavy pursuit into something anyone can start with a smartphone, a modest budget, and a few taps. But can zero hardware really compound into nearly a million dollars? Absolutely—provided you choose the right provider. Below are five cloud‑mining services that have stood out this year for regulatory compliance, consistent payouts, and global scale. Together they show how US $100 can, in the right circumstances, snowball toward six—or even seven—figures. 1. HASHJ — Ultra-Short 1- to 3-Day Contracts for Rapid Gains Minimum deposit: US $100 • Peak daily return: Up to US $9,600 (investment‑dependent) • Payout mode: Daily auto‑credit in BTC or USDT, with zero hidden fees Licensed in multiple jurisdictions, HASHJ offers 2‑factor authentication, custodial wallets, and 24/7 live support. Its stripped‑down interface lets newcomers get started in under five minutes. How to begin: 1. Head to https://hashj.com and unlock an instant US $18 welcome bonus when you register. 2. Select a 1‑ to 3‑day contract. 3. Top up your account with crypto. 4. Let the platform handle the mining and watch daily revenue land in your wallet. 2. StormGain — Free Cloud Mining Plus Spot Trading in One App StormGain fuses zero‑cost cloud mining with a full spot‑trading terminal inside a single mobile app—no leverage, options, or other derivatives to complicate risk. The built‑in profit calculator, live price panel, and flexible contract lengths let users scale hash power up or down at will. Global, high‑efficiency data centers keep uptime high and temperatures low, making StormGain a one‑stop choice for miners who want the option to sell, HODL, or stake their freshly minted coins the moment they receive them. 3. Bitdeer — Enterprise‑Grade Hash Power, Retail‑Friendly Interface With heavyweight miner manufacturer Bitmain behind it, Bitdeer funnels data-center–level hash power directly into the hands of everyday crypto investors. Choose from shared mining pools, fixed‑term contracts, or large bespoke packages—perfect for everyone from small holders to institutions with deep capital. 4. hashj Mining — Legacy Stability for Conservative Investors A veteran of the cloud‑mining scene, hashj Mining (not to be confused with HASHJ’s ultra‑short product above) boasts years of operational history and a worldwide node network. Its yields are deliberately less aggressive than newer entrants, but its emphasis on rock‑solid uptime and stringent security standards makes it a favourite for risk‑averse users seeking reliable, predictable returns. 5. ViaBTC — Dual Engine of Mining Pool & Cloud Contracts ViaBTC operates one of the world’s largest public mining pools and offers cloud‑contract purchasing on the same platform. Investors can buy hash power outright or plug existing rigs into the pool for fee sharing. Comprehensive analytics and diverse withdrawal methods offer the perfect blend of instant liquidity and sustainable mining returns. The Bottom Line: Million‑Dollar Cloud Mining Isn’t Fantasy Turning a small stake into life‑changing capital may sound far‑fetched, but with a compliant provider, verifiable hash power, and transparent payout logic, it’s within reach. Actual results depend on contract choice, market cycles, and your reinvestment strategy—but these five names, especially the fast‑cycle model of HASHJ, prove that you don’t need hardware or coding skills to tap the digital gold rush.

2025-06-15T22:00:43,"Bitcoin Risks Testing This Critical Support As Bullish Strength Wanes","The price of Bitcoin has shown signs of indecision and exhaustion over the past few days, with mostly sideways movement and a couple of unsustained breaks above $105,000. This lack of momentum comes as the crypto market continues to grapple with the impact of the ongoing unrest in the Middle East. While the current choppiness of the Bitcoin price action suggests that the cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is, at the time, insufficient for a break, recent on-chain data not only corroborates this inference but also offers insights into the potential next stop for the flagship cryptocurrency. Advanced Sentiment Index Slips Beneath 50% In a June 14 post on the X platform, on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. reported that Bitcoin’s bullish sentiment amongst investors may be starting to lose intensity. This on-chain observation is based on the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index metric, which measures the balance between bullish and bearish positioning in the market to gauge overall trader sentiment. As its name suggests, this on-chain indicator offers insight into the general sentiment in a particular cryptocurrency market. For instance, a reading above 60-70% typically signals strong bullish sentiment in the market and is usually seen before or during price rallies . Meanwhile, when the metric’s value is around 50%, it usually indicates neutral market sentiment, meaning there is a level of indecision or balance between bears and bulls. This is usually recorded in a consolidation phase, which precedes definitive directional movement in the market. On the other end of the spectrum, when the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index reads below 40-50%, it implies growing fear or caution in the market, which could precede further loss in BTC’s value. However, it could also potentially indicate a bottom if the sentiment were to be overly pessimistic. In the post on X, Adler Jr. reported a drop in the Sentiment Index below the neutral 50% threshold to about 46%, which falls within the bearish territory. According to the analyst, Bitcoin’s Sentiment Index peaked above 80% early in the month of June but slowly started to decline after hitting the high. As BTC recently rallied to $105,000 from $103,000, other important metrics such as the open interest also indicated very little investor support, further demonstrating weak bullish presence. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Adler Jr. opined that the indecisiveness currently being observed in the market might continue until something important — like the Sentiment Index — changes. For the uptrend to resume , the analyst explained that the Index has to rebound above 60-65%, which would only occur if there are simultaneous increases in net taker volume and open interest. If this does not happen, the Bitcoin price risks testing the next support level, around $102,000 — $103,000. For this reason, caution when dealing in the market is essential, as the next support’s strength is still highly probabilistic. As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at $105,419, reflecting no significant price movement in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-test-this-support-as-bullish-strength-wane/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin advanced sentiment index|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T21:30:58,"IBM’s Quantum Computer Could Threaten Bitcoin Security Soon: Details","IBM, a global technology company, has announced plans to build Quantum Starling, the world’s first fault-tolerant quantum computer. This new project, set to be released by 2029, aims to fix quantum computers’ high error rates and inability to run long, complex programs. Industry leaders say quantum computers might become strong enough to break today’s digital security systems. This could be dangerous for banks and might even breach inactive crypto wallets . While this is not an urgent threat, many worry it could happen sooner than expected. IBM’s Starling To Revolutionize Quantum Computers Quantum computers do not work like normal ones. Regular computers use bits, which can be either 0 or 1. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This special ability makes quantum computers very fast, powerful, and efficient. They can solve problems much faster than regular computers, including breaking encryption. Encryption keeps online information safe, including the data in Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain systems. However, today’s quantum computers are weak because qubits are very sensitive. Small changes in temperature or other conditions can make them stop working correctly. These errors prevent the computer from running large programs. As a result, IBM is focusing on building a fault-tolerant computer that can find and fix its own mistakes while running. This makes it more stable and allows it to handle longer and harder tasks. IBM’s Quantum Computer Starling and the 2029 Goal IBM’s new computer, Quantum Starling, will be able to run 100 million quantum operations using 200 corrected qubits. The computer will also use special hardware to fix errors in real time. IBM will install the system in its quantum data center in New York. This move is part of the company’s roadmap for building useful and scalable quantum computers by 2033. Over the next few years, IBM will test smaller systems and develop new software. These smaller machines will help IBM learn how to connect quantum chips, increase computing power, and prepare for larger builds like Starling. Crypto Community Panics, But Bitcoin Is Safe For Now IBM’s announcement has caused uproar in the crypto community. Experts say blockchains will not break overnight, but developers should start preparing now. Blockchain networks like Bitcoin use strong encryption to protect wallets and transactions, and today’s computers are not strong enough to crack these secret codes. Encryption methods that are safe from quantum attacks already exist; many believe it is time to use them. Meanwhile, some industry leaders like Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor say other systems, like banks and websites, could face quantum threats first. Bitcoin may be safer for a bit longer. Nevertheless, the risk to all digital systems will grow as quantum computers improve.

2025-06-15T20:01:13,"Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad Author to Investors: Buy XRP Instead of Saving Dollars for the Future","Renowned financial educator and Rich Dad Poor Dad author, Robert Kiyosaki, has once again stirred the financial world with a bold warning about the future of fiat currency. In a recently resurfaced video shared by Vandell of Black Swan Capitalist on X, Kiyosaki urged investors to reconsider their savings strategy—specifically, to stop saving U.S. dollars and start investing in digital assets like XRP and Bitcoin. A Wake-Up Call to Investors In the video clip, Kiyosaki challenged conventional financial thinking and criticized what he described as a widespread, dangerous dependency on fiat currency. “Can’t you see what’s happening?” he said. “People will still rather save dollars. There’s a brainwash there. Why don’t you save XRP and Bitcoin? Why are you saving this [dollars]?” His remarks reflect deep concern about the long-term value of the U.S. dollar, especially as inflation remains persistent and central banks continue aggressive monetary expansion. For Kiyosaki, saving dollars is not just unwise—it’s a trap. A while back we had the rare opportunity to speak with Robert Kiyosaki. Discussing XRP, BTC, Gold & Silver. FYI: XRP was below $0.50 pic.twitter.com/zhMkTqiKK7 — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) June 13, 2025 Why XRP? Timing and Vision What makes Kiyosaki’s advice even more significant is the timing. When he voiced this perspective, XRP was still trading under $0.50. Fast forward to today, XRP has climbed to $2.17—reflecting rising investor confidence, institutional interest, and the benefits of Ripple’s expanding global presence. While Kiyosaki has long praised Bitcoin and precious metals like gold and silver, his inclusion of XRP was notable. It suggests a growing recognition of XRP’s utility in solving real-world problems, particularly in the global payments sector. From Criticism to Clarity Kiyosaki’s message isn’t just another speculative endorsement—it’s a warning rooted in decades of financial insight. He’s been consistent in highlighting the risks of inflation, central bank policies, and overreliance on paper currency. His advocacy for Bitcoin and now XRP reflects a belief that the financial future will be shaped by assets outside traditional banking systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP, in particular, is gaining momentum as Ripple continues to ink strategic partnerships with financial institutions, expands liquidity solutions, and integrates tools like RLUSD to support on-chain settlements. As adoption grows, Kiyosaki’s once-controversial advice looks increasingly prescient. A Message That Aged Well For investors who took his advice when XRP was below $0.50, the returns have already been substantial. Yet, for Kiyosaki, the message goes beyond profit—it’s about preserving wealth in a world where fiat currencies face growing instability. As XRP trades above $2 and crypto adoption accelerates, Kiyosaki’s appeal to “save XRP and Bitcoin” instead of dollars is no longer just contrarian—it’s becoming common sense for those watching the writing on the wall.

In a new episode of the All-In podcast, Palihapitiya says current forecasts of the US economy are overly negative and don’t factor in the potential development of two events. According to Palihapitiya, President Trump’s tariffs are likely on track to contribute an extra $300 billion in receipts to the US government’s current account in what he says is a big positive for the economy. The investor says that when factoring in the likelihood of at least 100 basis points in Fed rate cuts, the US is on track to save $300 billion as well – meaning a total of $600 billion in revenue boosts to the United States, providing a big jump to overall confidence in the American economy and markets. “We all thought that this was like a bogeyman that you weren’t allowed to touch it, and if you touched the stove, you’re going to get burned. The mathematical reality is that this is actually going to work out much better for us than we anticipated, and it’s going to be somewhere in the range of $300 to $400 billion of extra revenue per year. That’s a huge win. So why is that important? That then sets up this next cataclysmic thing that we’re going to see in the next 60 days, which is, what does Jerome Powell do? If Jerome Powell stays politicized, his incentive will be to keep interest rates where they are. If Jerome Powell looks at the conditions on the ground, especially when you start seeing inflation stay in the low 2s, and approach 2.0, the real thing that he’s going to be under tremendous pressure to justify is ‘Why are you not cutting?’ And just to give you a sense of how important that is, if we cut by a hundred basis points, that’s another $300 billion. In that case, that’s not money we get in, but it’s money we don’t have to spend. So if you add these two things together, we are in the next 60 days, going to have to reforecast the American balance sheet where this is, or we’re actually going to be able to positively forecast an extra $600 billion – $300 billion of incremental revenue and $300 billion of savings. If that happens, watch out. It means that every single risked dollar is going to run to America. Every single one.

2025-06-15T20:00:00,"Corporations continue to spawn Bitcoin treasuries— What’s good about them?","For several years, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) was the sole public company whose modus operandi was buying millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin with borrowed capital. These days, several other companies are trying to follow in Strategy’s footsteps. As more companies go all-in on stacking Bitcoin, critics are raising concerns about the growing centralization of crypto treasuries. Currently, just 216 entities—101 of which are public companies—hold nearly 31% of the circulating BTC supply, with corporate treasuries alone accounting for approximately 765,300 bitcoins, or 3.7% of total supply (excluding lost coins). This trend shows no sign of slowing, with existing firms continuing to accumulate and new players entering the space. This prompts debate over the benefits and risks of corporate Bitcoin ownership. Read more: Anthony Pompliano plots $750m Bitcoin buy via SPAC merger: report The trend is in full swing A wave of high-profile crypto treasury launches is underway, led by figures like Jack Mallers with 21 Capital, David Bailey with Nakamoto, and most recently Anthony Pompliano with ProCapBTC, which is reportedly raising $750 million in equity and convertible debt to accumulate Bitcoin. Each new treasury announcement is met with bullish fanfare on Crypto Twitter, where influencers routinely frame the news as a catalyst for BTC price appreciation. Yet with such announcements now occurring almost daily, their actual impact is increasingly unclear. The familiar refrain of “this is not priced in” has become a cliché, while comment sections often reflect confusion over why Bitcoin’s price continues to fall despite seemingly bullish developments. FACT: ¥3.9 TRILLION SOFTBANK IS INVESTING BILLIONS IN A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUY MORE #BITCOIN THAN MICROSTRATEGY THIS IS NOT PRICED IN 🔥 pic.twitter.com/5vxwP4UUOK — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 7, 2025 Do Bitcoin treasuries pump BTC’s price? According to the Gemini research, the growing adoption among sovereign and regulated financial institutions led to decreased volatility in all time frames after 2018. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 made the trend even stronger. Despite the stabilization of the Bitcoin price, it doesn’t stop gaining value. The main difference is that now the price rises steadily without the frequent high-amplitude fluctuations it had in the past. According to Unchained, Bitcoin’s price is stuck between $100,000 and $110,000, and it will take a long time for it to exceed the $130,000 mark. People don’t pay attention to many things while reading bombastic announcements. One is a lack of retail interest, as the public tends to pay attention to Bitcoin when it hits an all-time high or at similar periods. Another reason for slower price movement is that Bitcoin treasuries not only buy BTC but dump it, too, as they need cash to repurchase shares. Additionally, the announcements usually display the full amount of the deal (i.e., “Pompliano to raise $750 million to invest in Bitcoin treasury”), whereas, in reality, these amounts are raised slowly; it may take several months to complete the deals. So it comes that the purchases made by Bitcoin treasuries are not what they may seem to be. Finally, the relentless accumulation of Bitcoin is pulling coins away from circulation, making a notable part of the supply dormant and somewhat purposeless for years. Bitcoin treasuries need this crypto to attract more investors and clients. However, it drives Bitcoin away from its initial role as an alternative electronic cash, and some in the crypto community raise critical voices directed at Bitcoin treasuries. This mass accumulation of Bitcoin by corporates & ETFs is getting very close to Satoshi's original vision of us never having to actually use the Bitcoin network. — Nic (@nicrypto) June 12, 2025 The ‘not your keys, not your coins’ attitude is alive and well Many Bitcoin enthusiasts prefer actually to own their bitcoins and don’t outsource all the hassle to corporations. Maximalists remind us that any entity does not control Bitcoin, and it is free to purchase, so there is no need for a company to buy and maintain Bitcoin on your behalf. Some criticize Bitcoin treasuries for not representing the spirit of Bitcoin, while others emphasize the troubled past of Bitcoin treasury frontmen. For instance, MicroStrategy had a questionable episode during the dot-com bubble era, whereas the company restated its profits, resulting in losses for the investors. The SEC accused the company of fraud. At the time, Saylor spoke about his plans to donate $100 million to the Internet university that will provide “free education for everyone on earth, forever.” This kind of evangelism may sound familiar to those who follow Saylor’s modern-day speeches , while he is more grounded when dealing with Bitcoin. What Magoo really means, is that bitcoin treasury companies need a professional Orange Washer An influencer already trusted by the plebs, who can toe the line between LARP'ing as a maxi, and shilling his stock as being superior to real BTC Aka, the used car salesman type https://t.co/nb9VuLJ66w — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 11, 2025 For some, Pompliano is an ambiguous candidate for helming the new mighty Bitcoin treasury. While Pompliano is a well-known and recognizable Bitcoin advocate, some remember his involvement in promoting fraudster crypto exchange FTX and its associated platform, BlockFi. Collapses of these platforms were painful not only for its users but also impacted the entire crypto sector, crashing the market and infusing cryptocurrency distrust among the community outsiders and, more importantly, regulators. So true. For example, I lost most of my savings after listening to your podcast and putting it into BlockFi. Completely changed my life! — GSx (@Wade24T) November 28, 2022 Some Bitcoin owners watch the performance of the treasury company’s stocks or ETFs and sell their bitcoins to buy these assets, hoping for quicker gains. Adam Back, a Blockstream CEO and the only person whose work is referenced in the Bitcoin whitepaper urged his followers not to sell their bitcoins to buy ETFs or similar assets as they won’t be able to buy them back. some are selling their btc to ETFs and pubCos. dudes: HODL. you won't be able to buy them back before long. but also other users are buying, this is the way. — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 12, 2025 Then, what’s good in Bitcoin treasuries? The same person urging us not to sell bitcoins, Adam Back, explained that Bitcoin treasuries “are bringing forward the Bitcoin adoption curve.” $MSTR & $BTC Treasuries by @adam3us : ""They are basically an arbitrage between the fiat current [system] and the hyper-bitcoinezed future. And if you can buy #Bitcoin today and pay for it in 5 years or convert into equity you are bringing forward the Bitcoin adoption curve.."" pic.twitter.com/UAF4bmCZUC — Marco ₿attistoni (@Battistoshi93) June 2, 2025 Back pointed out that most people don’t have money and opportunities to acquire Bitcoin. In contrast, public companies have these opportunities to raise capital by selling their shares or vice versa. These companies don’t need free money to invest in Bitcoin as they can buy Bitcoin in advance and pay for it years later. “They are basically an arbitrage between the fiat [monetary system] and the hyper-bitcoinized future.” A more mainstream explanation is that shares and ETFs are easier to deal with for institutional investors than Bitcoin. So they don’t have to worry about the Bitcoin legal status and lack of the company around it. Instead, they can deal with a public company that offers some guarantees and is traded just like other public companies while exposing clients to the Bitcoin price appreciation. Generally speaking, these treasuries are helping TradFi traders and investors to benefit from Bitcoin’s long-term price appreciation without having to deal with Bitcoin.

2025-06-15T20:00:00,"Reentry through repair: Jill Ford’s plan to close crypto’s access gap","At the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference, entrepreneur Jill Ford, founder of BitFord Digital, and Justin Rhedrick of the Bitcoin Transformation Community unveiled an ambitious new initiative at the intersection of crypto infrastructure and social justice. In their session, “Proof of Redemption: From (Prison) Bars to Bitcoin,” the duo introduced “Hash Over Cash” — a program that channels outdated mining equipment and donated hashpower into workforce reintegration and hands-on job training for formerly incarcerated individuals. Instead of relying solely on monetary donations, the initiative invites companies and individual miners to contribute used or broken ASIC rigs — or even temporarily redirect mining output. BitFord handles repair, resale, and routing of proceeds, while the Bitcoin Transformation Community leads reentry-focused training programs where participants learn real-world tech skills like diagnosing and refurbishing mining hardware. “Cash donations often get stuck in red tape,” Ford explained. But a pallet of old machines? That’s something companies can greenlight fast—and it still comes with a tax deduction.” With plans to scale nationally and early support from firms like Bldg 96, Hash Over Cash is positioning itself as a blueprint for sustainable impact in Bitcoin. We spoke with Ford to learn more about the program’s vision, its implications for social equity in crypto, and how mining can empower a new generation of Bitcoin builders. You might also like: Bitcoin is oversold after Israeli strike on Iran: analyst You and Justin Rhedrick introduced this at Bitcoin 2025. Why now? Timing matters. The Bitcoin and crypto industries are maturing, but there’s still a major access gap, especially when it comes to underserved communities and people impacted by the justice system. Justin and I connected through a shared belief that Bitcoin should be a tool for empowerment, not just speculation. He’s done incredible work on the education and reentry side, and BitFord has the infrastructure and access to hardware. I also understand from experience the challenges that people go through when they try to reintegrate For all these reasons, the partnership felt obvious. Now was the moment to turn good intentions into actual action. Can you share a moment from your own journey that made you realize how important workforce reintegration is? One moment that really stuck with me was when I was in a correctional facility and noticed how little access women had to anything related to crypto. Often they’re the ones that need Bitcoin the most because the fiat economy has turned its back on them. But they have no access to current tools, no concept of crypto’s real-world application. What they do have, though, is so much curiosity and motivation. It hit me that we don’t have a talent gap. We have an access gap. If we can bridge that, we unlock not only opportunity for individuals, but resilience for the ecosystem. What are the technical skills participants will leave with—and how do those translate into real jobs in the Bitcoin or tech space ? Participants will learn to diagnose, repair, and maintain Bitcoin mining rigs. That includes everything from identifying hardware failures to cleaning, testing, and optimizing ASIC machines. These are transferable skills, especially as more mining operations decentralize and need on-site tech support. But beyond mining, we’re giving people a gateway into hardware repair, logistics, and IT infrastructure work. These are roles that are always in demand. How do you vet or select program participants? Is there a focus on certain communities or regions? That part is led by Justin and the Bitcoin Transformation Community . They work closely with correctional education programs, reentry organizations, and community partners who understand the needs on the ground. Our focus is on those who are underserved by traditional workforce pipelines. Right now, we’re starting in TK, but the vision is national. You might also like: From cellblock to blockchain: Bitford Digital CEO Jill Ford wields Bitcoin to shake up TradFi How does this model scale? Could we see training hubs across multiple states or prison systems? Absolutely. That’s the plan. We’re already designing mobile training units that can be deployed in correctional facilities or reentry centers. The beauty of this model is that it’s modular. Wherever there’s access to equipment and willing partners, we can build a program. We also want to empower returning citizens to become trainers themselves, so the knowledge ripple continues. You mentioned public companies can move faster with hardware donations than with cash. What role do tax deductions play in motivating corporate donors? Tax deductions absolutely play a role. Donated hardware can often be written off faster and more cleanly than cash, especially if the equipment is already depreciated. For public companies, this is often easier to approve internally because it doesn’t come from a budget line. It comes from inventory. And we’re providing full documentation for those donations, making the accounting side seamless. That said, tax laws are complex and can vary. It’s crucial to consult with a qualified tax professional to determine the best approach for any given business situation. Any barriers that you have encountered in getting large mining firms to participate, and how are you addressing those? The biggest barrier is mindset. A lot of firms still think of ESG or social impact as a cost center, not a competitive advantage. We’re all about changing that narrative. This is about building long-term resilience not just for people, but for the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. The firms that get it are already signing on. For those who don’t yet, we’re showing them the upside: brand equity, tax efficiency, and a stronger, more decentralized network. What kind of career paths are you envisioning for BTC graduates? Short term, we’re preparing them for jobs in mining repair, logistics, hardware maintenance, and data center support. Long term, we want to open pathways to entrepreneurship. Imagine someone who was once incarcerated now running a node, managing a warehouse, or even launching their own repair shop. This isn’t about charity, per se, it’s about capacity building. What do you say to skeptics who may not understand why Bitcoin or mining is relevant to reentry or social impact? I always say: Bitcoin means freedom. That’s because Bitcoin is all about ownership, autonomy, and access. That’s incredibly relevant to people who’ve had their freedom restricted and are trying to rebuild their lives. Mining is one of the few tech sectors where you can learn real, in-demand skills without a four-year degree or perfect resume. It’s hands-on, it’s scalable, and it can serve as a bridge to something bigger. Trump’s strong support for domestic Bitcoin mining—including a call to make the U.S. the global mining capital—has run into resistance in rural areas that are directly impacted by noise pollution, environmental concerns, and industrial encroachment. Backlashes have occurred in New York (i.e., Dresden and Niagara Falls) and Granbury, Texas; Mining sites have led to public complaints, legal restrictions, and sound mitigation efforts. The story underscores a key irony: grassroots opposition to this administration’s pro-Bitcoin agenda is growing in the very places that helped elect him, raising questions about whether his crypto ambitions can succeed politically at the local level. What do you say to mining skeptics and the potential backlash of such initiatives? Look, skepticism is always healthy. But not all mining looks the same. We need to separate irresponsible practices from sustainable, community-led solutions. Our initiative is small-scale and deeply rooted in reuse and repair. We’re not dropping 10-megawatt facilities into quiet towns. We’re refurbishing hardware, training people, and building micro-opportunities that integrate with communities, not overrun them. If the future of mining is going to succeed in the U.S., it has to be local, sustainable, and accountable.

2025-06-15T19:35:00,"Avalanche price prediction 2025-2031: Time to buy AVAX?","Key takeaways: Our Avalanche price prediction anticipates a high of $33.36 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $19.07 Market cap $8.04B Trading volume $183.4M Circulating supply 421.84M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $19.28 24-hour low $18.79 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 6.88% 50-day SMA $22.17 200-day SMA $24.15 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis: AVAX remains bearish As of June 15, AVAX’s price rose by 1.01% in 24 hours and dropped by 18.20% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 23.67% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility is rising. The relative strength index is at 43.77 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing negative market momentum. It is considered oversold when the RSI value drops below 30. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which is in consolidation as it moves sideways. Last month, it had risen to $26.84 before correcting. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 33.61. The William Alligator trendlines show rising price volatility. Avalanche technical analysis: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 18.12 BUY SMA 5 20.12 SELL SMA 10 20.62 SELL SMA 21 21.21 SELL SMA 50 22.17 SELL SMA 100 21.05 SELL SMA 200 24.15 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 21.31 SELL EMA 5 21.26 SELL EMA 10 20.65 SELL EMA 21 20.15 SELL EMA 50 21.33 SELL EMA 100 24.65 SELL EMA 200 27.78 SELL What to expect from AVAX price analysis next? The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with rising volatility, particularly in the short term, as it attempts to correct from the month’s low. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025.

2025-06-15T19:16:39,"Traders Eye Bitcoin Surge to $270K Despite Market Pause","Bitcoin is currently consolidating around $105,000, but sentiment among traders remains firmly bullish. Despite recent geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions, many analysts believe the bull market is far from over. Rather than signaling a top, the current pause is seen by many as the prelude to further upside. Well-known trader Alan Tardigrade is one of several voices pointing to an optimistic future. “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge,” he said in his latest market analysis on June 15. He believes this bullish chart pattern could lead the price to $170,000 in the near future. Technical Indicators Support Bullish Forecasts Tardigrade also noted that a golden cross — when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average — has reappeared on the daily chart. According to him, this pattern has historically boosted BTC by 49%, 125%, and 68% since early 2023. “If $BTC experiences its worst and best gains from this point, it could reach $152k and $229k. These targets are reasonable given the recent uptrend,” he explained. His analysis of weekly and daily timeframes suggests that Bitcoin’s bullish structure is still intact, even amid temporary slowdowns. Other Traders Echo Bullish Sentiment Other prominent figures in the trading community are voicing similar expectations. A trader known as BigMike7335 suggested on June 14 that a potential pullback to $92,000 could set the stage for a breakout to $270,000 by October. This would reflect a typical second-wave corrective move within Elliott Wave theory, followed by a strong continuation of the trend. Merlijn, another active trader, pointed to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart. He believes a breakout from this formation could push BTC to $140,000 or more. “Neckline at $113K is the only thing standing in the way,” he told his followers. Warning Signs Still Present for Some While bullish sentiment dominates the trading discourse, some are issuing reminders of the market’s inherent risks. “The Bitcoin Standard” author Saifedean Ammous spoke candidly at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, warning that the asset’s history of sharp downturns cannot be ignored. “I just hope my message out there to everybody in this business is, Bitcoin has done -70% and -80% before, and it can do it again,” he said during an appearance on the Coin Stories podcast. Such comments serve as a cautionary note amid widespread optimism, particularly for new corporate buyers or institutions entering the market at current levels. With Bitcoin hovering near previous all-time highs, comparisons to the 2021 cycle peak have begun to circulate, prompting some to consider downside risks more seriously. Conclusion Despite concerns from a few corners of the market, the broader narrative among analysts and traders remains centered around significant further upside. Technical patterns, historical comparisons, and sentiment indicators continue to paint a picture of strength as Bitcoin prepares for another phase of price discovery.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/traders-eye-bitcoin-surge-to-270k-despite-market-pause/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T19:00:28,"Amid Bitcoin Hype, Seasoned Trader Predicts Sudden Drop To This Level","Bitcoin is at a crossroads again. Prices have been bouncing between $61,000 and $104,000 for about seven months. That range looks a lot like the $31,000–$64,000 sideways move before the sharp drop in early 2022. Traders and analysts are split over whether history is about to repeat itself or if fresh demand will keep Bitcoin aloft. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Price Stuck In Familiar Range According to reports, Bitcoin’s stretch from $61k to $104k mirrors the 2020–2021 “distribution zone” when it traded between $31,000 and $64,000 for nearly a year. Back then, the slide came fast: Bitcoin peaked around $69,000 in November 2021, then sank to roughly $15,600 by November 2022. That was a nearly 78% plunge. Breakouts Keep Falling Flat Based on analysis from Michaël van de Poppe, Bitcoin tried and failed to stay above the $106k level this month. His chart showed a quick rejection at that barrier, triggering long‑side liquidations. The price slipped back to the $104k–$105k zone after the failed push higher. Traders see each unsuccessful breakout as a warning sign of distribution. November 2021 all over again? pic.twitter.com/lIA6QFhD9S — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 14, 2025 Risk Of Steep Slide According to veteran trader Peter Brandt, strong fundamentals often shine brightest right before a market top. He pointed out that if today’s setup leads to a similar 78% drop from the $105k band, Bitcoin could fall toward $23,600. His simple math recalls last cycle’s move from around $69k down to $15,500. Growing Demand Meets Technical Barriers Based on reports of spot ETFs and growing buys by institutions and governments, some believe the floor is firmer now. Huge investment flows into Bitcoin have never been higher. Yet technical hurdles remain. The inability to clear $105k makes some analysts cautious.

In past cycles, that pattern led to gains of 50%, 125%, and 65%. It points to a possible rally if buyers step in around current levels. What It Means For Investors Bitcoin’s tug‑of‑war between caution and optimism is clear. On one side, pattern watchers warn of a big drop if support breaks. On the other, strong hands from big players may cushion any slide and spark a rally. Investors should keep an eye on $104k–$105k for signs of weakness or strength. A break below could open the door to a move toward $23,500. Conversely, a clean break above $106k might signal the next leg up. Regardless, volatility looks set to stay high, so risk management remains key.

2025-06-15T19:00:00,"Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: XRP, Solana, Zetachain","The cryptocurrency market will have numerous catalysts this week, including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England interest rate decisions, the ongoing Iran and Israel crisis, and potential Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows. This article explores the top three cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Solana, Ripple, and Zetachain. SEC ruling on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF looms Ripple ( XRP ) price will be a cryptocurrency to watch this week as the Securities and Exchange Commission delivers a ruling on Franklin Templeton ETF proposal on June 17. The most likely outcome is that the agency will postpone the ETF approval as it evaluates other proposals by companies like VanEck, Bitwise, and 21Shares. Most crypto traders believe that the agency, under Paul Atkins, will approve these ETFs by the end of the year. Polymarket odds of this approval have jumped to almost 90%. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF decision comes as the coin has remained in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. It has formed a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, pointing to a big breakout or breakdown in the next few weeks. One crypto pundit estimated that the coin will have a bullish breakout, which will align with Bitcoin price rising above the 8-year trendline that we covered here . XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 $275M token unlock could spark Solana rebound Solana ( SOL ) price has dropped by 21.7% from its highest point in May, meaning that it has moved into a local bear market. This crash has coincided with the ongoing sell-off of most of its meme coins. Solana price will be in the spotlight this week as the network will unlock tokens worth over $275 million on Saturday. These tokens represent about 0.36% of its float. Still, technicals point to a Solana price rebound, as it has formed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. This rebound will be confirmed if the token rises above the upper side of the descending channel at around $160.

It has plunged by over 80% from its highest point in 2024, partly because of its substantial monthly unlocks. These unlocks increase a token’s supply, which is risky, mainly when little demand exists. ZETA price will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks tokens worth $8.6 million, representing 5% of the float. The daily chart above shows that the ZETA price has pulled back from a high of $0.3120 in May to $0.20 today. It failed to move below that support level three times since March, forming a triple-bottom pattern. Therefore, Zetachain price may bounce back this week if it holds the support at $0.20.

In a statement , the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Iowa says that 63-year-old Margo Ann Williams laundered $800,000 of proceeds from a scheme that was carried out between December 2022 and July 2023. According to evidence presented at the trial, the email accounts of the five victims – a Cedar Rapids church, two businesses, a non-profit and an individual – were hacked while they were in the process of making large wire and automatic clearinghouse (ACH) transfers. The victims received spoofed emails containing instructions to change the routing information for the wire and ACH transfers. Believing that the emails were from legitimate and trusted sources, the victims instructed their banks to wire the funds according to the supposed new payment instructions. The funds were rerouted to bank accounts that Williams controlled. She subsequently relocated the funds to other bank accounts under her control before transferring the money to two crypto exchanges and another person in Florida. The banks discovered William’s fraudulent activities and closed her accounts, but she kept opening new ones at other banks in an effort to keep the scheme alive. She earned approximately $25,000 from the operation and spent the funds on many personal purchases, including an Apple watch and a luxury bag. Williams, who claimed that she perpetrated the scheme at the direction of a famous British actor with whom she became romantically involved, was sentenced to four years in prison. She’s also ordered to pay $594,037 in restitution to her victims and must also serve a three-year term of supervised release following her imprisonment.
