2025-06-16T13:57:50,"Kidnappers Beat Crypto Influencer, Then Let Him Go As They Find Out He’s Broke","A 26-year-old TikTok crypto influencer was kidnapped and beaten in Essonne, France over the weekend, only to be released after his attackers discovered he didn’t have the crypto funds they were after. Key Takeaways: A TikTok crypto influencer was kidnapped in France but released after his wallet was found nearly empty. France is seeing a rise in “$5 wrench attacks”—physical assaults targeting crypto holders for ransom. Experts warn that crypto ransoms are often futile, as transactions are traceable and funds can be frozen. According to a report from Europe1 , four men abducted the influencer and demanded a ransom of €50,000 ($58,000), to be paid in cryptocurrency. However, after checking his digital wallet and finding it nearly empty, they let him go. Surge in “$5 Wrench Attacks” Targeting Crypto Holders The case adds to a growing trend of “$5 wrench attacks,” a term coined in crypto circles to describe the use of physical violence to bypass digital security. France has seen a surge in such crimes. MP Paul Midy recently introduced a bill aiming to prevent public figures in the crypto space from being easily located via official registries. This weekend’s attack follows a more brutal incident on May 1, when four masked men abducted the father of a crypto entrepreneur in Paris, cutting off one of his fingers before police intervened. Authorities arrested twelve suspects in that case, including individuals tied to other kidnapping attempts across the city. Earlier this month, police captured the alleged mastermind behind several crypto-targeted kidnappings. The man, wanted by Interpol, had been linked to multiple cases involving crypto ransom demands. Wallet manufacturer Trezor weighed in on the recent surge in crypto-motivated attacks, calling the kidnappers “misguided.” A 26 year old TikTok influencer was kidnapped by 4 men in… you guessed it… France but was released after they realized he didn’t have as much money as he said he did online. Fake PnL screenshots are never worth it pic.twitter.com/PMDmGbTYxG — Beau (@beausecurity) June 15, 2025 The company emphasized that Bitcoin transactions are traceable and that stablecoins like USDT can be frozen or reversed, offering little utility for criminals. Trezor cited the kidnapping of Ledger co-founder David Balland, whose ransom was demanded in USDT. Authorities ultimately recovered 95% of the funds. France has become a hotspot for these crimes, with 14 out of 50 global wrench attacks recorded there over the past year. Moroccan police this week arrested a suspect accused of kidnapping crypto executives. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials. Crypto Execs Hire Bodyguards Amid Influencer Kidnapping Concerns As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnapping. The rise in inquiries came a after spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnappings attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement.

2025-06-16T13:56:31,"Trump Media and Technology Group Files to Launch Spot Bitcoin, Ethereum ETF","Trump Media, the US President-linked company operating Truth Social, Truth+, and TruthFi, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a combined ETF tracking the performance of the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. If approved, the financial vehicle will hold BTC and ETH directly, with 75% of its AUM going toward the leading digital asset, while the remaining 25% will be for the largest altcoin. Today’s press release by the Trump Media Group confirms previous reports that Crypto.com will serve as the exclusive BTC and ETH custodian of the ETF. Moreover, the exchange will be “prime execution agent, as well as staking and liquidity provider.” Yorkville America Digital will be the ETF’s sponsor, which wil be listed on the NYSE Arca if approved by the US SEC. The announcement distinguished the proposed ETF from being called a “security,” as the Shares “may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be accepted, prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective.” The US securities watchdog has a new and friendlier leadership under the Trump administration, which raises the chances of a potential green light. The current POTUS has undertaken a highly different approach when it comes down to the crypto industry, and one of the companies linked to him filing to launch a joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF is just another addition to the growing pro-digital asset initiatives .

2025-06-16T13:52:13,"Why Is Crypto Up Today? – June 16, 2025","The crypto market has gone up today, despite the small market cap fall. Eight of the top 100 coins have recorded increases over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 0.9% to $3.45 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $76.7 billion, nearly half of what we’ve been seeing in the latter part of last week. TLDR: The crypto market has turned green, with nearly all top 100 coins recording increases; While initially impacted by Iran’s attack on Israel, the market has seen an uptick today; Bitcoin is recovering, reclaiming the $106,000 level, still climbing at press time; Sentiment is still retreating towards the fear zone; Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility; US spot ETH ETFs broke their 18-days inflow streak, spot BTC ETFs recorded $301.62 million in inflows; The rally has the potential to continue, but keep an eye on geopolitical developments. Crypto Winners & Losers All top 10 coins per market cap have recorded price rises over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 1.1%, surpassing the $106,000 again, standing at the current price of $106,734. Ethereum (ETH) recorded the second-highest rise on the list: 3.2%, changing hands at $2,615. The top increase is Solana (SOL)’s 6.8%, which now trades at $156. At the same time, the smallest rise is Binance Coin (BNB)’s 0.6% to the price of $654. Moreover, only eight of the top 100 coins have decreased today. Mantle (MNT) fell the most. It’s down 1.9% to $0.6238. Tokenize Xchange (TKX) appreciated the most among the top 100, rising 12.8% and trading at $32.36. It’s followed by SPX6900 (SPX)’s 12.4%, currently trading at $1.65. Cryptoworld has seen several significant events over just the past couple of days. Notably, another nation officially legalized cryptoassets.

Traders Aggressively Positioning for Upside or Volatility Analysts at Glassnode have found that BTC 25 Delta Skew (a metric focusing on option contracts expiring in one week) has turned bullish. “Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility,” they commented today. Over the past week, $BTC 25 Delta Skew has flipped decisively bullish – especially in short-dated options – despite a slight price decline. 1-week: -2.6% → +10.1% 1-month: -2.2% → +4.9% Traders are aggressively positioning for near-term upside or volatility. pic.twitter.com/8R3TvckxUp — glassnode (@glassnode) June 16, 2025 They also noted that demand growth is keeping pace with BTC’s maturation, describing it as “an impressive sign of sustained investor appetite.” Others were focused on the regulatory impacts. Przemysław Kral, the CEO of the zondacrypto exchange, commented on the regulations opening doors to massive players to enter the space – but also their drawbacks. “Regulations attract major players to the market,” he said. MiCA is a major one. It does impose limitations, but these are necessary for crypto to go mainstream. “However, we’re already seeing one major systemic drawback of MiCA,” says the CEO. “If you wanted to start a crypto business from scratch today, MiCA makes that impossible. The directive’s requirements can only be met by large, established players. So, the resolution has eliminated my competition. MiCA cements and consolidates the market.” That said, MiCA offers a level playing field. Until now, any exchange in Europe could choose the “softest” jurisdiction and compete on cost rather than quality, he says. “Now, everyone must meet the same security standards, so users benefit.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $106,734. At the time of writing, this is the highest 24-hour point, up from the intraday low of $104,627. Also, it’s currently down 4.6% from the all-time high of $111,814. It’s trying to hold the current level so to attempt higher points. Notably, BTC’s overall stability holds despite headlines about retail and banking giants (potentially) launching stablecoins, which may be seen as bearish for BTC. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView At the same time, Ethereum, currently trading at $2,615, pulled itself up from its intraday low of $2,494. At the time of writing, it’s still rising to retake the $2,500 zone and possibly continue upwards. Moving above $2,630 would open doors for the $2,700 level. However, dropping below $2,570 could lead to further downside. Notably, it was revealed on Friday that SharpLink Gaming became the largest publicly traded ETH holder after purchasing 176,271 ETH. Moreover, Ethereum whales increased their exposure to the asset over the past month, while smaller investors decided to sell during price stagnation. Wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH added 1.49 million ETH over the past 30 days – a 3.72% increase. Also, as reported on Sunday, a whale purchased 48,825 ETH at an average price of nearly $2,605, taking advantage of the recent dip. There are currently 6,392 wallets holding between 1K and 100K Ethereum. Over the past month alone, these key whale and shark wallets have rapidly added more coins as retail traders have taken profit.

Currently, it’s still standing within the neutral zone, but it has fallen from 54 seen on Friday to 50 today . If fear starts pushing prices down, it may create buying opportunities for both new and existing investors. Source: CoinMarketCap Meanwhile, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw $301.62 million in net inflows on Friday. Data for Monday is not yet available at the time of writing. Of this amount, BlackRock saw $238.99 million. Others are in green as well, albeit with smaller amounts. However, US ETH spot ETFs broke their 19-day inflow streak on Friday with $2.18 million in outflows. Grayscale took in $6.67 million, and Fidelity bled out $8.85 million. Others saw no flows. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market turned another green corner over the past 24 hours. Stocks were down on their previous workday. The S&P 500 decreased by 1.13% by Friday closing time, the Nasdaq-100 was down 1.29%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1.79%. This was the result of the tensions between Israel and Iran, and Israel’s subsequent attack on Iranian cities and population. Is this rally sustainable? The short answer is yes, but there are ‘buts’. This uptick is a continuation of the rally that led to BTC hitting an ATH in May. It will continue to see short-term pullbacks, as is typical. However, the prices may be more significantly hit by escalating geopolitical issues.

2025-06-16T13:43:09,"Interesting Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late","TL;DR Industry participants believe XRP could soon break out, targeting $2.80 and even $8. One X user speculated that Ripple might secure a banking license, spreading additional enthusiasm across the community. Explosion Brewing? The price of Ripple’s cross-border token might be down on a weekly and monthly scale, but multiple analysts remain optimistic that a bull run could be on the way. The popular X user CRYPTOWZRD claimed that an explosion might be “brewing,” envisioning a bullish breakout to as high as $2.80. Currently, XRP trades at around $2.23 (according to CoinGecko’s data), and such a move would represent a 25% increase. Several hours later, the analyst chipped in again. They suggested that the asset’s price dynamics would be heavily influenced by Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming week, adding that geopolitical conditions will continue to play a key role. Crypto Beast, who has over 700,000 followers on the social media platform X, argued that XRP hasn’t yet reached its market peak, setting a minimum target of $8. They reminded about the developments in the case between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), arguing they might cause a further price spike for XRP. “XRP holders are about to make A LOT of money. When it’s time to sell, I will announce it here publicly,” they added. Awaiting These News The legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC has seemingly reached its final point , but an official conclusion is yet to be announced . Last week, both sides announced a proposed deal to settle the remaining financial aspects of the case. Under the deal, Ripple would pay $50 million to the SEC, while $75 million held in escrow would be returned to the crypto firm. To finalize the matter, the entities requested that the magistrates remove the August 2024 injunction tied to the original $125 million penalty. Back then, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple had breached certain securities laws. Some XRP proponents have speculated that the case could finally become history today (June 16). However, as of this writing, there isn’t anything official yet. The X user John Squire spread another rumor. He suggested that Ripple might secure a banking license and turn into “a full-on bank.” Such a development would likely have a positive impact on the company’s native cryptocurrency, with Squire wondering whether it could become “the new financial backbone.” The post Interesting Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions as of Late appeared first on CryptoPotato .",cryptopotato,https://cryptopotato.com/interesting-ripple-xrp-price-predictions-as-of-late/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP","Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price",cryptocompare

2025-06-16T13:30:36,"Will The Bitcoin Price Move Above $110,000 Again? Global M2 Money Supply Shows What’s Next","Bitcoin’s current trading range is all part of a consolidation move before a return above $110,000. Although the leading cryptocurrency has largely held above the $105,000 support zones in recent days, its rally has taken a hit in the past two weeks. Technical analysis of Bitcoin’s price action, when overlapped with the Global M2 Money Supply metric, shows that it is only a matter of time before it enters into a new all-time high. Global M2 Offset Models Says Something Interesting According to a detailed post by crypto analyst Colin, also known as “The M2 Guy,” on the social media platform X, Bitcoin’s price action appears to be tracking the global M2 money supply with a high degree of correlation when the data is offset by 68 to 76 days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Back In Control After $110,000 Rejection, What Comes Next? Two separate charts presented by Colin reveal this trend vividly, showing how Bitcoin price movements have followed the trajectory of the Global M2 Money Supply when adjusted for time. The short-term 68-day offset chart aligns closely with Bitcoin’s behavior since April 2025, while the 76-day offset chart offers a longer-term view of the relationship. In both cases, the analyst highlighted that the M2 curve is pointing upward, where Bitcoin has yet to play out, implying a similarly bullish trajectory for its price action. Colin describes this as a form of confluence, noting that when two correlated indicators show the same directional outcome, the probability of that outcome increases. Particularly, the average correlation across both charts is around 76.6 to 76.9%, both of which are very high and lend statistical weight to the prediction. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? The 68-day offset chart shows Bitcoin trailing the M2 curve with high precision since April, with the highest 89.9% degree of accuracy on the 90-day timeframe. Similarly, the 76-day offset, while less accurate in the short term, displays a strong correlation over longer intervals of 92.2% over one and a half years and 86.2% across two years. These correlation values shows that Bitcoin is increasingly sensitive to global liquidity trends, especially now that its price movement is tied to inflows/outflows surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Bounce To $120,000 Or Will It Break Below $100,000? This relationship becomes even more notable considering the M2 money supply itself has been climbing within a rising channel. If the alignment continues, Bitcoin may soon follow suit, lifting it back above the $110,000 level and breaking above its all-time high. Bitcoin’s price action will be very interesting to follow in the next few days. In Colin’s view, this next move up is not only likely but could happen within days.

2025-06-16T13:30:03,"Vietnam’s Historic Move to Legalize Crypto Could Add Rocket Fuel to These Top Altcoins","Did the next major move in blockchain technology just come from Vietnam? Developing nations are becoming key crypto drivers, with Vietnam and Pakistan emerging in recent days as potential leaders. Establishing country-level crypto standards like Vietnam has done, or developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, the way Pakistan is doing, can only boost crypto adoption at home and abroad. It also showcases how Bitcoin and broader blockchain technology can help emerging economies fuel growth and innovation. As we’ll discuss later, it could also add rocket fuel to some of the top altcoins . Vietnam, Saylor, Pakistan: 4 Takeaways What do the moves in Pakistan and Vietnam mean for the broader crypto economy? Here are four takeaways: Groundbreaking Legal Clarity in Vietnam On June 14, 2025, Vietnam passed its Law on Digital Technology Industry, effective January 1, 2026, categorizing crypto as a distinct, regulated asset class. This law affects 17M crypto holders and $105B in inflows over 2023–24, and provides much-needed stability, boosting investor confidence. Frameworks that Foster Innovation Vietnam’s approach goes beyond crypto legalization. The law introduces incentives, such as tax breaks, R&D support, and land-use benefits for sectors like AI and blockchain infrastructure, signaling a national pivot toward a tech-first economy. Pakistan’s Strategic Crypto Pivot Pakistan followed Vietnam’s lead a day later, on June 15, 2025, when Michael Saylor engaged with Pakistan’s finance leadership to champion Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset. Pakistan launched the Pakistan Crypto Council in March 2025, developing frameworks and planning a national Bitcoin reserve, along with crypto mining infrastructure. Emerging Economies Leading the Way? Vietnam and Pakistan’s moves reflect a global trend: emerging economies are leveraging digital assets to level up economically, rather than merely following Western nations. Demonstrating a greater appetite for crypto’s revolutionary potential, Pakistan, Vietnam, and others are pushing the limits of crypto’s potential in ways that could send leading altcoins soaring. Let’s investigate how top altcoins like Bitcoin Hyper , Uniswap, and Snorter Token could fare as global adoption grows. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s First-Ever Layer 2 Launches with SVM Bitcoin’s great, we can all agree – 230% AAR, a $2T+ market cap, etc. But could that be just the start? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) unleashes Bitcoin’s full potential. While right now, $BTC is one of the world’s best store-of-value assets, when it comes to crypto applications, it’s somewhat limited due to its original architecture. Bitcoin Hyper builds a Layer 2 on top of Bitcoin, leveraging the Bitcoin Relay Program on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to verify Bitcoin block headers and transaction proofs for any $BTC deposited to Bitcoin Hyper’s Canonical Bridge. The result is lightning-fast transaction resolution and the ability to build out an entire DeFi ecosystem on Bitcoin. There’s a growing interest in Layer 2 solutions; another hot crypto presale – Solaxy ($SOLX) – just smashed through $50M raised with a Solana Layer-2. Could $HYPER surpass that with its Layer-2 solution for the world’s largest crypto asset? $HYPER tokens cost $0.0119, with $1.3M raised in the presale so far. Check out the whitepaper , or learn how to buy Bitcoin Hyper , and see why we think the token could go from $0.0119 to $0.02595 for 118% gains. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale page . 2. Uniswap ($UNI) – Utility Token for Leading DeFi Protocol Seeks to Regain Previous Highs It’s a leading DEX, with over $1.78B traded in the past 24 hours. But Uniswap is also the 27th-largest crypto token, with a market cap of $4.91B . That’s impressive enough, but could $UNI be ready to make another run? The token trades well below its all-time high of $44.97 in the heady days of the 2021 bull run. But $UNI is on the list of assets currently held by the US government – and therefore eligible for the US Digital Assets Stockpile. Uniswap officials have also been involved in talks with the US Congress over pending legislation and decentralized finance. Add in global shifts towards more formal, organized crypto frameworks, and $UNI might be ready to make big moves. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Dominate the New World of Solana Meme Coins with Snorter Bot With new meme coins launching on Solana daily, some of the best opportunities to 10x your investment live underground. Finding and trading them takes time and effort, but $SNORT and the Snorter Bot make the process easy. The Snorter Bot sniffs out the best trading opportunities. Find them, snipe them, and stay safe from rug pulls and honeypots – all with the Snorter Bot. The $SNORT token facilitates lightning-fast swapping with the lowest fees possible on Solana. As DeFi grows alongside crypto adoption, it could set the stage for tokens like $SNORT. The meme coin market is flourishing, even as traders get more and more sophisticated. Give your meme coin trading a leg up with $SNORT, currently priced at $0.0953. The presale has raised over $1M so far, showing rapid investor interest. Visit the Snorter Token ($SNORT) presale page. Vietnam, Pakistan Embrace Crypto, Set Stage for Altcoins As countries like Vietnam and Pakistan take the lead in embracing crypto, the message is clear: digital assets are no longer just speculative tools, but strategic economic levers. Vietnam’s legislative clarity and Pakistan’s sovereign Bitcoin ambitions show that emerging economies are helping define the future of finance. Whether it’s foundational DeFi tokens like Uniswap, revolutionary Layer-2s like Bitcoin Hyper , or cutting-edge trading tools like Snorter Token , the next wave of growth could be here. Don’t take our word for it – do your own research.

2025-06-16T13:21:24,"TRON Secures US Public Listing in Deal Backed by Eric Trump","Per a report from the Financial Times, the TRON blockchain has secured a major deal that will allow it to go public in the US. The deal, backed by a Donald Trump tied investment bank called Dominari Securities, includes the creation of a new company, Tron Inc. TRON To Mimic MycroStrategy In Historic Deal According to the report, the listing will take place via a reverse merger with SMR Entertainment, a Nasdaq listed company. Two people familiar with the deal clarified that the deal would purchase millions in TRON’s native token, TRX. In that way, the new company will operate in a similar fashion to MicroStrategy, now called Strategy. The company founded by Michael Saylor has become a financial vehicle for those investors looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Since 2021, MicroStrategy introduced a new treasury strategy to benefit from the rise of the Bitcoin price. The company issues debt, and uses the revenue to increase their BTC holdings. As the cryptocurrency rises, the company’s debt diminishes. The price of MicroStrategy’s shares saw a 126% spike in a one-year period, according to recent data shared by its Chairman and Bitcoin bull, Michael Saylor. Due to its success, several companies around the world have tried to copy this strategy in their own fashion. In the new entity formed by the Tron and SMR merger, Eric Trump will take a role. Although, there are no details as to what role or in what capacity Trump will operate within Tron Inc. The Financial Times noted that Justin Sun, the controversial founder of the TRON blockchain, has made significant efforts to strengthen his ties to the Trump family. Sun is one of the top holders of the $TRUMP token, the cryptocurrency launched by the president of the US in early 2025. This investment allowed Sun to take part in a private dinner hosted by the head of state at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia. Furthermore, the Financial Times claims, Sun invested $75 million into the World Liberty Financial, a companied backed by the Trump family and their inner circle. TRON’s TRX Price Explodes Following the news of its public listing, the native token of the TRON blockchain experienced a significant rally. Data from CoinGecko indicates that the crypto saw a 3.3% rally over the past hour, pushing its price above the critical area north of $0.27. The TRX price is likely to continue the trend as the Tron Foundation is expected to inject over $210 million in the token into the new entity. Thus, similar to Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, TRX could see a spike in its demand. Moreover, the Financial Times pointed out that the company behind the deal, Dominari Securities, has seen a 580% increase in their value after Eric Trump announced his participation in its advisory board. The investment back has also seen millions of dollars in capital from Elon Musk companies, including SpaceX and xAI. Is the TRX price above to experience a similar rally? Stay tune to find out.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. In a recent feat, Solana Strategies has planned to raise $1 billion to boost the ecosystem. Talking about numbers, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 47.01% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

The RSI near 48 hints at the start of recovery but lacks strong momentum. It is worth mentioning that a breakout above $170 could trigger a rally toward the $185 to $190 resistance zone. However, a failure to hold above $150 may floor the price to $140. That being said, Solana crypto is likely to trade sideways with an inclination to the bulls until the next fortnight. Potential High: $190 Average Price Range: $165 Potential Low: $140 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the derivatives market with $6.74B in open interest, far surpassing other altcoins. The heatmap and high trader positioning signal elevated volatility ahead. Any major price move in SOL could trigger significant market reactions, making it a key token to watch in the coming sessions. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

The Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF, B.T., was registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 16, 2025, under filing number 333-*, according to the Form S-1 registration statement . The fund is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, LLC, based in Mountainside, New Jersey. Truth Social Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF. Source: SEC This marks the first time Truth Social or any Trump-affiliated venture has directly entered the ETF race. The filing proposes a trust format that would hold both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), a dual exposure product that breaks from the usual single-asset structure dominant in the U.S. spot ETF market. ETF registration Notably, the registration places the ETF under the Securities Act of 1933, similar to how spot Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ) and Fidelity’s FBTC were filed. However, it’s unclear whether this new vehicle will aim for full spot holdings or operate under a hybrid or futures-backed model. While details are still limited, the move signals that Truth Social is attempting to pivot beyond social media into financial productization, leveraging the brand’s visibility and user base for capital market initiatives. The ETF appears to be backed operationally and legally by Yorkville America Digital, which has not previously sponsored a crypto ETF. As of now, the SEC has not commented on the filing. A full prospectus and timeline for potential approval remain pending.

2025-06-16T13:00:37,"Ripple Price Analysis: Bearish Structure Remains as XRP Fails to Break Out of Consolidation","After months of consolidation and a clear underperformance against Bitcoin, XRP remains under bearish pressure on both USD and BTC pairs. Despite brief attempts at reclaiming higher levels, the charts show no decisive bullish structure yet, with XRP continuing to hover near key support areas. The price action has been largely reactive, with market participants cautious amid broader Bitcoin dominance and overall market uncertainty. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair The XRP/USDT pair continues to compress inside a large descending channel, capped by a strong trendline resistance dating back to the early 2025 highs. The price recently lost both the 100 and 200-day moving averages, located around the $2.3 mark, signaling weakening momentum. Yet, the RSI remains neutral around 48, suggesting indecision. The moving averages are also starting to flatten, which further confirms the lack of a strong directional bias in this phase. On the downside, the $2 psychological zone acts as the immediate support, with the broader support base at $1.6 remaining critical. A break below this level could trigger a cascade down to the $0.9 demand zone. On the upside, the buyers need to flip the higher boundary of the pattern and the $3 resistance zone. Until then, structure remains bearish-neutral within this wide range. The BTC Pair Against Bitcoin, XRP continues to weaken. The asset is currently trading around 2,070 SAT, hovering just below a major resistance band. XRP/BTC is seemingly now targeting the lower trendline of the multi-month descending channel. The 100-day moving average is also sloping downward following a bearish crossover, while the 200-day MA has flattened just above the current price, indicating that bearish momentum has outpaced mean reversion attempts. Notably, there’s a visible fair value gap (FVG) in the 1,600–1,000 SAT zone, left behind from the December 2024 breakout. This could act as a demand zone for price if the pair fails to hold current support. Moreover, the RSI at 43 shows weak momentum, reinforcing the lack of buying pressure. Therefore, XRP will need a strong reclaim above 2,200 SAT and a confirmed breakout from the descending channel to regain relative strength against Bitcoin. For now, the path of least resistance remains to the downside.

2025-06-16T12:59:11,"Here’s why Bitcoin and altcoins are rising today","Bitcoin and most altcoins rose on Monday, June 16, as fears surrounding the ongoing Israel–Iran conflict subsided and accumulation continued. Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped to $107,000, its highest point since June 12, while the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies rose to $3.34 trillion. Some of the top gainers were tokens like Jito ( JTO ), SPX6900 ( SPX ), Hyperliquid ( HYPE ), and Kaspa ( KASPA ). The crypto market’s rally coincided with the rebound of the U.S. stock market and the retreat of crude oil prices. Futures tied to the Dow Jones rose by 225 points, while those linked to the Nasdaq 100 rose by 175 points. Oil dropped by over 1%. Bitcoin and other crypto prices rose as fears of a widespread crisis in the Middle East subsided . The two countries have continued launching missile attacks, but analysts see the crisis being contained and not drawing in other countries like Russia and China. In a note to Bloomberg, a CMC Markets analyst said : “The market currently anticipates a limited conflict, though there is little indication that hostilities will end quickly. It is expected that fighting will continue unabated this week, albeit on a limited scale.” Historically, stocks and crypto prices plunge after a major “black swan event” and then bounce back as fears subside. For example, Bitcoin and most altcoins plunged in March 2020 after COVID was declared a global pandemic and then bounced back afterward.

2025-06-16T12:54:20,"Here’s why the Maple Finance token price is in a bull run","Maple Finance token price continued its strong rally on Monday, reaching its highest point since November. Maple Finance ( SYRUP ) price jumped by over 8% on June 16, up 512% from its lowest point this year. This surge has pushed its market capitalization to over $600 million, while its 24-hour volume soared 74% to $90 million. SYRUP price has jumped as the total assets under management in the ecosystem soar. Data on its website shows that its assets under management has risen to $2.23 billion, just weeks after crossing the $2 billion milestone. Separate data compiled by DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked in its platform has surged to $1.6 billion from $298 million in January, a 433% increase. This surge was driven by the High Yield Secured Lending product, which has accumulated over $424 million in assets. This fund lets users invest in a product backed by liquid tokens like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). You might also like: Ethereum Foundation donates $500K to Tornado Cash co-founder’s defense ahead of trial The Blue-Chip Secured Lending has gained over $137 million in assets, while its Bitcoin Yield solution holds $138 million. Maple’s growth could continue as demand for alternative assets increases. This growth, in turn, will lead to more fees in the network. Its monthly fees jumped to $2.7 million, up from $568,000 a month earlier. Maple Finance price has also soared as its staking volume rose. Data on its website shows that the network has already distributed over 10 million in rewards to its holders, while its staking ratio has jumped to 40.6%. The risk, however, is that Nansen data shows exchange balances have jumped 13% in the last 30 days to 248 million SYRUP, while smart money holdings have dropped 52% to 16.17 million SYRUP. Maple Finance token price analysis SYRUP price chart | Source: crypto.news The 12-hour chart shows that Maple Finance price has been in a strong surge in recent weeks, rising from $0.087 in April to $0.5340. It has moved above the 50-period and 25-period Exponential Moving Averages, a sign that bulls have prevailed. Most recently, SYRUP price moved above the key resistance at $0.4590, invalidating the double-top pattern whose neckline was at $0.3185. It then made a break-and-retest pattern by returning to $0.4590. A break-and-retest pattern is a common bullish continuation signal. Therefore, SYRUP price will likely continue rising as bulls target the next psychological point at $0.5500. A drop below the double-top point at $0.4590 will invalidate the bullish view.

2025-06-16T12:51:29,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Breakout or Rejection Next as BTC Nears Upper Range Boundary?","Bitcoin remains within a high-volatility environment as market participants weigh macro uncertainty, ETF flows, and liquidity grabs. Following the recent rejection from the 110K level, the price continues to coil within a tight range, offering tactical opportunities for both sides of the tape. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, BTC is hovering between two well-defined liquidity zones. The 100K–110K range is acting as a battlefield between buyers and sellers, with visible reactions at both ends. The 100-day and 200-day moving averages continue trending upward and are now converging near the 95K mark, providing a strong dynamic support layer, especially if a bullish crossover occurs. On the upside, the 110K level remains critical as it represents recent buy-side liquidity, and the price has failed to close above it multiple times. A daily close beyond that range would flip the market structure bullish again. Until then, the current choppy environment may persist, and even a short-term correction might be on the cards. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the 4H, we can see the asset reacting strongly to the bullish fair value gap at 103K, and bouncing into the bearish FVG around 106K. While this area acts as a clear resistance zone, the price is now breaking it to the upside, which could lead to a bullish leg toward the higher boundary of the large wedge pattern soon. The RSI is also climbing again, currently around 56, which indicates mild bullish momentum but not yet conviction. As mentioned, to confirm the bullish continuation, the buyers must reclaim the 106K–107K zone with a clean break and sustained structure. On the contrary, failure to hold above this level could open up the door to revisit the larger 100K demand block below. Traders should remain cautious of potential deviations and liquidity hunts within this tight range. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Reserve Bitcoin’s exchange reserves have been in an aggressive downtrend since the beginning of 2025, now reaching their lowest point in years. This long-term drain in exchange-held BTC reflects a macro structural shift in investor behavior, as participants are increasingly choosing to self-custody their coins. This behavior typically aligns with bullish conviction, as BTC moving off exchanges reduces immediate sell pressure and signals long-term holding intent. However, there’s more to this than just sentiment. The structural supply shortage on exchanges creates a low-liquidity environment where even modest demand can cause exaggerated price moves. This dynamic helps explain BTC’s sharp rallies and equally sharp corrections. As reserves continue to dwindle, the price may become even more sensitive to inflows or outflows, both from institutional buyers and retail. This environment favors volatility and sets the stage for explosive directional moves, especially as market structure tightens.

But optimism quickly gave way to risk aversion after the unexpected strike on Iran by Israel on June 13 triggered a sharp selloff across global markets. Bitcoin retraced much of its early gains with a 7.33 percent drop, closing the week lower as rising oil prices and macro uncertainty weighed heavily on investor sentiment. This episode underscores how even a strong trend can be swiftly derailed by exogenous shocks, especially when markets are running hot. Beneath the surface, trader behaviour revealed mounting stress. Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume plunged to –$197 million (see chart below), its lowest since June 6—signalling that sellers had seized control, aggressively offloading BTC at market prices. This selling, however, combined with a spike in liquidations, resembles past capitulation—style setups that often mark local bottoms. If Bitcoin can hold the $102,000–$103,000 zone, it may suggest that selling pressure is being absorbed and that the market could be primed for recovery—assuming geopolitical risks don’t intensify further. Notably, the scale of the correction has been modest, especially compared to past bull market drawdowns. A 9 percent peak-to-trough pullback is well within normal volatility bands for Bitcoin, with nearly half of all trading days in the current cycle having seen deeper drawdowns. In addition, the rapid slide in the Fear and Greed Index into “Fear” territory, despite a relatively mild decline, suggests market psychology remains fragile. This reflexive fear, however, may actually reduce downside risk, as positioning remains cautious and susceptible to quick reversals if demand reasserts. For now, Bitcoin is navigating a classic consolidation within an uptrend—volatile, but not broken. US inflation showed a mild increase in May, with the Consumer Price Index rising just 0.1 percent thanks to falling energy prices. However, this relief may be short-lived as trade tariffs and heightened geopolitical tensions raise the risk of renewed inflation through global supply chain disruptions and energy market volatility. Labour market signals are also turning cautious ; jobless claims rose to 248,000, approaching levels associated with recession risks, while continuing claims hit their highest since 2021—suggesting it’s taking longer for displaced workers to find new jobs. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve is expected to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting this week, balancing recent inflation softness with energy-driven price pressures and fragile job market trends. With inflation expectations still elevated and global uncertainties mounting, policymakers are likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach before committing to any rate cuts. The crypto sector is witnessing a strategic pivot as major players embrace treasury deployment and regulatory recalibration to drive ecosystem growth. The Blockchain Group , positioning itself as Europe’s version of Strategy, unveiled a €300 million at-the-market equity program to expand its Bitcoin reserves—signalling growing investor appetite for BTC-backed equity vehicles amid regulatory clarity under MiCA. Meanwhile, Cardano is considering a $100 million diversification of its ADA treasury into native stablecoins and Bitcoin, aiming to deepen liquidity and strengthen its DeFi infrastructure without relying on external funding. In parallel, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has withdrawn several Gensler-era proposals targeting DeFi exchanges and custody frameworks, reflecting a broader shift toward more innovation-friendly regulation under Acting Chair Paul Atkins. Together, these developments highlight a new phase where blockchain foundations are actively leveraging capital to accelerate adoption, while regulators begin aligning with the decentralised nature of Web3 finance.

Accordingly, cryptocurrency billionaire Justin Sun's altcoin project Tron plans to establish an MSTR-type company and go public with US President Donald Trump's son Eric Trump. Tron will go public via a reverse merger with Nasdaq-listed SRM Entertainment in a deal orchestrated by Dominari Securities, a New York-based investment bank with ties to Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, the FT reported, citing two people familiar with the matter.

That’s the difference between just another site and one that becomes a favorite. Responsible Gambling & User Safety in Indian Online Casinos One of the most overlooked — yet critical — aspects of online gambling in India is player protection. While flashy bonuses and fast withdrawals catch attention, safety should be non-negotiable. Responsible gambling tools and secure KYC systems are the unsung heroes of a healthy, long-term gaming experience. Here’s what top-tier platforms offer when it comes to player protection: Self-exclusion tools that allow players to block access temporarily or permanently Deposit and wager limits to help avoid overspending Encrypted transactions and robust data protection protocols Transparent terms for bonuses, withdrawals, and dispute resolution RajBet, for instance, features a responsible gambling section where users can request cooling-off periods or limit their deposits. Casino Days and Pure Win also include help links to international gambling support organizations like GamCare or Gambling Therapy. Additionally, the KYC (Know Your Customer) processes across all listed platforms are fairly strict — which is a good thing. Verifying your ID, age, and payment method ensures that underage or fraudulent activity is kept at bay. While this might feel tedious to some, it protects both the user and the platform. If you’re new to online gambling or have concerns about staying in control, look for platforms that promote these tools upfront. Real safety isn’t hidden in footnotes — it’s built into the user experience. Conclusion: Choosing the Best Online Casino India 2025 With so many casinos targeting Indian users in 2025, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. But now you’ve got the structure, the facts, and the comparisons to make a confident choice. Whether you’re after the best casino with Hindi dealers, a crypto-friendly betting site, or just fast UPI withdrawals — the picks above are tried, tested, and tailored for Indian players. Pick your priorities, double-check the fine print, and enjoy the ride. From casino games India fans love to fast crypto payments and Hindi language support, there’s a platform for every style of play.

2025-06-16T12:38:02,"‘Solana on Bitcoin’ Smashes $14.2m—24 Hours Until Listing Bombshell","The post ‘Solana on Bitcoin’ Smashes $14.2m—24 Hours Until Listing Bombshell appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News What if the next 1000x wasn’t on Ethereum, Solana, or some obscure L2 but right at the heart of Bitcoin? That’s the bet Bitcoin Pepe is making, and its presale is selling out with over $14.2m already raised. The team delayed its initial May 31 listing, extending the runway to onboard multiple Tier 1 exchanges and coordinate a synchronized, high-impact launch. Within 24 hours of the announcement, another $500k poured in. And if that’s what a delay announcement can do, what happens when they drop the real listing date bombshell in less than 24 hours? This is the final stretch, and here’s what you need to know. For live updates, visit the official website . Bitcoin Pepe’s layer 2 leaks: The first meme layer on Bitcoin is looking real Bitcoin Pepe is engineering the first-ever meme coin infrastructure on Bitcoin. This is the first meme ICO native to BTC, powered by a custom L2 and a token standard that turns Bitcoin from a vault into a canvas. If Ethereum’s ERC-20 ignited the altcoin boom, PEP-20 could do the same, but with Bitcoin-sized liquidity behind it. The leaked screenshots are early, but the L2 is already more polished than many L2s at launch. The bridge UI is minimal but strong; wallet integrations and safety checks are built right in. The explorer feels like a trimmed-down Etherscan: fully functional, simple, and clean. The DEX is also operational, and the care in UI/UX shows. With big fonts, bold colors, and easy onboarding, it doesn’t feel like a clunky protocol. Is 100x possible once BPEP hits exchanges? There are real reasons why Bitcoin Pepe is primed to 100x, and they go way beyond vibes. First of all, PEP-20 opens up native asset creation on Bitcoin. That alone expands Bitcoin’s surface area dramatically, which means every new token launched equals more volume, which translates into more utility for BPEP. After delaying the launch to land better exchange support, the project pulled in $500K in 24 hours. That doesn’t happen unless the delay signals upside. Every extra day provided an opportunity to onboard more exchanges, align deeper liquidity, and prepare for a coordinated, multi-CEX listing that would hit hard and fast, with the presale crowd positioned closest to the explosion. What’s more, eight cross-ecosystem partnerships have already been signed. These partnerships will serve as genuine connections to established networks in gaming, DeFi infrastructure, content creation, and launch tools, featuring names such as Super Meme , Plena Finance , Crypto Hunters , and Catamoto . With influencer buzz already bubbling across crypto X and YouTube , the FOMO is only getting louder. The audience is already here; it just hasn’t had much to do. If Solana showed us anything, it’s that chain-native meme coins can go 1000x overnight. Bitcoin Pepe is the first one with the setup to do it on BTC. Solana on Bitcoin: Less than 24 hours until listing bombshell With Bitcoin reclaiming headlines and capital flowing into anything with native upside, BPEP becomes the logical next trade, not just because it’s cheap, but because it’s early in a place no one’s been able to build this before. Right now, Bitcoin’s macro trendline is getting vertical. Analysts are tossing out $300k–$1.5M price targets. Bitcoin-native altcoins have a narrative again, and Bitcoin Pepe’s value prop is directly tied to that flood of capital. Every moment counts. Every moment is an opportunity to front-run what will likely be one of the most talked-about listings this cycle. With Bitcoin running hot and retail sidelined for now, Bitcoin Pepe is a low-cap rocket tethered to the biggest chain in crypto.

2025-06-16T12:30:17,"Bitcoin Treasury: H100 Secures Pivotal $15M from Adam Back, Targets Massive $75M Boost","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: H100 Secures Pivotal $15M from Adam Back, Targets Massive $75M Boost In a fascinating convergence of industries, Swedish healthtech firm H100 has made waves in the cryptocurrency space. The company recently announced a significant financial maneuver that underscores the growing trend of companies integrating digital assets into their financial strategies. This move is particularly noteworthy due to the involvement of a prominent figure in the Bitcoin world and the clear intention behind the funding: building a Bitcoin treasury . What’s the Big Deal with H100 and Adam Back? H100, a company focused on health technology, revealed via an announcement on X that it has successfully secured a $15 million convertible loan. The source of this funding is none other than Adam Back, the CEO of Blockstream and a highly respected figure within the Bitcoin community, known for his pioneering work on Hashcash, a precursor to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work. This $15 million convertible loan is part of a much larger potential funding round , targeting a total of $75 million. The fact that a healthtech company is attracting such significant investment from a Bitcoin heavyweight like Adam Back, specifically earmarked for Bitcoin acquisition, highlights a potential shift in how diverse industries view and utilize digital assets. The primary stated purpose for these initial funds is straightforward: to acquire Bitcoin for the company’s treasury. This positions H100 among a growing list of public and private companies exploring the use of Bitcoin as a reserve asset, moving beyond traditional fiat currencies and gold. Why Are Companies Building a Bitcoin Treasury? The concept of a corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy has gained considerable traction over the past few years, largely popularized by companies like MicroStrategy. The rationale behind such a strategy often centers on several key factors: Inflation Hedge: Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it a potential hedge against the inflation of fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on treasury assets compared to low-yield traditional investments. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet provides diversification away from assets solely tied to the traditional financial system. Philosophical Alignment: Some companies align with Bitcoin’s principles of decentralization, transparency, and censorship resistance, viewing it as a forward-thinking asset. For a company like H100, adopting a Bitcoin treasury could signal a forward-looking approach to financial management and potentially align the company with a tech-savvy, future-oriented investor base. Exploring H100’s Bitcoin-Focused Expansion While the immediate use of the $15 million is for Bitcoin acquisition, the mention of a potential $75 million funding round and a broader ‘Bitcoin-focused expansion’ suggests that H100’s plans might extend beyond simply holding BTC on its balance sheet. What could this expansion entail for a healthtech firm? Several possibilities come to mind, although the company’s specific plans remain to be fully detailed: Accepting Bitcoin for Services: H100 could begin accepting Bitcoin as payment for its health technology products or services, facilitating international transactions and potentially attracting customers who prefer using digital currency. Integrating Blockchain in Healthtech: While distinct from Bitcoin as a treasury asset, the underlying blockchain technology could be explored for applications within healthtech, such as secure patient data management, supply chain tracking for pharmaceuticals, or verifiable health records. A ‘Bitcoin-focused’ expansion could imply leveraging Bitcoin’s network properties or layers built upon it. Bitcoin Mining or Infrastructure: Less likely for a healthtech firm, but some companies have diversified into Bitcoin mining or supporting infrastructure. Given Adam Back ‘s background with Blockstream, there might be synergistic opportunities related to Bitcoin infrastructure, though this is speculative. Investment in Bitcoin-Related Ventures: Part of the larger funding could potentially be used to invest in other companies or projects within the Bitcoin ecosystem that align with H100’s strategic goals. The term ‘Bitcoin-focused expansion’ used by H100 is intriguing and suggests a deeper integration of Bitcoin into the company’s future strategy than just a balance sheet allocation. It could signify a commitment to operating within the Bitcoin economy or leveraging its unique properties. The Significance of Adam Back’s Investment The involvement of Adam Back is a powerful endorsement. As a cryptographer who contributed significantly to the theoretical underpinnings of Bitcoin and as the head of Blockstream, a company at the forefront of Bitcoin infrastructure development (like the Liquid sidechain), his investment carries significant weight within the industry. His backing provides credibility to H100’s corporate Bitcoin strategy and its broader expansion plans. Back’s participation in the funding round not only provides capital but also brings invaluable expertise and network connections within the Bitcoin space. This could be crucial for H100 as it navigates the complexities of managing a Bitcoin treasury and potentially expanding its operations within the Bitcoin economy. Navigating the Challenges of a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy While the potential benefits are significant, adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy is not without its challenges. Companies must carefully consider: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings, which can impact a company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings reports. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, creating uncertainty. Security: Safely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols to prevent theft or loss. Accounting and Taxation: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings and navigating tax implications can be complex. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, Bitcoin can still be viewed with skepticism by some investors, customers, or the general public. H100, like other companies venturing into this space, will need to develop sophisticated strategies to mitigate these risks while capitalizing on the potential upside. The expertise brought by investors like Adam Back could be instrumental in navigating these challenges. Actionable Insights for Businesses Considering Corporate Bitcoin H100’s move serves as a case study for other companies contemplating a similar path. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Homework: Thoroughly understand Bitcoin, its technology, market dynamics, and historical performance. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Determine how much volatility your company’s balance sheet can withstand. Bitcoin should likely be part of a diversified strategy, not the sole asset. Develop a Clear Strategy: Define the objectives for holding Bitcoin (e.g., long-term store of value, transaction currency, speculative investment). Prioritize Security: Implement institutional-grade security solutions for custody, whether self-custody or using a trusted third-party custodian. Understand Regulatory and Accounting Implications: Consult with legal and accounting professionals experienced in digital assets. Communicate Transparently: Be prepared to clearly articulate your strategy and rationale to shareholders, employees, and the public. The successful securing of a significant funding round like H100’s, especially with backing from figures like Adam Back , demonstrates that institutional interest in corporate Bitcoin strategies is not waning but potentially expanding into new sectors like healthtech. Conclusion: A Bold Step for H100 and Corporate Bitcoin H100’s announcement marks a significant development, showcasing a healthtech company making a decisive move into the world of digital assets. The $15 million convertible loan from Adam Back specifically for building a Bitcoin treasury , as part of a larger potential $75 million funding round , is a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin as a corporate asset. This strategy aligns H100 with a growing number of innovative companies globally who see Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic component of their long-term financial and operational plans. While challenges exist, the potential benefits of diversification, inflation hedging, and alignment with a future-oriented economy are driving this trend. H100’s ‘Bitcoin-focused expansion’ will be a key area to watch, potentially revealing new ways digital assets can intersect with the health technology sector.

2025-06-16T12:24:48,"Cryptocurrency markets predict Bitcoin’s price for end of 2025","Cryptocurrency prediction markets are increasingly confident that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is likely to trade at a record high between $120,000 and $130,000 by December 31, 2025. This bullish outlook comes as Bitcoin holds above the $100,000 mark, recovering from a brief sell-off triggered by rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. As of press time, the leading digital currency was trading at $106,679, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours, although down nearly 3% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Prediction markets set Bitcoin price Regarding price prediction, the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin ends 2025 at around $120,000, with traders assigning a 76% probability of that outcome, according to data retrieved by Finbold from the crypto prediction platform Polymarket on June 16, Meanwhile, Polymarket traders are giving Bitcoin a 57% chance of reaching at least $130,000 and a 32% probability of hitting $150,000. For Bitcoin to reach $150,000, it would need to rally by about 40% from its current price. On the other hand, more aggressive price targets have attracted far less confidence. In this case, predictions for Bitcoin to trade at $200,000 or $250,000 stand at just 13% and 8%, respectively. The lowest confidence bet is a spike to $1 million, with only a 3% chance. On the other hand, the markets don’t seem to expect a severe correction. The odds of Bitcoin falling to $70,000 or lower are just 26%, while the probability of a plunge back to $20,000 is only 5%. Bitcoin price prediction for December 31, 2025. Source: Polymarket Institutions show more interest in Bitcoin For now, sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. Bitcoin appears to be regaining strength following Thursday’s sell-off linked to the Israel-Iran conflict. On Monday, the asset briefly reclaimed the $107,000 level, although traders remain cautious amid ongoing regional instability. Still, institutional demand is helping to support the price. Notably, Japan’s first and only publicly listed Bitcoin treasury company has added 1,100 BTC to its holdings. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) saw total inflows of $1.37 billion last week, signaling continued investor interest.

For Bitcoin Solaris, that moment is now. As the broader market warms up to innovation again, one project has managed to draw attention not just with promises, but with working systems, advanced tech, and explosive momentum. BTC-S isn’t positioning itself as a speculative meme, it’s aiming to become the ultimate alternative to Bitcoin. At just $8 today and a roadmap heading for $20 at launch, the window to act is rapidly shrinking. Why Bitcoin Solaris Could Surpass Expectations Bitcoin Solaris is not just a fork or another fast chain. It’s a purpose-built, dual-layer ecosystem combining Bitcoin-grade decentralization with Solana-level speed. While other projects offer singular improvements, BTC-S delivers a full-stack transformation. From universal mining to DeFi tools, it’s created for real users, not just whales or devs. At its core: Dual-layer architecture fuses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) Base Layer with a blazing-fast Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Solaris Layer. The network supports over 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality, rivaling the fastest blockchains in existence. Energy usage is reduced by 99.95% compared to Bitcoin, making it eco-friendly and accessible. Smart contracts are written in Rust and support advanced DeFi, NFT, and enterprise applications. And it’s more than specs, the upcoming Solaris Nova App allows mining from mobile, removing barriers to entry and making wealth-generation as simple as tapping a screen. Real Value, Not Just Hype While Bitcoin built the foundation, it never scaled for mainstream use. BTC-S picks up where Bitcoin left off: Feature Bitcoin Bitcoin Solaris Consensus PoW PoW + DPoS Block Time 10 minutes 15 seconds (Solaris) TPS ~7 10,000+ Energy Usage High 99.95% lower Smart Contracts No Yes (Rust-based) Mining Accessibility Expensive hardware Mobile + desktop mining Beyond its tech, BTC-S also offers tiered user rewards via the integrated Bitcoin Solaris Casino , where users enjoy daily spins, token bonuses, and a shot at winning up to 0.5 BTC for high-tier purchases. It’s an engaging addition that merges crypto economics with fun, without straying from the ecosystem’s core mission. Why Crypto Veterans Are Quietly Loading Up on Bitcoin Solaris Tokenomics That Make Sense Bitcoin Solaris follows a deflationary, utility-driven model: Total Supply: 21 million BTC-S (same as Bitcoin) Mining Allocation: 66.66% Presale: 20% Ecosystem & Liquidity: 13.34% Such a distribution ensures long-term decentralization and rewards real contributors over speculators. It’s designed to grow with demand, not crash from unlock dumps. Why Everyone’s Talking About It Crypto Twitter, Telegram groups, and YouTube are already heating up around BTC-S. Influencers like 2Bit Crypto are publishing deep-dive reviews on why this may be the best altcoin bet before the next bull wave. Their consensus? It’s the rare blend of usability, innovation, and timing. Additionally, third-party audits by Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm a high-security standard for the platform’s codebase and contracts adding credibility and attracting more serious capital into the ecosystem. Presale Phase: One of the Shortest in Crypto History We’re now in Phase 8, with the current price at $8. Just a step away from its launch price of $20. With only weeks left until the July 31 launch, this is one of the shortest and most explosive presales in the space. Next Price Tier: $9 Bonus: 8% additional tokens Current Raised: $4.5M+ User Base: 11,500+ participants already in If you’re waiting, the numbers say others aren’t. It’s rare to see such velocity and community traction before a token even hits exchanges. For those who missed the early Bitcoin, the Bitcoin Solaris presale might just be redemption. Final Verdict Bitcoin Solaris isn’t promising to replace Bitcoin, it’s evolving it. With blazing speed, eco-conscious design, real-world use cases, and mobile-first mining, BTC-S rewrites the playbook on what a modern crypto should look like. It’s already halfway through its presale climb, and the time to act is rapidly closing. This isn’t just about speculation. It’s about being part of a new financial layer before the world catches up.

2025-06-16T12:20:42,"Unveiling Top Crypto Trends in South Korea’s Market","BitcoinWorld Unveiling Top Crypto Trends in South Korea’s Market Ever wondered what the buzz is like in specific regional crypto markets? Understanding local sentiment can offer unique insights. This week, we’re diving into the fascinating world of the Korean crypto market , specifically looking at which digital assets captured the most attention. What’s Driving Conversation in the Korean Crypto Community? The Korean crypto community is known for its active participation and influence on certain token prices. Keeping an eye on their interests can be incredibly insightful. Data from Bitcoin World between June 6 and 12 gives us a snapshot of which tokens were at the forefront of discussions and research. We’re looking at two key metrics: Top 10 Searched Tokens: What are people actively researching or looking up? This often indicates potential new interest or investigation into a project. Top 10 Mentioned Tokens: What are people talking about? This can reflect recent news, price movements, or general sentiment within the community. Exploring Top Crypto Searches in South Korea When it comes to actively searching for information, the data from South Korea crypto users on Bitcoin World reveals some familiar faces alongside a few surprises. Here are the tokens that saw the highest search volumes during the specified week: Rank Token Search Volume 1 XRP 49,175 2 ETH 21,087 3 BTC 15,217 4 RVN 11,528 5 ONDO 9,474 6 SOL 8,595 7 UXLINK 6,816 8 STX 5,721 9 MASK 5,442 10 BORA 4,781 It’s notable that XRP holds the top spot by a significant margin. While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) consistently rank high globally, XRP often sees amplified interest in the South Korea crypto scene. This could be due to various factors, including ongoing legal developments or specific community dynamics. RVN (Ravencoin) and ONDO appearing in the top 5 also highlights specific interests within this market, perhaps related to mining, RWA (Real World Assets), or recent news surrounding these projects. Beyond Search: Top Crypto Mentions in the K-Community Searches tell us what people are looking for, but mentions tell us what they are actively discussing. The list of crypto mentions Korea shows a slightly different picture within the K-Community crypto space: Rank Token Mention Count 1 BTC 1,515 2 ETH 755 3 XRP 225 4 TRUMP 194 5 SOL 161 6 ANIME 89 7 RVN 71 8 MASK 70 9 AXL 65 10 ONDO 52 Here, BTC and ETH reclaim their dominant positions, suggesting they are the foundational topics of discussion. XRP is still present but drops to third. The appearance of tokens like TRUMP, ANIME, and AXL in the mentions list, despite some not being in the top searches, indicates specific narratives, news events, or niche interests driving conversation within the Korean crypto community during this period. RVN and ONDO appear on both lists, showing consistent interest across both search and discussion. Understanding Top Crypto Trends Korea: Key Insights Analyzing both the top crypto searches Korea and the crypto mentions Korea gives us a more complete picture of the sentiment and focus within the South Korea crypto scene. While core assets like BTC and ETH are constant topics, regional factors and specific project developments clearly influence interest in tokens like XRP, RVN, and ONDO. The mentions list also reveals the impact of trending narratives, as seen with tokens like TRUMP and ANIME appearing prominently. For anyone interested in the dynamics of the Korean crypto market , monitoring these local trends is crucial. It highlights which projects are gaining traction and where community energy is being directed. Summary: What Did We Learn About the Korean Crypto Market Last Week? Last week’s data from the Korean crypto community on Bitcoin World provided valuable insights. XRP led the charge in searches, demonstrating its continued popularity in South Korea crypto circles. Meanwhile, BTC and ETH dominated discussions, reflecting their status as market staples. The appearance of tokens like RVN, ONDO, TRUMP, and ANIME on these lists underscores the diverse and sometimes unique interests driving the top crypto trends Korea .
