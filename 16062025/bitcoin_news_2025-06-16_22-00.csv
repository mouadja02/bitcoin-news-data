2025-06-16T19:55:18,"President Trump’s Truth Social Files With SEC for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF","A company backed by the President of the United States has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a joint Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exchange-traded fund (ETF). According to a new S-1 Filing with the SEC, President Trump’s Truth Social, a social media network, has filed for a new BTC/ETH ETF. States the filing, “The purpose of the Trust is to own bitcoin and ether transferred to the Trust in exchange for Shares issued by the Trust. Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in the net assets of the Trust. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin and ether held by the Bitcoin and Ether Custodian on behalf of the Trust.” The fund is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, and crypto custody will be handled by Foris DAX Trust Company, LLC, which is connected digital asset exchange Crypto.com. Last month, Trump reportedly blackballed a lobbying firm for allegedly manipulating him into posting on social media about XRP. In early March, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he directed the Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets “to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.” Politico, citing “two people familiar with the incident,” reported that Trump was goaded into making the post by an employee of the lobbying firm Ballard Partners. The unnamed employee reportedly “buttonholed” Trump at Mar-a-Lago and encouraged him multiple times to publish the post, even providing him with the text of a message she thought the president should write.

2025-06-16T19:30:12,"Ethereum Consolidation Continues – Altseason May Follow A Clean Break Above Resistance","Ethereum has remained in a volatile consolidation phase, trading between the $2,400 and $2,800 levels as geopolitical tensions weigh heavily on global markets. After last week’s failed breakout above resistance, ETH has retraced yet again, struggling to build sustained momentum. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has intensified market uncertainty, contributing to spikes in volatility across risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Ethereum Weekly Candle Hints At Pre-Tower Top Formation – Details Despite the macro headwinds, Ethereum bulls continue to defend key support levels, preventing a deeper breakdown. The $2,400 zone has acted as a strong floor in recent weeks, absorbing sell pressure and keeping ETH within its current trading range. Meanwhile, the $2,800 resistance remains the major hurdle to reclaim for a bullish breakout scenario. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical outlook suggesting that Ethereum is still consolidating below a key resistance area. This structure indicates that ETH is coiling before its next major move. The window for a potential breakout narrows as price tightens within this established range. Ethereum Prepares To Move Ethereum has pushed into a critical price zone, with bulls attempting to hold the $2,600–$2,700 range after recent volatility. The asset has shown resilience, rebounding from last week’s lows and re-entering the mid-range of its multi-week consolidation. With price action once again approaching the $2,800 resistance level, market participants are eyeing a potential breakout that could open the door to $3,000 and beyond. Analysts remain divided. On one side, bullish momentum and improving market sentiment suggest ETH is preparing for a larger move. A confirmed breakout above $2,800 would likely trigger aggressive buying and initiate a broader altcoin rally. Many investors are positioning themselves in anticipation of a rotation from Bitcoin into high-beta assets like Ethereum, hoping to ride the next phase of the cycle. On the other side, caution persists. Some technical analysts argue that Ethereum may still be at risk of losing steam, especially if the price gets rejected again at resistance. A failure to maintain the current range could result in a retracement toward $2,400 support or even lower, shaking out weak hands. According to a recent technical update from Jelle, Ethereum remains locked in consolidation just below its key resistance zone. The analysis points to a tightening structure where the window of opportunity is closing. If ETH breaks above this zone, it could ignite fireworks across the altcoin market. With global uncertainty still present and traders closely watching resistance levels, Ethereum’s next move could define the pace of the broader market. Whether it’s a breakout or a breakdown, the coming days are likely to be pivotal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tests Critical $104K Support – Eyes On $97K If It Breaks ETH Price Action: Technical Details Ethereum is currently trading at $2,606, maintaining a tight consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,800 as shown in the 12-hour chart. After multiple rejections around the $2,800 zone, the asset is struggling to break through this resistance level decisively. Despite the volatility triggered by macroeconomic uncertainty and Middle East conflict, ETH has managed to defend the $2,500 area, supported by a rising 100-period moving average. The recent bounce from the lower end of the range suggests that bulls are still active, stepping in to defend critical structure. However, volume remains relatively muted, indicating that buyers are cautious and awaiting confirmation before initiating larger positions. Meanwhile, the 50-period moving average remains above the 200-period MA, hinting at a medium-term bullish bias if support continues to hold.

If the range breaks to the downside, the $2,400 zone is the next level to watch for demand.

2025-06-16T19:30:11,"Bitcoin Permanent Holder Demand Accelerates – Gearing Up For A Breakout?","Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience despite growing geopolitical turmoil. After days of uncertainty fueled by escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, BTC has held the crucial $104,000 support level and is now pushing into higher price territory. The strength in price action signals that bulls remain firmly in control, even as global markets remain on edge. Fresh on-chain data from CryptoQuant highlights a key trend supporting this strength: Permanent Holder demand is accelerating. This cohort, often made up of long-term investors and institutions with high conviction, plays a vital role in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. Permanent Holders are wallets that accumulate BTC without showing a history of regular selling. They typically represent the most committed participants in the ecosystem, often continuing to buy and hold regardless of short-term volatility. With this trend gaining momentum alongside stable price support, Bitcoin appears well-positioned for another leg up —if broader macro conditions don’t derail the bullish setup. All eyes are now on the $109K and $112K resistance levels. Consolidation Builds Strength As Permanent Holders Accumulate Bitcoin has spent the past few weeks in a consolidation phase after a volatile first half of 2025. The year began with a wave of macroeconomic tension following newly imposed trade tariffs by US President Donald Trump, which disrupted global trade dynamics. Shortly after, rising US Treasury yields signaled growing systemic risk in financial markets, creating uncertainty across asset classes. Most recently, geopolitical fears intensified as conflict erupted between Israel and Iran, leading to spikes in oil prices and broad market unease. Despite these headwinds, Bitcoin has remained impressively resilient. The asset has continued to hold above the critical $104,000 level, with bulls defending support and maintaining upward pressure. This stability, even during times of global unrest, points to growing investor confidence and the possibility of a major move to the upside. Adding to this outlook, new insights from CryptoQuant show that Permanent Holder demand is accelerating. Permanent Holders—wallets that accumulate Bitcoin without showing a pattern of consistent selling—represent long-term conviction and reduced market liquidity. When demand from this cohort rises, it typically signals strong belief in future price appreciation and has historically preceded major bull runs. This structural demand trend, combined with Bitcoin’s ability to weather macro volatility, suggests the market is quietly building strength for an expansive move. If geopolitical risks stabilize and macro conditions ease, BTC could break out from its current range and retest the $112,000 all-time high, potentially setting the stage for the next leg of the cycle. BTC Bulls Push Back Above Key Moving Averages Bitcoin is showing signs of renewed strength after bouncing from the critical $103,600 support level. The 4-hour chart reveals a strong move above the 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs, indicating short-term momentum shifting back in favor of the bulls. BTC is now trading at $107,057, consolidating just below the $109,300 resistance—a zone that has acted as a significant ceiling over the past few weeks. The move back above the moving averages, particularly the 200 SMA (red line), suggests that demand is picking up. Volume has increased during the recent push, validating the breakout attempt. The $103,600 level remains the key support to watch on any downside move, as it has consistently acted as a launch point for previous rallies. To confirm a continuation of the uptrend, BTC must break above the $109,300 resistance with a strong candle close and ideally retest it as support. If rejected again, traders could expect a retest of the $105K-$106K zone, which aligns with the moving average cluster now acting as support.

2025-06-16T19:19:36,"Tron’s $210m Nasdaq play is real. Eric Trump’s role? Not so much.","As Justin Sun’s TRON enters into a $210 million reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, Eric Trump has publicly distanced himself from Dominari Securities, the firm brokering the deal. The Trump-linked bank’s role is drawing scrutiny amid Sun’s expanding investments in crypto ventures associated with the Trump orbit. The reported reverse merger between TRON and Florida-based SRM Entertainment marks one of the more unusual public debuts in recent crypto history: a blockchain empire going public not through a traditional IPO, but by absorbing a small-cap toy maker with licensing deals across Disney, Universal, and SeaWorld. Structured as a private placement, the deal involves a $100 million upfront investment and warrants valuing the transaction at $210 million. As part of the agreement, SRM Entertainment will rebrand as Tron Inc., effectively giving Sun’s blockchain project a backdoor entry onto the Nasdaq. The intrigue deepens with the players behind the scenes. Dominari Securities, the boutique investment bank arranging the offering, has well-documented ties to the Trump family. Read more: Trump’s Truth Social joins ETF race with dual Bitcoin and Ethereum product According to a June 16 CNBC report, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump joined Dominari’s parent company’s advisory board earlier this year. Yet within hours of the report linking Dominari to the TRON-SRM deal, Eric Trump took to X to deny any “public involvement” with the firm, calling the narrative “inaccurate.” . @tier10k I’m the biggest fan of Tron and love @justinsuntron – he is a great friend and an icon in the crypto space. That said the below is inaccurate – I don’t have public involvement in this company. https://t.co/CDt0uudY1s — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) June 16, 2025 Damage control or strategic retreat? Eric Trump’s swift denial raises more questions than it answers. His June 16 tweet directly addressed the report tying his family to the TRON-SRM merger. But the phrasing—“I don’t have public involvement in this company”—leaves room for interpretation. What about involvement behind closed doors? With Dominari brokering one of the year’s most controversial crypto deals, the denial reads like a strategic retreat. The optics were problematic: Justin Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire facing an SEC fraud case that has lost momentum under the Trump administration, invests nearly $100 million into Trump-aligned crypto ventures. Then, a Trump-linked bank steps in to help him go public. The timing is critical. Sun’s investments in Trump-backed ventures, including World Liberty Financial and the MAGA meme token, had already drawn scrutiny. Now, with Dominari at the center of the merger, the narrative risks shifting from business strategy to political patronage. Eric Trump’s denial may be a preemptive move to blunt regulatory or media backlash. Still, in crypto markets, where perception often drives sentiment, the damage may already be done. SRM stock surged 460 percent on news of the merger. But if investors start questioning who’s really pulling the strings, that volatility could just as quickly reverse course.

The saying holds true for Bitcoin treasury company Strategy, which on Monday announced it had expanded its holdings with a new 10,100 BTC buy amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The price of Bitcoin, meanwhile, climbed above the $107,000 level on Monday following a volatile weekend. Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Bet With Additional 10,100 BTC Purchase Strategy — formerly MicroStrategy — said it bought 10,100 BTC last week for approximately $1.05 billion at an average price of $104,080 per digital coin, with Bitcoin slumping from $110,000 last Monday to $103,639 lows on June 12 after news that Israel had bombed Iran rattled the markets. According to CoinGecko data, the world’s largest cryptocurrency was trading at $107,938 as of press time, up 2.3% in the past 24 hours. The Tysons, Virginia-based software company is the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, and now focuses on buying the asset — at its highs and lows — so that investors can get exposure to Bitcoin via its Nasdaq-listed shares. Strategy now holds a total of 592,100 BTC, worth over $63 billion. The total stash was purchased at an average price of $70,666 per BTC for a total cost of roughly $41.8 billion, including fees and expenses. That’s equal to around 2.8% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply. Please leave some for the rest of us. You bought our entire stack in 1 week — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) June 16, 2025 The latest haul comes after the company completed its new 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD) issuance. Targeted at long-term investors seeking high-yield, fixed-income opportunities, the offering consisted of 11.76 million shares and generated approximately $979.7 million in net proceeds after fees and expenses. Growing Corporate Crypto Adoption Since Strategy added a Bitcoin treasury, other public and private companies are following its lead by scooping up BTC to give shareholders better value for money.

Citing “two people briefed on the matter,” Financial Times reports that Tron will go public via a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, managed by New York-based boutique investment bank Dominari Securities – a firm that has ties to President Trump’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric. According to FT, Sun’s new venture will be called “Tron Inc.” and copy the treasury method of Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy, but instead of Bitcoin ( BTC ), will accumulate TRX, the native token of the Tron network. FT’s sources say that Eric Trump will hold a major role in the company, and that the deal will also involve a $210 million injection of crypto assets. In a separate press release, SRM Entertainment announced it was entering into a Securities Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) with an unnamed private investor for a $100,000,000 equity investment that will be used by SRM to initiate a TRON token treasury strategy. Sun was named as an advisor to the company. Shares of SRM Entertainment (SRM) skyrocketed as much as 647% early on Monday, and at time of writing, are currently up 453% on the day.

In a new press release , the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York says it is charging six people – Michael Edwards, Shakeemo Hill, William Hill, Alixandria Lauture, Shuron Malone and Carlos Mercado – in connection with a multi-million-dollar check and bank fraud crew that operated between January 2022 and July 2024. Authorities allege that they operated a sophisticated scheme that involved buying or obtaining keys to unlock Postal Service collection boxes in an effort to steal mail, bank cards and other bank account details. The group and their coconspirators would subsequently change the details of the checks by using digital means to alter the details and printing them on check stock or by using chemicals to remove the original ink. The group’s leader, Edwards, mostly planned out how to obtain the postal keys, while William Hill, Shakeemo Hill, and Mercado used the keys to steal mail from collection boxes. The other two members were involved in recruiting people they knew to supply them with private bank account details they could use. The group posted “millions of dollars” worth of checks for sale on a messaging application. They also deposited millions worth of fraudulent checks into accounts at national banks located on the East Coast, though no specific amounts were disclosed. As stated by US Attorney Jay Clayton, “As alleged, the six defendants charged today lined their pockets by stealing checks destined for hard working New Yorkers and others. Together with our partners at the Postal Inspection Service, we will fight to protect the integrity of the US mail system – a public service upon which millions of Americans rely every day to send items of financial, professional, and personal importance.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The network's mining difficulty hit a record 126.98 trillion, propelled by a 14-day average hashrate of 913.54 exahashes per second (EH/s). Transaction fees in June fell below 1% of block rewards, and hashprice dropped to $52 per PH/s before rebounding slightly. Escalating competition and energy costs are expected to drive production expenses above $70,000 per BTC, up from $64,000 in the first quarter of the year, the report said. To remain competitive, public miners like MARA Holdings (MARA), CleanSpark (CLSK), Riot Platforms (RIOT), and IREN (IREN) are accelerating buildouts . MARA grew its hashrate by 30% in May, while HIVE (HIVE) added 32% after energizing a new facility in Paraguay. Cipher Mining (CIFR) is targeting a 70% boost by expanding its Texas operation. Top-tier ASICs now cost between $10 and $30 per terahash, the report said, with operational payback periods stretching as long as two years. That’s assuming a $0.06/kWh electricity rate — already out of reach for some. Terawulf, for instance, paid $0.081/kWh in the first quarter, pushing its fleet hashcost up by over 25%. Meanwhile, mining equities are decoupling from bitcoin’s price performance . IREN, Core Scientific (CORZ), and Bit Digital (BTBD) were all in the green over the last month, while Canaan (CAN) and Bitfarms (BITF) were both down double digits during the same time period.

With technical confluence building around the $108,900 level, the market is now at a pivotal decision point. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has shown strong momentum coming into the week following a weekend push higher.

Key technical points Key Resistance at $108,900: This level aligns with the value area high, a prior swing high, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and a major high-timeframe resistance. Support Cluster at Weekend Lows: The point of control, 0.618 Fibonacci, and value area low align near the weekend’s base, creating a strong zone of liquidity. High Likelihood of Liquidity Sweep: Bitcoin often targets weekend lows before major directional moves, especially when consolidating at resistance. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin is currently trading within a key resistance region defined by a cluster of confluence: the value area high, a macro swing high, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and a high-timeframe horizontal level at $108,900. This zone has historically served as a barrier for bullish momentum, making it a valid region for short-term distribution or consolidation. What happens at this level will likely determine the next leg of price action. A candle close above $108,900, particularly on the 4H or daily chart, would signal strength and open the door for a breakout toward new all-time highs. On the other hand, a rejection at this level, especially on low volume, could trigger a sweep of weekend liquidity. You might also like: XAUUSD weekly forecast: fundamentals push gold higher, $3700 a possibility? The key support zone to monitor in that scenario lies around the point of control, which aligns with the weekend lows, the 0.618 retracement, and the value area low. Historically, Bitcoin tends to clear weekend lows before initiating major moves, aligning with the liquidity-driven behavior typical of the asset. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin is trading at a critical inflection point. A break above $108,900 with strong volume increases the probability of a new all-time high. A rejection, however, raises the likelihood of a liquidity sweep, with a potential retrace to support zones near $104,000. Watch this level closely, as this week’s trend may hinge on what unfolds here.

2025-06-16T18:31:31,"Why Japanese Investors Are Embracing Metaplanet for Bitcoin Exposure","BitcoinWorld Why Japanese Investors Are Embracing Metaplanet for Bitcoin Exposure Are high taxes making direct Bitcoin ownership less appealing? According to recent Matrixport analysis , Japanese investors are finding clever ways to gain exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency without facing the country’s potentially steep tax rates on direct crypto gains. This shift in strategy highlights the impact of regulatory environments on investment behavior and shines a spotlight on a unique approach: investing in companies with significant Bitcoin holdings, like Metaplanet. Understanding the Challenge: High Bitcoin Tax Japan Japan is known for its vibrant cryptocurrency market, but it also has a tax system that can significantly impact investors’ profits. Unlike some countries that treat crypto gains as capital gains with lower rates, Japan often categorizes these profits as ‘miscellaneous income’. Here’s a quick look at the tax landscape: High Rates: Gains from cryptocurrency trading or holding can be taxed at progressive rates reaching up to 55% when combined with other income, including national and local taxes. This is a substantial portion of any profit, making investors hesitant to sell or even realize gains. Miscellaneous Income Classification: This classification means crypto profits are added to other income sources, potentially pushing individuals into higher tax brackets. Taxable Events: Selling crypto for fiat, exchanging one crypto for another, or using crypto to pay for goods and services can all trigger taxable events. This high tax burden creates a significant disincentive for direct, active trading or long-term holding if the eventual sale faces such a high levy. It encourages investors to look for alternative methods to benefit from Bitcoin’s potential appreciation. Metaplanet: A Gateway for Indirect Bitcoin Investment Enter Metaplanet. This publicly listed Japanese company has gained prominence by adopting a strategy similar to MicroStrategy in the US – accumulating substantial amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. By investing in Metaplanet shares, Japanese investors are effectively gaining exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional stock market vehicle. Why is this appealing? Investing in company shares is a well-understood and tax-efficient process in Japan compared to direct crypto holdings. Gains from selling shares are typically taxed under a separate system, often at a lower, fixed rate (around 20%) regardless of the investor’s total income. This creates a significant tax advantage for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Matrixport’s observation underscores this trend, suggesting that the tax differential is a primary driver behind the increased interest in Metaplanet among Japanese investors. What the Matrixport Analysis Reveals About Metaplanet’s Valuation The Matrixport analysis points to an interesting phenomenon: Metaplanet’s market valuation appears to trade at a significant premium compared to the value of the Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet. The report highlighted Metaplanet’s 7.23x market net asset value (mNAV), implying that Bitcoin within the Metaplanet structure is being valued by the market at roughly $759,000 per coin, significantly higher than the prevailing spot market price. This premium suggests more than just the value of the underlying Bitcoin. According to Matrixport, several factors contribute to this elevated valuation: Speculative Demand: Investors are betting on Metaplanet’s continued Bitcoin accumulation strategy and the potential for its stock price to appreciate alongside BTC. Limited Float: The number of available Metaplanet shares might be relatively low compared to demand from investors seeking this indirect exposure. Expectations of Higher Future BTC Valuations: Investors anticipate that Bitcoin’s price will continue to rise, and holding it via Metaplanet’s balance sheet is seen as a convenient and tax-efficient way to participate in that growth. Tax Arbitrage: The ability to gain Bitcoin exposure with a potentially lower tax burden on future gains adds significant value for Japanese investors. This premium serves as a tangible indicator of the strong demand for tax-advantaged Bitcoin exposure in Japan. Navigating the Landscape: Benefits and Challenges of Indirect Bitcoin Investment Investing in Metaplanet for Bitcoin exposure offers clear benefits, primarily related to taxation and accessibility via traditional brokerage accounts. However, it’s essential to consider the potential challenges: Benefits: Tax Efficiency: As discussed, potential lower tax rates on stock gains compared to direct crypto gains. Accessibility: Easily tradable through standard stock brokerage accounts, familiar to traditional investors. Simplified Custody: No need for investors to manage private keys or worry about the security of direct Bitcoin holdings. Regulatory Clarity: Investing in a listed company is a well-established regulatory path. Challenges: Trading at a Premium: As highlighted by Matrixport, investors might pay a significant premium over the actual value of the underlying Bitcoin. Company-Specific Risk: The investment is tied to the performance and management of Metaplanet as a company, not just the price of Bitcoin. Limited Direct Control: Investors don’t directly own Bitcoin and cannot use it for transactions or other purposes. Correlation Risk: While highly correlated, Metaplanet’s stock price may not perfectly track Bitcoin’s price due to other business factors or market sentiment towards the company itself. For Japanese investors , weighing these factors is crucial when deciding between direct and indirect Bitcoin investment methods. Japan’s Evolving Stance on Corporate Bitcoin Holdings The Matrixport report also touched upon recent shifts in the Japanese government’s approach to corporate crypto holdings. Efforts to lower barriers for corporations to hold BTC and potentially classify it more as a reserve asset than a speculative one signal a potential thawing in regulatory attitudes, at least for businesses. While this doesn’t directly change the individual investor’s tax burden on miscellaneous income, it creates a more favorable environment for companies like Metaplanet to operate and expand their Bitcoin reserves. This could further solidify the indirect investment path as a viable option. The Future of Bitcoin Investment in Japan The current landscape, driven by high individual taxes and innovative corporate strategies, points towards continued interest in indirect methods for gaining Bitcoin exposure among Japanese investors . The success and premium valuation of Metaplanet serve as a case study for how tax environments can shape investment product demand. While the tax situation for individuals remains challenging, any future reforms that simplify or reduce the tax burden on direct crypto gains could potentially shift the balance. Until then, strategies involving publicly traded companies with significant Bitcoin holdings are likely to remain attractive for those looking to participate in the Bitcoin market from Japan. The insights from the Matrixport analysis provide valuable context into these market dynamics, highlighting the creative solutions investors adopt in response to specific regulatory and tax conditions. Conclusion: Navigating Taxes for Bitcoin Exposure The story of Japanese investors and Metaplanet is a compelling example of how tax policy directly influences investment flows and innovation within the crypto space. High taxes on direct Bitcoin gains in Japan have paved the way for indirect methods, with Metaplanet emerging as a popular vehicle. The significant premium highlighted by Matrixport analysis underscores the strong demand for tax-efficient access to Bitcoin. While this approach offers benefits like tax efficiency and accessibility, investors must also be aware of the risks associated with company-specific performance and the premium paid. As Japan’s regulatory environment continues to evolve, the strategies employed by its investors will undoubtedly adapt, but for now, indirect investment methods remain a powerful response to the challenge of high Bitcoin tax Japan .

2025-06-16T18:30:00,"Bitcoin (BTC) Primed for New Highs Above $150,000 in 2025, While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Could Become the Next Crypto to Hit $1","Bitcoin (BTC) is building momentum in mid‑2025, holding steady around $104,020 after a recent dip from about $108,750. As savvy investors evaluate what crypto to invest in, the steady recovery of Ethereum adds weight to the case for established coins, even as rising DeFi coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attract eyes for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Currently trading at $0.03 in its presale’s Phase 5, MUTM has raised over $10.6 million, passed a CertiK audit, and is projected for an explosive rally. Many now see MUTM as the most promising cheap crypto to buy now and a realistic coin for 2025’s next millionaire-maker and will hit $2 soon after launch. Mutuum Finance Soars Phase 5 of Presale as Investor Interest Surges Mutuum Finance is gathering real momentum as it soars in Phase 5 of its presale. As a new project, the platform is a potent competitor in the DeFi sector that provides an inflation-resistant and scalable alternative to meme coins focused on speculation. The interest of investors is also building up, and the project has already gathered more than $10.6 million, and over 12100 people hold the tokens. At this stage, the price of one MUTM is $0.03, and the official launch price will be doubled to $0.06, providing those who decide to support us at this stage, with a substantial chance of earning in the short term and an opportunity to grow in the long term. Mutuum Finance DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance offers an innovative non-custodial liquidity protocol allowing people to have full ownership of their assets when engaging in decentralized lending. The platform is developed on the basis of the dual lending model featuring Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer systems. The Peer-to-Contract structure operates under the control of smart contracts that smoothly vary interest rates in real-time according to the activity in the market. This brings about stability in the automated process to both the lenders and the borrowers. The Peer-to-Peer model on the other hand allows users to completely sideline intermediaries and instead allow borrowers and lenders to get in touch with each other. It is especially useful to people who transact with volatile assets like meme coins. Combined, those systems introduce a flexible and user-friendly experience of DeFi lending that is more controllable and secure than its centralized counterpart. CertiK Audit and Mutuum Finance Stablecoin Beyond its lending innovation Mutuum Finance also has intentions to launch a USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin offered by Mutuum will be capable of maintaining a stable condition even in a turbulent market as opposed to the situation being experienced with the algorithmic stablecoins. Mutuum Finance consists of open-source smart contracts and has already undergone a rigorous audit by CertiK, one of the most reliable brands in the sphere of blockchain security. Such an audit not only confirms the security of the infrastructure of the platform but also strengthens the overall transparency approach of Mutuum Finance, as well as its safety and reliability from the long-term perspective of the DeFi ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining recognition as one of the top high-upside DeFi projects of 2025, with over $10.6 million raised and 12,100+ early backers joining its Phase 5 presale. Priced at just $0.03, with a confirmed launch price of $0.06, investors today are positioned for 100% gains out of the gate, with long-term projections eyeing potential returns as high as $2 and beyond. Backed by a completed CertiK audit, a robust dual lending model, and a soon-to-launch USD-pegged stablecoin, MUTM is offering far more than hype, it’s building a real, utility-driven ecosystem. If you’re looking for the next altcoin breakout before Bitcoin crosses $150K, secure your MUTM tokens now before the presale price jumps.

2025-06-16T18:29:00,"Solaxy vs. Neo Pepe—Inside Crypto’s Biggest Presale War","There are two players, who are ready to duke it out on the bloody battlefield of cryptocurrency presales . Competitors are not the only ones that Solaxy and Neo Pepe ($NEOP) have become symbols of a fierce ideological struggle within bitcoin society. In spite of presale phases that are thoroughly crafted to motivate investors and create groundbreaking momentum, they have taken the market by the storm and are representative of quite different concepts about the future of crypto. Finding themselves at a crossroad, investors who want to join the next Crypto Investment Gems are forced to choose between quite different perspectives. Even though the number of new releases in the crypto sphere each year is quite extensive, only a microscopic number of those elicit the interest and investment that warrant their attention. Presales have proven to be the necessary test field in this extremely competitive market where early adopters are able to determine the true capability of a project. At that, Solaxy and Neo Pepe are great in this respect; both represent somewhat different paths to achievement. Solactic is straightforward and correct towards the agreed industry standards whereas Neo Pepe is on edge, experimenting with mechanics and firm ideological frameworks. This competition represents various notions of decentralization, innovation, and participation of the community in shaping the future of crypto and not merely a financial contest. 1. Presale Tactics—Revolutionary vs. Conventional The way cryptocurrencies run their presales reveals a great deal about their underlying goals and operating principles. Although Solaxy has chosen a more conventional presale model—linear stages with modest token value increases—it is strong in delivery. Neo Pepe Protocol, on the other hand, has adopted a revolutionary 16-stage presale system, beginning at $0.05 and rising to $0.16, painstakingly crafted to maximize investor excitement and sustain ongoing buzz. Neo Pepe is among the Best Presale choices for this year since it provides consistent liquidity in addition to consistent price increase for investors. Unlike Solaxy’s traditional, predictable approach, Neo Pepe’s dynamic presale cleverly combines hourly token unlocks post-launch, an original twist keeping constant investor involvement and price stability. 2. Symbolic Messaging—Utility vs. Cultural Rebellion Emphasizing utility, scalability, and technical performance, Solaxy places itself squarely in the crypto story driven by utilities. Excellent, most certainly, but hardly innovative in the packed market of today. On the other hand, Neo Pepe Protocol uses symbolism as a potent kind of market differentiator. It goes beyond conventional memecoin expectations by including strong socioeconomic symbolism into its basic character—an evocative cultural revolt against centralized financial control and market saturation. Unlike most memecoins, like Shiba Inu or Pepe (PEPE), Neo Pepe uses its meme-origin as an ideological lighthouse rather than for comedy. Emphasized by the idea of the “Memetrix,” its presale story is meant to appeal especially to crypto aficionados looking for active involvement in a financial revolution instead of merely passive speculation. 3.Strategic Edge of Neo Pepe—Auto-Liquidity Mechanism Another crucial battlefield where Neo Pepe clearly excels is liquidity provision. Solaxy is not very good here. Following immediate burning of LP tokens, Neo Pepe Protocol uses an advanced auto-liquidity mechanism to automatically channel 2.5% of every transaction to build liquidity pools. This innovative mechanism greatly exceeds the more conventional liquidity strategies used by Solaxy by guaranteeing constant prices and building investor confidence. Neo Pepe positions itself as unique in the Exclusive Token Launch scene by including auto-liquidity straight into its tokenomics, so removing reliance on hand market interventions. 4. Empowering Investors vs. Centralization Risks: Governance Model The governance structure of a cryptocurrency determines long-term project viability and investor confidence mostly. Solaxy depends mostly on a conventional centralized structure even if it is transparent in governance. Although quick, this method runs the danger of exactly replicating the centralized control crypto aficioners want to avoid. Built around the NEOPGovernor contract, Neo Pepe’s governance system marks an ideological advance. Its distributed government model boasts: One million tokens, easily available but strong against pointless ideas. One-block delay in voting delays allows quick and responsive community government. One-week long voting period is enough to promote reflective and inclusive decision-making. Aim for a quorum fraction of an ideal 4%, which will balance participation against paralysis of decision-making. Timelock: Open execution delay guaranteeing thorough community control. This all-encompassing system enables investors to actively shape the future of the project, so sharply contrasting Solaxy’s centralized governance risks. 5. Strategic Positioning: Instant Impact Against Long-Term Vision Usually, investor appeal comes down to strategic orientation. Solaxy’s functional utility approach gives quick, short-term impact grounded in its practicality. However, these approaches sometimes lead to stagnation since once initial excitement based on utility fades, market hype can soon fade. But Neo Pepe fosters investor loyalty by means of both steady growth and instant excitement. Its strategic road map goes much beyond simple launch excitement; future phases include strategic alliances, governance-driven exchange listings, and vigorous worldwide marketing campaigns. 6: Industry Context—Neo Pepe’s Specialism Neo Pepe obviously stands out from well-known presales like Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) or Antix (ANTIX) by its thorough and creative approach. While Antix mostly depends on speculative momentum and Bitcoin Pepe stresses conventional meme-driven enthusiasm, Neo Pepe combines strong tokenomics with meaningful symbolic engagement, so offering great utility wrapped in ideological purpose. Presale Losers and War Winners Taken through the lens of presale strategy, governance elegance, liquidity frameworks, as well as symbolic messaging, Neo Pepe is evidently competitive. It is a complete vision, which is well designed to attract investors in both the short and long-qualities. Ultimately, Neo Pepe Protocol is soon becoming one of the leading Crypto Investment Gems in the competitive and competitive crypto presale arena. The current participants in the launch will not only be a participant in another crypto launch but also a part of a continuing process of real decentralization, monetary independence, and a significant cultural declaration. Do it now; check the Neo Pepe Protocol presale and become part of crypto’s revolutionary journey toward true decentralization and financial freedom.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solaxy-vs-neo-pepe-inside-cryptos-biggest-presale-war/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB","Press Release",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T18:28:52,"CoinShares Joins Solana ETF Train With New Filing: Details","CoinShares has joined other asset management firms to file for a Solana ETF. It officially joined the race on June 14 by registering its interest in an S-1 form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, CoinShares is now the eighth applicant for a Solana ETF in the United States. Where is the BlackRock Solana ETF Filing? CoinShares is joining Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton, which had submitted the same filing earlier. Senior Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared the update on X, stating that ” Coinshares is jumping into the Solana spot ETF race with a new filing this morning. I think we are up to 8 now. He also noted that some people have asked him when BlackRock will file its SOL ETF filing. He answered these questions, “I don’t know, no intel. My Spidey sense is not helpful either, as I could see them filing, but I could also see them not filing.” Grayscale and Fidelity Files SOL ETF It is worth noting that for every Solana ETF filing made to the SEC, the applicants indicated their interest in including staking when they eventually launch. This suggests that staking is becoming a standard feature for these proposed funds. Grayscale Investments submitted a proposal to the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a SOL ETF in March. Fidelity filed its application in the same month, further demonstrating the increased interest in Solana. Such an ETF would allow investors to access Solana without directly buying or managing cryptocurrency. Generally, there is a push to engage with digital assets other than Bitcoin (BTC). Canary Capital Partners With Marinade Finance on ETF Staking Canary Capital took a bolder step towards its SOL ETF by bagging a new partnership with Marinade Finance , a popular SOL staking platform. This partnership led to the fund’s renaming, now called the Canary Marinade Solana ETF. This deal allows the ETF to include SOL staking, like the SOL ETF application from other asset managers. However, all these applicants wait for the security regulator to decide on their filings. On the other hand, the SEC has postponed its decision, claiming to wait for public comments.

The acquisition is another sign of investor confidence in the world’s largest and oldest crypto despite the Israel-Iran war and the looming uncertainty over global financial markets. Metaplanet, which has modelled its aggressive Bitcoin approach on Michael Saylor’s Strategy, earlier this month announced a revised target to hold over 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, referencing a goal of holding 1% of the entire Bitcoin supply. After reaching 10,000 BTC, the company will need to buy a further 200,000 BTC over the next 18 months to reach that target. To fund additional Bitcoin buys, Metaplanet recently unveiled plans to raise up to $5.3 billion via the issuance of 555 million new shares over the next two years.

2025-06-16T18:21:16,"Why is XRP Price Going Up Today?","The post Why is XRP Price Going Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The price of XRP has climbed 7% in the past 24 hours, reaching $2.32, as crypto markets turn green amid growing chatter over easing tensions in the Middle East and important developments in the long-running Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. After recent market uncertainty caused by the Israel-Iran conflict, crypto prices are starting to recover. XRP, in particular, has seen a strong upswing, with trading volume doubling during this price jump. The token has not only erased the losses from last week’s selloff but has also reclaimed its key price zone around $2.30. A big reason behind XRP’s rally is the crucial court deadline today, June 16, 2025, in the Ripple vs. SEC case. If both parties fail to submit a corrected motion by the end of the day, the case could move to a full appeal, dragging the matter out for months. However, if they manage to settle or file the needed documents, it could lead to a favorable outcome for Ripple — possibly classifying XRP as a non-security for retail sales. This could open the door for XRP-backed financial products like ETFs and settle the lawsuit by mid-2025. There’s also fresh ETF news. Purpose Investments, a major asset management firm, may have received its final prospectus receipt, potentially clearing the way to launch its XRP ETF soon. If approved, this would be a major milestone for XRP adoption in traditional markets.

2025-06-16T18:10:31,"Unlocking Bullish Signals: Bitcoin Permanent Holder Demand Surges","BitcoinWorld Unlocking Bullish Signals: Bitcoin Permanent Holder Demand Surges Are you watching the Bitcoin market closely? If so, you might have noticed some interesting signals emerging from on-chain data. One particular metric, Bitcoin permanent holder demand, is currently flashing green, suggesting a significant shift in investor behavior that could have major implications for future price movements. Understanding the Rise in Bitcoin Permanent Holder Demand What exactly does it mean when we talk about “permanent holder demand”? This term, often used by on-chain analytics platforms like CryptoQuant, refers to the wallets and entities that are accumulating Bitcoin and showing little to no history of selling. These are the investors with a long-term perspective, often dubbed ‘hodlers’, who believe in Bitcoin’s future value and are essentially taking coins out of the readily tradable supply. The recent report from CryptoQuant highlighted a rapid increase in this specific type of Bitcoin demand . This isn’t just random buying; it’s accumulation by those who intend to hold onto their assets for extended periods, possibly years. Think of it as smart money or conviction capital entering or strengthening its position in the market. Why is High Bitcoin Demand From Long-Term Holders Significant? Historically, periods of strong accumulation by permanent holders have often preceded or accompanied major market rallies. Why? Because it indicates several key factors: Reduced Selling Pressure: When long-term investors are buying and holding, they aren’t selling. This reduces the amount of Bitcoin available on exchanges, making it harder for large sell-offs to occur and easier for prices to rise on positive news or buying pressure. Strong Confidence: It signals that experienced and conviction-driven investors believe the current price levels represent a good opportunity for long-term gains. Their actions often influence others and build overall market confidence. Supply Shock Potential: If this accumulation continues, it can lead to a supply squeeze, where limited available Bitcoin meets rising demand, potentially leading to rapid price appreciation. This sustained Bitcoin demand from those with a long-term view is a powerful signal, often seen as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin’s future trajectory. Connecting the Dots: CryptoQuant Analysis and Market Trends The insights provided by platforms like CryptoQuant are invaluable for understanding the underlying market dynamics beyond just price charts. Their CryptoQuant analysis delves into the blockchain data, tracking the movement of coins between different types of wallets (exchanges, miners, long-term holders, short-term speculators). This level of detail allows analysts to identify trends that might not be immediately obvious. The specific metric highlighted – rising permanent holder demand – is a direct reflection of behavior on the blockchain. It’s not speculation based on news headlines; it’s an observation of actual coin movements. This makes on-chain data a powerful tool for identifying potential shifts in market sentiment and structure. Comparing current on-chain patterns to historical cycles, CryptoQuant analysts can often find correlations. For example, similar spikes in permanent holder accumulation were observed during the early phases of previous bull runs. While past performance is not indicative of future results, these historical precedents provide a framework for interpreting current data points. Implications for Bullish Bitcoin Momentum The confluence of rising Bitcoin permanent holder demand, reduced exchange supply, and historical precedents strongly suggests potential for bullish Bitcoin momentum. It paints a picture of a market where conviction is growing and selling pressure from a significant segment of holders is minimal. Does this guarantee an immediate price surge? No. The crypto market is influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and short-term trading activity. However, the foundation being laid by long-term holders is a critical component for sustainable upward price movements. Consider the mechanics: If long-term holders continue to absorb supply, any significant buying pressure from institutions or even retail investors looking to enter or add to their positions will hit a market with less available supply on exchanges, potentially driving prices up more quickly and with less resistance. Actionable Insights for Long-Term Bitcoin Investors For individuals who consider themselves long-term Bitcoin investors , this analysis provides affirmation of their strategy. It suggests that the fundamental picture, based on the behavior of other conviction holders, remains strong. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics and analysis from reputable sources like CryptoQuant. Understanding these underlying trends can help you make more informed decisions. Review Your Strategy: If your goal is long-term accumulation, the current environment, characterized by strong holder demand, might reinforce that approach. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For many long-term investors, continuing a DCA strategy can be effective, allowing you to accumulate more Bitcoin regardless of short-term price fluctuations, especially when the long-term outlook appears strong based on holder behavior. Manage Risk: While the signals are bullish, always invest within your means and understand the inherent volatility of the crypto market. The behavior of long-term Bitcoin investors is often a leading indicator of market health and future potential. Their current accumulation phase is a data point that shouldn’t be ignored. Summary: The Foundation for a Bullish Bitcoin Future? In conclusion, the analysis from CryptoQuant highlighting the significant increase in Bitcoin permanent holder demand is a compelling signal for the market. It indicates that investors with a long-term vision are actively accumulating Bitcoin, reducing the available supply on exchanges and demonstrating strong confidence in its future value. This trend, historically associated with the early stages of major rallies, provides a strong fundamental argument for potential bullish Bitcoin momentum. While short-term volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, the actions of long-term Bitcoin investors , as revealed by detailed CryptoQuant analysis of on-chain data, suggest that a solid foundation is being laid for future growth. Keeping an eye on this rising Bitcoin demand is crucial for anyone navigating the current market landscape.

2025-06-16T18:05:50,"Time for Major Leg Up in Silver Prices, According to Veteran Trader – Here’s His Price Targets","A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst and trader says silver is about to have a massive breakout. The analyst pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 320,800 followers on the social media platform X that silver may start to outshine gold, which has been hitting new all-time highs. “Silver gearing up for the next major leg up in my opinion, gold probs about to take a backseat for a bit as gold-to-silver ratio starting diverge heavily again on low timeframes.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz practices Elliott Wave theory, which states that a bullish asset tends to go through a five-wave move up before an ABC correction. Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that silver is in the process of its third-wave surge. He predicts silver may reach the $40 level, then have a slight correction before soaring to around $43. Bluntz also says other indications of a silver breakout include the possible formation of a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders (IHS) pattern against the S&P 500 (XAG/SPX) on the monthly chart. “Four months later and now silver is also on the cusp of the same massive breakout against equities. Four year IHS breakout brewing with volume increasing substantially in the breakout. Multiple extremely high timeframe bull divergence. Decade-long downtrend broken.” Source: Bluntz/X Bluntz also says gold may hit a new all-time high within weeks. “$3,400 resistance cleared and coming in on the all-time high test. Gold still looking crazy bullish and I think we see $3,800 within a few weeks.” Source: Bluntz/X Gold is trading for $3,414 at time of writing. Meanwhile, the gold/silver ratio, which measures the number of ounces of silver required to purchase one ounce of gold, is currently at 93. At time of writing, silver is worth $36.42.

2025-06-16T18:02:44,"European crypto ETPs continue to attract interest","Digital assets manager 21Shares has announced the cross-listing of five crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange. With the move, the issuer has ten products listed on the Swedish exchange. According to its official announcement , the newly listed ETPs are Uniswap (AUNI), Avalanche (AVAX), Bitcoin Gold (BOLD), Solana Core Staking (CSOL), and Ethereum Core (ETHC). 21Shares existing products on the exchange already include ETPs for Bitcoin (ABTC), Ethereum (AETH), Solana (ASOL), XRP (AXRP), and Bitcoin Core (CBTC). According to the firm, its expansion is part of its effort to increase its presence in the Nordic region and give investors access to regulated and transparent digital asset products. Its head of Financial Product Development, Mandy Chiu, noted that these products allow investors to diversify their portfolios and make them more resilient. She said: “Our continued expansion in the Nordic region reflects the increasing demand from both retail and institutional investors for diversified and cost-effective crypto exposure.” Meanwhile, the head of ETF & ETP for Nasdaq European Markets, Helena Wedin, expressed excitement about the new products from 21Shares. Hedin said that the new ETPs reflect the current wave of innovation in the financial sector while highlighting the exchange’s role in bringing the product to the masses. 21Shares sees over $200 million in outflows YTD Meanwhile, 21Shares is Europe’s biggest digital assets product issuer, with listings on six exchanges, including Euronext Paris and Amsterdam, SIX Swiss Exchange, and London Stock Exchange. It has recently listed Hedera (HBAR) and Cronos (CRO) ETPs on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam. However, its reach extends beyond Europe, with the asset issuer also having a spot in Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds listed in the US. Interestingly, it is currently pending ETF applications for altcoins before the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) While it has dozens of ETPs, three of which are in the top 20 for assets under management (AUM) in Europe , 21Shares products have struggled with outflows from most of its products this year. According to CoinShares data, the firm currently has an outflow of $212 million year-to-date for its products. The massive outflow is likely because most of the underlying products for its ETPs are altcoins, which have struggled to see sizable gains in 2025. Still, 21Shares reported a $4 million inflow last week, taking its month-to-date flow to a positive $6 million. European crypto ETPs continue to attract interest Despite the struggles of 21Shares, the crypto ETP market in Europe is growing. Germany particularly has attracted significant inflows into digital assets products this year with $908 million, a record that is only bested by the US, according to CoinShares data. Retail investors have been the driving force behind these inflows, but institutional investors are showing interest. According to ETF Stream , Fund-of-fund allocation to crypto ETPs has increased from €45 million to €138 million between 2023 and 2025. While it still accounts for only a small portion of total asset under management (AUM) ETPs, it indicates that more professional investors are paying attention to crypto investment products. Meanwhile, more retail investors will likely have access to crypto ETPs soon, with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) disclosing recently that it wants to lift the ban on retail investors buying crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs). With the UK having about 30 ETNs listed on its exchange, the decision could attract more inflows to the asset class. Interestingly, Europe has about 130 crypto ETPs listed across various exchanges, many of which are available to the public. However, the US could soon see as many products with more than 70 crypto ETF applications currently before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

2025-06-16T18:00:37,"Key Fractal From 2023 Says Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish, But A Crash To $90,000 Could Be Coming","Crypto analyst X Force has drawn the crypto community’s attention to a key fractal from 2023, which paints a bullish picture for the Bitcoin price. However, the analyst suggested that a drop to $90,000 could still be on the cards for BTC, although that won’t invalidate the macro setup. Key Fractal Shows Bitcoin Price Is Still Bullish In an X post, X Force highlighted a key fractal from the early phase of the 2023 bull market and noted why it supports the view that the current trend remains bullish. He remarked that the price structure that was observed back then could offer insights relevant to the current analysis, as history often rhymes even though it might not repeat itself exactly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $94,000 Imminent As Fibonacci Resistance Is At Stake X Force then noted that in 2023, a larger degree wave 1 terminated, followed by a shallow wave 2 that retraced only to the 23.6% to 38.2% Fibonacci levels. The analyst then declared that this interpretation wasn’t just hindsight but it was the only valid count even in real-time. He also raised the possibility of the Bitcoin price creating another low. X Force explained that the context of the micro timeframes is losing weight as every bounce and dump is extremely sensitive to the overall creation of the wave structure. Meanwhile, the analyst indicated that the Bitcoin price could still drop to as low as $90,000 but noted that it is important that BTC remains above this critical support level. In an X post, the crypto analyst stated that as long as the Bitcoin price stays above the $90,000 level, the implications of the shorter-term price action have zero impact on the overall macro trend. X Force added that pullbacks and choppiness are not only healthy but vital to any bull market. A BTC Price Crash Imminent? Veteran trader Peter Brandt has raised the possibility of a Bitcoin price crash happening soon. In an X post, he questioned if November 2021 was happening all over again for the flagship crypto. His accompanying chart showed how that period formed the cycle peak for BTC, following a double top formation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Above $107,000 Is Ideal, But Don’t Get Excited Until This Happens The Bitcoin price then crashed from its all-time high (ATH) of around $69,000 and consolidated for over two years before witnessing another breakout in 2024. The chart indicated that BTC may have formed a double top again following the recent rally to a new all-time high of $111,900. If so, this could mark the end of the cycle’s bull run, with a crash set to follow. However, the chart suggested that BTC could sustain this bull run if it holds above $104,612. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $106,700, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

But with its high entry cost and slower growth potential, some investors are beginning to explore emerging opportunities like Ruvi AI (RUVI) . Positioned at the intersection of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) , Ruvi AI offers compelling reasons to be considered a smarter investment today, boasting structured growth , practical utility , and a massive 113x return potential . Why Analysts Are Comparing Ruvi AI and Bitcoin Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto world is driven by its status as the first cryptocurrency and its reputation as “digital gold.” However, as the market matures, investors are seeking tokens with more utility and faster growth potential. While Bitcoin’s returns have slowed over time due to its maturity, Ruvi AI promises exponential growth opportunities grounded in real-world applications. Ruvi AI’s Phase 2 presale price of $0.015 per token makes it an attractive entry point for investors. What sets it apart is its $0.07 guaranteed price post-presale , delivering an automatic 50% return before public trading even begins. Analysts predict that Ruvi AI will reach $1 post-listing , translating to 113x returns for early investors. Where Bitcoin relies on its reputation, Ruvi AI combines scalability, innovation, and structured growth to appeal to both retail and institutional investors. Presale Success Underlines Ruvi AI’s Momentum Ruvi AI’s presale performance speaks volumes about investor confidence. Having raised $1.7 million and sold over 150 million tokens , the project’s traction is growing daily. Its structured price model ensures predictable returns, helping investors avoid the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. VIP Tiers Amplify Investment Potential Ruvi AI goes a step further by offering VIP investment tiers that reward early participants with bonus opportunities. Here’s how they transform contributions into substantial returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. For investors ready to take full advantage of this presale opportunity, these VIP options provide an incredible pathway to early financial gains. Transparency and Security Make a Strong Case Despite Bitcoin’s position at the top, its growth is largely driven by market sentiment rather than a focus on utility or transparency. On the other hand, Ruvi AI demonstrates its commitment to investor trust through actionable steps like its upcoming CyberScope audit. This third-party review ensures Ruvi AI’s infrastructure is secure, giving peace of mind to cautious investors. Adding to its credibility is Ruvi AI’s partnership with WEEX Exchange , a globally respected trading platform. This collaboration guarantees liquidity after its presale, ensuring users can seamlessly trade their tokens post-launch. These initiatives point to Ruvi AI’s long-term focus on creating a trustworthy and sustainable ecosystem. Real-World Applications Fuel Ruvi AI’s Utility Bitcoin’s primary use case revolves around being a store of value. While that’s significant, Ruvi AI expands the horizon of what cryptocurrencies can achieve. By integrating AI with blockchain, Ruvi AI addresses specific challenges across various industries: Marketing Businesses leverage its AI-enabled tools to optimize ad campaigns, refine customer targeting, and achieve measurable ROI improvements. Entertainment Ruvi AI enhances consumer experiences, from personalized content suggestions to blockchain-supported payment systems, creating value for both creators and audiences.

These scalable applications ensure Ruvi AI isn’t just a speculative investment but a foundational tool across industries. Is Ruvi AI a Smarter Pick Over Bitcoin? While Bitcoin commands respect for its legacy, its growth potential is limited by its maturity and high market cap. Ruvi AI, however, offers an exciting entry point for investors looking for dynamic growth and practical utility. Its $0.015 presale price , guaranteed rise to $0.07 , and projected $1 valuation suggest exponential return potential, making it a standout choice for those in search of significant crypto gains. Combined with its upcoming CyberScope audit , its trusted WEEX Exchange partnership , and its focus on AI-driven utility , Ruvi AI is redefining the blockchain landscape.

Price is now approaching a potential breakout zone, with strong support below and a bullish continuation pattern forming on the chart. A Fibonacci extension points to $2.20 as the next major upside target, if current structure holds. After bottoming out near the $0.25 region, SPX6900 ( SPX6900 ) has been in a strong uptrend, marked by consecutive higher lows and higher highs. This structure has consistently reclaimed major volume levels and flipped resistance into support. Now, with price consolidating just under all-time highs and forming what could be a bullish pennant, traders are watching for a continuation move toward the $2.20 region. Key technical points Value Area High + Daily Support at $1.42: As long as price holds above this zone, the uptrend remains structurally intact. Bullish Pennant Formation Possible: Price is consolidating just beneath ATH, with converging support and resistance pointing to a breakout setup. Fibonacci Extension Target at $2.20: Taken from the last swing low to high, the 0.618 extension projects further upside if breakout occurs. SPX6900/USDT (1D) Chart, Source: TradingView SPX 6900’s market structure remains one of the strongest in the current cycle. After establishing a macro low around $0.25, price action reversed sharply, reclaiming the 200-day moving average, breaking past major volume profile levels, and confirming each breakout with a bullish retest. This has led to the formation of solid high-timeframe support zones, which continue to hold. Most recently, a key reaction came from the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, which produced a strong rally into all-time high territory. Now, price appears to be consolidating in a pennant formation, a classic continuation setup where price coils in equilibrium before a decisive breakout. This pause in momentum is backed by strong volume, suggesting healthy buying interest and sustainable trend conditions.

What to expect in the coming price action SPX 6900 remains in a high-momentum uptrend, and the current consolidation phase could lead to another impulsive breakout. If the $1.42 support zone holds and price breaks above the pennant, a move toward $2.20 is the next likely target.

Here’s why","While Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate the public conversation, analysts have continued to champion XRP, informing the community it is no longer a speculative asset but the foundation of a technological infrastructure ready for institutional adoption. EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a popular analyst on X, recently highlighted XRP’s advantages, comparing the asset to a nuclear weapon that can change the course of a war. He referred the community to a post he shared in February 2024, where he delved deeper into the XRP ecosystem’s features and reasons why it can reshape global finance. ONLY FEW #XRP possesses the transformational power to reshape the very essence of the global financial system. Much like a nuclear weapon alters the course of warfare. Read the Full post https://t.co/PXqNoS69wM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 15, 2025 Infrastructure Built for Functionality Unlike many cryptocurrencies, XRP was engineered for scalability, low-cost transactions, and integration into existing financial processes. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) supports rapid settlements with minimal energy usage. This sets it apart from proof-of-work networks, such as Bitcoin. Ripple president Monica Long recently revealed that XRP is 120,000 times more efficient than BTC , and this focus on efficiency and utility has shaped the asset’s identity as a purpose-built system for financial applications. A Game-changing Ecosystem EGRAG CRYPTO noted that, unlike Bitcoin, XRP avoids the concerns tied to a pseudonymous founder holding an outsized supply. While some detractors claim XRP is centralized, experts, including Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz, have debunked these claims . At the same time, XRP delivers features uncommon in many other blockchain ecosystems, such as built-in decentralized exchange capabilities, smart contract support through Hooks, and compatibility with tokenized real-world assets . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to the analyst, these elements position XRP to meet a range of use cases, including cross-border payments, remittances, decentralized finance, microtransactions, and supply chain applications. He also highlighted the automated market maker (AMM) functionality and a global decentralized exchange ecosystem as extensions of the XRPL’s capabilities. Legal Positioning and Institutional Confidence While Ripple’s protracted legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is burdensome, it has given XRP legal clarity unmatched by many digital assets. For analysts like EGRAG CRYPTO, this clarity has strengthened its position. The asset’s resilience through regulatory pressure and market volatility has become part of its identity, signaling its durability in high-stakes environments. Importantly, XRP’s trajectory is no longer confined to the crypto-native audience. EGRAG CRYPTO’s post describes the interest of institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity, whose recognition of XRP’s long-term potential may mark a shift from exploratory engagement to strategic positioning. As the analyst noted, XRP is the financial nuclear weapon of the digital era. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The deadline for a crucial status report in the case has allegedly officially passed, but there’s still no confirmation from the court about whether it was submitted. According to AI assistant Grok, a major update in the case — either a status report or a court ruling — was expected today, June 16, 2025. Based on usual court filing hours, it should have arrived by now. However, delays are possible, with the next likely dates being June 19 or even as far out as August. Despite the legal uncertainty, XRP’s price has been on the rise. Over the past 24 hours, it has gained about 7%, moving up nicely as broader market sentiment improves. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies are also showing gains. What’s Next For XRP Price? XRP is currently trading at $2.31 on the daily chart. Over the past few days, XRP has been hovering between a support level around $2.10 to $2.25 and a resistance level between $2.31 and $2.36. This sideways movement has kept the market quiet without any major breakouts or breakdowns. There’s also a possible head and shoulders pattern forming on the chart, which could be a bearish sign for XRP. However, this pattern would only be confirmed if the price drops below $2.25. If Bitcoin pushes higher in the short term, XRP and other altcoins might follow with a small price jump.

2025-06-16T17:40:31,"Major Remixpoint Bitcoin Acquisition: Japanese Firm Adds $1.4M BTC","BitcoinWorld Major Remixpoint Bitcoin Acquisition: Japanese Firm Adds $1.4M BTC Get ready for some interesting news from the land of the rising sun! Japanese energy consulting firm, Remixpoint, just made headlines with a significant Remixpoint Bitcoin purchase. This move isn’t just a small step; it’s another clear signal of growing corporate interest in digital assets, even from seemingly traditional sectors. What’s Behind the Latest BTC Acquisition by Remixpoint? In a recent press release dated June 16, Remixpoint announced a notable addition to its treasury: another 13.3 Bitcoin. The price tag for this latest acquisition came in at 200 million yen, which translates to roughly $1.4 million USD at the time of the purchase. This isn’t Remixpoint’s first rodeo with Bitcoin. The company has been accumulating BTC over time. This latest buy boosts their total Corporate Bitcoin Holdings substantially. Before this purchase, they already held a considerable amount, and adding 13.3 BTC brings their total stash to approximately 1,051.56 BTC. Why is this significant? Well, for starters: It shows continued confidence from Remixpoint in Bitcoin as a treasury asset. It represents a tangible increase in their exposure to the cryptocurrency market. It highlights a trend of Japanese companies exploring digital asset investments. While 13.3 BTC might seem modest compared to the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, it’s a substantial amount for a company like Remixpoint and adds to their already existing significant position. Why Are Companies Building Corporate Bitcoin Holdings ? Remixpoint isn’t alone in deciding to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. A growing number of companies globally are exploring or actively accumulating digital assets. The reasons are varied but often include: 1. Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and potential currency devaluation, Bitcoin is seen by some as a scarce asset similar to digital gold, offering a hedge against inflation. 2. Treasury Reserve Diversification: Moving a portion of corporate reserves into Bitcoin diversifies away from traditional cash holdings, which can lose value over time, especially in low-interest-rate environments. 3. Potential for Appreciation: Companies are attracted to Bitcoin’s historical performance and potential for significant price increases, aiming to grow their treasury value. 4. Market Signal: Holding Bitcoin can signal innovation and forward-thinking to investors, customers, and employees, particularly for tech-focused or younger companies. 5. Adoption and Integration: For companies involved in the crypto space (like Remixpoint, which also operates a crypto exchange), holding Bitcoin aligns with their core business and facilitates operations. Is Japan Bitcoin Adoption Picking Up Among Corporations? Japan has a unique relationship with cryptocurrency. It was one of the first countries to recognize Bitcoin as legal property. While retail adoption has been strong, corporate adoption, outside of crypto-native companies, has been slower compared to North America. However, Remixpoint’s repeated BTC Acquisition suggests this might be changing. Other Japanese firms have also shown interest: Some financial institutions are exploring stablecoins and blockchain technology. Gaming companies are integrating NFTs and crypto into their platforms. Investment firms are launching crypto funds. Remixpoint, with its roots in energy and business solutions but also a strong presence in the crypto exchange space via its subsidiary BITPoint, is perhaps uniquely positioned to bridge these worlds. Their continued investment in Bitcoin could encourage other Japanese companies to consider similar moves, potentially boosting Institutional Bitcoin interest in the region. Understanding the Challenges of Institutional Bitcoin Investment While the potential benefits are clear, companies holding Bitcoin also face challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is known for significant swings, which can impact a company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings reports. Regulation: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, creating uncertainty for corporate holders. Accounting Rules: Accounting for volatile digital assets like Bitcoin can be complex, often requiring companies to record impairment losses if the price drops below their cost basis, even if they haven’t sold the asset. Security: Safely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to protect against hacks and theft. Remixpoint’s decision to increase its holdings indicates they believe the potential benefits outweigh these risks, or that they have robust strategies in place to manage them. What Does This Mean for the Market? Each corporate purchase, especially from a publicly listed company like Remixpoint, adds to the overall demand for Bitcoin. While 13.3 BTC isn’t enough to single-handedly move the market, the cumulative effect of multiple companies making similar decisions contributes to price support and can be seen as a bullish signal for long-term price action. More importantly, it normalizes the idea of holding crypto assets for traditional businesses, paving the way for broader Institutional Bitcoin adoption in the future. Looking Ahead Remixpoint’s latest BTC Acquisition is a clear statement of intent. As more companies globally and in Japan evaluate their treasury strategies in the face of economic uncertainty and technological shifts, moves like this from Remixpoint could become more common. The trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings appears to be solidifying, even if the pace varies by region and industry. It will be interesting to watch if other Japanese firms follow Remixpoint’s lead and how this growing corporate interest impacts the Japan Bitcoin market and the global crypto landscape. Conclusion Remixpoint’s decision to acquire an additional 13.3 BTC for $1.4 million is more than just a transaction; it’s a reinforcement of their commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Bringing their total holdings to over 1,050 BTC, the Japanese firm joins a growing list of companies diversifying into digital assets. This move highlights the increasing trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings , driven by factors like inflation hedging and diversification, while also navigating challenges like volatility and regulation. As Institutional Bitcoin adoption continues to evolve, Remixpoint’s actions serve as a notable example within the Japan Bitcoin market and the broader global crypto space, signaling confidence in the long-term value of BTC.

2025-06-16T17:36:06,"Expert Picks for Best Presale Crypto Sites in June 2025: Nexchain, BTC Bull, & BlockDAG","The crypto presale market is booming in 2025, offering investors some of the most exciting new crypto token presales. With multiple projects gaining traction, savvy investors are carefully selecting the best crypto presale to buy right now. Among the top crypto presales, Nexchain stands out with its AI-powered platform, while BTC Bull and BlockDAG also offer unique investment opportunities. As the market grows, these presale crypto projects are drawing strong attention from both retail and institutional investors looking for long-term gains. Nexchain’s AI Advantage Reshaping the Crypto Presale Market Nexchain isn’t just another crypto presale project. It’s a fully functional AI-powered blockchain ecosystem designed to revolutionize Web3. Its NEX AI brings powerful automation and learning capabilities across multiple industries, making the platform highly adaptable for real-world use cases. Whether it’s finance, healthcare, or supply chain, Nexchain provides scalable solutions that traditional blockchains struggle to offer. This combination of AI integration, hybrid consensus, and smart contract innovation is why Nexchain is becoming one of the best crypto presale tokens in 2025. With each presale stage, the token price increases, giving early adopters an edge before its public launch. Nexchain is firmly positioned on the crypto presale list as a top choice for investors looking to buy presale crypto with strong fundamentals. BTC Bull Token Gaining Fast Momentum BTC Bull Token is a presale project designed to piggyback off Bitcoin’s success, but in a way that feels both timely and cleverly engineered. It has already raised more than $7 million, and with presale prices set to rise once the $8 million threshold is crossed, early adopters are positioning now. The concept is simple but compelling. BTC Bull Token is building the first official mascot for Bitcoin’s bull market narrative, complete with a capped 21 million token supply to mirror Bitcoin’s own scarcity model, but this is more than branding. The project has introduced a milestone-based reward system where every $25,000 increase in Bitcoin’s price triggers one of two events: either a token burn to reduce the circulating supply or a Bitcoin airdrop directly to holders. BlockDAG’s Explosive Growth Ahead of Exchange Listings BlockDAG is leading the charge in June 2025 as the best crypto to buy 2025, blending innovation with real-world accessibility.

Its live testnet and no-code dApp builder are drawing attention from builders and enterprises alike, while its user base continues to swell thanks to the X1 mobile miner app. With over 1.5 million users mining BDAG daily via smartphones, BlockDAG has become a viral success, democratizing access to crypto rewards without energy-intensive setups. The numbers tell a compelling story: $294.3.5 million raised, 22.3 billion coins sold, and a limited-time $0.0018 price point ahead of a $0.05 listing. That’s a 2,660% ROI window that has traders rushing in. As its June 13 Go Live Reveal prepares to unveil 20 exchange listings, BlockDAG isn’t just promising growth, it’s executing it. Among the altcoin crowd, BlockDAG stands out as the best crypto to buy in 2025 based on fundamentals, traction, and momentum. Final Words: Nexchain Dominates The Top Crypto Presale List In today’s highly competitive token presales, Nexchain separates itself with real utility, AI-powered technology, and impressive fundraising success. As investors search for the best crypto presale to buy right now, Nexchain continues to top the crypto presale list with its strong fundamentals and 429% ROI potential.

The Canada-regulated firm announced on Monday, June 16 that it had secured the final approval for its Purpose XRP ETF prospectus. With this approval Purpose can now unveil its Ripple ( XRP ) ETF for public trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange, a milestone that will see the asset manager launch the fund under the ticker XRPP. “The OSC’s granting of a receipt for the Purpose XRP ETF prospectus reinforces Canada’s global leadership in building a regulated digital asset ecosystem,” said Vlad Tasevski, chief innovation officer at Purpose Investments. According to the announcement, the spot XRP ETF will go live on the TSX on Wednesday, June 18, 2025. The fund will offer direct exposure to spot XRP, with availability in Canadian dollars, CAD-hedged under the ticker XRPP and CAD non-hedged under XRPP.B. Investors can also access U.S. dollar units under the ticker XRPP.U. Users will be able to hold the ETFs in registered accounts, including Tax-Free Savings Accounts and Registered Retirement Savings Plans, both widely used savings tools in Canada .

However, the regulator has yet to greenlight any other altcoin-related exchange-traded fund.

2025-06-16T17:30:17,"Davis Commodities seizes $16t opportunity with Bitcoin & RWA tokenization bet","With RWA tokenization projected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, Davis Commodities’ multimillion-dollar agricultural tokenization push positions it as a first mover in digitizing sugar, rice, and edible oils, while simultaneously building a Bitcoin war chest. According to a June 16 press release , Nasdaq-listed agricultural trader Davis Commodities (DTCK) is transforming its business model by integrating Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserves and real-world tokenization, positioning itself at the center of a rapidly digitizing global trade ecosystem. The dual-pronged strategy, funded by a newly approved $30 million capital raise, will see the Singapore-based company deploy nearly two-thirds of the funds toward building Bitcoin reserves and launching RWA tokenization projects focused on staples such as sugar, rice, and edible oils. For a company moving physical crops across 20 countries, the initiative signals a fundamental rethinking of how agricultural value can be stored, traded, and leveraged in the blockchain era. You might also like: Nasdaq-listed SRM eyes $100m TRX for TRON treasury strategy The Bitcoin hedge and tokenization playbook Davis Commodities’ bold strategy begins with BTC, which the company is treating not as a speculative asset but as a long-term strategic reserve. It plans to allocate $4.5 million (15% of the raise) to Bitcoin initially, scaling up to 40 percent ($12 million total) as market conditions evolve. Bitcoin’s near 150% surge in 2023 and nearly 120% rally in 2024 proved its merit as both a macro hedge and high-growth asset, a duality that appeals to a traditional commodities trader navigating volatile forex markets and inflationary pressures. But the real disruption lies in the other half of Davis’s strategy: $15 million earmarked for tokenizing real-world agricultural assets. By issuing blockchain-based digital twins of physical sugar, rice, and edible oil inventories, Davis could unlock liquidity trapped in warehouse receipts and streamline cross-border settlements, reducing days-long delays to near-instant transactions. The potential upside is significant. Industry analysts project RWA tokenization to grow into a $16 trillion market by 2030, and early estimates suggest Davis’s tokenized agri-portfolio alone could generate $50 million in annual revenue within two years. For context, that’s more than double the company’s entire 2024 net income. “By integrating Bitcoin reserves and RWA tokenization, we are not only strengthening our position as a leading agricultural trader but also embracing the vast opportunities at the convergence of traditional commodities and digital assets. This strategy is designed to deliver sustainable growth, enhance investor returns, and ensure we remain at the forefront of innovation in global trade,” the company’s CEO said. According to the statement, Davis Commodities will use the remaining 10 percent of the funds to advance its technology infrastructure, bolster security measures, and foster strategic partnerships.

New rules apply to self-custodied and offshore crypto, with quarterly tax reporting. Lawmakers propose Bitcoin reserves and crypto-based payroll for foreign workers. Brazil has eliminated its long-standing tax break on cryptocurrency profits, introducing a flat 17.5% capital gains tax on all digital asset transactions. The measure, enacted through Provisional Measure 1303, took effect on June 12 and marks a significant shift in the country’s approach to crypto taxation. Previously, Brazilian taxpayers were exempt from capital gains tax on crypto sales totalling up to 35,000 Brazilian reais (approximately $6,300) per month. Gains exceeding this value were taxed progressively, with rates ranging from 15% to 22.5%, depending on the volume of the transactions. This structure allowed smaller investors to operate tax-free and subjected large-scale traders to higher tax rates.

While Bitcoin’s long-term reliability and institutional backing continue to attract conservative buyers, the exponential upside of Ozak AI is turning heads amongst early adopters and high-risk takers. Bitcoin: The King Still Has Room to Run Bitcoin has remained the most trusted and broadly followed cryptocurrency for over a decade. Following previous halving cycles, BTC has proven parabolic growth—something bulls expect to copy in 2025. Factors like developing institutional demand, global economic uncertainty, and limited supply are pushing price predictions as high as $250,000. From its present price range, Bitcoin would need to climb roughly 3-4x to reach this milestone. That’s a solid go back for a large-cap asset with a $1 trillion market cap, mainly for investors in search of stability and long-term period boom. However, the sheer size of Bitcoin makes a 100x or 200x pass highly improbable, proscribing its upside in comparison to smaller-cap options. Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin Ozak AI: A Micro-Cap with Massive Potential Ozak AI offers a unique investment narrative. Priced at just $0.005 and backed by over $1.2 million raised in presale funding, Ozak AI is not just another speculative altcoin—it’s a project with real-world AI utility. Its mission is to reshape financial analytics using machine learning and blockchain technology. Key components of Ozak AI include: Ozak Stream Network (OSN): Delivers real-time market insights to users Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN): Enables off-chain data integration Ozak Data Vaults: Provide secure, decentralized storage for financial information Prediction Agents: AI-powered assistants that help investors make data-backed decisions Ozak AI’s potential to surge to $1 from its current Ozak AI presale price translates into a 200x ROI, dwarfing Bitcoin’s expected gains. With listings already confirmed on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko , Ozak AI is building momentum before hitting centralized exchanges—making now a strategic time to enter. The battle between Bitcoin and Ozak AI is essentially a debate between safety vs. opportunity. Bitcoin is established, secure, and globally recognized, making it a great choice for conservative investors. However, its limited upside compared to small caps like Ozak AI may not satisfy those looking for explosive growth. Ozak AI, while inherently riskier as a new project, offers asymmetric upside potential. Its integration of AI with decentralized infrastructure puts it in a fast-growing niche, and its tiny market cap means even moderate adoption could send prices soaring. Both Bitcoin and Ozak AI are compelling in their own right. Bitcoin may reach $250K and deliver consistent returns for long-term holders, but Ozak AI’s $1 target offers one of the most attractive ROI opportunities in the current market. For investors willing to accept higher risk in exchange for high-reward potential, Ozak AI might just be the breakout star of 2025. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.
