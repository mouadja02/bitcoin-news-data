MemeStrategy bought 2,440 SOL tokens, worth about HKD 2.9 million (around USD 370,000), using OSL Group, a government-approved crypto platform. This shows MemeStrategy is serious about getting into the crypto space and signals a big step forward for Hong Kong’s crypto scene, too.

Similar to U.S.-listed firms like Upexi Inc. and Classover, MemeStrategy is adding Solana to its reserves. While the investment amount is modest, it shows increasing trust in alternative blockchain ecosystems like Solana. The platform’s proof-of-stake model, offering staking rewards and fast transaction speeds, makes it an attractive option for companies looking to integrate blockchain technology. Hong Kong Strengthens Its Crypto Credentials The transaction is seen as a major strategic move by MemeStrategy. It was carried out via OSL, the first platform licensed under Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) virtual asset trading framework. This underscores Hong Kong’s ambition to become a regulated hub for digital assets, setting itself apart from China’s strict crypto stance. Moving on, OSL also emphasized that this move marks its expansion into assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, signaling a shift in institutional interest toward emerging ecosystems like Solana. As more regulated players enter the space, the infrastructure for corporate adoption in Asia continues to strengthen. A Gateway to Asia’s Crypto Future? With MemeStrategy stepping into Solana, Hong Kong could be setting the stage for institutional crypto adoption in Asia. While companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla led the way with big Bitcoin bets in the West, Asia is taking a more regulated and diversified approach. By embracing platforms like Solana through licensed channels, Hong Kong is signaling that it’s ready to support the next wave of global crypto adoption, one that reaches beyond just Bitcoin.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/hong-kongs-memestrategy-adds-2440-solana-and-1-bitcoin-to-its-crypto-treasury/,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL","News|Fintech Company",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T10:50:14,"Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Soar Past 10,000 BTC Milestone","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Soar Past 10,000 BTC Milestone Big news shaking up the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets! Metaplanet, a publicly listed company based in Japan, has just announced a significant milestone in its ambitious Bitcoin strategy. They’ve officially crossed the 10,000 BTC mark, solidifying their position as a major player in the world of institutional Bitcoin adoption, particularly within the Japanese market. For those following the space, Metaplanet has become synonymous with a bold Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This latest announcement, shared via their official X account, confirms the purchase of an additional 1,112 BTC. This single transaction dramatically boosts their total holdings, placing them firmly in the ranks of companies making substantial BTC investment commitments. Metaplanet Bitcoin: How Did They Reach 10,000 BTC? Reaching 10,000 BTC isn’t a small feat for any company, let alone one pivoting its core strategy around digital assets. Metaplanet’s journey to this impressive figure has been marked by consistent, strategic purchases. The latest acquisition of 1,112 BTC is a crucial step, but it’s part of a larger, ongoing plan for Bitcoin accumulation. Here’s a look at some key aspects of their approach: Consistent Strategy: Metaplanet hasn’t made just one or two purchases; they’ve demonstrated a pattern of regular Bitcoin accumulation, signalling a long-term view rather than speculative trading. Transparency: They’ve been relatively open about their Bitcoin strategy and holdings, which builds confidence among investors interested in their unique corporate treasury approach. Dedicated Funding: Unlike some companies that might allocate a small percentage of existing reserves, Metaplanet has actively sought dedicated funding mechanisms specifically for acquiring Bitcoin. This dedication highlights their conviction in Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset and a hedge against macroeconomic factors like currency devaluation and inflation. Funding This Massive BTC Investment: The Bond Strategy Explained One of the most interesting aspects of Metaplanet’s strategy is how they fund their Bitcoin accumulation. The latest purchase, and presumably future ones, are being financed through a significant issuance of bonds. Specifically, they recently decided to issue $210 million in 0% ordinary bonds. Let’s break down why this is noteworthy: Zero Percent Interest: Issuing bonds with a 0% interest rate is highly advantageous for the company. It means they can borrow a substantial amount of capital without the burden of regular interest payments, freeing up cash flow. Capital Allocation: The explicit purpose of these bonds is to fund further Bitcoin accumulation. This clearly signals to the market that the company is leveraging debt specifically to increase its exposure to BTC. Balance Sheet Strategy: By issuing debt to acquire Bitcoin, Metaplanet is essentially transforming liabilities (the bonds) into an asset (Bitcoin) on their balance sheet. The bet is that the appreciation of Bitcoin will significantly outweigh the principal amount of the bonds when they eventually need to be repaid. This strategy isn’t without risks, primarily tied to Bitcoin’s price volatility. However, it demonstrates a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and represents a creative approach to corporate treasury management in the digital age. Japan Bitcoin Scene: Metaplanet Leading Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s moves are particularly significant within the context of the Japan Bitcoin market. While institutional adoption has been gaining traction globally, Japan has sometimes been perceived as more cautious or slower to adopt compared to regions like North America. Metaplanet is changing that narrative. As a publicly listed Japanese company openly pursuing a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy, they are acting as a pioneer. Their actions could pave the way for other Japanese corporations to consider similar strategies. What makes their position in the Japan Bitcoin market stand out? Public Profile: Being a listed company means their actions are visible and subject to public scrutiny, potentially influencing perceptions of Bitcoin among other businesses and investors in Japan. Regulatory Navigation: Successfully operating and executing a Bitcoin strategy within Japan’s regulatory framework provides a potential blueprint or case study for others. Local Impact: Increased institutional interest from domestic companies like Metaplanet can contribute to the growth and maturity of the local crypto ecosystem. While companies like MicroStrategy are larger in scale globally, Metaplanet’s role as a domestic leader in Japan’s institutional Bitcoin space is crucial for the regional adoption narrative. The Journey of Bitcoin Accumulation: Metaplanet’s Milestones Reaching 10,000 BTC is a major milestone, but it’s the result of a consistent journey of Bitcoin accumulation. Metaplanet began publicly announcing its Bitcoin strategy and purchases in 2024, quickly accumulating significant amounts. Here’s a simplified look at their rapid accumulation journey (approximate figures based on public announcements): Date (Approx.) Purchase Amount (BTC) Cumulative Holdings (BTC) May 2024 ~117.7 ~117.7 June 2024 (Early) ~250 ~367.7 June 2024 (Mid) ~23.3 ~391 June 2024 (Late) ~500 ~891 June/July 2024 ~1,112 ~2,003 July 2024 ~1,112 (Latest) 10,000 (Total after multiple purchases) Note: The path to 10,000 BTC involved multiple purchases not all detailed here, but the table illustrates the acceleration of their Bitcoin accumulation efforts. The latest 1,112 BTC purchase specifically took them over the 10k threshold from a previous figure (which wasn’t explicitly 8888 BTC, but the cumulative total reached 10k with this latest buy). This aggressive accumulation strategy underscores their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential and its role as a store of value. What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Globally? Metaplanet’s success in reaching 10,000 BTC isn’t just a win for the company; it’s a significant data point for the broader narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Every time a publicly traded company successfully integrates Bitcoin into its treasury strategy, it adds legitimacy to the asset class. Here’s why this matters globally: Validation: It provides further validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate, investable asset class for corporate treasuries, not just speculative investors. Case Study: Metaplanet serves as a case study for other companies, particularly in Asia, demonstrating that it’s possible to navigate the complexities and regulatory landscape to implement a significant BTC investment strategy. Increased Demand: Institutional buying creates consistent demand for Bitcoin, which can have positive implications for its price and market stability over the long term. Diversification Trend: While Metaplanet is focusing heavily on BTC, their move is part of a larger trend where companies are exploring alternatives to traditional cash holdings, especially in environments of inflation or currency concerns. Metaplanet’s journey from announcing its Bitcoin strategy to accumulating 10,000 BTC in a relatively short period is a powerful example of how quickly institutional sentiment can shift and translate into tangible Bitcoin accumulation. Benefits and Potential Challenges of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet Taking a significant position in Bitcoin like Metaplanet has done comes with potential upsides and inherent risks. Potential Benefits: Upside Potential: If Bitcoin’s price continues to appreciate over the long term, Metaplanet’s treasury holdings could see substantial growth, potentially exceeding the value of their traditional business operations. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. For a Japanese company, this could be particularly relevant given economic conditions and currency fluctuations. Investor Attraction: This strategy can attract a new class of investors who are specifically looking for exposure to Bitcoin through traditional equity markets. First-Mover Advantage (in Japan): Being one of the first major publicly traded companies in Japan to adopt this strategy gives them a unique position. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings. A sharp downturn could negatively impact Metaplanet’s balance sheet and potentially its stock price. Regulatory Risk: While they are operating within current regulations, future changes in crypto regulations in Japan or globally could pose challenges. Market Perception: Some traditional investors might view the strategy as overly risky or speculative, potentially limiting their investor base. Execution Risk: Managing a large amount of Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Metaplanet’s leadership has clearly weighed these factors and decided that the potential benefits of being a Bitcoin-centric company outweigh the risks, especially over a long investment horizon. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors learn from Metaplanet’s bold move and significant BTC investment? While retail investors don’t have the same tools (like issuing 0% bonds), the core principles behind Metaplanet’s strategy offer valuable lessons: Conviction in the Asset: Metaplanet’s actions demonstrate strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For individual investors, this highlights the importance of doing your own research and developing conviction in your investment choices. Long-Term Perspective: Accumulating 10,000 BTC is not a short-term trade. It’s a long-term treasury strategy. This reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is often best approached with a multi-year investment horizon to potentially ride out volatility. Understanding Macro Trends: Metaplanet’s move is partly driven by macroeconomic factors (currency, inflation). Understanding how global economics might influence asset classes like Bitcoin is crucial for informed investment decisions. Strategic Allocation: While most individuals won’t put *all* their assets into Bitcoin, Metaplanet’s strategy prompts thought about how digital assets might fit into a broader, diversified portfolio, depending on individual risk tolerance and goals. Metaplanet’s journey is a powerful example of a company adapting to a changing financial landscape and placing a significant bet on the future of digital assets. In conclusion, Metaplanet reaching the 10,000 BTC milestone is a landmark event, particularly for the Japan Bitcoin ecosystem. It underscores the increasing pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption and showcases a creative, debt-financed approach to Bitcoin accumulation. As Metaplanet continues its journey, the market will be watching closely to see how this pioneering strategy unfolds and influences the broader corporate world’s view of Bitcoin as a treasury asset.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out.

Early in the month, LINK began recovering from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a key neckline at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has struggled to sustain its position near this neckline, pulling back toward the support level of the rounded bottom by mid-June. This rounded bottom support also aligns with the LINK crypto’s multi-year support zone near $13. The continuation of this short-term price advance would require a break and a daily close above the $18 neckline. As this could indicate a potential upward move, with LINK targeting a retest of the $24 resistance level in June, an area supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. Should LINK break past the $24 mark, forecasts for late 2025 suggest the token could climb as high as $32.

Key Takeaways: Digital asset funds saw $1.9 billion in weekly inflows, pushing YTD totals to a record $13.2 billion. Bitcoin and Ethereum led inflows with $1.3 billion and $583 million. US investors drove most of the inflows, signaling strong institutional demand. The inflows mark the ninth consecutive week of gains and bring year-to-date inflows to a record $13.2 billion, according to a Monday report by CoinShares . Bitcoin led the charge with $1.3 billion in inflows, bouncing back after two weeks of minor outflows. Short Bitcoin Products See $3.7M Inflows, But AUM Remains Small Short-bitcoin products also attracted $3.7 million, though assets under management remain modest at $96 million. Ethereum recorded its strongest week since February, bringing in $583 million. The move included its largest single-day inflow in four months and brings ETH’s recent run to $2 billion, equivalent to 14% of its total assets under management. Regional participation remained concentrated in the U.S., which accounted for nearly all of last week’s inflows. Switzerland, Germany, and Canada followed with more moderate contributions. Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Brazil saw outflows of $56.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Elsewhere, XRP snapped a three-week losing streak with $11.8 million in inflows, while Sui products continued to attract interest with $3.5 million. The latest data suggests that institutional appetite for digital assets remains intact, even as traditional markets face macro uncertainty. BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Fastest ETF to Reach $70B in Assets BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the fastest ETF in history to reach $70 billion in assets, doing so just 341 days after launch, five times faster than the previous record-holder, the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). Among the 12 Bitcoin ETFs on the market, IBIT stands out as the dominant leader, far ahead of Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC, which each manage about $20 billion.

By November, it had already surpassed BlackRock’s own gold ETF in size, and in December, it became the fastest ETF to hit $50 billion in assets. Analysts have described IBIT’s rise as unmatched across any asset class or ETF type. Meanwhile, seven major asset managers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck, submitted new or amended filings for spot Solana ETFs with the SEC on June 13. The filings mark the largest coordinated push for Solana-based investment products to date, with notable entries from 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the excitement, analysts caution that approval may take time. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart pointed to the long road taken by Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting that the inclusion of staking language in all filings could complicate SEC approval. Staking was absent from earlier BTC and ETH ETF approvals, and the SEC has yet to greenlight staking in any fund.

Based on reports from CoinGecko, Ether is up 5% in the last 14 days and 5.4% over the past month. It’s trading around $2,625 almost 45% below its all‑time high. The slow grind suggests neither buyers nor sellers have full conviction. Still, big holders continue to stack coins, waiting for the next catalyst. Rising Activity On Layer 2 And Services On‑chain data shows whales directing attention to specific services. Transaction volume in Ethereum Name Service jumped over 300% in the second week of July. Lending protocols on Ethereum saw a more than 200% rise. Meanwhile, transfers of USDC on layer 2 networks—Base, Arbitrum and Optimism—all posted triple‑digit gains. These numbers point to growing use of scaling layers and services beyond simple trading. Spot ETF Inflows Update Institutional interest has been strong too. US spot Ether products saw inflows for 19 straight days before a small pullback. That streak brought in $1.37 billion, mostly into BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. On the day the run ended, the funds recorded just a little over $2 million in outflows. It’s a minor wobble in what has so far been a solid embrace of Ether by big financial firms.

The zero-interest bonds, part of Metaplanet’s 18th series of ordinary bond offerings, will mature in December. According to a regulatory filing, the proceeds from the bond sale are intended for Bitcoin purchases, although it remains unclear whether the latest 1,112 BTC acquisition occurred before or after the bond issuance was finalized.

Metaplanet first began accumulating Bitcoin in April 2024 and has since emerged as one of the most aggressive institutional buyers in the market. With this latest move, Metaplanet has overtaken Coinbase Global on the list of top public holders of Bitcoin. Coinbase holding 9,267 BTC, now trailing Metaplanet’s 10,000 BTC, according to data from Bitbo. The company’s stock reacted sharply to the news. Shares of Metaplanet surged more than 17% to 1,769 yen on Monday morning in Tokyo, according to Yahoo Finance data . Since the start of the year, its stock has risen over 408%, reflecting investor enthusiasm around its Bitcoin-heavy strategy. A key indicator Metaplanet tracks is its bitcoin yield, the percentage change in the ratio of total BTC holdings to fully diluted shares outstanding. According to the firm’s internal figures, this metric has posted strong quarterly growth, with yields reaching 309.8% in Q4 2024 and 87.2% so far in Q2 2025.

2025-06-16T10:26:28,"3 U.S. Economic Data Reports That Could Impact Bitcoin Price This Week","The post 3 U.S. Economic Data Reports That Could Impact Bitcoin Price This Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News This week could be a turning point for crypto markets – not because of a new ETF or token hype, but thanks to three major U.S. economic updates that could shake up the Fed’s next move. With retail sales, jobless claims, and the FOMC rate decision all dropping within days, Bitcoin traders are watching the macro landscape closely. If signs of a slowing economy get louder, rate-cut bets go up and that’s usually good news for Bitcoin. Let’s look at what’s coming. Retail Sales Dip Could Spark Talk of Rate Cuts Retail sales data is due this week, and economists aren’t optimistic. They expect a 0.6% drop from April to May, signaling that U.S. consumers may be pulling back. That matters more than it sounds. Consumer spending drives about 70% of the U.S. economy, and if it’s losing steam, it strengthens the case for the Fed to cut interest rates sooner rather than later. Some of the slowdown may be tied to renewed uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs. But for Bitcoin, the takeaway is simple: weaker sales = higher chance of rate cuts = potential BTC boost. On the flip side, if retail sales come in stronger than expected, the dollar could gain and Bitcoin might take a hit short term. Jobless Claims Rise, and That’s a Crypto Signal Too Also on the calendar: initial jobless claims, moved to Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday. Economists expect a rise to 250,000, up from 248,000 last week – already the highest since October. It may seem like a small shift, but for markets, it’s a big signal. A rising number of people filing for unemployment shows that the labor market is starting to crack and that puts pressure on the Fed to pivot. As one analyst wrote, “The labor market is CRACKING… Weakness = Fed pivot = crypto moon.” That sentiment is picking up across the board. All Eyes on the Fed Rate Decision The big one is Wednesday’s FOMC meeting. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s a 96.7% chance the Fed will keep rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. No surprises expected, but if one does come, it could move markets fast. The other wildcard? Trump. He’s been vocal about pushing the Fed to act faster. After last week’s CPI data, he posted : “Fed should lower one full point. Would pay much less interest on debt coming due. So important.” The market still expects cuts to start in September. But if the Fed blinks early, Bitcoin could rally hard. Lower rates make non-yielding assets like crypto more attractive. Bitcoin Already on the Move Bitcoin is already showing some signs of action. It’s up nearly 1% in the past few hours, trading at $106,576 at the time of writing. It’s a subtle move, but traders know what’s coming. If this week’s economic data confirms a slowdown, and the Fed hints at a shift, we could be looking at a strong move from BTC. In short: the macro signals are lining up. And in crypto, that’s when the big moves tend to happen.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/3-u-s-economic-data-reports-that-could-impact-bitcoin-price-this-week/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-16T10:20:56,"Urgent Warning: VanEck Advises Bitcoin Treasury Companies to Protect Against Shareholder Dilution","BitcoinWorld Urgent Warning: VanEck Advises Bitcoin Treasury Companies to Protect Against Shareholder Dilution In the dynamic world where traditional corporate finance meets the cutting edge of digital assets, a critical piece of advice has emerged for Bitcoin treasury companies . These firms, holding significant amounts of BTC on their balance sheets, face unique challenges as their stock performance intertwines with the volatile price of Bitcoin. Understanding the potential pitfalls and implementing smart strategies is paramount for safeguarding value. Why Bitcoin Treasury Companies Face Unique Challenges Companies that have added Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries have done so for various reasons, including a hedge against inflation, a store of value, or simply belief in the asset’s future potential. However, this also ties their stock valuation closely to Bitcoin’s price movements. While many such companies have traded at a premium to their Net Asset Value (NAV) – essentially, the value of their underlying assets per share – this isn’t a guarantee. The market’s perception, operational performance, and overall crypto sentiment can cause this premium to shrink, or even turn into a discount. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck , a prominent investment management firm, recently highlighted a developing situation on X (formerly Twitter). He pointed out that while no public company holding substantial Bitcoin has consistently traded below its NAV, at least one is now seeing its stock price approach that critical level. This signals a potential inflection point where financial strategies become crucial. Understanding Net Asset Value (NAV) in this Context For a company whose primary asset is Bitcoin, the Net Asset Value per share is roughly calculated by taking the total market value of their Bitcoin holdings plus other assets, subtracting liabilities, and dividing by the number of outstanding shares. When a company’s stock trades significantly above its NAV, investors are essentially paying a premium for exposure to Bitcoin through that company, often due to management expertise, operational business, or market sentiment. However, when the stock price gets close to or dips below the NAV, it suggests the market values the company less than the sum of its parts, specifically its Bitcoin holdings. This situation presents risks, particularly when the company needs to raise capital. The Risk of Shareholder Dilution Through ATM Offerings One common method for public companies to raise funds is through At-The-Market (ATM) offerings. This allows a company to sell new shares into the open market gradually at prevailing prices. For Bitcoin treasury companies, ATM offerings have sometimes been used to raise capital specifically to buy more Bitcoin, aiming to increase their BTC holdings and potentially boost future value. However, Mr. Sigel’s warning centers on the danger of executing ATM offerings when the stock price is trading too close to or below NAV. Issuing new shares at such a price means that existing shareholders’ ownership stake is diluted at a value that doesn’t fully reflect the underlying asset value. In essence, you’re selling a dollar’s worth of assets (via the share price) for less than a dollar. This shareholder dilution can erode the value held by existing investors, counteracting the potential benefits of acquiring more Bitcoin, especially if the new capital isn’t deployed effectively or if the discount to NAV persists or worsens. VanEck’s Actionable Advice: Strategies to Prevent Dilution To navigate this tricky situation and protect shareholder interests, VanEck offers several concrete recommendations for Bitcoin treasury companies : Halt ATM Sales Near NAV: A primary piece of advice is to stop issuing new shares through ATM offerings if the stock price trades consistently below a certain threshold relative to NAV. Sigel suggested a benchmark, such as trading below 0.95 times NAV for 10 consecutive days, as a trigger to pause ATM sales. This prevents selling shares at a significant discount to the underlying asset value. Implement Share Buybacks Strategically: When Bitcoin’s price rises but the company’s stock underperforms (potentially widening a discount or failing to keep pace with NAV), companies should consider using available capital for share buybacks. Buying back shares when they are trading at a discount to NAV is accretive to the remaining shareholders’ value. It reduces the number of outstanding shares, meaning each remaining share represents a larger portion of the company’s assets, including its valuable Bitcoin holdings. Explore Strategic Options for Lingering Discounts: If a company’s stock consistently trades at a significant discount to its NAV over a prolonged period, more drastic measures might be necessary. Sigel suggests exploring strategic options like mergers or spinoffs. A merger with another entity might unlock value or provide operational synergies. A spinoff could potentially separate the Bitcoin treasury part from an operating business, allowing the market to value each component more appropriately. These options aim to resolve persistent undervaluation and maximize shareholder value. Why This Matters for Investors For investors holding stock in companies with significant Bitcoin treasuries, understanding the relationship between the stock price and NAV is crucial. A widening discount could signal undervaluation, but also potential issues with management strategy or market perception. Conversely, smart financial management, like strategic buybacks when the stock is undervalued relative to NAV, can be a positive sign. VanEck’s guidance underscores the importance of financial prudence even for companies bullish on digital assets. While accumulating Bitcoin is a core strategy for these firms, how they manage their capital structure and interact with the equity markets directly impacts shareholder returns, independent of Bitcoin’s price performance. Conclusion: Protecting Value in the Intersection of Crypto and Equity The advice from VanEck’s Matthew Sigel serves as a timely reminder for Bitcoin treasury companies . As stock prices fluctuate and potentially approach net asset value , the risk of shareholder dilution through methods like ATM offerings becomes more pronounced. By implementing disciplined financial strategies – knowing when to halt share sales, utilizing buybacks effectively, and being open to strategic changes if discounts persist – these companies can better protect and enhance value for their shareholders in the evolving landscape where corporate balance sheets meet digital assets.

Following the rise, Cardano ( ADA ) is now one of the most actively staked blockchain networks, according to a June 16 update on X by Cardano trading platform TapTools. Staking addresses are wallets that have locked up ADA to earn rewards and contribute to network security. A consistent rise often indicates longer-term user engagement. JUST IN: Cardano $ADA has surpassed 1.3 million staking addresses, highlighting its status as one of the world’s most actively staked blockchain networks. pic.twitter.com/HDUnJ8mmRH — TapTools (@TapTools) June 16, 2025 This rise follows Bitstamp’s May 28 decision to allow UK customers to stake ADA on its platform, making it easier for more people to join the process. Cardano’s developers have also been working on changes behind the scenes. To create a more adaptable and reliable system, on June 6, they unveiled plans to improve the network’s node structure. As part of the planned upgrades, the developers are looking at new reward models to support smaller stake pool operators and encourage broader participation .

On the derivatives side, Coinglass data show that volume decreased slightly to $870.21 million, but open interest increased 3.28% to $778.49 million. This combination indicates that traders are increasing their positions while awaiting the next move in the price. Looking at the daily chart, Cardano is starting to show signs of recovery after finding support near $0.61. It’s now trading just below its 20-day moving average, which sits around $0.675. This line has acted as a resistance level over the past few weeks. A clean break above it could open the way for a retest of the recent high near $0.73. Cardano price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The Bollinger Bands are starting to tighten slightly, which often comes before a larger price move. Currently, the price is sitting in the lower half of the band, suggesting some upward room if momentum picks up. The upper band is near $0.74, which lines up with last week’s top. With the relative strength index at 42, ADA has not yet entered overbought territory and could rise even higher if buyers return. As the RSI previously fell below 40, the recent rebound may indicate a short-term change in momentum. The price may revert to the $0.62–$0.61 range if it is rejected in the $0.675–$0.70 range. A break below that would be more bearish and could open the door to a deeper pullback. If ADA breaks out above the current resistance levels, there may be short-term upside potential, but for now, the trend is neutral.

2025-06-16T10:19:54,"Hyperliquid’s HYPE token breaks all-time high, eyes more gains ahead","HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid, hit a new all-time high of $44.69 on June 16 and appears poised for further gains after breaking out of multiple bullish technical setups. According to data from crypto.news, this latest high surpassed its previous record of $43.96 set just last week. Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) market capitalization rose to over $14.8 million, while daily trading volume climbed 25% compared to the previous day, reflecting continued interest and momentum among traders. The rally has been supported by significant growth in Hyperliquid’s Layer-1 ecosystem. Data from DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked on Hyperliquid has surged to $2.53 billion, marking an increase of over 80% in the past 30 days. Hyperliquid’s total stablecoin supply on its Layer-1 chain has also increased to $3.73 billion, up from $2 billion in January 2025. This growth underscores increased transactional activity and liquidity across its ecosystem, with stablecoins often serving as the backbone for decentralized trading and lending applications.

Over the past 30 days, it has processed over $246.8 billion in trading volume, nearly triple the combined volume of the other top-ten decentralized perpetual platforms. The exchange’s competitive edge is largely attributed to its high leverage offerings, allowing users to access up to 40x leverage, a feature that has attracted aggressive short-term traders. Further on-chain data shows whales have been increasingly accumulating HYPE tokens over the past few weeks. Hype price analysis From a technical standpoint, HYPE has confirmed multiple bullish breakout patterns on the 1-day USDT chart. On June 9, the token broke out of a bullish pennant formation, a continuation pattern that typically signals the resumption of an uptrend. HYPE 1-day price chart — June 16 | Source: crypto.news Following this, HYPE also rallied above a bull flag pattern that had developed over the past week, further validating bullish sentiment. Moreover, the token has breached a critical resistance zone at $35.13, which had previously marked the upper boundary of a long-term cup-and-handle pattern that began forming in December 2024. The breakout above this level represents a significant technical milestone, often viewed as a signal for sustained upward movement. Momentum indicators also support the bullish case with both the MACD and RSI lines trending higher on the 4-hour chart, suggesting strengthening upward momentum and increased buying pressure. HYPE MACD and RSI chart — June 16 | Source: crypto.news However, there are some risks. Notably, whales and long-term holders could be looking to lock in some gains, which is typical when an asset hits an all-time high. For instance, Onchain Lens reported that a whale who held a long position in HYPE is currently sitting on profits of over $13.7 million. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that Hyperliquid whales are tilting slightly bearish, with 51.09% of total positions and over 50.8% of margin currently allocated to shorts. This positioning may be indicative of short-term caution, as whales often hedge or reduce long exposure at key resistance levels to manage downside risk. While not necessarily a sign of a broader bearish reversal, it could contribute to short-term volatility. Therefore, if bullish momentum persists, the token could next target the psychological resistance level of $50, up 12.8% from the current price level. On the contrary, if whale activity intensifies on the sell side or if broader market sentiment weakens, a drop below the $35 support level would invalidate the current bullish outlook and potentially signal the start of a deeper correction.

2025-06-16T10:18:45,"Metaplanet Hits 10,000 BTC Mark Following $210M Bond-Backed Acquisition","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced the acquisition of an additional 1,112 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 10,000 BTC as part of its aggressive Bitcoin Treasury Operations strategy. The latest purchase was executed for approximately ¥16.883 billion or $117 million. Metaplanet’s 10,000 BTC Milestone This development closely follows the issuance of Metaplanet’s 18th Series of Ordinary Bonds, through which it raised $210 million from EVO FUND. The bonds, bearing zero interest and redeemable at face value by December 12, 2025, were explicitly designated for Bitcoin purchases. According to the company’s press release , the 10,000 BTC milestone was achieved through a series of strategic acquisitions funded by both equity and debt instruments, including multiple tranches of stock acquisition rights and a steady stream of zero-coupon bond issuances. This move also marks the completion of the firm’s “210 Million Plan,” under which EVO FUND was granted 210 million 0%-discount rights. Over the past year, Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, which happens to be an important performance indicator tracking BTC per fully diluted share, has soared. This reflected both increased Bitcoin holdings and shareholder accretion despite dilution. As of June 16, the BTC Yield stood at 87.2% quarter-to-date. The company recorded 3,526 BTC in BTC Gain for Q2 2025, translating to a ¥53.412 billion increase in Bitcoin value denominated in yen. With its BTC holdings now totaling 10,000, Metaplanet has overtaken Coinbase, which holds 9,267 BTC, based on figures reported by Bitbo. The scale and pace of its recent purchases position Metaplanet as one of Asia’s most prominent corporate holders of Bitcoin. The firm now aims to amass a total of 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Having already accumulated 10,000 BTC, it must secure the remaining 200,000 BTC within the upcoming 18 months. Companies Betting Big on BTC A growing number of public companies are integrating digital assets into their treasuries, with 117 firms now collectively holding over 800,000 BTC. The latest to join this trend is Mercurity Fintech Holding (MFH), which announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a dedicated BTC treasury reserve. The New York-based fintech firm plans to revamp its treasury operations by leveraging tokenized finance, with Bitcoin at the core of its strategy. MFH said that it will store its BTC using institutional-grade blockchain custody infrastructure and incorporate staking services and tokenized treasury tools to enhance yield and capital efficiency. In a similar move, Oslo-based crypto brokerage K33 has also begun holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet, after a $6.22 million raise through interest-free loans and new equity and warrant issuances.

On June 16, Swedish-listed H100 Group announced that it had signed a new investment agreement with Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, securing an initial convertible loan guarantee of 150 million SEK (approximately $15.82 million). The funds raised from this convertible loan will be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of H100 Group’s long-term Bitcoin asset allocation strategy. This comes on the heels of an earlier capital raise announced in late May, when H100 Group secured 21 million SEK (approximately $2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans. The funding round was also led by Adam Back, who invested $1.4 million, with additional contributions totaling $800,000 from investment firms including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners. H100’s latest raise reflects a broader trend among European firms turning to structured financing to fund Bitcoin accumulation. Earlier this month, The Blockchain Group, listed on Euronext Growth Paris, received shareholder approval to raise over €10 billion for Bitcoin purchases via a mix of bonds and equity issuances. You might also like: Swedish health tech firm H100 secures $2.2m via convertible loans to buy Bitcoin Several other European firms are also pursuing aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategies.

In April, U.K.-listed Abraxas Capital also made headlines with an acquisition of nearly 3,000 BTC, representing an investment of roughly $250 million. Meanwhile, analysts remain divided on the rise of corporate Bitcoin treasuries. While some see it as a forward-thinking financial strategy, others caution against the significant risks involved.

2025-06-16T10:16:32,"4 Hours Left as 2025’s Best Presale Attracts Over $500K Solaxy Whale Purchases in the Weekend","Solaxy ($SOLX) is 4 hours away from the end of its presale. With over $52M raised and over half a million dollars in whale purchases in the last two days, this train seems to be speeding through milestones. And in the crypto space, the trains you skip (like Solaxy , in this case) could just be the ones that drop you at the nearest Ferrari store. Based on our analysis of the project , $SOLX has both utility, community sentiment, and whale interest going for it, all of which promise an explosive future. We’ll also explain why crypto whales are scampering to buy $SOLX, and why you should probably follow the smart money and buy into the best crypto presale of 2025. What Is Solaxy? Solaxy is a new cryptocurrency project that has created a strong buzz among DeFi enthusiasts thanks to its real-world application and revolutionary utility. Right off the bat, the whitepaper makes it clear that the developers’ focus is on improving Solana: cranking up transaction efficiency and scalability, and reducing network congestion to zero. Solana is currently the second-biggest blockchain in terms of DeFi TVL – and arguably the best one for meme coins. Unfortunately, the network has been rife with congestion and failed transactions. Solana’s problems can be attributed to a sudden spike in investors after the success of some of the best meme coins , especially $TRUMP. A flood of new traders overloaded Solana, which then started causing frequent transaction delays (even total failures) and network congestion. What Is Solaxy’s Master Plan in Fixing These Issues? Solaxy plans to address Solana’s issues by building the first-ever Layer 2 solution on the network. The L2 will offload the mainnet’s transactions onto a sidechain, thereby relieving some of the pressure it’s constantly under due to the sheer volume of transaction requests. Additionally, Solaxy’s Layer 2 will also process transactions in batches, not one by one. Similar to how banks bulk transactions to increase speed and reduce costs, Solaxy will not only make Solana faster but also cheaper. Don’t Mistake Solaxy for just a Scaling Tool Though at first glance, Solaxy might come across as just a scaling solution for Solana, its recent Hyperlane collaboration elevates it to a true infrastructure player. Note that Hyperlane is a class-leading Web3 infrastructure project. With Hyperlane’s permissionless interoperability, Solaxy will be able to communicate with multiple blockchains, not just Solana. This will help Solaxy make bridging between Solana and Ethereum speedier, cheaper, and more seamless. dApps will be able to interact across blockchains, with users and developers on Solana being able to transfer crypto between Solana and Ethereum with unprecedented ease. Moreover, Solaxy can power high-frequency dApps as well. These include meme coin and microtransaction platforms, gaming ecosystem in need of real-time interactions, and custom-made financial applications that require better affordability and low latency. So in terms of real utility, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better altcoin this season (and whales are thinking the same thing , considering the current $52.6M raise). Hurry Up – $SOLX Presale Ends in Under 4 Hours Seeing as Solaxy could be at the heart of Solana’s newfound momentum ( +8% in the last day ), buying $SOLX would give you front-row seats to the project’s growing popularity and market adoption. The project is in the last hours of its presale, with a total investor raise of almost $53M at the time of writing. Solaxy has attracted over $500K in whale purchases in the last two days. These include transactions of $113K , $59K , and $58K . You can buy $SOLX right now for just $0.001764. But this early bird price will only be available for the next 4 hours, when the presale ends. Here’s the kicker: As per our Solaxy price prediction , the token can reach a whopping $0.20 by the end of 2026. This means that those who invest now can potentially walk away with over 11,200% ROI.

Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), met with Pakistani Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and the State Minister for Blockchain and Crypto, Bilal Bin Saqib, on Sunday to discuss the country’s evolving crypto strategy. According to local outlet Dawn, Saylor expressed support for Pakistan’s vision and welcomed the opportunity to serve as an adviser on digital asset policy. In a video posted on X by a Finance Ministry official, Saylor praised Pakistan’s talent and entrepreneurial potential. “Pakistan has many brilliant people and a lot of people do business with you,” he said, encouraging the government to leverage its strengths to become a leader in Bitcoin policy. He cited Strategy’s own journey— accumulating 582,000 BTC worth over $61 billion—as a model Pakistan could follow, highlighting how intellectual leadership attracts global capital. Pakistan Eyes Global South Leadership Pakistan has taken several steps in recent months to embrace the digital asset economy. Last month, it launched a national crypto authority to regulate the space, and Saqib confirmed plans to establish a Bitcoin reserve for the country. Saylor assured the ministers that the international market would support such a move if it sees confident and credible leadership. “The market gave us billions because they trust us,” Saylor told Aurangzeb and Saqib. “If the world trusts you and hears your words, the capital and the capability will flow to Pakistan.” He added that once leadership is recognized in a sector, global investors rally behind it. “I think they’ll do it to Pakistan,” he said. Saqib described the meeting as a “milestone” in Pakistan’s journey to become a Web3-ready and Bitcoin-friendly emerging economy. He emphasized the need for Pakistan to model itself on Strategy’s success, asking, “If private individuals can build that in the US, why can’t Pakistan, as a nation, do the same? We have the talent, the story, and the energy.” Crypto Council Advances Legal Framework On June 6, the Pakistan Crypto Council—a government-backed body formed in March and headed by Saqib—presented a draft of the country’s new crypto legal framework . The Finance Ministry has agreed to fast-track its approval. The council aims to shape progressive policies that enable innovation while safeguarding investor interests. As Pakistan sets its sights on leading the Global South in digital asset adoption, Saylor’s backing adds momentum to its ambitious plans.

2025-06-16T10:07:34,"Is XRP Ready for Global Adoption? Shocking Math Reveals the Truth","The post Is XRP Ready for Global Adoption? Shocking Math Reveals the Truth appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A viral analysis by X user Future XRP is catching serious attention in the crypto space. The claim? XRP could reach between $3,000 and $21,000—not based on hype, but on actual transaction data and an economic formula. The logic hinges on XRP Ledger’s transaction speed, circulating supply, and global utility potential. If XRP becomes the go-to settlement asset for trillions of dollars in payments, the price could skyrocket. Here’s a breakdown of the analysis and its implications for XRP’s future . How XRP’s Transaction Speed Could Boost Its Value The XRP Ledger is already one of the fastest blockchains, processing up to 1,500 transactions per second (TPS) in real-world conditions, with tests showing over 3,400 TPS. In theory, it could scale up to 10,000 TPS. The more frequently XRP is used to settle payments, the higher its velocity. Higher velocity means that fewer XRP are needed to move more money, increasing the value of each token. If XRP becomes the backbone for global payments, speed and usage will be critical drivers of its valuation. Why Circulating Supply Could Trigger a Supply Shock Although 100 billion XRP were created, many tokens are locked up in ETFs, institutional reserves , or long-term storage. This reduces the amount of XRP available in the open market. If supply is limited while demand grows, each token becomes more valuable. Future XRP highlights that less available XRP paired with higher usage means higher prices. The Formula Predicting XRP’s Future Price Future XRP uses the classic MV = PQ formula to calculate potential price levels. In this equation: M = XRP in circulation V = How often each XRP is used annually (velocity) P = Price of XRP Q = Total value of transactions XRP settles annually So, Price per XRP = Total Value Settled / (Circulating XRP * Velocity) Let’s explore three key scenarios. Scenario 1: High Speed, Low Supply TPS: 10,000 Circulating XRP: 20 billion Velocity: 15.8 times per year Settlement Volume: $1 quadrillion annually Predicted Price: $3,164.56 per XRP Scenario 2: High Speed, High Supply TPS: 10,000 Circulating XRP: 60 billion Velocity: 5.26 Predicted Price: $3,168.09 per XRP .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin Holds $105K as $1B in Longs Get Wiped Out , Scenario 3: Low Speed, High Supply TPS: 1,500 Circulating XRP: 60 billion Velocity: 0.79 Predicted Price: $21,097.04 per XRP This final case shows that if XRP is slower and less efficient, the price must rise dramatically to meet global demand. Can XRP Realistically Handle $1 Quadrillion in Payments? The global financial system processes anywhere from $500 trillion to $1 quadrillion each year. If XRP captures even 10 to 14 percent of this volume, the price must increase to support the scale of settlement. This means XRP’s future price depends not only on speculation but also on its actual utility, adoption, and velocity. Final Thoughts The bold prediction of XRP reaching $21,000 might seem extreme, but the math behind it is grounded in transaction velocity and global payment volume. If XRP becomes a core layer for settling massive amounts of value across the world, a high price per token is not just possible—it may be necessary. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-16T10:06:40,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction for this Week (June 16-June 21, 2025)","The post Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Prediction for this Week (June 16-June 21, 2025) appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market enters a new week, on a relatively stable ground. The global crypto market cap has risen by 1.10% to $3.32 trillion, while the intraday trading volume zoomed past by 15.94% to $89.62 billion. Which is a clear sign of growing activity as traders anticipate potential market-moving events. The Fear & Greed Index sits at 50, reflecting neutrality across retail and institutional sentiment. While ETF inflows are seeing a revival, providing crucial support to market leaders, it’s Ethereum that’s stealing the spotlight with its institutional traction. XRP, too, is drawing attention thanks to its $1 billion in treasury commitments and anticipation surrounding the Ripple vs SEC case. I am sure that this has compelled you to look out for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price prediction. Here’s how the top three assets are shaping up technically: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Bitcoin price today is trading at $107,113, with a marginal 1.02% spike in the last 24 hours. The price remains in a narrow consolidation pattern on the daily chart, hovering just below its recent swing high. With ETF momentum fueling demand, a breakout above the $107,000 resistance could send BTC flying toward $110,000. On the flip side, if selling pressure intensifies below $105,000, a slide to the $102,800 support could follow. However, with volume up nearly 11%, bulls seem to be holding their ground for now. That being said, I believe, a sustained push above $106,800 would confirm bullish continuation. If you are keen on investing in BTC, then our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 is a must-read for you! Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin this week, rallying 3.33% to trade at $2,627, with a notable $5 billion in ETF inflows and a 40% surge in trading volume. On the technical front, ETH is attempting to break out of a sideways channel. A clean break above $2,633 its recent high could fuel a rally toward $2,750–$2,800, especially with institutional backing on the rise. However, if ETH fails to hold above the $2,550 level, you can expect a retracement to $2,450. If you are an ETH hodler, this Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 is for you! Ripple XRP Price Prediction: XRP today is changing hands at $2.18, up 1.60%, but still below its 50-day SMA of $2.28, signaling short-term caution. The token is above the 200-day SMA of $1.91, reinforcing longer-term strength. With support near $2.0145, I believe that the downside seems limited in the short term. Interested in XRP, but concerned about its long term returns? Read our Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030! Immediate resistance lies at $2.45, and a weekly close above that could reignite hopes for a rally toward the psychological $3 level. Traders are closely watching the Ripple vs SEC case, with Judge Torres expected to deliver a verdict, an event that could dramatically shift price dynamics. FAQs 1. Is Bitcoin ready for a breakout this week? Yes, if Bitcoin can sustain above $106,800, the charts suggest a breakout toward $110,000 is likely, supported by ETF inflows and improving volume. 2. Why is Ethereum outperforming Bitcoin? Ethereum has seen stronger institutional inflows into its ETFs, and its technical structure is showing signs of a bullish breakout above key resistance. 3. Will XRP rally after the Ripple-SEC verdict? A favorable verdict could be a major catalyst, potentially propelling XRP above $2.45 and toward $3.00. However, short-term price action remains cautious until the verdict is confirmed.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-price-prediction-for-this-week-june-16-june-21-2025/,"BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T10:03:28,"Solana Founder Mocks Altcoin Projects for “Dumb” Bitcoin Buy Strategy","The post Solana Founder Mocks Altcoin Projects for “Dumb” Bitcoin Buy Strategy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko has sparked fresh debate in the crypto world by criticizing altcoin projects that invest in Bitcoin. His comments – clearly aimed at Cardano’s recent $100 million Bitcoin plan – have stirred strong reactions across the community. As major blockchain players weigh in, the clash reveals deeper questions about how altcoin projects should manage their treasuries in today’s unpredictable market. This is so dumb. Projects should keep 18-36 months of post kill list runway in short term tbills but that’s about it. Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts. — toly (@aeyakovenko) June 16, 2025 Yakovenko Fires Back: “Why Pay for Coconuts?” Yakovenko didn’t hold back. In a post on X, he dismissed the idea of altcoin teams buying Bitcoin for their users, saying individuals can, and should, do it themselves. “This is so dumb… Why would anyone want a team to buy and hold Bitcoin for them when they can do it themselves? Why pay for all those coconuts?” he wrote. Instead of Bitcoin, he recommends projects hold enough low-risk assets, like U.S. Treasury bills, to cover three years of operating costs. Anything beyond that, he suggests, is unnecessary. Cardano’s $100M Bitcoin Plan Raises Eyebrows The drama began after Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson proposed converting $100 million worth of ADA into Bitcoin and stable assets. According to him, this wouldn’t hurt Cardano’s ecosystem. In fact, he says it could help grow the treasury over time through yield, eventually allowing the team to buy back even more ADA. “If successful, this strategy could create a stable floor for the ecosystem,” he said, expecting a sustainable financial model. However, his embrace of Bitcoin raised eyebrows, especially after he previously challenged Bitcoin’s “sound money” status, promising not to allow “ Bitcoin maxis ” to dominate. Crypto Community Weighs In The proposal drew mixed reactions in the crypto community. Jeff Park of Bitwise Invest on X , “Subpar altcoins ditching their assets to build a BTC treasury was not on my 2025 bingo card.” Others in the space had mixed reactions. DeFi platform Alva called Cardano’s move risky but said it could strengthen its position in decentralized finance. Meanwhile, traders remain cautious about a short-term dip in ADA, though some technical signals suggest a rebound may follow. Bigger Question: Is Bitcoin the Future of Altcoin Treasuries? This back-and-forth between the heads of Solana and Cardano highlights a growing divide in the crypto world: Should altcoin projects lean into Bitcoin, or focus on building value with their own assets? As market volatility continues, the choices these projects make now could shape their long-term success and how investors view their role in the broader crypto ecosystem.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/solana-founder-mocks-altcoin-projects-for-dumb-bitcoin-buy-strategy/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|SOL","News",cryptocompare

The parties discussed the potential use of Bitcoin as part of the national reserve and the development of crypto policy frameworks. Saqib urged Pakistan to consider Saylor’s example of turning Strategy into a Bitcoin-buying vehicle. He believes that if private individuals can build that in the U.S., Pakistan, with the talent, story, and energy, can do the same. Pakistan advances its crypto pivot strategy Michael Saylor talked with 🇵🇰 Pakistan’s Finance Minister and State Minister for Crypto, Bilal, about #Bitcoin . An interesting move, especially since Bitcoin is still not recognised as legal tender in Pakistan. pic.twitter.com/v99XuQUvNs — Zia ul Haque (@ImZiaulHaque) June 16, 2025 Pakistan has greatly advanced in supporting its crypto pivot after Strategy’s executive chair, Michael Saylor, met with the country’s officials to laud its crypto efforts. During a meeting on Sunday with Pakistan’s Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of Blockchain and Crypto Affairs Bilal Bin Saqib, Saylor discussed how Bitcoin can function in a state reserve and the country’s planned crypto policies. In a video posted on June 15 by a Finance Ministry official, Saylor told the duo that Pakistan has many brilliant people and many individuals who do business with the country. He also used his Bitcoin-buying company as an example of how the country can show intellectual leadership. According to Bitbo, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has the largest Bitcoin holdings among public companies, with 582,000 BTC worth over $61 billion. The crypto company has sold billions of dollars worth of debt and shares to fund its BTC purchases, and its share price has soared over 3,000% since its first buy in mid-2020. “Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience. Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.” -Michael Saylor, Former CEO and Co-founder of Strategy. Saqib noted that the country has shifted to become more crypto-friendly, with the government setting up a crypto authority last month to regulate the sector. Pakistan’s Minister of Blockchain and Crypto Affairs also acknowledged that the country will create a Bitcoin reserve. Saylor told Saqib and Aurangzeb that the markets gave him billions of dollars because they trusted his company. He also argued that intellectual leadership was the most important thing that bolsters trust in people. The American billionaire added that when the market decides who is leading in a particular area, they stand behind the leader and invest with them, which he believes they’ll do for Pakistan. Saylor argued that Pakistan had the most important things, which are commitment and clarity, and he said that he is looking forward to working with the country. Pakistan seeks to build a robust crypto policy framework Saqib’s office said in a statement that its talk with Saylor was a milestone in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework for the country. Aurangzeb also maintained that Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in developing and adopting digital assets. He referred to the group of nations typically regarded as having a lower level of economic development. On June 6, Pakistan’s government-backed Crypto Council presented a draft legal framework, for which the Finance Ministry agreed to fast-track the approval process. The council was established in March to regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into the country’s financial landscape. The Finance Division said the council is set to play a pivotal role in formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan . Saqib was installed as CEO, and he also acts as an adviser to World Liberty Financial, the crypto project linked to U.S. President Donald Trump and his family.

This isn’t a small, speculative bet; it’s a strategic allocation of significant capital towards Bitcoin. 0% Interest Bonds: Issuing bonds at 0% interest is noteworthy. It suggests favorable market conditions for Metaplanet to raise funds and potentially indicates investor confidence in the company’s overall strategy, including its Bitcoin holdings, or perhaps specific terms related to the bond structure itself (though the announcement is brief). Directly for BTC Purchases: The stated purpose is unambiguous – the funds are earmarked for acquiring more Bitcoin. This transparency is crucial for investors and the market to understand the company’s financial direction. Expanding the Bitcoin Treasury: This issuance will dramatically increase Metaplanet’s existing Bitcoin Treasury holdings, further cementing its position as a public company with a significant portion of its balance sheet in BTC. This action mirrors the strategy pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy, which has used various financing methods, including debt and equity, to accumulate a large amount of Bitcoin. Metaplanet appears to be adopting a similar playbook tailored to the Japanese market. Why Are Companies Like Metaplanet Investing in Institutional Bitcoin? The trend of publicly traded companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, often referred to as Institutional Bitcoin adoption, is driven by several factors: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Many companies view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against currency debasement and inflation, especially in an era of expansive monetary policies globally. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature are seen by proponents as characteristics that make it a superior long-term store of value compared to traditional assets or fiat currencies. Potential Appreciation: The hope for significant price appreciation remains a primary driver, offering the potential for substantial returns on corporate treasury funds that might otherwise yield little in low-interest environments. Attracting Investment: For some companies, adopting a Bitcoin strategy can attract a new class of investors interested in exposure to the digital asset space through traditional equity markets. Challenges and Risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price is notoriously volatile, which can introduce significant fluctuations in a company’s reported earnings and balance sheet value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, posing potential risks regarding future restrictions, taxation, or legal challenges. Accounting Treatment: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by jurisdiction, sometimes requiring impairments that negatively impact financial statements even if the market price recovers later. Public Perception: While growing, institutional adoption of Bitcoin is still relatively new, and some traditional investors or stakeholders may view it as a risky or speculative corporate strategy. Metaplanet and Japan Bitcoin Adoption: A Growing Trend? Metaplanet’s aggressive move highlights the increasing interest in Japan Bitcoin adoption among corporations. While Japan has a well-established cryptocurrency trading market, corporate treasury adoption has been slower compared to North America. Metaplanet is positioning itself at the forefront of this trend in the Japanese market. This could potentially serve as an example for other Japanese Firm Bitcoin curious entities. As more companies see Metaplanet successfully navigate holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet, it might reduce the perceived risk for others considering a similar strategy. Japan’s supportive stance on Web3 and digital innovation could also create a more favorable environment for such corporate strategies in the future. Actionable Insights from Metaplanet’s Move What can investors and market watchers take away from Metaplanet’s significant bond issuance for Bitcoin? Confirmation of Strategy: This isn’t a one-off purchase; it’s a clear confirmation of Metaplanet’s long-term strategy to become a major holder of Bitcoin. Signal for Asian Market: The move could signal growing confidence and potential acceleration of institutional Bitcoin adoption in Asia, following the lead of Western companies. Focus on Balance Sheet Plays: Investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional stock markets should pay attention to companies like Metaplanet that are actively building a Bitcoin treasury. Monitor Execution: Observe how Metaplanet executes these purchases and manages its growing Bitcoin holdings amidst market volatility and regulatory developments. Metaplanet’s journey provides a valuable case study for understanding the motivations, mechanisms, and potential impacts of corporate Bitcoin adoption outside the typical Western focus. Conclusion: Metaplanet Solidifies its Bitcoin Stance Metaplanet’s decision to issue $210 million in bonds to buy more Bitcoin is a bold and significant move. It reinforces their commitment to a Bitcoin Treasury strategy, positioning them as a leading example of Institutional Bitcoin adoption in Japan. This action not only expands their own holdings but also sends a strong signal about the increasing global acceptance and strategic importance of Bitcoin as a corporate reserve asset. As the trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets continues, Metaplanet’s substantial investment marks a key development, particularly within the Japan Bitcoin landscape, potentially paving the way for other Japanese Firm Bitcoin strategies.

2025-06-16T09:48:59,"Pi Network’s Latest Update Sparks Backlash","The post Pi Network’s Latest Update Sparks Backlash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Pi Network’s latest update about its .pi domain auction has sparked criticism from its users. While the Pi Core Team introduced a new app to manage domain bids, with features like stats tracking and email alerts, many in the community feel this isn’t the major progress they were waiting for, especially ahead of Pi2Day 2025 . No Major Update? Pioneers, who support and use the Pi Network, had hoped for stronger announcements that could help the Pi token gain real value . Instead, many see this domain auction update as underwhelming and out of touch with what users actually want. However, Pi network failed to impress the crypto community, and now they doubt Pi’s future, which seems bleak and dark. Users also see a severe bloodbath in Pi price if they don’t come up with new announcements. If the Pi2Day announcement consists only of Pi domains and there is no further major news on #Pi2Day , a very dark cloud will arise over Pi Network. Pi domains are not a bad thing, but it would be very bad if it stayed with this outdated announcement. Just give us the smart… — Pi Network News Global 𝛑 (@PiNewsGlobal) June 15, 2025 Auction Sees Low Interest Amid Price Crash Since the auction began three months ago, around 3 million PI tokens (worth $1.8 million) have been spent on domain bids, according to Piscan . But this is small compared to Pi’s daily trading volume of over $100 million. The update hasn’t done much to boost interest or price. Pi is now trading at around $0.60, down 35% in the last week and 60% for the month. Early hopes that businesses would rush to buy branded .pi domains have faded. Even Pi’s founder Nicolas Kokkalis once compared them to regular internet domains, but that excitement hasn’t shown up in real numbers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Can Pi Network Price Hit $100? , Calls for Real Updates Grow Louder Users are now demanding more meaningful progress.

Tired of hype with no substance — MOON CRYPTO SIGNAL PREMIUM (@cryptosignal666) June 15, 2025 More Pressure on the Team Ahead The team now faces added pressure. Over 248 million PI tokens will unlock next month, which could lead to even more selling. Without clear steps like exchange listings, ecosystem tools, and faster KYC processing, the network risks losing its community’s trust. For now, the .pi domain update is seen as too little, too late. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

How important are exchange listings for the long-term viability of Pi Network? Major exchange listings (like Binance or Coinbase) are crucial for Pi Network’s long-term viability. They would provide vital liquidity, wider accessibility, and increased credibility, which are currently lacking.

2025-06-16T09:42:16,"Pundit Says 49,900% XRP Price Rally Will Happen Sooner, XRP Army Responds","In a recent post, prominent XRP commentator BarriC reiterated a long-held yet widely debated belief within the digital asset community. In a concise message, BarriC stated, “$XRP $2 to $1,000 will happen a lot sooner than people realise.” The assertion reinforces a dramatic forecast about the future price appreciation of XRP , a digital asset that continues to divide opinion among retail investors, analysts, and critics. Although no specific timeframe or methodology was provided in the tweet, the suggestion that XRP could experience such exponential growth in the near term drew a wide range of responses, particularly from within the XRP community . $XRP $2 to $1,000 will happen a lot sooner than people realise — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 13, 2025 Contrasting Opinions From Supporters and Critics Shortly after BarriC’s post, various XRP community members reacted to the statement, expressing both support for and skepticism of the prediction. One user, XRPAMAHC, acknowledged their support for the asset but raised concerns about the feasibility of the $1,000 price point. “Big fan of XRP, but how $1000? gives me ur logic explanation,” they wrote. They added that if XRP were to reach the market capitalization of Bitcoin, a price around $35 per token would be more realistic, describing the $1,000 valuation as a “unicorn dream.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another community member, James Rejoin, responded with sarcasm, suggesting that such a price milestone would take many decades to materialize. He remarked, “Yes. It will happen in 100 years rather than 150. So that’s good news,” expressing doubt regarding the timeframe implied in BarriC’s original comment. Meanwhile, Robert Smith responded more directly and with strong opposition. He said he has “been seeing and hearing this since XRP came about, and it hasn’t gotten anywhere near it.” He further stated that “If it does hit 1k it will be in 100+ years from now.” Smith’s remarks reflect the long-standing frustration among segments of the community that have observed XRP’s historical performance fail to meet such bullish targets. No Supporting Data Provided BarriC’s tweet did not provide a breakdown of the economic model, utility projections, or supply-demand dynamics that might substantiate the predicted price range. This absence of data has led observers to view the statement as speculative. Without referencing institutional adoption metrics, on-chain analytics, or macroeconomic catalysts, the projection stands as a bold expression of belief rather than a supported forecast.

2025-06-16T09:40:47,"Altcoin Season Index Reveals Critical Bitcoin Season in Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index Reveals Critical Bitcoin Season in Crypto Market Hey there, crypto enthusiasts! Ever wondered if it’s a good time to buy Bitcoin, or if altcoins are about to explode? Understanding the different phases of the crypto market can be a game-changer. One popular tool that helps gauge this is the Altcoin Season Index . As of June 16, 2024, the Altcoin Season Index , tracked by CoinMarketCap, registered a reading of 25. This specific number isn’t just a random data point; it signals a particular phase in the market cycle: we are currently in what’s known as Bitcoin Season . Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 25 Mean? So, what exactly is the Altcoin Season Index , and why should you care that it’s sitting at 25? This index is a simple yet insightful metric designed to tell us whether the broader market is favoring Bitcoin or the myriad of other cryptocurrencies, collectively known as altcoins. Here’s the breakdown: The index looks at the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization over the past 90 days. Crucially, it excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. It compares how these top 100 altcoins have performed relative to Bitcoin during that 90-day window. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. The thresholds are key to interpreting the score: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index would typically be 75 or higher. This is the period where many altcoins see significant gains, often outpacing Bitcoin’s growth. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index would typically be 25 or lower. This is the period where Bitcoin tends to perform relatively better than most altcoins, or altcoins might even be losing value while Bitcoin holds steady or gains. Neither (Transition Period): A score between 25 and 75 suggests a transitional period where there isn’t a clear dominance of either Bitcoin or altcoins across the board. Performance might be mixed. With the index currently at 25, it firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season . This indicates that over the past three months, a significant majority of the top 100 altcoins have underperformed compared to Bitcoin. Navigating the Market: What is Bitcoin Season Like? Being in Bitcoin Season means that, on average, your altcoin portfolio is likely struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. This phase is characterized by several potential dynamics: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market capitalization makes up a larger percentage of the total crypto market cap. Investors might be rotating capital into Bitcoin, viewing it as a safer or more stable asset compared to riskier altcoins. Accumulation Phase: For some investors, Bitcoin Season can be seen as an accumulation phase for altcoins. Prices may be depressed relative to Bitcoin, offering potential entry points if you believe in the long-term prospects of specific altcoin projects. Lower Risk Appetite: Often, Bitcoin Season coincides with periods of uncertainty in the broader financial markets or specific FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) within the crypto space. Investors tend to flock to Bitcoin, perceived as the ‘blue chip’ or less volatile asset compared to the vast landscape of altcoins. Capital Flow: Capital tends to flow into Bitcoin first during market uptrends, or it retreats into Bitcoin during downtrends before potentially flowing back into altcoins. Understanding this phase is crucial for setting realistic expectations for your portfolio and making informed decisions based on current crypto trends . The Flip Side: What Triggers Altcoin Season? While we are currently in Bitcoin Season , the market is cyclical, and the shift to Altcoin Season is what many investors eagerly anticipate. So, what typically needs to happen for the index to climb towards that 75+ mark? Altcoin Season often kicks off after a significant move or period of consolidation in Bitcoin’s price. Here are some common triggers: Bitcoin Price Stability or Consolidation: Once Bitcoin has made a large move (up or down) and enters a period of relative stability or trades sideways, investors might start looking for higher returns elsewhere. Increased Risk Appetite: Improved macroeconomic conditions, positive regulatory news, or growing confidence in the crypto space can increase investor appetite for riskier assets like altcoins. Capital Rotation: Profits made from Bitcoin’s run are often rotated into promising altcoin projects, especially those with strong fundamentals, upcoming developments (like mainnet launches, significant partnerships), or compelling narratives (like DeFi, NFTs, AI, Layer 2 solutions). Specific Altcoin Narratives Gain Traction: Sometimes, a strong performance in a few key altcoin sectors or individual projects can start pulling the index higher as capital flows into those areas. During Altcoin Season , it’s common to see many altcoins post gains of 50%, 100%, or even significantly more in relatively short periods, while Bitcoin’s gains might be more modest in comparison. This is where the potential for exponential returns lies, but also where risk is significantly higher. Historical Context: Looking Back at Past Crypto Trends The concept of Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season isn’t new; it’s a pattern observed across multiple market cycles. While past performance is never a guarantee of future results, looking at historical crypto trends can provide valuable perspective. Major bull markets often start with a strong run in Bitcoin, followed by capital flowing into large-cap altcoins, and finally into smaller, more speculative altcoins. Bear markets or periods of uncertainty typically see capital flow back into Bitcoin or out of the market entirely, leading to extended periods of Bitcoin Season or general market downturns where everything struggles. For example, late 2017 and early 2018 saw a massive Altcoin Season following Bitcoin’s parabolic rise. Similarly, parts of 2020 and early 2021 featured strong altcoin runs after Bitcoin broke previous all-time highs. Conversely, the bear market of 2018 and much of 2022 were largely periods of Bitcoin Season or general market decline. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Consider During Bitcoin Season? The current reading of the Altcoin Season Index at 25, signaling Bitcoin Season , provides context for investors. It doesn’t dictate strategy, but it informs it. Here are some potential considerations: Focus on Bitcoin: If you believe Bitcoin will continue to outperform, this phase supports a strategy heavily weighted towards BTC. Strategic Altcoin Accumulation: For those bullish on altcoins, Bitcoin Season can present opportunities to accumulate specific altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. Research is paramount here; focus on projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Risk Management: During Bitcoin Season , altcoins are generally more volatile and susceptible to larger percentage drops than Bitcoin. This is a time to be extra cautious with position sizing and stop-loss orders. Portfolio Rebalancing: If your portfolio became heavily skewed towards altcoins during the last run, Bitcoin Season might be a signal to rebalance and increase your Bitcoin holdings. Research and Education: Use this period to deep dive into potential altcoin investments for the next cycle. Understand the technology, team, tokenomics, and community of projects you are interested in. Remember, the index is a lagging indicator (based on the last 90 days). It tells you where we’ve been, which helps understand where we are, but it doesn’t predict the future with certainty. Challenges and Limitations of the Index While a useful tool for understanding broad crypto trends , the Altcoin Season Index has limitations: Top 100 Bias: It only considers the top 100 coins. Performance of smaller cap altcoins isn’t included, and these can sometimes have their own micro-seasons. 90-Day Window: The 90-day lookback period is somewhat arbitrary. Market dynamics can shift faster or slower than this window captures perfectly. Exclusions: While excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens makes sense for measuring speculative performance, it still leaves out a significant portion of the overall crypto market value and activity. Correlation vs. Causation: The index shows correlation in performance but doesn’t explain *why* it’s happening. The underlying reasons for Bitcoin Season (macro, sentiment, etc.) are more complex. Therefore, the index should be used as one tool among many when analyzing the market, not as the sole determinant of your investment strategy. Connecting the Index to the Current Crypto Market Landscape The current Bitcoin Season indicated by the index reading of 25 aligns with several observable factors in the broader crypto market . We’ve seen periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, shifts in inflation expectations, and varying levels of institutional inflow into Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin has shown relative resilience compared to many altcoins, which have faced headwinds, including regulatory scrutiny on some projects and a general cooling off of speculative fervor after previous rallies. This environment naturally favors Bitcoin as investors potentially de-risk or consolidate positions in the market leader. The index simply provides a quantifiable measure of this trend over the recent past. What Could Signal a Shift Away from Bitcoin Season? For the Altcoin Season Index to start climbing back towards ‘Neither’ or even ‘Altcoin Season’, we would likely need to see a sustained period where altcoins begin to consistently outperform Bitcoin. This could be driven by: A strong, convincing breakout in Bitcoin’s price followed by consolidation. Positive macroeconomic shifts that increase overall risk appetite. Major positive developments within specific altcoin ecosystems (e.g., successful network upgrades, significant adoption news). A general increase in trading volume and liquidity across the altcoin market. Monitoring these factors, alongside the index itself, can help investors anticipate potential shifts in crypto trends . Conclusion: Navigating the Cycles The Altcoin Season Index at 25 is a clear signal that the crypto market has been in a phase of Bitcoin Season over the last 90 days. This means Bitcoin has generally outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins. Understanding whether we are in Bitcoin Season or Altcoin Season is valuable for investors to align their expectations and strategies with current crypto trends . While Bitcoin Season might feel less exciting for altcoin holders, it’s a normal part of the market cycle and can present opportunities for strategic accumulation or risk management.

2025-06-16T09:39:38,"Block: Out Of Favor, Not Out Of Play","Summary Block's valuation is deeply discounted, pricing in macro and competitive headwinds, creating a contrarian buy opportunity for patient investors. Despite weak user growth and competition, XYZ's core businesses show resilience, with steady per-user engagement and strong brand stickiness in SMBs. Operating margins are improving, and the balance sheet is healthy, despite high stock-based compensation and Bitcoin-driven revenue volatility. Significant crypto exposure adds risk but also hidden upside; if sentiment turns, Block's multi-narrative model could unlock asymmetric long-term gains. Since the tariff selloff, Block ( XYZ ) has not meaningfully recovered along with the wider market bounce back. Valuations are looking reasonable to initiate a contra buy! The core thesis is that while the valuations are discounted structurally on real weakness in both consumer and SMB segments, the markets have priced much of the downside and hidden optionality could now provide long-term upside potential. In a highly disruptor-friendly and competitive space, Block is facing near-term headwinds and does not seem to have the right narratives that are likely to be rewarded right now. It does not seem to be quite the defensive you are looking for to ride the macro headwinds, nor the innovation-friendly positioning that is drawing risk capital. But that is exactly what opens up a contrarian window - the multi-narrative model of crypto fintech, consumer app, banking solution as well as a PoS may seem divergent now, but offers deep embedded optionality. Core Weaknesses With Hidden Optionality Poor growth in the Cash App active user base has been plaguing Block well before the recent tariff uncertainties and consumer spending headwinds - there is nothing new about a stagnating user base. In fact, there are green shoots being ignored by the markets. The historical financials data from Block show a steady inflow per user growth though (8% YoY in Q1 2025) suggesting underlying engagement is holding up. There are limitations to scaling monetization due to a customer base with lower income levels, but this is also a segment with room for digital financial inclusion, a longer-term structural theme to which Block remains exposed. The revenue stream is still heavily bitcoin reliant, which adds volatility to earnings, but also offers optionality if crypto sentiment stabilizes. Newer forays like Afterpay and micro lending are yet to show topline support, but the optionality of new offerings is still very much in play, particularly as the ecosystem matures. Active User Growth Cash App - XYZ (Image created by author using data from XYZ Financials) Block's Square merchant business is witnessing rising competition from platforms like Toast, Stripe, and Shopify. All three peers are targeting small and medium-sized businesses with payment processing and associated services (core areas where Square previously held a clear lead). While not identical in terms of the business segments they serve, all of them overlap with Square's target segments. This competitive pressure is real, but so is Block's brand equity and product stickiness in its core SMB user base. Block's concentrated exposure to small businesses does make it vulnerable to macroeconomic shocks like tariffs and cuts in consumer discretionary spend. But the valuations seem to have baked those headwinds in, investors willing to ride out the temporary drags will likely see eventual easing in consumer stress rerating Block quickly. Operating Margins Improving, but SBC Remains a Drag A key drag on margins is persistently high stock-based compensation, accounting for ~15% of gross profits. All is not gloom and doom, though. The operating margin is showing improved numbers in the past few years, supporting leverage in XYZ's business model as it scales. Block's balance sheet remains healthy, with sufficient liquidity to weather short-term volatility. Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Valuation Bottom Forming? Block's current valuation looks reasonably cheap on a metric like EV/Revenue. Although significant revenue comes in from Bitcoins, the contribution has been relatively stable throughout. While the EV/Revenue ratio in isolation may look more discounted than it is due to the Bitcoin revenues, its steep discount relative to its own history is still valid. The market appears to be assigning a structural discount to reflect concerns around user monetization cap and competition in both consumer and merchant ecosystems. Short term macro headwinds make the story unfavorable to deserve a rerating soon, but the discounted valuations look like having priced in much of the downside already. Contra buys now could gain asymmetrically if there is a narrative change or even minor investor confidence comes back on better than anticipated growth. Data by YCharts The P/Gross Profit Ratio underlines the multi-year valuation discount even better. Recent corrections have brought the P/GP ratio down from 6.3x to ~4x, near the trough of all-time lows. P/GP ratio - XYZ (Image generated by author using data from Seeking Alpha and XYZ Financial Files) The Bitcoin Distraction Comes With Optionality Block has an outsized exposure to crypto, particularly Bitcoin. Trades through Cash App are recorded fully as revenue but with minimal contribution to gross profit. In Q1 2025, Bitcoin revenue was again a dominant share of total reported topline (in the typical range of ~40%), yet contributed ~2% in gross profit on revenues generated from Bitcoin. However, it takes getting used to the structure to see the hidden optionality beneath. Beyond trading platforms in the Cash App, Block has further crypto ambitions, including its self custody wallet (Bitkey) and open-source platform (TBD). Although these remain early-stage and non monetized. That along with a decentralized finance (DeFi) focus for the future opens up optionality. I think the crypto narrative is a double-edged sword and particularly concerning when we look at peer fintechs like PayPal downsizing their crypto bets, shifting focus back to core payments and engagement. However, if the crypto cycle turns decisively bullish, Block stands to gain from its contra positioning. Contra Buy on Valuation Alone Block isn't an obvious buy in today's market, but that's the point. While narratives are divergent and risks real, the stock is trading as if none of its embedded optionality matters. With valuations trading at multi-year low, particularly after the tariff sell-off, this feels like a setup where even small tailwinds on macro, crypto or product could reprice the story quickly. For those willing to be early and patient, the contrarian reward risk looks compelling for a Buy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795089-block-stock-out-of-favor-not-out-of-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","XYZ",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T09:39:03,"Strategy: Don't Bet On A U.S. Dollar Crisis, As It's Highly Unlikely (Upgrade)","Summary Strategy stock is a high-beta investment that would thrive in macroeconomic chaos. Yet, in the structured reality we inhabit, macroeconomic stability is an almost certain outcome instead. MSTR stock can still thrive amid macroeconomic order. Bitcoin halving and digital-asset sentiment factors position the company to continue benefiting from global cryptocurrency adoption. Instead of treating the Company as a dollar-crisis hedge, treat it as a low-weight cyclical momentum and long-term volatility investment. Be aware of the impending, natural downturn for Bitcoin in 2026. Since my last Strategy ( MSTR ) analysis , the stock has gained 11% in price. Evidently, the consensus has been brewing in the market that an impending U.S. dollar crisis is on the horizon. This has been dubbed a ""debt death spiral,"" and even, more ominously, ""the end of the current world order."" Amid a rising China and more general geopolitical uncertainty, many are beginning to look for asymmetric assets to provide returns in the case of widespread federal debt default. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is one of the most favored assets in the modern age. Gold ( GLD ), also, is gaining strong momentum. Strategy offers a unique high-beta leveraged Bitcoin exposure. In a world where the U.S. dollar collapsed amid the feared-of ""debt death spiral,"" Strategy stock would boom. Yet, a closer look at the macroeconomy and at the details of Strategy's investment case shows that this isn't a bet worth making. Instead, bet on continued U.S. leadership, a robust and strong macroeconomy evolving through robotics-enabled high GDP growth, and more peaceful relations with the U.S. and China leading to stabilized geopolitical conditions in the Western-led, but multipolar world order we are already firmly placed within. Strategy's Investment Case is Strong Even Without Calamity The good news is, that even under normal macroeconomic conditions, Bitcoin is positioned to continue to prosper. This means Strategy is positioned for success in a ""rain or shine"" macro environment. As of Q1 2025, Strategy held approximately 528,185 bitcoins on its balance sheet; this was acquired for about $35.6 billion in total. At the time of this writing, that stash is worth over $55 billion. Bitcoin trends in approximately four-year cycles, most typically catalyzed by ""halvings"" (where the reward that Bitcoin miners get is cut in half). As a result, it requires surgical discipline and evaluation of these cycles to attain strong trading returns. Alternatively, Bitcoin or Strategy stock can be bought at a low valuation and held unswervingly through all periods of volatility. Over 70 public companies across the globe now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a "" treasury standard. "" None of these tailwinds require hyperinflation or economic calamity. What makes Strategy clever is its capital-raising and Bitcoin-acquisition strategy. The company uses stock sales, convertible notes, and preferred equity offerings to expand its Bitcoin holdings. In Q4 2024 , the company issued over $15 billion in new equity, and in Q1 2025 it executed an At-The-Market stock offering worth $21 billion. With the proceeds, it bought hundreds of thousands of additional bitcoins. Critically, management has obtained favorable terms (like 0% coupon convertible notes) to minimize interest burden while maximizing treasury firepower. Even though the company continues to focus on Bitcoin, its enterprise software division remains operational. Whether this is a necessary component of the business anymore remains up for debate. There is certainly credence to the notion that Strategy should simply go ""all in"" on its Bitcoin strategy. Revenue from this segment is essentially flat to down, with total revenue of $463.5 million in Fiscal 2024 compared to $496.3 million in Fiscal 2023. However, the revenue-generating enterprise software division does provide cash flow for funding operating expenses, allowing the company to continue its long-term Bitcoin holding strategy without interruption from liquidation for expense reasons. A U.S. Dollar Collapse is Unlikely I believe it is important to put Strategy in perspective with current macroeconomic uncertainties. Most notably, the looming ""debt death spiral"" that figures like Dalio posed a couple of years ago as increasingly imminent amid the federal debt load and unmanageable interest payments. Dalio also warned that such destabilizing economic conditions often lead to reactive global conflicts amid a financial power vacuum. At this time, the dollar still accounts for approximately 60% of global foreign exchange reserves. China's renminbi isn't a realistic challenger because it's connected to insufficiently open financial markets. Although there is ongoing discussion among industry experts of weakness in the dollar, a lot of this appears to be narrative-based fear to me. A return to visible strength in the U.S. government and America's sustained military-security alliances continue to fortify the dollar-centric order. Given the deep structural factors that tie our world order together, a sudden collapse is highly unlikely. On the dark side of the equation is that U.S. public debt is widely projected to reach about 156% of GDP by 2055. That's up starkly from about 100% in 2025. However, AI, robotics, and automation in general are poised to significantly alleviate this burden. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) has forecasted that AI could boost U.S. productivity growth by about 1.5% annually over the next decade. Also, McKinsey has forecasted that AI and automation could raise GDP growth in developed economies by 1.5-3.4% annually over the next decade. I'm more bullish, viewing U.S. real GDP growth of 5% annually as a very conservative estimate for the end of the next 10 years. This could mean 7-8% nominal GDP growth, well above the around 4.5% average interest rate on federal debt. 2025 real GDP growth is likely to be about 1.5-2% . This outlook, although still uncertain, does significantly withdraw credibility from the thesis of an impending fiat collapse. That affects the long-term return thesis for Strategy, which would (unfortunately) thrive most under exacerbated negative macro-financial conditions. However, the dollar is not on the brink of hyperinflation or collapse. In fact, the dollar is still globally dominant and backed by a dynamic economy. U.S. debt is high and rising, but stronger geopolitical relations and significant (presently undervalued) productivity gains from robotics could prevent the kind of runaway inflation or currency crisis that Bitcoin maximalists invest in light of. In essence, the ""fiat endgame"" thesis for Strategy stock is unlikely. This is true not only because of secular advanced tech trends, but also because of Western political activism in the White House and abroad to strengthen the current world order. Strategy Stock Offers Short-term Momentum Before Cyclical Downside I am quite certain that Strategy will continue to perform very well over the long term and achieve strong (likely market-beating) returns, even from the present high valuation. Bitcoin has become a dominant store of value, and it is now benefiting from substantial sentiment-driven tailwinds due to broad global, institutional, and retail adoption. That said, the cyclical dynamics of Bitcoin need to be clearly acknowledged. Given we have only recently had the Bitcoin halving in April 2024 , and Strategy stock is close to all-time highs, it's prudent to be careful of an impending valuation down-cycle before the next major breakout to greater new highs some years later around the next halving. Due to these cyclical factors, I think it's best to avoid buying Strategy stock or Bitcoin at this time if you're a long-term holder. While there are short-term momentum factors at play that are bolstered by immediate geopolitical pressures and macro-fiscal concerns, I expect that come 2026 these will ease significantly. Bitcoin may rise to $550 in the near term, but this is essentially a short-term trade and should include a defensive take-profit target. Once interest rates are cut more substantially to allow a proper bull run in 2026 to unfold, the Bitcoin price will likely stabilize and then begin its periodic downturn in late H1 2026. My thesis is essentially hinged on the notion that short-term macroeconomic uncertainty will keep sentiment for Bitcoin elevated post-halving, but once more pronounced equity market bullishness sets in due to stabilized and persistently positive economic indicators and lower geopolitical pressure (cooling of Iran-Israel conflict, peace outlined in Ukraine, a more co-operative and gradually evolving China), Bitcoin will enter its next down-cycle. I am bullish on Strategy stock for now, but my Buy rating will become a Hold soon. Strategy 1-Week-Period Price Chart ( Author's Chart, Using Seeking Alpha) Holding Cash is the Best Strategy to Protect From All Tail Risks Instead of buying Strategy stock as a hedge against U.S. fiscal collapse, which is an unlikely scenario, I believe it more prudent to hold a cash position to protect from all tail risks. Holding a high number of Bitcoin or Bitcoin-connected assets like Strategy elevates portfolio volatility and can lead to prolonged periods of underperformance, especially if the asset is bought at an unfavorable valuation just before a cyclical downturn, like in the next nine months or so. Instead, the cash strategy is agile and allows for opportunistic value investing without being heavily depleted in certain macro environments. U.S. Treasuries remain the most prudent, and secure, way to hold cash right now. The U.S. is still strong, the dollar is still the global reserve currency, and robotics will likely significantly shift the current ""debt death spiral"" narrative. In other words, it's business as usual in my book, and the timeless value principles of Buffett remain true. Long-term holding, value investing, and a strong cash position; and ""never bet against America"". I understand the fear of the looming debt crisis, but we should not forget that with the right focus on AI, robotics, energy, and strong geopolitical relations (with allies and ""adversaries"" alike), the U.S. can continue to lead and stabilize the present world order, even if it is multipolar. In such an environment, Strategy stock works as a high-beta, periodic high-alpha investment that should be bought at low valuations (like in 2023) and sold near peaks (like in the next nine months). Alternatively, you could take Strategy's approach and hold Bitcoin or Strategy stock itself through all volatility, but expect significant periods of decline and you must ensure you buy during periods of low sentiment, not high. The risk that Bitcoin will lose positive sentiment traction over the long term appears very unlikely to me. Volatility should be expected, but other than risks with Strategy's management not executing well-timed buys of the cryptocurrency, Strategy stock is actually a low-risk investment based on my analysis. Conclusion: Moderate Buy I do admire what Strategy has done. Not only is the investment model working (and quite simple in actuality), but it is also brave. Management will have to watch its equity value go through many periods of immense volatility, and as such, there will be moments where the company will be a market star and others where its light periodically fades. Even so, the long-term Bitcoin narrative is not going away, and sentiment for the cryptocurrency appears both robust and enduring to me. In light of this, and the dynamics of halving events, there's reason to be long-term bullish on Strategy, but just watch for the impending downturn in the next year or so.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795088-strategy-dont-bet-on-a-us-dollar-crisis-as-its-highly-unlikely-upgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","MSTR",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T09:34:09,"ETH sees 15% weekly surge, but all eyes turn to this project ahead of beta launch","Ethereum (ETH) recently delivered a strong 15% weekly performance, reinvigorating bullish sentiment across the crypto space. As Layer-1 giants reclaim momentum, attention is naturally turning toward projects innovating around Ethereum (ETH)’s infrastructure, especially those about to launch. One of the most anticipated of these is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a decentralized protocol preparing for its beta debut and introducing features that address long-standing DeFi challenges. While Ethereum (ETH) continues to lead in market cap and adoption, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building utility that will define the next evolution of decentralized finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): DeFi lending, reimagined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) won’t be just another lending protocol—it will be a multi-model platform built for flexibility, inclusivity, and scale. Unlike many traditional DeFi platforms that will only offer pooled lending with rigid parameters, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will combine both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. This dual-lending architecture will open the doors to diverse strategies, whether users want simple passive returns from popular tokens like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), or Avalanche (AVAX), or prefer to lend directly to peers using custom terms—even on volatile assets like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB). With the P2C model, depositors will earn dynamic interest directly tied to borrower demand. When borrowing activity spikes, lender returns will increase as well. Meanwhile, the P2P feature will give experienced users the ability to set rates and negotiate terms with specific borrowers—adding a level of control and customization rarely seen in the DeFi space. The engine driving the Mutuum ecosystem is its native token, MUTM. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a current presale price of $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $10.60 million during its Phase 5 presale, attracting more than 12,100 holders. Holders of MUTM won’t just benefit from potential price appreciation—they will participate in revenue-sharing mechanisms through the protocol. Users can stake their mtTokens (representing deposits in the protocol) to receive passive dividends. These dividends will be funded by a buyback system where protocol revenues are used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market—creating steady demand and rewarding long-term contributors with additional income. Those purchased tokens will then be sent to safety-module participants who stake mtTokens in designated contracts. Layer-2 integration: DeFi, accelerated One of the major developments that sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its planned integration with Layer-2 scaling solutions. High gas fees and sluggish transaction times have long plagued Ethereum (ETH)-based protocols. By incorporating Layer-2 infrastructure, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer faster and more cost-efficient transactions while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum (ETH) network. This move improves user experience, makes micro-lending viable, and opens the door for wider adoption. For a lending protocol that relies on efficient borrowing and repayment mechanics, this upgrade gives Mutuum a vital edge in usability and accessibility. Adding to its ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently developing its own decentralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized stablecoins that depend on fiat reserves and opaque banking relationships, Mutuum’s stablecoin will be fully backed by on-chain collateral—assets already held within the protocol. This ensures transparency, overcollateralization, and an algorithmic supply system that adjusts in real time. According to the official roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch the beta version of its platform alongside the token go-live. This timing is critical—it ensures that early adopters not only acquire the token at presale rates but can immediately put their MUTM to work within a functional ecosystem as soon as the platform goes live. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also completed a thorough smart contract audit by CertiK, one of the most respected blockchain security firms in the space. With a Token Scan Score of 80 and comprehensive checks via manual review and static analysis, the platform enters its next phase with robust security credibility. A generous giveaway to celebrate community growth To support community expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running an ongoing $100K giveaway . This initiative is not only building awareness but rewarding early participants, strengthening the foundation of a committed user base. As the project scales toward launch, such campaigns are helping to accelerate the distribution of MUTM tokens across a wide and engaged audience. Ethereum (ETH)’s recent price action has reaffirmed its role as the heartbeat of the decentralized economy. But every bull cycle brings a new wave of innovation—and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently among the few upcoming platforms with both a solid tokenomic structure and a feature set that solves multiple DeFi pain points. From dynamic interest lending and overcollateralized stablecoins to Layer-2 scalability and real-time dividend rewards, every aspect of Mutuum’s roadmap is engineered for utility and performance. Investors looking for more than just another speculative token now have an alternative that blends practicality with long-term ecosystem sustainability. With over $10.60 million already raised, a thriving community of 12,100+ holders, and a fully-audited codebase, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to become a foundational piece of the next DeFi growth wave.

2025-06-16T09:25:20,"New All-Time High for HYPE as Bitcoin (BTC) Climbs Above $107K (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s gradual recovery post the Friday crash continued in the past 24 hours as the asset jumped past $107,000 for the first time since the Israel-Iran attacks started. Many altcoins have produced impressive gains over the past day, but HYPE has stolen the show once again with another new all-time high. BTC Back to $107K The previous business week also started in a positive manner for the primary cryptocurrency, which jumped past $110,000 on several occasions from Monday to Wednesday. However, it couldn’t penetrate that level for good and started to lose value in the process. The most substantial rejection took place on Friday morning when BTC dumped from $108,500 to under $103,000 in minutes. The reason for this painful decline was Israel’s missile attack against Iran, in which over 70 people were killed. Although Iran retaliated on Saturday morning and the attacks continued during the weekend, bitcoin actually started to recover some ground. On Sunday, it tried to overtake $106,000 but failed at first before the bulls pushed it above that level and even north of $107,000 on Monday morning. Its market capitalization has risen to $2.130 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts continues to stand tall at 61.5%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView HYPE Keeps Pumping Ethereum has added roughly 5% of value in the past 24 hours and now trades well above $2,600 after testing the $2,500 support. XRP, BNB, DOGE, TRX, ADA, BCH, and LINK are also in the green, while SOL has emerged as the top gainer from the 10 largest alts. Solana’s token has jumped by over 8% and now trades above $155. HYPE has done it again by charting another all-time high, this time, close to $45. HYPE is up by double-digits once again on a daily scale. Other notable gainers include SUI, AVAX, UNI, TAO, ICP, AAVE, ONDO, and more. SPX and AB have surged from the top 100 alts. The total crypto market cap has rocketed by $80 billion since yesterday and is up to $3.460 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-06-16T09:20:38,"Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Unlocking Market Secrets as Greed Rises to 61","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Unlocking Market Secrets as Greed Rises to 61 Ever wondered what truly drives the rollercoaster ride of the cryptocurrency market? Beyond charts and news headlines, a powerful force is at play: human emotion . Fear and greed are the twin engines that can push prices to extremes. Understanding this underlying crypto market sentiment is crucial, and that’s where tools like the Crypto Fear and Greed Index come into play. What Exactly is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index ? Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a barometer for the emotional state of the crypto market. Developed by Alternative, this index aggregates data from various sources to provide a single number between 0 (representing Extreme Fear) and 100 (representing Extreme Greed). It’s designed to help investors gauge whether the market is currently dominated by panic selling (fear) or exuberant buying (greed). Why is this important? Historically, extreme fear can signal a potential buying opportunity (when others are panicking), while extreme greed might indicate the market is due for a correction (when everyone is overly optimistic). As of June 16, the index stands at 61, marking a slight increase from the previous day and firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone. This reading suggests that market participants are feeling generally positive and confident. How is the Index Calculated? Breaking Down the Factors The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s a composite score derived from six different weighted factors. Understanding these components gives you a deeper insight into what influences the overall sentiment: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average corresponding values of the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility, especially on the downside, often signals fear. Market Momentum / Volume (25%): This compares the current volume and market momentum to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greed, while high selling volume during a dip reflects fear. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts on various social media platforms, focusing on specific crypto-related hashtags and sentiment analysis of those posts. High levels of discussion and positive sentiment can contribute to a greed score. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component previously involved weekly polls asking people about their market sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear (people moving from altcoins to the relative safety of Bitcoin), while falling dominance might suggest increasing greed (people speculating on riskier altcoins). Google Trends (10%): This analyzes Google search data for crypto-related search terms. Spikes in search queries like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” often correlate with fear, while searches for terms like “buy crypto” or specific altcoins during a rally can signal greed. By combining these diverse data points, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the prevailing crypto market sentiment . Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 61 Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment ? A reading of 61 firmly places the market in the ‘Greed’ territory, though not yet at the ‘Extreme Greed’ levels (typically above 75-80). This suggests a generally positive outlook among investors. People are more inclined to buy, hold, or even speculate, driven by positive price action or optimistic news. In the ‘Greed’ zone, you might observe: Increased buying pressure and rising prices. More discussion about potential profits and price targets on social media. Decreased perceived risk among retail investors. Higher trading volume as more participants enter or increase their positions. However, it’s important to remember that ‘Greed’ isn’t necessarily a signal to blindly buy. While positive sentiment can fuel rallies, the ‘Greed’ zone is also where caution becomes increasingly important. Markets driven by excessive greed can become overheated and prone to sudden pullbacks or corrections. Understanding Crypto Volatility in the Context of Sentiment Crypto volatility is a double-edged sword heavily influenced by sentiment. In periods of fear, volatility spikes downwards as panic selling ensues. Sharp, rapid price drops increase the volatility component of the index, pushing it towards ‘Fear’. Conversely, during periods of rising greed, volatility can also increase upwards as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) drives rapid price pumps. The index’s volatility component captures these movements, reflecting how stable or erratic price action is, which is often a direct result of market emotions. The Role of Market Momentum and Volume Market momentum , closely tied to trading volume, is a significant contributor to the index. When there’s strong positive momentum – prices rising quickly on high volume – it’s a clear sign of buying pressure, indicative of greed. Conversely, negative momentum with high selling volume signals fear. The index uses this data to see if recent price movements are supported by significant trading activity, validating the strength of the prevailing sentiment. A rising index often correlates with increasing positive market momentum . Actionable Insights: Using the Index in Your Crypto Trading So, how can you actually use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index ? It’s best used as one tool among many, not as a standalone trading signal. As a Contrary Indicator: Some experienced traders use the index contrarianly. Extreme Fear (low values) might be seen as a potential buying opportunity when others are panicking. Extreme Greed (high values) might be a signal to take profits or be cautious about entering new positions. The current level at 61 is ‘Greed’, suggesting increased caution might be warranted compared to when the index was in ‘Fear’. To Gauge Market Psychology: The index provides a quick snapshot of the market’s emotional state. Is there widespread panic or euphoria? This can help you assess the general mood and avoid getting swept up in emotional trading decisions. Combine with Other Analysis: Never rely solely on the index. Use it alongside technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators), fundamental analysis (project news, adoption), and macroeconomic factors. For example, if technical indicators show a potential resistance level while the index is in ‘Greed’, it might reinforce a decision to be cautious. Understand the Zones: Pay attention to the shifts between zones (Fear to Neutral, Neutral to Greed, etc.) and the extremes (Extreme Fear/Greed). These transitions can sometimes precede significant market moves. Remember, the index reflects *current* sentiment based on recent data. The market can change rapidly. Limitations of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index : It’s Not a Crystal Ball While useful, the index has limitations: It’s a Lagging or Coincident Indicator: It reflects sentiment based on what has already happened (price moves, search trends, social posts), not what *will* happen. Simplification: Reducing complex market dynamics to a single number is a simplification. It doesn’t account for nuanced market conditions or specific asset performance (beyond Bitcoin dominance). Potential for Manipulation: Some components, like social media or Google Trends, could potentially be influenced, although the index tries to mitigate this. Doesn’t Predict Magnitude or Timing: A high ‘Greed’ score doesn’t tell you *when* a correction will happen or *how large* it will be. Similarly, ‘Fear’ doesn’t guarantee a bottom. Therefore, it’s a valuable tool for context but should not be the sole basis for investment decisions. Conclusion: Staying Informed on Crypto Market Sentiment The rise of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index to 61, keeping it within the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear signal of current positive crypto market sentiment . Driven by factors like price action, market momentum , and potentially shifts in Bitcoin dominance or changes in crypto volatility , this reading suggests investors are feeling optimistic. While ‘Greed’ can accompany upward price movements, it’s also a time for increased vigilance. Using the index as a gauge for prevailing emotions, combined with thorough analysis, can help you navigate the market more effectively. Understanding the underlying fear and greed dynamics, as reflected by this index, is a powerful step towards making more informed, less emotional trading and investment decisions in the volatile world of crypto.

2025-06-16T09:20:04,"Fake Cold Wallet Bought on Chinese TikTok Costs User $6.9M in Crypto","A crypto investor has lost nearly $7 million after purchasing what appeared to be a legitimate cold wallet through Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, only to discover the device was a sophisticated trap designed to steal digital assets. 近 5000万一夜蒸发！只因在抖音买了个“冷钱包”？血的教训！ 一个深夜电话，让我毛骨悚然！ 关系很铁的朋友，刚经历了人生至暗时刻—— 他持有的价值近 5000万人民币的加密货币，被盗一空！… — Hella | 海拉｜神奇女侠 (@hella1413) June 14, 2025 The victim, described as a close friend of former Bitmain team member Hella, fell prey to what security experts call a “carefully designed hot trap” that compromised the wallet’s private key at the moment of creation. Within hours of the theft being discovered, the stolen cryptocurrency had been laundered through Huiwang, a Cambodian-based network operated by the Huione Group that facilitates illicit financial activities, including crypto exchange services and darknet marketplace operations. How Chinese Crypto Hardware Stole Millions in Crypto Criminals are now adopting a growing, dangerous trend where traditional phishing techniques are targeted at hardware wallets, which users trust implicitly for enhanced security features. A SlowMist investigation revealed that the compromised wallet was marketed through Douyin’s e-commerce platform, Douyin Shop, which allows third-party sellers to offer various products, including cryptocurrency hardware. Last night, We received an emergency report: a user lost $6.5M worth of crypto from a cold wallet. The wallet was bought via Douyin (TikTok China), but the private key was compromised at creation — and funds were drained within hours. Cold wallet ≠ Safe Avoid “Factory… https://t.co/YDV4EgxD3a — SlowMist (@SlowMist_Team) June 14, 2025 The scammers exploited this legitimate marketplace to distribute devices that appeared factory-sealed and authentic, often advertising them at discounted prices to attract cost-conscious buyers. Unlike software-based scams that rely on users making mistakes during transactions, this hardware compromise occurred at the fundamental level of private key generation. When the victim initialized their new wallet, the pre-compromised device generated keys already known to the attackers. This created an illusion of security while providing criminals complete access to funds transferred to the wallet. Within hours of the theft, the criminals had successfully moved the stolen cryptocurrency through multiple layers of obfuscation, making recovery virtually impossible. This speed and efficiency suggest coordination between hardware scammers and money laundering networks. North Korea hackers are well known for these types of large-scale organized crimes. North Korean cyber spies reportedly set up fake US firms to deploy malware targeting crypto developers, violating Treasury sanctions. #NorthKorea #CyberSecurity https://t.co/TvCmrspaep — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 Most recently, they executed a large-scale corporate social engineering campaign targeting crypto developers by conducting fake job interviews and infiltrating open-source software packages. Crypto Security Crisis Remains a Growing Threat The cold wallet scam is just one facet of an expanding organized threat towards crypto users. Criminals are moving beyond traditional phishing emails and fake websites to compromise the very tools and devices that users trust for security. Recent months have witnessed a surge in similar attacks, including the distribution of malware-infected Ledger Live applications targeting macOS users and the revelation that Chinese printer manufacturer Procolored had been distributing Bitcoin-stealing malware alongside official drivers , resulting in the theft of 9.3 BTC worth over $953,000. The official driver provided by this printer carries a backdoor program.

The increasing sophistication of these attacks has prompted major technology companies to take decisive action. Microsoft recently collaborated with international law enforcement to disrupt the Lumma Stealer malware operation , seizing nearly 2,300 websites linked to the criminal infrastructure. @Microsoft has taken legal and technical action to disrupt Lumma Stealer, a notorious malware responsible for information theft. #Microsoft #lumma https://t.co/UCvErbFxTS — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 22, 2025 Notably, this latest crypto loss occurs against a backdrop of escalating crypto security threats, with CertiK’s May 2025 Security Report revealing over $302 million lost across Web3 through various attack vectors. The report showed a dramatic 4,483% increase in losses from code vulnerabilities, totaling $229.6 million in May alone, while phishing attacks continued to plague the ecosystem with $47.6 million in losses. The cold wallet scam represents a particularly insidious evolution in crypto crime. It exploits users’ trust in hardware security devices that are traditionally considered the gold standard for cryptocurrency storage.
