2025-06-15T21:30:58,"IBM’s Quantum Computer Could Threaten Bitcoin Security Soon: Details","IBM, a global technology company, has announced plans to build Quantum Starling, the world’s first fault-tolerant quantum computer. This new project, set to be released by 2029, aims to fix quantum computers’ high error rates and inability to run long, complex programs. Industry leaders say quantum computers might become strong enough to break today’s digital security systems. This could be dangerous for banks and might even breach inactive crypto wallets . While this is not an urgent threat, many worry it could happen sooner than expected. IBM’s Starling To Revolutionize Quantum Computers Quantum computers do not work like normal ones. Regular computers use bits, which can be either 0 or 1. Quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This special ability makes quantum computers very fast, powerful, and efficient. They can solve problems much faster than regular computers, including breaking encryption. Encryption keeps online information safe, including the data in Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain systems. However, today’s quantum computers are weak because qubits are very sensitive. Small changes in temperature or other conditions can make them stop working correctly. These errors prevent the computer from running large programs. As a result, IBM is focusing on building a fault-tolerant computer that can find and fix its own mistakes while running. This makes it more stable and allows it to handle longer and harder tasks. IBM’s Quantum Computer Starling and the 2029 Goal IBM’s new computer, Quantum Starling, will be able to run 100 million quantum operations using 200 corrected qubits. The computer will also use special hardware to fix errors in real time. IBM will install the system in its quantum data center in New York. This move is part of the company’s roadmap for building useful and scalable quantum computers by 2033. Over the next few years, IBM will test smaller systems and develop new software. These smaller machines will help IBM learn how to connect quantum chips, increase computing power, and prepare for larger builds like Starling. Crypto Community Panics, But Bitcoin Is Safe For Now IBM’s announcement has caused uproar in the crypto community. Experts say blockchains will not break overnight, but developers should start preparing now. Blockchain networks like Bitcoin use strong encryption to protect wallets and transactions, and today’s computers are not strong enough to crack these secret codes. Encryption methods that are safe from quantum attacks already exist; many believe it is time to use them. Meanwhile, some industry leaders like Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor say other systems, like banks and websites, could face quantum threats first. Bitcoin may be safer for a bit longer. Nevertheless, the risk to all digital systems will grow as quantum computers improve.

Market sentiment is moving away from excessive optimism or pessimism and toward a more balanced level, according to Coinglass data. Funding rates are a mechanism implemented to ensure that the price of perpetual futures contracts on cryptocurrency derivative exchanges remains close to the relevant spot (real) market price. These rates represent the direct transfer of funds between long and short investors, and exchanges do not earn from these fees.

2025-06-15T20:01:13,"Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad Author to Investors: Buy XRP Instead of Saving Dollars for the Future","Renowned financial educator and Rich Dad Poor Dad author, Robert Kiyosaki, has once again stirred the financial world with a bold warning about the future of fiat currency. In a recently resurfaced video shared by Vandell of Black Swan Capitalist on X, Kiyosaki urged investors to reconsider their savings strategy—specifically, to stop saving U.S. dollars and start investing in digital assets like XRP and Bitcoin. A Wake-Up Call to Investors In the video clip, Kiyosaki challenged conventional financial thinking and criticized what he described as a widespread, dangerous dependency on fiat currency. “Can’t you see what’s happening?” he said. “People will still rather save dollars. There’s a brainwash there. Why don’t you save XRP and Bitcoin? Why are you saving this [dollars]?” His remarks reflect deep concern about the long-term value of the U.S. dollar, especially as inflation remains persistent and central banks continue aggressive monetary expansion. For Kiyosaki, saving dollars is not just unwise—it’s a trap. A while back we had the rare opportunity to speak with Robert Kiyosaki. Discussing XRP, BTC, Gold & Silver. FYI: XRP was below $0.50 pic.twitter.com/zhMkTqiKK7 — Vandell | Black Swan Capitalist (@vandell33) June 13, 2025 Why XRP? Timing and Vision What makes Kiyosaki’s advice even more significant is the timing. When he voiced this perspective, XRP was still trading under $0.50. Fast forward to today, XRP has climbed to $2.17—reflecting rising investor confidence, institutional interest, and the benefits of Ripple’s expanding global presence. While Kiyosaki has long praised Bitcoin and precious metals like gold and silver, his inclusion of XRP was notable. It suggests a growing recognition of XRP’s utility in solving real-world problems, particularly in the global payments sector. From Criticism to Clarity Kiyosaki’s message isn’t just another speculative endorsement—it’s a warning rooted in decades of financial insight. He’s been consistent in highlighting the risks of inflation, central bank policies, and overreliance on paper currency. His advocacy for Bitcoin and now XRP reflects a belief that the financial future will be shaped by assets outside traditional banking systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP, in particular, is gaining momentum as Ripple continues to ink strategic partnerships with financial institutions, expands liquidity solutions, and integrates tools like RLUSD to support on-chain settlements. As adoption grows, Kiyosaki’s once-controversial advice looks increasingly prescient. A Message That Aged Well For investors who took his advice when XRP was below $0.50, the returns have already been substantial. Yet, for Kiyosaki, the message goes beyond profit—it’s about preserving wealth in a world where fiat currencies face growing instability. As XRP trades above $2 and crypto adoption accelerates, Kiyosaki’s appeal to “save XRP and Bitcoin” instead of dollars is no longer just contrarian—it’s becoming common sense for those watching the writing on the wall.

2025-06-15T20:00:48,"‘Forget Japan, Forget Europe’ – Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya Sees Massive Dollar Inflows Into US in Next 60 Days if Two Predictions Unfold","Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya is predicting a resurgence of the American balance sheet and an influx of new capital into the US. In a new episode of the All-In podcast, Palihapitiya says current forecasts of the US economy are overly negative and don’t factor in the potential development of two events. According to Palihapitiya, President Trump’s tariffs are likely on track to contribute an extra $300 billion in receipts to the US government’s current account in what he says is a big positive for the economy. The investor says that when factoring in the likelihood of at least 100 basis points in Fed rate cuts, the US is on track to save $300 billion as well – meaning a total of $600 billion in revenue boosts to the United States, providing a big jump to overall confidence in the American economy and markets. “We all thought that this was like a bogeyman that you weren’t allowed to touch it, and if you touched the stove, you’re going to get burned. The mathematical reality is that this is actually going to work out much better for us than we anticipated, and it’s going to be somewhere in the range of $300 to $400 billion of extra revenue per year. That’s a huge win. So why is that important? That then sets up this next cataclysmic thing that we’re going to see in the next 60 days, which is, what does Jerome Powell do? If Jerome Powell stays politicized, his incentive will be to keep interest rates where they are. If Jerome Powell looks at the conditions on the ground, especially when you start seeing inflation stay in the low 2s, and approach 2.0, the real thing that he’s going to be under tremendous pressure to justify is ‘Why are you not cutting?’ And just to give you a sense of how important that is, if we cut by a hundred basis points, that’s another $300 billion. In that case, that’s not money we get in, but it’s money we don’t have to spend. So if you add these two things together, we are in the next 60 days, going to have to reforecast the American balance sheet where this is, or we’re actually going to be able to positively forecast an extra $600 billion – $300 billion of incremental revenue and $300 billion of savings. If that happens, watch out. It means that every single risked dollar is going to run to America. Every single one.

2025-06-15T20:00:00,"Reentry through repair: Jill Ford’s plan to close crypto’s access gap","At the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference, entrepreneur Jill Ford, founder of BitFord Digital, and Justin Rhedrick of the Bitcoin Transformation Community unveiled an ambitious new initiative at the intersection of crypto infrastructure and social justice. In their session, “Proof of Redemption: From (Prison) Bars to Bitcoin,” the duo introduced “Hash Over Cash” — a program that channels outdated mining equipment and donated hashpower into workforce reintegration and hands-on job training for formerly incarcerated individuals. Instead of relying solely on monetary donations, the initiative invites companies and individual miners to contribute used or broken ASIC rigs — or even temporarily redirect mining output. BitFord handles repair, resale, and routing of proceeds, while the Bitcoin Transformation Community leads reentry-focused training programs where participants learn real-world tech skills like diagnosing and refurbishing mining hardware. “Cash donations often get stuck in red tape,” Ford explained. But a pallet of old machines? That’s something companies can greenlight fast—and it still comes with a tax deduction.” With plans to scale nationally and early support from firms like Bldg 96, Hash Over Cash is positioning itself as a blueprint for sustainable impact in Bitcoin. We spoke with Ford to learn more about the program’s vision, its implications for social equity in crypto, and how mining can empower a new generation of Bitcoin builders. You might also like: Bitcoin is oversold after Israeli strike on Iran: analyst You and Justin Rhedrick introduced this at Bitcoin 2025. Why now? Timing matters. The Bitcoin and crypto industries are maturing, but there’s still a major access gap, especially when it comes to underserved communities and people impacted by the justice system. Justin and I connected through a shared belief that Bitcoin should be a tool for empowerment, not just speculation. He’s done incredible work on the education and reentry side, and BitFord has the infrastructure and access to hardware. I also understand from experience the challenges that people go through when they try to reintegrate For all these reasons, the partnership felt obvious. Now was the moment to turn good intentions into actual action. Can you share a moment from your own journey that made you realize how important workforce reintegration is? One moment that really stuck with me was when I was in a correctional facility and noticed how little access women had to anything related to crypto. Often they’re the ones that need Bitcoin the most because the fiat economy has turned its back on them. But they have no access to current tools, no concept of crypto’s real-world application. What they do have, though, is so much curiosity and motivation. It hit me that we don’t have a talent gap. We have an access gap. If we can bridge that, we unlock not only opportunity for individuals, but resilience for the ecosystem. What are the technical skills participants will leave with—and how do those translate into real jobs in the Bitcoin or tech space ? Participants will learn to diagnose, repair, and maintain Bitcoin mining rigs. That includes everything from identifying hardware failures to cleaning, testing, and optimizing ASIC machines. These are transferable skills, especially as more mining operations decentralize and need on-site tech support. But beyond mining, we’re giving people a gateway into hardware repair, logistics, and IT infrastructure work. These are roles that are always in demand. How do you vet or select program participants? Is there a focus on certain communities or regions? That part is led by Justin and the Bitcoin Transformation Community . They work closely with correctional education programs, reentry organizations, and community partners who understand the needs on the ground. Our focus is on those who are underserved by traditional workforce pipelines. Right now, we’re starting in TK, but the vision is national. You might also like: From cellblock to blockchain: Bitford Digital CEO Jill Ford wields Bitcoin to shake up TradFi How does this model scale? Could we see training hubs across multiple states or prison systems? Absolutely. That’s the plan. We’re already designing mobile training units that can be deployed in correctional facilities or reentry centers. The beauty of this model is that it’s modular. Wherever there’s access to equipment and willing partners, we can build a program. We also want to empower returning citizens to become trainers themselves, so the knowledge ripple continues. You mentioned public companies can move faster with hardware donations than with cash. What role do tax deductions play in motivating corporate donors? Tax deductions absolutely play a role. Donated hardware can often be written off faster and more cleanly than cash, especially if the equipment is already depreciated. For public companies, this is often easier to approve internally because it doesn’t come from a budget line. It comes from inventory. And we’re providing full documentation for those donations, making the accounting side seamless. That said, tax laws are complex and can vary. It’s crucial to consult with a qualified tax professional to determine the best approach for any given business situation. Any barriers that you have encountered in getting large mining firms to participate, and how are you addressing those? The biggest barrier is mindset. A lot of firms still think of ESG or social impact as a cost center, not a competitive advantage. We’re all about changing that narrative. This is about building long-term resilience not just for people, but for the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. The firms that get it are already signing on. For those who don’t yet, we’re showing them the upside: brand equity, tax efficiency, and a stronger, more decentralized network. What kind of career paths are you envisioning for BTC graduates? Short term, we’re preparing them for jobs in mining repair, logistics, hardware maintenance, and data center support. Long term, we want to open pathways to entrepreneurship. Imagine someone who was once incarcerated now running a node, managing a warehouse, or even launching their own repair shop. This isn’t about charity, per se, it’s about capacity building. What do you say to skeptics who may not understand why Bitcoin or mining is relevant to reentry or social impact? I always say: Bitcoin means freedom. That’s because Bitcoin is all about ownership, autonomy, and access. That’s incredibly relevant to people who’ve had their freedom restricted and are trying to rebuild their lives. Mining is one of the few tech sectors where you can learn real, in-demand skills without a four-year degree or perfect resume. It’s hands-on, it’s scalable, and it can serve as a bridge to something bigger. Trump’s strong support for domestic Bitcoin mining—including a call to make the U.S. the global mining capital—has run into resistance in rural areas that are directly impacted by noise pollution, environmental concerns, and industrial encroachment. Backlashes have occurred in New York (i.e., Dresden and Niagara Falls) and Granbury, Texas; Mining sites have led to public complaints, legal restrictions, and sound mitigation efforts. The story underscores a key irony: grassroots opposition to this administration’s pro-Bitcoin agenda is growing in the very places that helped elect him, raising questions about whether his crypto ambitions can succeed politically at the local level. What do you say to mining skeptics and the potential backlash of such initiatives? Look, skepticism is always healthy. But not all mining looks the same. We need to separate irresponsible practices from sustainable, community-led solutions. Our initiative is small-scale and deeply rooted in reuse and repair. We’re not dropping 10-megawatt facilities into quiet towns. We’re refurbishing hardware, training people, and building micro-opportunities that integrate with communities, not overrun them. If the future of mining is going to succeed in the U.S., it has to be local, sustainable, and accountable.

2025-06-15T20:00:00,"Corporations continue to spawn Bitcoin treasuries— What’s good about them?","For several years, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) was the sole public company whose modus operandi was buying millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin with borrowed capital. These days, several other companies are trying to follow in Strategy’s footsteps. As more companies go all-in on stacking Bitcoin, critics are raising concerns about the growing centralization of crypto treasuries. Currently, just 216 entities—101 of which are public companies—hold nearly 31% of the circulating BTC supply, with corporate treasuries alone accounting for approximately 765,300 bitcoins, or 3.7% of total supply (excluding lost coins). This trend shows no sign of slowing, with existing firms continuing to accumulate and new players entering the space. This prompts debate over the benefits and risks of corporate Bitcoin ownership. Read more: Anthony Pompliano plots $750m Bitcoin buy via SPAC merger: report The trend is in full swing A wave of high-profile crypto treasury launches is underway, led by figures like Jack Mallers with 21 Capital, David Bailey with Nakamoto, and most recently Anthony Pompliano with ProCapBTC, which is reportedly raising $750 million in equity and convertible debt to accumulate Bitcoin. Each new treasury announcement is met with bullish fanfare on Crypto Twitter, where influencers routinely frame the news as a catalyst for BTC price appreciation. Yet with such announcements now occurring almost daily, their actual impact is increasingly unclear. The familiar refrain of “this is not priced in” has become a cliché, while comment sections often reflect confusion over why Bitcoin’s price continues to fall despite seemingly bullish developments. FACT: ¥3.9 TRILLION SOFTBANK IS INVESTING BILLIONS IN A COMPANY THAT WANTS TO BUY MORE #BITCOIN THAN MICROSTRATEGY THIS IS NOT PRICED IN 🔥 pic.twitter.com/5vxwP4UUOK — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 7, 2025 Do Bitcoin treasuries pump BTC’s price? According to the Gemini research, the growing adoption among sovereign and regulated financial institutions led to decreased volatility in all time frames after 2018. The launch of Bitcoin ETFs in 2024 made the trend even stronger. Despite the stabilization of the Bitcoin price, it doesn’t stop gaining value. The main difference is that now the price rises steadily without the frequent high-amplitude fluctuations it had in the past. According to Unchained, Bitcoin’s price is stuck between $100,000 and $110,000, and it will take a long time for it to exceed the $130,000 mark. People don’t pay attention to many things while reading bombastic announcements. One is a lack of retail interest, as the public tends to pay attention to Bitcoin when it hits an all-time high or at similar periods. Another reason for slower price movement is that Bitcoin treasuries not only buy BTC but dump it, too, as they need cash to repurchase shares. Additionally, the announcements usually display the full amount of the deal (i.e., “Pompliano to raise $750 million to invest in Bitcoin treasury”), whereas, in reality, these amounts are raised slowly; it may take several months to complete the deals. So it comes that the purchases made by Bitcoin treasuries are not what they may seem to be. Finally, the relentless accumulation of Bitcoin is pulling coins away from circulation, making a notable part of the supply dormant and somewhat purposeless for years. Bitcoin treasuries need this crypto to attract more investors and clients. However, it drives Bitcoin away from its initial role as an alternative electronic cash, and some in the crypto community raise critical voices directed at Bitcoin treasuries. This mass accumulation of Bitcoin by corporates & ETFs is getting very close to Satoshi's original vision of us never having to actually use the Bitcoin network. — Nic (@nicrypto) June 12, 2025 The ‘not your keys, not your coins’ attitude is alive and well Many Bitcoin enthusiasts prefer actually to own their bitcoins and don’t outsource all the hassle to corporations. Maximalists remind us that any entity does not control Bitcoin, and it is free to purchase, so there is no need for a company to buy and maintain Bitcoin on your behalf. Some criticize Bitcoin treasuries for not representing the spirit of Bitcoin, while others emphasize the troubled past of Bitcoin treasury frontmen. For instance, MicroStrategy had a questionable episode during the dot-com bubble era, whereas the company restated its profits, resulting in losses for the investors. The SEC accused the company of fraud. At the time, Saylor spoke about his plans to donate $100 million to the Internet university that will provide “free education for everyone on earth, forever.” This kind of evangelism may sound familiar to those who follow Saylor’s modern-day speeches , while he is more grounded when dealing with Bitcoin. What Magoo really means, is that bitcoin treasury companies need a professional Orange Washer An influencer already trusted by the plebs, who can toe the line between LARP'ing as a maxi, and shilling his stock as being superior to real BTC Aka, the used car salesman type https://t.co/nb9VuLJ66w — Pledditor (@Pledditor) June 11, 2025 For some, Pompliano is an ambiguous candidate for helming the new mighty Bitcoin treasury. While Pompliano is a well-known and recognizable Bitcoin advocate, some remember his involvement in promoting fraudster crypto exchange FTX and its associated platform, BlockFi. Collapses of these platforms were painful not only for its users but also impacted the entire crypto sector, crashing the market and infusing cryptocurrency distrust among the community outsiders and, more importantly, regulators. So true. For example, I lost most of my savings after listening to your podcast and putting it into BlockFi. Completely changed my life! — GSx (@Wade24T) November 28, 2022 Some Bitcoin owners watch the performance of the treasury company’s stocks or ETFs and sell their bitcoins to buy these assets, hoping for quicker gains. Adam Back, a Blockstream CEO and the only person whose work is referenced in the Bitcoin whitepaper urged his followers not to sell their bitcoins to buy ETFs or similar assets as they won’t be able to buy them back. some are selling their btc to ETFs and pubCos. dudes: HODL. you won't be able to buy them back before long. but also other users are buying, this is the way. — Adam Back (@adam3us) June 12, 2025 Then, what’s good in Bitcoin treasuries? The same person urging us not to sell bitcoins, Adam Back, explained that Bitcoin treasuries “are bringing forward the Bitcoin adoption curve.” $MSTR & $BTC Treasuries by @adam3us : ""They are basically an arbitrage between the fiat current [system] and the hyper-bitcoinezed future. And if you can buy #Bitcoin today and pay for it in 5 years or convert into equity you are bringing forward the Bitcoin adoption curve.."" pic.twitter.com/UAF4bmCZUC — Marco ₿attistoni (@Battistoshi93) June 2, 2025 Back pointed out that most people don’t have money and opportunities to acquire Bitcoin. In contrast, public companies have these opportunities to raise capital by selling their shares or vice versa. These companies don’t need free money to invest in Bitcoin as they can buy Bitcoin in advance and pay for it years later. “They are basically an arbitrage between the fiat [monetary system] and the hyper-bitcoinized future.” A more mainstream explanation is that shares and ETFs are easier to deal with for institutional investors than Bitcoin. So they don’t have to worry about the Bitcoin legal status and lack of the company around it. Instead, they can deal with a public company that offers some guarantees and is traded just like other public companies while exposing clients to the Bitcoin price appreciation.

2025-06-15T19:35:00,"Avalanche price prediction 2025-2031: Time to buy AVAX?","Key takeaways: Our Avalanche price prediction anticipates a high of $33.36 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $19.07 Market cap $8.04B Trading volume $183.4M Circulating supply 421.84M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $19.28 24-hour low $18.79 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 6.88% 50-day SMA $22.17 200-day SMA $24.15 Sentiment Bearish Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis: AVAX remains bearish As of June 15, AVAX’s price rose by 1.01% in 24 hours and dropped by 18.20% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 23.67% in 24 hours. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. Last month, the coin attempted a recovery which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to as high as $26.84. The William Alligator trendlines now show that its volatility is rising. The relative strength index is at 43.77 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing negative market momentum. It is considered oversold when the RSI value drops below 30. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which is in consolidation as it moves sideways. Last month, it had risen to $26.84 before correcting. Like the daily chart, its RSI is in neutral territory at 33.61. The William Alligator trendlines show rising price volatility.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is bearish with rising volatility, particularly in the short term, as it attempts to correct from the month’s low. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025.

2025-06-15T19:16:39,"Traders Eye Bitcoin Surge to $270K Despite Market Pause","Bitcoin is currently consolidating around $105,000, but sentiment among traders remains firmly bullish. Despite recent geopolitical and macroeconomic disruptions, many analysts believe the bull market is far from over. Rather than signaling a top, the current pause is seen by many as the prelude to further upside. Well-known trader Alan Tardigrade is one of several voices pointing to an optimistic future. “Bitcoin is trending upward in an Ascending Broadening Wedge,” he said in his latest market analysis on June 15. He believes this bullish chart pattern could lead the price to $170,000 in the near future. Technical Indicators Support Bullish Forecasts Tardigrade also noted that a golden cross — when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average — has reappeared on the daily chart. According to him, this pattern has historically boosted BTC by 49%, 125%, and 68% since early 2023. “If $BTC experiences its worst and best gains from this point, it could reach $152k and $229k. These targets are reasonable given the recent uptrend,” he explained. His analysis of weekly and daily timeframes suggests that Bitcoin’s bullish structure is still intact, even amid temporary slowdowns. Other Traders Echo Bullish Sentiment Other prominent figures in the trading community are voicing similar expectations. A trader known as BigMike7335 suggested on June 14 that a potential pullback to $92,000 could set the stage for a breakout to $270,000 by October. This would reflect a typical second-wave corrective move within Elliott Wave theory, followed by a strong continuation of the trend. Merlijn, another active trader, pointed to an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart. He believes a breakout from this formation could push BTC to $140,000 or more. “Neckline at $113K is the only thing standing in the way,” he told his followers. Warning Signs Still Present for Some While bullish sentiment dominates the trading discourse, some are issuing reminders of the market’s inherent risks. “The Bitcoin Standard” author Saifedean Ammous spoke candidly at the Bitcoin 2025 conference, warning that the asset’s history of sharp downturns cannot be ignored. “I just hope my message out there to everybody in this business is, Bitcoin has done -70% and -80% before, and it can do it again,” he said during an appearance on the Coin Stories podcast. Such comments serve as a cautionary note amid widespread optimism, particularly for new corporate buyers or institutions entering the market at current levels. With Bitcoin hovering near previous all-time highs, comparisons to the 2021 cycle peak have begun to circulate, prompting some to consider downside risks more seriously. Conclusion Despite concerns from a few corners of the market, the broader narrative among analysts and traders remains centered around significant further upside. Technical patterns, historical comparisons, and sentiment indicators continue to paint a picture of strength as Bitcoin prepares for another phase of price discovery.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/traders-eye-bitcoin-surge-to-270k-despite-market-pause/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

2025-06-15T19:00:28,"Amid Bitcoin Hype, Seasoned Trader Predicts Sudden Drop To This Level","Bitcoin is at a crossroads again. Prices have been bouncing between $61,000 and $104,000 for about seven months. That range looks a lot like the $31,000–$64,000 sideways move before the sharp drop in early 2022. Traders and analysts are split over whether history is about to repeat itself or if fresh demand will keep Bitcoin aloft. Related Reading: Crypto Bloodbath: Over $1 Billion Liquidated As Iran-Israel Tensions Erupt Price Stuck In Familiar Range According to reports, Bitcoin’s stretch from $61k to $104k mirrors the 2020–2021 “distribution zone” when it traded between $31,000 and $64,000 for nearly a year. Back then, the slide came fast: Bitcoin peaked around $69,000 in November 2021, then sank to roughly $15,600 by November 2022. That was a nearly 78% plunge. Breakouts Keep Falling Flat Based on analysis from Michaël van de Poppe, Bitcoin tried and failed to stay above the $106k level this month. His chart showed a quick rejection at that barrier, triggering long‑side liquidations. The price slipped back to the $104k–$105k zone after the failed push higher. Traders see each unsuccessful breakout as a warning sign of distribution. November 2021 all over again? pic.twitter.com/lIA6QFhD9S — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) June 14, 2025 Risk Of Steep Slide According to veteran trader Peter Brandt, strong fundamentals often shine brightest right before a market top. He pointed out that if today’s setup leads to a similar 78% drop from the $105k band, Bitcoin could fall toward $23,600. His simple math recalls last cycle’s move from around $69k down to $15,500. Growing Demand Meets Technical Barriers Based on reports of spot ETFs and growing buys by institutions and governments, some believe the floor is firmer now. Huge investment flows into Bitcoin have never been higher. Yet technical hurdles remain. The inability to clear $105k makes some analysts cautious. Related Reading: $57 Million In Crypto And Counting: Trump’s World Liberty Connection Long Term Signals Still Bullish Trader Tardigrade noted that Bitcoin’s 50‑day and 200‑day simple moving averages recently formed a golden cross. In past cycles, that pattern led to gains of 50%, 125%, and 65%. It points to a possible rally if buyers step in around current levels. What It Means For Investors Bitcoin’s tug‑of‑war between caution and optimism is clear. On one side, pattern watchers warn of a big drop if support breaks. On the other, strong hands from big players may cushion any slide and spark a rally. Investors should keep an eye on $104k–$105k for signs of weakness or strength. A break below could open the door to a move toward $23,500. Conversely, a clean break above $106k might signal the next leg up. Regardless, volatility looks set to stay high, so risk management remains key.

2025-06-15T19:00:00,"Top cryptocurrencies to watch this week: XRP, Solana, Zetachain","The cryptocurrency market will have numerous catalysts this week, including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England interest rate decisions, the ongoing Iran and Israel crisis, and potential Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF inflows. This article explores the top three cryptocurrencies to watch this week, including Solana, Ripple, and Zetachain. SEC ruling on Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF looms Ripple ( XRP ) price will be a cryptocurrency to watch this week as the Securities and Exchange Commission delivers a ruling on Franklin Templeton ETF proposal on June 17. The most likely outcome is that the agency will postpone the ETF approval as it evaluates other proposals by companies like VanEck, Bitwise, and 21Shares. Most crypto traders believe that the agency, under Paul Atkins, will approve these ETFs by the end of the year. Polymarket odds of this approval have jumped to almost 90%. Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF decision comes as the coin has remained in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. It has formed a symmetrical triangle on the daily chart, pointing to a big breakout or breakdown in the next few weeks. One crypto pundit estimated that the coin will have a bullish breakout, which will align with Bitcoin price rising above the 8-year trendline that we covered here . XRP has been consolidating for 7 months since it pumped 700% after breaking out of the 7-year pennant, which I predicted. It has now reached the end of its healthy consolidation period. The next major move will begin soon and should align with Bitcoin breaking the 8-year line. https://t.co/D4dWE6powa pic.twitter.com/GSnXsghfbW — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) June 15, 2025 $275M token unlock could spark Solana rebound Solana ( SOL ) price has dropped by 21.7% from its highest point in May, meaning that it has moved into a local bear market. This crash has coincided with the ongoing sell-off of most of its meme coins. Solana price will be in the spotlight this week as the network will unlock tokens worth over $275 million on Saturday. These tokens represent about 0.36% of its float. Still, technicals point to a Solana price rebound, as it has formed a bullish flag pattern on the daily chart. This rebound will be confirmed if the token rises above the upper side of the descending channel at around $160.

It has plunged by over 80% from its highest point in 2024, partly because of its substantial monthly unlocks. These unlocks increase a token’s supply, which is risky, mainly when little demand exists. ZETA price will be in the spotlight this week as it unlocks tokens worth $8.6 million, representing 5% of the float. The daily chart above shows that the ZETA price has pulled back from a high of $0.3120 in May to $0.20 today. It failed to move below that support level three times since March, forming a triple-bottom pattern. Therefore, Zetachain price may bounce back this week if it holds the support at $0.20.

In a statement , the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Iowa says that 63-year-old Margo Ann Williams laundered $800,000 of proceeds from a scheme that was carried out between December 2022 and July 2023. According to evidence presented at the trial, the email accounts of the five victims – a Cedar Rapids church, two businesses, a non-profit and an individual – were hacked while they were in the process of making large wire and automatic clearinghouse (ACH) transfers. The victims received spoofed emails containing instructions to change the routing information for the wire and ACH transfers. Believing that the emails were from legitimate and trusted sources, the victims instructed their banks to wire the funds according to the supposed new payment instructions. The funds were rerouted to bank accounts that Williams controlled. She subsequently relocated the funds to other bank accounts under her control before transferring the money to two crypto exchanges and another person in Florida. The banks discovered William’s fraudulent activities and closed her accounts, but she kept opening new ones at other banks in an effort to keep the scheme alive. She earned approximately $25,000 from the operation and spent the funds on many personal purchases, including an Apple watch and a luxury bag. Williams, who claimed that she perpetrated the scheme at the direction of a famous British actor with whom she became romantically involved, was sentenced to four years in prison. She’s also ordered to pay $594,037 in restitution to her victims and must also serve a three-year term of supervised release following her imprisonment.

2025-06-15T18:30:33,"Owning One Bitcoin Now Seen as the New American Dream","Bitcoin is quickly becoming a major goal for younger investors in the United States. Crypto market activity is holding firm despite rising geopolitical tensions. Notably, the price of Bitcoin currently stands above $105,000. It is showing resilience in the face of recent volatility caused by conflict in the Middle East. New Priorities for the Next Generation In a major development, Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise Asset Management, believes owning one bitcoin is fast becoming the modern version of the American Dream. As reported by Coindesk, speaking on the Unchained podcast, Park explained that younger investors are moving away from traditional goals like home ownership. Instead, many are focused on owning a full bitcoin. According to him, they see it as a mark of financial freedom. According to Park, some even view it as a way to create lasting wealth across generations, calling it “retiring your bloodline. The emotional value attached to being a wholecoiner now goes beyond personal gain. It is also about securing a family legacy in a world where financial systems often feel unstable. It is worth noting that this view is not limited to individual investors. Leading asset management firms and major technology companies have also been favouring Bitcoin over traditional financial assets. For example, Strategy bought 1,045 BTC for $110.2 million between June 2 and 8 at an average price of $105,426. This brings its total holdings to 582,000 BTC, worth over $62 billion. Bitcoin Holds Steady After Geopolitical Jolt Bitcoin rebounded after a sharp drop below $104,000 triggered by Israel’s strike on Iran. Despite the shock, the leading cryptocurrency recovered quickly and is trading at $105,590, up 0.15% in the last 24 hours. Analysts highlight the $104,000 to $105,000 range as a strong support zone, based on high-volume buying during the dip. Technical data showed the price moving between $104,480 and $105,696 before closing near its current level. However, a notable breakout followed recently with Bitcoin jumping from $105,486 to $105,550. This rebound suggests underlying confidence in Bitcoin . Still overall market sentiment remains cautious. Traders are watching for a push toward the $106,000 mark, depending on continued buying strength. More Than an Asset — A Global Identity In the same podcast, Park also stressed that bitcoin’s global and neutral nature is part of its growing appeal. For many, it is not just a hedge or an investment. It is a statement of independence from centralised systems. As bitcoin remains above $105,000, its role in shaping financial identity continues to grow, especially among younger investors searching for stability and control. Still, Japanese tech company Remixpoint has recently expanded its Bitcoin treasury with a massive purchase of BTC. The firm recently added 56.87 BTC to its holdings, spending about ¥887 million, equivalent to about $6 million.

Mutuum Finance is now in Presale Phase 5 at $0.03. Investor interest is still incredibly robust, and over 12,000 investors have bought the token along with a total raise of $10.6 million. Investors who get in on this level will see 100% return on investment when the token is launched at $0.06. As traders search for the best crypto to buy in 2025 or what to buy before June ends, Mutuum Finance is becoming the breakout story of the season. Bitcoin Eyes New Highs Backed by Institutional Momentum Bitcoin remains steady, trading around $107,803, with intraday highs near $110,277 and lows around $107,491. Institutional demand is driving the narrative, large inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury purchases continue to support BTC’s bullish outlook. Technical indicators suggest Bitcoin is carving out a bullish breakout, with its recent bull flag formation and a golden cross between the 50- and 200-day moving averages pointing toward a potential retest of its May peak near $112,000. Analysts from firms such as Bitwise and Bernstein have issued conservative 2025 targets of $200,000, citing macroeconomic tailwinds like easing inflation and further ETF expansion. Mutuum Finance Presale Explodes Past $10.6M Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum in presale. Phase 5 of the presale is surging as investors rush to grab tokens at just $0.03 before the next price hike, and with good reason. While meme coins come and go, Mutuum Finance is built on real fundamentals, real innovation, and real staying power. With over 12,000 early adopters already in and $10.6 million raised, this isn’t just hype, it’s a full-blown movement. At this price, Phase 5 is the final window to get in cheap. The next presale round jumps to $0.035, and the token is set to launch at $0.06, meaning investors who move now could lock in a 100% return before launch even begins. $100K Up for Grabs Mutuum Finance is rewarding early entry with token value and giving back in a big way. The project is running a $100,000 giveaway , and 10 lucky investors will each walk away with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. In addition, the top 50 MUTM holders are also being rewarded with exclusive bonus tokens in a competitive, real-time leaderboard that adds gamified excitement to the investment process. Mutuum Finance is also rewriting the DeFi rulebook with its hybrid lending protocol, a powerful fusion of peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) models. Last Call Before Prices Climb The momentum is real, and the presale is moving fast. With a fast-growing investor base, a clear roadmap, and serious innovation, Mutuum Finance is becoming one of the biggest DeFi breakouts of 2025. If you wait until the price hits $0.035 or watch it launch at $0.06, you’ll be chasing gains instead of securing them. Act now. Join the early believers. And don’t miss your shot at exponential returns, leaderboard rewards, and a shot at $10K in free tokens. Claim your MUTM tokens before the next price hike hits.

2025-06-15T18:30:00,"Quantum Countdown: How Bitcoin’s 15-year shield faces its biggest threat yet","The Bitcoin network has been safe and stable for 15 years. However, elliptic curve cryptography, or ECC, was created in 1985 to protect Bitcoin, and concerns about its soon-to-be obsolescence intensify each year. The emerging technology of quantum computers challenges the network’s security. Crypto.news discussed the future of Bitcoin in the post-quantum era with Kapil Dhiman, the CEO of Quranium, a Layer 1 blockchain protocol optimized for post-quantum security, AI integration, and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility. How did you realize that quantum computers are a threat, and when did you start dedicating most of your time to finding a solution? Dhiman : During my consulting days at PwC, I began to see a recurring blind spot: quantum computing. While most of the industry was focused on scaling and interoperability, few seriously considered the existential threat that quantum computers pose to current cryptographic infrastructure, including blockchain. Early on, I realized that this wasn’t just a theoretical risk sitting decades away. The pace of advancement, especially with quantum advantage edging closer, meant that we needed to act now, not after the breach. By late 2023, it was clear to me that the digital world as we know it, from DeFi to identity systems, could be compromised without quantum-proof infrastructure. In early 2024, I joined forces with Zeeshan and Yaduvendra to co-found Quranium , a new Layer 1 built from the ground up to be quantum-secure, AI-native, and ready to protect the next era of the internet. Since then, this mission has been my whole focus. We’re not just building a blockchain. We’re building the digital shield for everything that’s coming next. What exactly is a Q-Day? How much time do we have? Dhiman : Q-Day is the term we use for the moment quantum computers become powerful enough to break widely used cryptographic systems, including RSA, ECC, and the algorithms securing most blockchains and online banking today. But unlike Y2K, it won’t be a neatly marked day on the calendar. It could happen quietly; a breakthrough in a lab, or worse, behind closed doors in the hands of adversaries. We might only realise it’s happened after the damage is done. That’s what makes it so dangerous: there’s no global countdown clock ticking toward Q-Day. So how much time do we have? That’s the unknown. Some estimates suggest by 2030. But even before the hardware arrives, the threat is real, thanks to “store now, decrypt later” (SNDL) strategies. Encrypted data is already being harvested today, just waiting for quantum power to catch up. The consequences could be enormous. Take Bitcoin: it’s acutely vulnerable. As I mentioned recently in WIRED , the only viable fix would be a hard fork, requiring 51% consensus across the network and a coordinated migration of funds. If quantum capability lands before that happens, Bitcoin could collapse overnight. It’s a ticking time bomb. You might also like: Exclusive: Crypto exchange ZBX aims to defeat ‘Q-Day’ with Naoris tech People who read about the crypto sector every day, usually associate the threat of quantum computing with cracking their wallets. But this threat stretches to other sectors as well. If the problem is ignored, can we see the banking system getting critically damaged? Or lots of personal data from messengers and social media platforms freely floating online? AI-backed systems going crazy and stuff like that? What is the worst scenario? Dhiman : You’re absolutely right. Most people in crypto worry about quantum cracking their wallets, but the threat goes far beyond that. If we ignore this problem, we’re not just discussing financial loss. We’re talking about the foundations of digital trust breaking down. Think about the systems that run our world today: banking, healthcare, messaging apps, cloud platforms, and AI services. They all rely on cryptographic systems that were never designed to withstand a quantum-capable adversary. If quantum computers can break widely used encryption like RSA or ECC, then yes, banks could be compromised, personal messages could be exposed, and deep systems like national IDs or military comms could be intercepted. It wouldn’t be just about money anymore. It would be about identity, privacy, and sovereignty. Worst-case scenario? Imagine an AI system trained on poisoned data or manipulated in real-time. Imagine diplomatic secrets leaked from old encrypted emails. Or financial systems manipulated quietly because the attacker had access for months before anyone even noticed. At the end of the day, this isn’t a tech issue; it’s a civilization-level trust issue. Given the possible implications, it seems that regulators worldwide should react to the emergence of quantum computing. Will the distribution of these computers be somewhat controlled? If this technology is that explosive, will it be as hard to obtain as nuclear weapons? Are regulators around the world working on it? Dhiman : That’s a great and very important question, and one that regulators are only just starting to grapple with. Quantum computing may not have the explosive visuals of nuclear weapons, but its impact could be just as far-reaching, especially in the digital realm. We’re talking about breaking encryption, compromising national security systems, and even destabilizing the trust models that underpin global finance and communications. Right now, quantum systems are expensive, centralized, and limited to a few governments, labs, and major tech players. So yes – there’s still some natural control around access. But that’s not going to last forever. We’ve seen it before with AI and other frontier tech. Once the tools get smaller, cheaper, and more available, the risk multiplies. That said, we’re starting to see regulatory moves. The U.S. has already imposed export controls on quantum technologies, and the EU, Switzerland, and other countries are following suit. There’s no global treaty yet, but there’s a growing awareness that this tech can’t remain ungoverned. Will access be as tightly controlled as nuclear weapons? Probably not. But we are moving toward what I’d call a managed chokehold; restrictions on exports, funding, and cloud-based access to quantum infrastructure. Think of it as governments trying to slow the spread while they play catch-up. That’s why readiness matters. Regulators can try to contain the technology, but it’s already out of the lab. The only real defense is upgrading our infrastructure. That’s the future we’re building toward at Quranium: quantum-secure by design, so we’re not waiting for the world to act; we’re already ahead of it. You told the Korea IT Times that opposing the quantum threat is about technology and global collaboration. Do you see this collaboration happening, and are you optimistic? Dhiman : Yes, I did say that, and I stand by it more than ever. Fighting the quantum threat isn’t just about rolling out better cryptography. It’s about aligning global priorities. Because let’s be honest, a quantum attack doesn’t respect borders. If someone breaks encryption in one part of the world, the ripple effects can go global in seconds. I’ve had the chance to speak with people across different regions, in Switzerland, the UAE, the U.S, South East Asia, and what gives me optimism is that there’s a real shift happening. Governments are investing in quantum readiness. Enterprises, especially in finance and identity, are starting to ask the right questions. We’re seeing more cross-border partnerships and collaborations form and Quranium is part of that conversation. We’ve co-hosted sessions like The Quantum Threat: Future-Proofing Finance in Singapore with PwC, and partnered with innovators globally to move this forward. South Korea is a great example. Their National Strategic Plan for Quantum Science and Technology initiative is entirely centered on international collaboration, not just to develop the tech, but to build a secure ecosystem around it. Their 2023 joint statement with the U.S. also laid out a clear plan for working together on quantum science and cybersecurity. When you pair that with efforts from the EU, India, and strategic bodies like the World Economic Forum and CSIS, you see a fragmented but growing fabric of collaboration. So am I optimistic? Yes, but cautiously. The momentum is there. The conversations are happening. But this can’t be a wait-and-watch moment. Quantum is moving fast and we need to move faster. If we get this right, we don’t just neutralize the threat, we unlock entirely new opportunities for secure, intelligent infrastructure on a global scale. Recently, BlackRock warned its customers about Bitcoin’s vulnerability associated with quantum computing. That was probably the first instance when a high-profile company voiced the problem. Do you see big players doing anything else about the quantum threat on top of raising awareness? What big companies on top of BlackRock and Google were discussing the problem? Dhiman : Yes, BlackRock’s statement marked a turning point. For a traditional asset manager of that scale to publicly warn about quantum threats, it sent a strong signal. It’s no longer just cryptographers or blockchain startups talking about this. The alarm bells are starting to ring in boardrooms. Beyond BlackRock, we’ve seen activity from companies like Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon. They’re not just developing quantum hardware, they’re investing in post-quantum security standards. Cloud providers, for example, are piloting quantum-safe protocols for enterprise clients. JPMorgan, Visa, and other financial giants are also researching how to future-proof sensitive systems. That said, there’s still a disconnect. Many efforts are siloed, focused more on innovation and research than on coordinated defense or industry-wide migration. Outside of BlackRock, we haven’t yet seen a collective commitment to adopt quantum-resistant systems. Especially in decentralized ecosystems like Bitcoin, where coordination is difficult, real change will take time. Have you had discussions with big influencers and what’s your opinion on their awareness and readiness to step in? Do influencers outside of the crypto community ring the alarm? Dhiman : As for influencers, awareness is rising in crypto circles. Accounts like Coin Bureau are helping to amplify the message and encourage community discussions around protocols like QRAMP (Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol). Outside crypto, though engagement is still scattered. Some commentators like tech commentator Chamath Palihapitiya mention quantum here and there, often reacting to headlines like Google’s progress, but there’s no deep push yet for systemic change. That’s why Quranium is leaning in, not only by building infrastructure ready for the quantum era, but by keeping the conversation going across industries and communities. The more we raise awareness now, the more time we buy to ensure the transition is smooth, secure, and inclusive. I’ve seen a survey by Quranium. It reveals that people holding crypto are well aware of the problem and they want to protect their funds but most of them have no idea how to do it. Can you describe transitioning from vulnerable wallets to quantum-proof wallets from the user’s perspective? What can be already done? Dhiman : That stat you mentioned, “78% willing to switch for quantum-safe security”, really jumped out at us too. It’s clear: the community wants protection, but most people don’t know how to get there. And that’s not their fault. The current wallet ecosystem just hasn’t given users any clear path forward. From a user’s perspective, transitioning to a quantum-secure wallet shouldn’t be complicated. At Quranium, we built QSafe with that in mind. It feels like any other modern wallet: easy to set up a familiar interface, but under the hood, it uses post-quantum cryptography by default. That means your keys, backups, and transactions are secured with algorithms that can withstand quantum attacks, like SPHINCS+ and ML-KEM. Users can already take action. With QSafe, for example, the process is simple: Create a wallet, secure your recovery phrase, activate post-quantum settings (built-in by default), and move assets over from your existing wallet. There is no need to wait for a protocol upgrade or a hard fork. For those still using vulnerable wallets, the first step is awareness, understanding what protects your assets, and whether your current provider is even thinking about the quantum threat. Unfortunately, the survey showed that most aren’t. What we’re seeing is a shift. People are moving toward using their wallets like banks. But unlike banks, we don’t get to rely on regulators or insurance to back us up. It’s self-custody, which means the responsibility is higher, but so is the need for better tools. The dormant bitcoins question. Who will be in charge of unlocking the stuck bitcoins? Will they end up being grabbed by quantum raiders? Dhiman : This is one of the most uncomfortable truths about the quantum threat and one that very few people want to discuss. Dormant bitcoins, especially those sitting in old wallets with exposed public keys and no movement for years, are essentially low-hanging fruit for quantum computers. If Q-Day arrives before a hard fork or a protocol-wide upgrade, those coins can be stolen without any chance of recovery. So who’s in charge of unlocking them? Technically, no one. These wallets don’t have active guardians or access controls beyond their cryptography. If that cryptography breaks and quantum computers can derive private keys from public ones, those funds are as good as gone. That includes Satoshi’s wallets, which hold about $100 billion worth of BTC. In that scenario, it won’t be “unlocking,” it’ll be looting. Quantum raiders, whether state-backed or rogue actors, could sweep those wallets. And the worst part? You won’t even know it happened until the coins start moving. The chain won’t raise any red flags because from its point of view, the attacker has a valid private key. Unless Bitcoin undergoes a hard fork to adopt post-quantum cryptography in time, which is a monumental task requiring global coordination, there’s no central authority to protect those dormant coins. That’s why we keep saying: the clock is ticking. Security by consensus is powerful, but when facing something like quantum, it has to be fast too. Will quantum computers serve to improve the security of the crypto sector or benefit it the other way? If so, what are the possible use cases? Dhiman : Quantum computing is a double-edged sword for the crypto sector. On one hand, it’s the single biggest threat to the cryptographic foundations most blockchains rely on, especially those using RSA and elliptic curve signatures, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Algorithms like Shor’s can break these within hours once we hit the 2,000–4,000 logical qubit mark, and based on current trajectories, that could happen by the early 2030s. But that’s just one side of the story. Quantum tech could also strengthen the crypto space if we’re prepared. Take quantum random number generation (QRNG): it creates truly unpredictable keys, which could reduce wallet-level vulnerabilities. JPMorgan and Quantinuum have already shown how this works in finance, and crypto could follow. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is another example. It’s being tested in places like China for ultra-secure communication over long distances. If applied to crypto exchanges or high-value wallets, QKD could add a layer of defense that current systems lack. Beyond security, quantum computing could optimize how smart contracts are written, tested, and patched, especially in DeFi, where vulnerabilities can cause cascading failures. It could also supercharge fraud detection systems, giving AI tools the boost they need to analyze transactions and flag suspicious behavior in real time. So yes, quantum could benefit crypto but only if we get ahead of the threat first. If we delay the transition to post-quantum cryptography, then all these benefits won’t matter because we’ll be too busy dealing with the fallout. It’s a race: proactive adoption turns quantum into an ally. Waiting too long turns it into a wrecking ball.

2025-06-15T18:06:02,"Bitcoin Bull vs. Neo Pepe Protocol—Where Will Smart Investors Go?","The post Bitcoin Bull vs. Neo Pepe Protocol—Where Will Smart Investors Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is a constantly evolving battleground where seasoned investors must differentiate between short-lived excitement and enduring, visionary projects. As investor interest continues to surge, two crypto presales have come into sharp focus: Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) and Neo Pepe Protocol ($NEOP) . Each offers distinctive paths forward, representing fundamentally different approaches to investing, decentralization, and long-term market engagement. Discerning investors need to carefully evaluate the underlying strengths, governance frameworks, liquidity structures, and symbolic messaging of each project to identify which offers the most robust potential. Symbolic Power and Narrative Appeal—Traditional Optimism vs. Revolutionary Vision Bitcoin Bull presents a straightforward narrative of traditional market optimism, leveraging bullish sentiments deeply rooted in Bitcoin’s historic performance. This simplicity and familiarity resonate with investors seeking secure, predictable associations, banking on Bitcoin’s proven market appeal and emotional resonance. Conversely, Neo Pepe Protocol boldly positions itself as a Revolutionary Crypto project through its distinctive narrative, the Memetrix. It emphasizes decentralization, rebellion against systemic financial oppression, and rejection of market saturation. Investors in Neo Pepe are not merely participating financially but are part of a significant cultural and economic movement. This visionary symbolism attracts those seeking impactful change alongside substantial financial returns. Presale Dynamics and Liquidity Strategies—Balancing Urgency with Stability Presale structures significantly influence investor decisions. Bitcoin Bull’s traditional, predictable approach offers minimal urgency, potentially limiting initial momentum and growth. Neo Pepe Protocol, however, employs a meticulously structured presale designed to amplify investor engagement and urgency: 16-Stage Escalation : Incrementally increasing token prices from $0.05 to $0.16, incentivizing swift investor action. Hourly Token Unlocking Post-Launch : Gradual token releases maintain sustained market engagement and prevent oversaturation. Additionally, Neo Pepe’s sophisticated auto-liquidity mechanism directly addresses volatility and enhances stability: Auto-Liquidity Generation : Every transaction contributes a 2.5% boost to liquidity pools. LP Token Burn : Immediate burning of liquidity provider tokens permanently locks liquidity, significantly stabilizing the asset. These combined presale dynamics and liquidity measures position Neo Pepe as a safer, yet aggressively growth-oriented investment opportunity, appealing especially to those prioritizing risk mitigation. Decentralized Governance—Investor Empowerment and Transparency Robust governance structures foster investor confidence and project integrity. Bitcoin Bull’s governance model remains opaque, potentially limiting investor insight and influence. Neo Pepe Protocol, in contrast, offers a comprehensive, transparent decentralized governance model designed explicitly to empower investors: Delegated Voting Power : Investors actively influence decisions through token delegation. Transparent Treasury Management : Community-driven oversight eliminates misuse concerns, ensuring funds are appropriately allocated. Mandatory Timelock for Decisions : Deliberate decision-making periods reinforce accountability and investor trust. This governance approach distinctly positions Neo Pepe as a compelling choice for investors demanding transparency, active participation, and collective stewardship. Comparative Market Context and Investor Outlook Amid a competitive presale environment featuring projects like Solaxy (SOLX), Antix (ANTIX), and Catslap (SLAP), Neo Pepe’s meticulous attention to liquidity, presale strategy, and governance transparency significantly differentiates it. This careful consideration distinctly surpasses Bitcoin Bull’s more conventional narrative and simpler tokenomics. For seasoned crypto investors, Neo Pepe Protocol clearly stands out by blending visionary symbolism, strategic presale momentum, innovative liquidity management, and transparent governance. These compelling elements not only minimize typical early-stage risks but also maximize long-term project viability and investor confidence. Conclusion—Why Neo Pepe Emerges as the Superior Investment Choice Ultimately, comparing Bitcoin Bull and Neo Pepe Protocol highlights stark contrasts in narrative depth, liquidity strategies, presale dynamics, and governance transparency. Bitcoin Bull’s straightforward, familiar approach provides initial comfort but lacks essential sophistication and investor empowerment crucial for sustained success. Neo Pepe Protocol emerges decisively as the smarter, more robust investment opportunity, uniquely combining ideological strength with operational stability and investor-focused governance. For investors seeking meaningful long-term value and active participation in a genuinely transformative project, Neo Pepe Protocol stands as a clear frontrunner, marking a significant step forward in crypto empowerment and decentralization. Investors interested in participating in this groundbreaking project should consider securing their tokens early by visiting Neo Pepe’s presale page—act now to join the forefront of crypto innovation and decentralization.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/bitcoin-bull-vs-neo-pepe-protocol-where-will-smart-investors-go/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Sponsored",cryptocompare

Both billionaires are asserting that Bitcoin has the capacity to become the reserve currency of the world. Speaking at this year’s State of Crypto Summit, the Coinbase head highlighted the struggle faced by different governments in their attempt to contain deficit spending. He shares his optimistic outlook for Bitcoin as an alternative currency capable of containing the rise in deficit spending, adding that mass adoption is underway. The crypto billionaire further expressed confidence in this series of events, adding that it could position Bitcoin as a universal reserve currency. “Democracies around the world are really struggling to get their deficit spending under control. I guess my crazy little idea is that I think Bitcoin is going to provide an important check and balance on deficit spending, and if it gets out of control too much, people will flee to it in times of uncertainty, and it could actually end up that Bitcoin is the new reserve currency of the world.” He asserted . Paul Graham, who reacted to Brian Armstrong’s statement, explained that the driving force behind his decision to purchase Bitcoin in its early days was tied to the possibility that it would eventually become a global store of value. “When I first bought some (or at least talked to you about buying some) in 2013, that was the reason: as insurance against it becoming the world’s reserve currency.” He wrote . When asked if his Bitcoin holdings were still intact, he responded in affirmation: “I assume so,” he wrote in a follow-up post. At report time, Bitcoin is valued at $105,566 per coin. The leading asset has managed to clear off weekly losses, although it remains to be seen whether selling pressure is contained throughout the weekend.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/these-two-billionaires-are-convinced-that-bitcoin-could-become-a-world-reserve-currency/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|SPONSORED","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

Hoskinson is confident that converting millions of ADA tokens to Bitcoin and other stablecoins could accomplish this. More precisely, the Cardano boss told viewers on a recent YouTube live stream that setting aside $100 million worth of ADA tokens from its treasury and converting them to Bitcoin and selected stablecoins could strengthen Cardano’s DeFi network. As he is quoted as saying; “What I’d like to see is could we take about $100 million worth of ADA in the treasury and convert it to a blend of a collection of stable coins and incumbent in Cardano, so USDM, USDA, as well as ADA-backed stablecoin synthetics like IUSD, and also convert some of it to Bitcoin to prime the Bitcoin DeFi.” He asserts that the goal is to increase the DeFi to stablecoin ratios, bringing them into line with those of other DeFi ecosystems. Hoskinson targets a 33% to 40% ratio between stablecoin issuance and total locked value (TLV) on the network. Hoskinson further explained that with millions of ADA transfers being recorded daily, a significant transfer of funds might have little to no impact on the price of the ADA token as liquidity could still be enhanced with over-the-counter trades, among other things. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of ADA change hands on a daily basis, and the markets are deep enough that it could absorb within 30 to 90 days using TWAPs, OTCs, and other mechanisms, a hundred million dollar sale without moving the ADA price in any significant fashion.” He stated. At report time, ADA is valued at $0.6 per token. With altcoins collectively taking a hit, ADA has also not been spared. While 30-day losses have crossed 20%, over 4.35% has been sustained in losses over the last 7 days.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-shares-master-plan-to-usher-in-massive-liquidation-for-cardano/,"ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano",cryptocompare

Yet, beyond the headlines, a quieter surge is unfolding inside the DeFi sector. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending protocol currently in its presale phase, is making waves with soaring participation numbers, aggressive volume growth, and unmatched investor momentum. With over $10.55 million already raised and more than 12,000 holders onboarded, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be one of the most in-demand tokens of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building for function, not just FOMO Unlike speculative assets driven only by hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being built with strong DeFi fundamentals. The protocol will allow users to lend and borrow a variety of crypto assets using two mechanisms: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will deposit assets like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Avalanche (AVAX), or Solana (SOL) into shared liquidity pools. In the P2P model, users will be able to negotiate lending terms directly, bypassing automated rates to set custom deals. This will be especially useful for trading in tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), or Shiba Inu (SHIB)—assets not usually supported on major platforms. At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reward users who provide liquidity through non-custodial smart contracts. When users deposit assets, they will receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens will represent both the initial deposit and the interest earned, growing in value as borrowing activity increases. Unlike staking systems that rely on inflationary rewards, interest on Mutuum will come from actual borrower demand—ensuring more sustainable returns. Users aiming for passive income can stake their mtTokens in a safety module to receive dividend distributions in the form of MUTM tokens. These dividends will be funded by the protocol’s revenue, primarily from borrower interest. To maintain upward demand pressure on the token price, the protocol will use part of its earnings to buy MUTM on the open market and distribute it to stakers. While the crypto world watches Bitcoin (BTC)’s dominance climb with renewed excitement, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly outpacing most of the market in volume and holder count. The presale’s strong engagement reflects growing investor confidence in protocols with real utility, especially those that are still undervalued ahead of major exchange listings. With a fixed total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens and a listing price expected to open at $0.06, many believe the current $0.03 presale rate presents an entry opportunity with high upside. With the ongoing $100K giveaway , this early-stage advantage is becoming rare in a market where many altcoins have already priced in future expectations. The stablecoin advantage and layered ecosystem growth One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s most important innovations is its upcoming decentralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized or fiat-backed options, this stablecoin will be minted directly from overcollateralized on-chain assets already held in the protocol. This system will increase transparency and maintain algorithmic supply adjustments, allowing users to borrow against stable value without relying on external reserves. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already achieved key milestones in its first phase. These include executing the presale, launching marketing campaigns, listing on crypto tracking platforms, and initiating a smart contract audit by CertiK. As the roadmap progresses into development-focused phases, the team will deliver key infrastructure: smart contracts, frontend dApps, and full backend integration. Phase 3 will include testnet beta testing and a functional demo version. Once this is complete, the project will move into Phase 4, where the live platform will go public. The MUTM token will be listed on major exchanges, and investors will be able to claim and use their tokens in the working platform. At that stage, the dividend mechanisms, smart contract lending, and user dashboard will become fully operational—solidifying MUTM as a functional asset rather than just a speculative token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers use, not just hype As Bitcoin (BTC) climbs toward new peaks, investor attention naturally gravitates toward established names. But history shows that once top-tier coins reach all-time highs, smart money begins rotating into newer protocols offering real utility and stronger upside. That’s where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself: not as a hype machine, but as a working product with yield, utility, and growth potential. Its passive income structure, overcollateralized borrowing system, and smart contract-driven ecosystem offer clear financial pathways for both cautious and active participants. The upcoming stablecoin and expanding cross-chain features will only deepen its market relevance, while token buybacks and dividend mechanisms will support long-term value for users. While Bitcoin (BTC) holders are celebrating the $112K milestone, those who joined Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.03 are watching their early-stage investment move toward real-world application, token appreciation, and income-generating possibilities. As the protocol prepares for its official launch, one thing is clear—Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not waiting for permission to lead the next wave of DeFi.

According to a new report from the New York Post, records released by the Office of Government Ethics show that Trump’s stake in WLFI raked in just over $57.3 million for him, one of his largest sources of income in the past year. WLFI, which was launched last year, was co-founded by Trump’s three sons – Donald Jr., Eric and Barron – and others as a response to what they say is the growing politicization of the banking system. Previously, Donald Trump Jr. said that his family was debanked after getting into politics and described the banking system as a “pyramid scheme.” “There was a time… where I could call any single banker in New York City, they’d pick up the phone [and] I’d be able to get a loan for whatever real estate project I was doing across the street. Then we got into politics, and all of a sudden, they wouldn’t take your call. You couldn’t get financing. We were debanked.” The disclosure reports that Trump’s personal crypto wallet is valued at between $1,000,001 and $5 million while listing millions of dollars worth of royalty payments he received for selling items with his name and likeness. Some of the President’s noteworthy liabilities include $100 million worth of mortgage loans for various properties, hundreds of millions of dollars worth of lawsuits and tens of thousands of dollars worth of credit card bills.

Amid this clash, the crypto market is also affected, as Bitcoin and altcoins are witnessing selling pressure. However, Ravencoin’s trend is still bullish, and it is coming down to its key levels from where it can bounce again. Let’s find the key levels in detail in this Ravencoin price prediction. Table of Contents What is Ravencoin? Ravencoin price prediction Ravencoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook Ravencoin price prediction 2025 Ravencoin price prediction 2030 Since its launch, Ravencoin ( RVN ) has reached an all-time high of $0.27391, followed by a 1363% price drop. At the time of writing, it is currently trading at $0.0196, which represents a 45% drop from $0.03573, which was seen 5 months ago in December 2024.. RVN 1 week chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss RVN price prediction by giving you its short-term and long-term price forecasts and exploring whether this token can continue its bullish run. You might also like: What Is Ravencoin (RVN) and Is It a Legit Cryptocurrency? What is Ravencoin? The goal of Ravencoin, a digital peer-to-peer (P2P) network, is to deploy a use case-specific blockchain that is intended to effectively manage a single function: the transfer of assets between parties. Built on a fork of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) code, Ravencoin was first announced on October 31, 2017, and on January 3, 2018, it released binaries for mining. This was known as a fair launch because there was no premine, initial coin offering, or masternodes. Its name was inspired by the Game of Thrones television series. Ravencoin, which is a fork of the BTC code, has four major features: a mining algorithm (KAWPOW, formerly X16R and X16RV2 respectively) designed to lessen the centralization of mining brought on by ASIC hardware; a modified issuance schedule (with a block reward of 5,000 RVN); a block time reduction to one minute; and a coin supply cap of 21 billion, which is a thousand times greater than BTC. Ravencoin seeks to address the issue of blockchain trade and asset transfers. In the past, an asset produced on the BTC blockchain could unintentionally be destroyed when the coins used to create it were traded. Token assets on the Ravenchain can only be issued by burning RVN coins, which are intended to function as internal currency within the network. A stake of a project, such as equities and securities, airline miles, an hour’s pay, or real-world custodial items like gold or actual euros, can all be represented by the assets. Now let’s discuss RVN price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Ravencoin price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the RVN token? Let’s dive into the RVN price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Ravencoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Ravencoin price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to drop by -0.85% and reach $0.01973 by July 13, 2025. As of June. 13th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the RVN price outlook has turned slightly bullish, with 14 technical analysis indicators showing bullish signals, 4 indicating bearish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Ravencoin price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the RVN token’s price could fluctuate between $0.0170 and $0.0418, and may likely hold a yearly average of $0.0358. CoinCodex projects that the RVN token can trade in the price channel of $0.019725 and $0.021148 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in RVN or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Ravencoin price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Ravencoin crypto price prediction for 2030, RVN’s price could vary between $0.02421 and $0.026785. DigitalCoinPrice expects that RVN’s price could climb to $0.0904 and $0.10 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the RVN price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the RVN token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including RVN. A great way for RVN to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the RVN token.

Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the RVN token. Will Ravencoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is challenging to predict the exact value of the RVN token, it is essential to watch for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Ravencoin price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low RVN can go. Should I invest in Ravencoin? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Ravencoin price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Additionally, it is worth noting that cryptocurrencies, in general, are highly speculative investments, and their success relies not only on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the RVN token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

2025-06-15T16:13:42,"Kaspa Early Investors Now Flocking to Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Don’t Miss Bitcoin’s Second Coming","The post Kaspa Early Investors Now Flocking to Bitcoin Solaris: ‘Don’t Miss Bitcoin’s Second Coming appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Kaspa was once the darling of proof-of-work maximalists. Its DAG-based structure and high-speed execution brought serious gains to those who believed early. But now, many of those same investors are pivoting fast. The destination? Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), a radically engineered blockchain designed not just for speed or security, but for unlocking real wealth for the everyday person. For many, it’s not just another altcoin—it’s Bitcoin’s second coming. Kaspa Had Its Run—But the Momentum Has Shifted There’s no denying Kaspa’s early promise. With block times measured in seconds and an innovative take on consensus, it drew praise from technologists and traders alike. But despite its brilliance, it’s facing limitations. Kaspa lacks a layered architecture, has no native staking, and remains too niche for widespread adoption. Bitcoin Solaris, by contrast, is proving irresistible to those who profited from Kaspa’s rise and are now seeking the next transformative leap. With stronger architecture, a mobile-first strategy, and an entirely different approach to community growth, BTC-S is emerging as the smarter play. Bitcoin Solaris: Where Power Meets Purpose At the core of Bitcoin Solaris lies a dual-consensus model. Its Base Layer uses Proof-of-Work to maintain the Bitcoin ethos—decentralization, fairness, and security. But layered on top is the Solaris Layer, a Delegated Proof-of-Stake system that delivers 100,000 TPS and 2-second finality. Together, they form a blockchain that is: Scalable beyond legacy limits Energy-efficient, consuming 99.95% less than Bitcoin Fully ready for smart contracts and real-world utility The upcoming Solaris Nova App takes this even further, allowing users to mine BTC-S directly from their smartphones, without any need for expensive rigs or technical setup. (You can preview the rewards using this mining calculator ). Liquid Staking Built for Real Users Bitcoin Solaris goes beyond passive holding with its liquid staking system. Once staked, BTC-S tokens become sBTC-S, a fully tradable version that can still earn rewards while remaining usable in DeFi. Rewards + Liquidity in one Compatible with DeFi protocols Strengthens the network through participation Managed easily through the Solaris Nova App Mine BTC-S, Stack Wealth, No Hardware Needed Referrals That Reward Both Sides Unlike most projects that only reward one party, Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double rewards referral program . When someone joins through a referral, both the inviter and the new buyer receive 5% in BTC-S tokens automatically. Growing Buzz from Influencers and Analysts The buzz surrounding Bitcoin Solaris is impossible to ignore. A comprehensive review by 2Bit Crypto dives into why so many believe BTC-S is the only serious challenger to Bitcoin’s original mission. Meanwhile, Ben Crypto highlights its unique technical strengths and how mobile mining could redefine mass adoption. It’s not just a trend, it’s a migration. From Telegram groups to X threads, crypto enthusiasts are calling it a fresh start for people priced out of traditional mining or slow chains. Presale Demand Hits New Heights Bitcoin Solaris is now in phase 7 of its presale, with the price currently at $7 and climbing soon to $8. The launch is locked for July 31, with a $20 token price target—a potential 187% return for today’s buyers. Over 11,500+ users already joined $4.5M+ raised, gaining momentum by the day Only weeks left before the presale ends Recognized as one of the shortest and most aggressive launches in 2025 This is where Bitcoin Solaris truly shines . It’s not just about tech, it’s about access. It’s about giving everyday people a fair shot before the whales even wake up. The Final Word: Why This Matters Now Bitcoin Solaris isn’t here to replace Bitcoin. It’s here to complement it with better tools, more access, and faster pathways to growth. It carries the spirit of early Bitcoin but upgrades the infrastructure to serve today’s reality. No massive rigs, no centralized mining pools, only speed, fairness, and utility in your hands. Kaspa was a brilliant chapter. But the next chapter is already being written, and BTC-S is on the cover.

2025-06-15T16:11:59,"From meme to the moon: Why LILPEPE might outperform XRP this bull cycle","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP eyes $10 as Bitcoin targets $200k, but rising memecoin LILPEPE may outshine Ripple in 2025’s bullish crypto market. Ripple is in the news again as the cryptocurrency market readies itself for a potential growth spurt. Analysts are predicting Bitcoin to surge to $200,000, which in turn would allow XRP to reach $10. They attribute this to a potent combination of positive technical indicators, institutional demand, and favorable regulations. But XRP is gaining ground. While Little Pepe, a memecoin, is gaining prominence, it is also becoming a significant player in the market. Powered by meme magic and battle-hardened blockchain engineering, LILPEPE is a breakout penny crypto that has the potential to surpass even XRP’s stellar projections in 2025. Here’s why investing in LILPEPE could be a lucrative opportunity during this meme-fueled bull market. You might also like: XRP price nears big move as RLUSD flirts with $500m milestone BTC at $200,000? XRP’s path to $10 looks real The conditions are favorable for Bitcoin to make a significant surge towards $200,000. With over $126 billion now locked into spot Bitcoin ETFs and exchange balances dwindling, the case for BTC’s 83% rise from $109K is becoming increasingly compelling. Altcoin surges historically follow a breakout to these levels, and XRP sits at the front of that wave. XRP has outperformed BTC by a massive 343% over the last 12 months. Analysts, based on projections of the XRP/BTC ratio, anticipate clear targets at $4.35 and $5, with a potential peak at $10. Add Ripple’s ongoing legal wins and increasing institutional usage as a payment solution, and there is a fundamentally strong asset with explosive potential. The meme kingdom: Why LILPEPE will shine brighter than XRP While XRP has institutional respect, LILPEPE commands the culture. The memecoin revolution has minted millionaires from mere memes. Launched on June 10, 2025, LILPEPE is revolutionizing the industry with a Layer 2 chain designed explicitly for memes, offering speed, affordability, security, and legendary status. Imagine a memecoin that doesn’t just exist on Ethereum but out-memes Ethereum itself. LILPEPE is the world’s first Layer 2 dedicated entirely to memes, with sniper-bot protection, zero tax, and a Launchpad (“Pump Pad”) tailored to launch viral meme projects straight to the moon. Why LILPEPE could dominate in 2025: Zero Tax, No Bots: Built-in sniper bot resistance ensures fair launches. Fast Finality: Transactions confirm faster than Elon tweets. Presale Still Live: Stage 1 ongoing; over $447,000 already raised at $0.001 per token. Tokenomics Made for Mooning: 100b total supply, with 26.5B allocated for presale. That’s your low-entry opportunity. CEX Listings: Plans confirmed for two top-tier exchange listings post-launch, strategically targeting the world’s biggest exchange. Buy LILPEPE with ETH or USDT via MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Tokens are claimable after the presale ends; just connect a wallet and flex the memecoins. Not just another frog: The rise of the meme empire From the swamps of Solidity and the jungles of JavaScript, a small yet powerful hero emerged — Little Pepe. LILPEPE isn’t some recycled Pepe wannabe. He is the inheritor of the meme throne. With a narrative that blends web3 storytelling and community power, LILPEPE is giving rug-pulled frogs and boring Layer 2s something to cry about. Penny crypto, gigabrain potential At a token price of $0.001, LILPEPE represents the pinnacle of early adoption. This isn’t just a token floating in a pond. This is a frog equipped with a jetpack, equipped with meme magic, and backed by a community eager to take action. According to early ape whispers, if XRP outperforms Bitcoin’s rise by 10x, LILPEPE could increase 150x to 180x. And the price charts are still in infancy — this is pre-launch, pre-pump, pre-FOMO. Why settle for a 10x when the frog army is eyeing triple digits? Conclusion: All hail the meme king of 2025 Bitcoin at $200k? XRP at $10? It’s all within reach. While institutions are catching up with XRP, the most astute investors are already investing in LILPEPE, the only memecoin that boasts its Layer 2, sniper-free launches, zero tax, and a roadmap as comprehensive as a PEPE meme folder. Many projects have been started. Rug pulls, legs, and gas have burned many investors’ gains. But the present is a moment. Little Pepe is now available — small in name, powerful in meme. The presale is currently underway, with tokens soaring faster than the fervor on cryptocurrency Twitter. Don’t remain indifferent as LILPEPE transforms into the most legendary meme coin of 2025. Invest in LILPEPE today and allow the frog to lead towards a prosperous future. Let the Golden Meme Age begin. To learn more about Little Pepe, visit the website , Telegram , and X .
