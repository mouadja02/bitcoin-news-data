2025-06-16T06:38:09,"New Move Comes from Surprise Country Rolling Up Sleeves for Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve! After CZ, Big Bull Meets with Michael Saylor!","As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow in Asia, one of the South Asian countries, Pakistan, continues to take bold steps. Pakistan, which has made bold moves regarding Bitcoin (BTC), has now started talks with Strategy founder Michael Saylor. According to reports, Saylor met with Pakistani Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and the country’s Minister of State for Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib on Sunday for a meeting focused on Bitcoin. The meeting between the parties focused on the country's cryptocurrency policies and the possible use of Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. While voicing his support for Pakistan’s crypto efforts, Saylor stated that he is open to serving as an advisor for the country’s crypto strategy. Pakistan is making recent moves to become a crypto-friendly country, with the government setting up a crypto authority to regulate crypto last month. At this point, the official Bilal Bin Saqib announced at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference held in Las Vegas at the end of May that Pakistan will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Related News: Surprise Country with Binance Founder CZ as Advisor Announces They Will Establish Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve! ""Thank You USA!"" This decision represents a significant shift from the Pakistani government’s previous stance that it would never legalize Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as Pakistan had previously maintained that cryptocurrencies would never be legal in the country. However, Pakistan's attitude towards crypto began to change earlier this year. The Pakistani government initially established a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025. This council was established to oversee the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and attract foreign investment. Afterwards, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), one of the most influential names in the industry, was appointed as a Strategic Advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC). Just three days after CZ’s appointment, Pakistan’s Finance Minister’s advisor Bilal Bin Saqib announced plans to allocate some of the country’s surplus electricity to Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-16T06:28:22,"Michael Saylor to advise Pakistan on national Bitcoin strategy","Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has expressed willingness to advise Pakistan on its Bitcoin reserve strategy following a high-level meeting with the country’s finance leaders. According to local media , Saylor met with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and State Minister on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib in Islamabad on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s emerging digital asset framework and its plan to integrate Bitcoin into its sovereign reserve strategy. Saylor, whose company holds the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury , discussed how Bitcoin could support national resilience and long-term economic transformation. He noted that Pakistan “has many brilliant people” and emphasized that leadership and clarity would attract capital to the country. The Finance Ministry shared a video of the meeting, in which Saylor stated that when the world sees a nation taking a leadership role in Bitcoin, “they get behind the leader and they send their money to you.” “I look forward to working with you,” he told the ministers, signalling his willingness to support Pakistan’s Bitcoin reserve initiative in an advisory capacity. You might also like: Michael Saylor boasts Strategy’s ‘indestructible balance sheet’ Saqib’s office described the meeting as a milestone in Pakistan’s bid to build a “robust digital assets policy framework” and position itself as a “Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market.” Saqib believes Pakistan can adopt a similar model to Saylor’s, pointing to how he “transformed a mid-sized software firm” into a Bitcoin powerhouse through strategic conviction. With “the talent, story, and energy” already in place, Saqib argued that there’s no reason Pakistan, as a nation, can’t follow the same path. The meeting comes weeks after Pakistan confirmed plans to create a national Bitcoin reserve , just days after establishing the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas in May, Saqib announced that the government was setting up a long-term Bitcoin wallet and had no plans to sell its holdings, framing the initiative as a matter of state strategy. Pakistan also plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres, a move designed to monetise stranded energy assets and attract foreign capital. Officials have framed this as part of a broader effort to modernize the power and technology sectors. The Pakistan Crypto Council, launched in March, has been central to these developments. Saqib serves as both the CEO of the council and a state minister. In June, the council presented a draft legal framework for crypto regulation, which the Finance Ministry agreed to fast-track. Pakistan has previously tapped other global crypto figures for guidance, including Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who came on board as a strategic adviser to help shape its blockchain infrastructure and regulatory landscape.

Saylor praised Pakistan’s progressive approach to cryptocurrency adoption and urged the country to consider Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset for monetary resilience. “Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience,” he said , adding, “Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.” Pakistan’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In March, the country launched the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), which aims to regulate and integrate blockchain technology into its financial system.

We have the talent, the story, and the energy.” According to the Ministry of Finance press release on Sunday, the dialogue was hailed as a “milestone” in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework, attract global institutional interest, and “position itself as a Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market.” The PCC is set to play a pivotal role in “formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan,” the Finance Division said.

2025-06-16T06:06:26,"Ethereum co-founder: Wall Street will ‘go deep’ into DeFi and Ethereum","Ethereum co-founder and Consensys founder Joseph Lubin predicts Wall Street will soon make its foray into DeFi and crypto amidst the recent spike in institutional demand for BTC and ETH. In a recent post , Lubin highlighted the increasing demand for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) coming from institutional investors. He believes that the spike in corporations that stock up on ETH and BTC by adopting a digital asset treasury strategy is a big indicator that the financial system is shifting to DeFi . Therefore, he predicts that Wall Street will soon dive into decentralized protocols and digital assets as more and more companies join the race. This is because he believes Wall Street figureheads care about financial instruments that are consistently climbing higher in value. And right now, crypto is on their watchlist. “They will be motivated to deep dive and learn what’s up with these strategies. They will have to deeply understand the details of Bitcoin and Ethereum and the strategies of MSTR and SBET. They will have do go deep on DeFi on Ethereum,” said Lubis. In addition, he believes it is up to the crypto space builders and developers to get Wall Street “excited” about decentralized finance by continuing to grow innovation within the space and aim to widen mainstream adoption of DeFi alongside crypto. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Wall Street to spearhead accelerated shift to DeFi Lubin sees the shift already beginning with financial regulators like the SEC no longer chasing after crypto firms as they once did during the Biden administration under Gary Gensler .

Despite the major advancements already made, he believes that the shift has only just begun and is on its way towards an acceleration fueled by institutional demand. In early June, Ethereum’s price movements showed signs of an incoming rally as Wall Street demand signaled a potential comeback for the token.

2025-06-16T06:04:09,"Ethereum eyes recovery as whale inflows surge — is a breakout above $2.6K brewing?","Ethereum is showing fresh signs of strength as more big investors enter the market. The second-largest cryptocurrency by value is trading at $2,575, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Over the last week, its price has moved between $2,473 and $2,869, during a time when global markets have been uneasy due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Trading activity around Ethereum ( ETH ) has picked up sharply. In the past day, daily spot trading volume rose over 32% to $14.27 billion. At the same time, data from Coinglass shows that futures trading volume is up 26.46% to $53.09 billion. Open interest, or money locked into ETH futures, has gone up by 1.20% to $35.13 billion. This shows that more traders are placing new bets, likely expecting a bigger move in price. On-chain data also points to growing interest. According to a June 14 post by Santiment, wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have been buying heavily. These larger holders, often called whales and sharks, have added 1.49 million ETH in the past month. Their total share of the ETH supply is now 26.98%. At the same time, many smaller holders appear to have sold for profit, meaning large players are buying while others cash out. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1933662569954164978?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Will Ethereum price reach $3,000 in June?

It purchased almost $240 million worth of Ethereum between June 3 and June 6. This month alone, BlackRock has added more than $500 million in Ethereum. Other companies, such as Cumberland and Galaxy Digital, are also expanding their holdings, indicating strong interest from big institutional players. On the technical side, Ethereum is trading just below its 20-day average and moving within a tighter price range. Bollinger Bands are starting to narrow, a sign that volatility is compressing ahead of a potential breakout . The relative strength index is neutral at 52, but increasing volume and whale activity may help push the price higher. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although they continue to show some weakness, momentum indicators like the 10-period momentum and the moving average convergence divergence seem to be bottoming out. If the MACD line crosses above the signal line in the coming sessions, it would be a bullish sign of renewed upward momentum. The next major resistance zone is located around $2,870 if bulls are able to push the price above $2,600 with volume confirmation. A close above that would open the door toward $3,000. On the downside, a retest of the lower Bollinger Band around $2,400 might occur if the price is unable to stay above the 20-day average.

2025-06-16T05:38:22,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Eases Slightly After Record High","Despite rising operational costs, leading miners like Marathon Digital and CleanSpark are not only expanding production but also choosing to hold their mined BTC. This could mean that miners have long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Meanwhile, institutional players like Strategy and its co-founder Michael Saylor also continue accumulating. Market sentiment is also still bullish, supported by strong ETF inflows and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as an alternative to gold and Treasuries. Analysts warn, however, that geopolitical shocks could still challenge this momentum. Mining Difficulty Slips but Bitcoin Miners Still Battle Bitcoin's mining difficulty saw a slight decline, dropping to approximately 126.4 trillion after reaching a record high of 126.9 trillion on May 31. This adjustment, while minor, happened amid increasing financial pressure on miners due to reduced block rewards after the April 2024 halving, rising energy costs, and sustained high network hashrate. These combined factors are pushing up competition and production costs, testing the profitability and resilience of mining operations. Bitcoin mining difficulty (Source: CryptoQuant ) Despite these headwinds, some publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are not only managing to stay afloat but are expanding aggressively and adopting a new approach by holding onto their mined Bitcoin instead of selling it. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is a major player in this trend. In May, the company boosted its Bitcoin output by 35% by mining 950 BTC during a month that was marked by record hashrate levels and heightened market volatility. MARA’s decision to keep all the Bitcoin it mined pushed its corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC, which made it one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. “Record production month for MARA — and we sold zero Bitcoin,” CFO Salman Khan said in a post on June 3. CleanSpark, another publicly listed mining company focused on sustainable energy, also reported gains . The firm produced 694 BTC in May, which was up 9% from April, and now holds 12,502 BTC in reserves. According to CEO Zack Bradford, CleanSpark increased its operational hashrate to 45.6 exahashes per second by the end of May, representing a 7.5% increase from the previous month. Bitcoin miners are some of the top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The shift in strategy by companies like MARA and CleanSpark could mean that there is a deeper confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Saylor Signals New BTC Buy Mining companies are not the only institutions interested in hoarding Bitcoin. For now, BTC is holding steady above $105,000 despite escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, including Israeli airstrikes on Tehran and concerns over potential disruptions to global oil supply. The relative price stability of Bitcoin comes at a time when global financial markets are bracing for increased volatility when trading resumes on Monday. In a move that suggests continued confidence in Bitcoin, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted a BTC chart that many see as a sign of another imminent Bitcoin purchase by the company. Strategy’s most recent acquisition took place on June 9, when it bought 1,045 BTC worth around $110 million. This brought the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 582,000 BTC. According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy is now up more than 50% on its Bitcoin investment, which translates into over $20 billion in unrealized gains. Saylor’s timing is interesting, as the announcement was made during a weekend of heightened conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite these geopolitical developments, Bitcoin only experienced a minor 3% dip since the conflict escalated. This price stability has been supported by strong investor interest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which recorded more than $1.3 billion in net inflows over the past week. According to Farside Investors , BTC ETFs saw five straight days of capital inflows, which means that there is sustained demand for exposure to Bitcoin. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) Market sentiment is also still bullish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index standing at 61 . This suggests that investors are still optimistic in the face of global uncertainty. However, not all analysts share this confidence. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin warned that if Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz—a crucial passage for 20% of the world’s oil shipments—it could cause a spike in energy prices. Such a development would have huge ripple effects across global markets, and could potentially drag down risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, due to increased economic pressures. While Bitcoin’s current performance points to its role as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil, the events in the Middle East and their broader economic consequences will still be key variables influencing market sentiment over the next few days. Woes Push Investors Toward Bitcoin Overall, Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable alternative to traditional stores of value like gold and US Treasuries, according to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley . In a recent statement, Horsley shed some light on Bitcoin’s total addressable market as not only the $16 trillion gold market but also the $30 trillion-plus held in US Treasury securities by institutions and individual investors. His comments came in response to economist Mohamed El-Erian , who explained that US Treasury flows are no longer a reliable indicator of investor sentiment during times of market stress. Instead, El-Erian suggested that analysts look to flows into gold and silver, traditional safe havens, for clues about where capital is moving during rising uncertainty. Bitcoin’s positioning as a digital alternative to gold has gained momentum, especially as investors seek tools to hedge against geopolitical risks, inflation, and market instability. With its decentralized design and capped supply, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a savings technology that offers protection from the risks tied to fiat currencies and government-managed financial systems. The recent geopolitical developments and fiscal concerns have only strengthened this narrative. In the United States, President Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” has come under scrutiny for its projected $2.5 trillion in deficit spending, which adds to the country’s already staggering $37 trillion national debt. Critics, including Elon Musk and other fiscal conservatives, argue that the bill undermines the long-term financial stability of the country. The bond market reacted sharply to these concerns in April of 2025, particularly after Trump’s proposed trade tariffs and the growing debt load. Investors dumped government bonds, which led to a spike in yields as they demanded higher returns to offset the perceived risk of holding US debt. Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, said that the market was clearly rattled by Trump’s fiscal policies and that calming the situation would require a major shift in economic strategy. Against this backdrop of fiscal instability and geopolitical tension, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a potential safe haven.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9573/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-eases-slightly-after-record-high,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T05:27:32,"Will SUI Price Hit $10?","The post Will SUI Price Hit $10? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News SUI has been making headlines in 2025 with its impressive price action. With rising adoption, TVL, and institutional interest, SUI could be eyeing long-term price targets of $5, $10, or even higher in the coming months. SUI started the year strong as it briefly crossed the $5 mark. But it further dropped over 65% as the selling pressure kicked in. Despite the drop, the buyers quickly stepped in and helped the price recover. The interest is growing again now and the momentum looks set to continue. SUI is currently trading at $3.07, up 2.9% in the last 24 hours. It is showing mixed technical signals with most moving averages bearish. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 41, indicating that momentum has cooled, and the MACD also points to a slowdown. If SUI holds above $3.10, it could climb to $3.50 this week. A rise above $3.50 may trigger a bigger rally; but if it drops below $3.00, then more selling could follow. Will SUI End June at $4? SUI started off the month slow and is stuck in a tight range as bears tried to push the price down. However, buying pressure is expected to rise in the next few days breaking past its resistance levels. The outlook for June remains bullish, with SUI likely to end the month between $3.80 and $4.00. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Saylor Joins Pakistan’s Crypto Mission , Analysts said that SUI is shaping up to be a major player in the next bull run. The network now ranks 8th in total value locked (TVL) across all blockchains. A big part of this momentum comes from Suilend, Sui’s leading lending platform, which recently saw its TVL surge by 90% to $700 million in just one month. $SUI remains to be one of the core pillars of the upcoming bull cycle. Interesting metrics: – 8th highest TVL across chains – Suilend has become the largest lending protocol with a 90% increase in the past month –> $700M in TVL. – Over 10% of SUI's TVL is in #Bitcoin -related… pic.twitter.com/t8kypcZeQd — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) June 9, 2025 Additionally, over 10% of SUI’s TVL is now in Bitcoin-related assets. This kind of cross-chain functionality is drawing in new users and liquidity. The institutional interest in SUI is also on rise as several firms have filed for SUI ETF . With all these factors in play, a new all-time high for SUI may not be too far. SUI Outperforms SOL SUI is also outperforming Solana, and the trend may continue over the next 12 to 24 months. If Sui keeps up the same uptrend, it could trade between $5 and $8 in 2026. According to CoinCodex , the price outlook for SUI from 2025 to 2030 is bullish . It is expected to reach an average price of $3.80 in 2025, and could climb as high as $5.20. By 2030, SUI could even climb to $11, if the demand and adoption keeps rising. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As reported earlier, Metaplanet’s stock surged more than 4,800% over the past year, after its pivot to Bitcoin investment strategy. Metaplanet is now Japan’s most shorted stock, says CEO as Bitcoin bulls warn of a global short squeeze. “Really bad timing to be short,” says Blockstream’s Adam Back. #Bitcoin #Metaplanet https://t.co/aWGJO2iQGi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 21, 2025 Seamus Rocca, CEO at Xapo Bank, shared his perspective on the rising corporate Bitcoin allocations recently. In an email to Cryptonews, he said that the increase in corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is “significant.” However, “it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions,” Rocca added. “It’s about allocating what a business can afford to hold over a five-to-ten-year horizon, without being forced to sell into volatility.” Further, he said that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet “represent high-conviction outliers,” with bold strategies that align with their unique business plans. “In this space, patience and discipline can be underrated virtues,” he told Cryptonews. “Our view has been, and remains, that Bitcoin deserves serious consideration—but with a disciplined, long-term framework: focus on the asset itself, avoid speculative trading, and size positions responsibly.” Company Adapts Strategy Amid Yen Depreciation Metaplanet’s recent announcement to issue $210 million in 0% ordinary bonds comes at a time when Japan is facing economic challenges, characterized by high debt levels and yen depreciation. As a result, the strategy underscores Metaplanet’s commitment to leveraging Bitcoin’s potential for long-term appreciation. The Japanese Yen kicked off the week on a weaker note. However, the anticipation that the Bank of Japan might push for tighter monetary conditions, along with trade-related uncertainties, lends some support to the safe-haven Japanese Yen.

Saylor reportedly met with top Pakistani officials over the weekend to explore how crypto could help reshape the country’s financial future. The talks, described by officials as a “landmark discussion,” brought Saylor together with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib . The agenda focused on how Bitcoin could be used in sovereign reserves and monetary policy. Meanwhile, Pakistan is accelerating efforts to become a digital asset leader in the Global South. “Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation, and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” said Aurangzeb, who also chairs the Pakistan Crypto Council. Pakistan Finds an Ally in MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Saylor, who heads the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, welcomed Pakistan’s outreach.

The meeting comes after a series of bold steps by Islamabad. In March, the government established the Pakistan Crypto Council to create a legal framework for digital assets. Then in April, it introduced the country’s first national crypto policy, designed to align with FATF standards. Soon after, the government created the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. In addition, it announced a state-backed strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. With Support from Zhao and Trump Allies, Pakistan’s Crypto Plan Gains Weight Saylor is not the only high-profile figure showing interest. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was appointed a strategic advisor to the PCC in April. His addition, despite past legal controversies, is seen by officials as a signal of global credibility. Others from US political and financial circles have also entered the picture. Gentry Beach Jr., a close ally of President Donald Trump, visited Islamabad as part of a US delegation helping shape the council’s structure. Meanwhile, Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump associate and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, signed a deal in April between his firm, World Liberty Financial, and the PCC. The agreement aims to embed blockchain technology into Pakistan’s financial systems. Additionally, the company is reportedly linked to the Trump family, with Eric, Donald Jr. and Jared Kushner holding a controlling stake.

Michael Saylor, a U.S. billionaire and a well-known Bitcoin supporter, has offered to help the country build its digital currency policies and attract global investors. The move comes as Pakistan looks to strengthen its economy through the smart use of cryptocurrency. Despite the Middle East tensions, the Israel-Iran conflict , the global market remains unaffected by Bitcoin plans, and the market is turning back all the bearish signals. On top of this, Saylor’s stepping into as crypto advisor is giving hope to 40 million crypto users in Pakistan.

The discussion was described as a “landmark” moment for Pakistan’s crypto journey. Saylor praised the country’s vision and said he would be glad to act as an adviser to help shape Pakistan’s digital asset policies . He pointed out that Pakistan has “many brilliant people” and the potential to show “intellectual leadership” to the rest of the world. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction: Bullish and Bearish Scenarios Explained , He told the ministers that when markets trust a leader, they bring in money, just like they trusted his company, which saw massive growth after investing in Bitcoin.

The recent post by Sailor hinted that the company is planning to buy more BTC soon. Pakistan Wants to Lead the Developing World The country is already making strong progress. In March, Pakistan launched the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) to help build crypto laws. In April, it introduced its first-ever crypto policy 2025, designed to meet global compliance standards such as those set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The government is also fast-tracking legislation drafted by the PCC. Saqib, who heads the council, also revealed plans to set up a national Bitcoin reserve , a bold move signaling Pakistan’s commitment to becoming a crypto-forward economy. Meanwhile, Saylor also encouraged Pakistan’s idea of creating a Bitcoin reserve, basically a stash of Bitcoin that the country would keep like gold. He believes this could help Pakistan stand out as a forward-thinking nation. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-16T05:00:00,"Brazil and Vietnam Reshape Crypto Markets with Landmark Regulations","Two of the world’s most closely watched emerging markets have taken significant steps to formalize their positions on digital assets. Brazil has eliminated long-standing tax exemptions on crypto gains, replacing them with a flat 17.5% capital gains tax as part of a broader fiscal reform. Meanwhile, Vietnam passed a first-of-its-kind law recognizing digital assets and setting the stage for a nationwide digital technology strategy. Vietnam Passes Groundbreaking Law Recognizing Crypto Assets, Aims to Become Digital Tech Powerhouse The National Assembly of Vietnam officially approved the Law on Digital Technology Industry on June 14, ushering in a comprehensive legal framework for digital assets, artificial intelligence, and advanced technologies. The law , scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1, 2026, positions Vietnam as the first country globally to enact a standalone law dedicated entirely to the digital technology industry. The new legislation provides long-awaited legal clarity for the crypto industry in Vietnam, recognizing digital assets and dividing them into two primary categories: virtual assets and crypto assets. Although both are based on encryption or digital technologies for their verification and transfer, they explicitly exclude securities, fiat-backed digital currencies, and other conventional financial instruments. Vietnamese lawmakers vote to approve the Law on Digital Technology Industry (Source: VGP ) Under the new framework, the Vietnamese government is now responsible for defining specific business conditions and regulatory mechanisms for both asset categories, signaling a shift from a loosely regulated market to a structured environment that could attract institutional interest and innovation. The law emphasizes strict compliance with cybersecurity standards and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, aligning Vietnam with international regulatory benchmarks, particularly those set by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Vietnam has been on the FATF’s “gray list” since 2023 due to concerns over money laundering and terrorist financing. The introduction of these new safeguards is expected to be a major step in addressing those issues. By bringing crypto assets under formal supervision, the Vietnamese government hopes to mitigate risks associated with scams, fraudulent investment schemes, and unregulated platforms—issues that have plagued the country’s digital asset ecosystem in recent years. A Response to Rising Crypto Crime Vietnam’s crypto sector has experienced significant abuse by malicious actors, underscoring the urgency for regulatory reform. Earlier this year, Vietnamese authorities dismantled BitMiner, a fake crypto mining platform that defrauded over 200 investors of approximately 4 billion Vietnamese dong ($157,300). The operation claimed to be based in Dubai and sold fictitious mining packages and training programs. In another major crackdown in December 2024, Hanoi City police intervened just in time to prevent 300 potential victims from investing in the “Million Smiles” crypto scam. That scheme promoted a fake in-house digital currency called QFS (Quantum Financial System), tricking more than 100 businesses and 400 individuals out of nearly 30 billion dong ($1.17 million) through fraudulent claims that included ties to ancestral treasures and spiritual guarantees. Such cases have shown the need for robust consumer protections and legal definitions for crypto-related businesses—something this new law aims to deliver. While the legal recognition of crypto assets has grabbed headlines, the law’s implications go far beyond digital currencies. It forms the cornerstone of Vietnam’s larger strategy to become a regional and global leader in digital innovation. The legislation lays out broad incentives for companies working in critical areas such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and digital infrastructure. These include tax reductions, land-use incentives, and government-backed research and development grants. In particular, firms focused on core technologies like chip design and AI data centers are expected to benefit. Provincial governments will also be required to launch programs that support workforce development, offering subsidies, scholarships, and training initiatives tailored to digital technologies. Moreover, Vietnam plans to overhaul its education system by integrating digital technology skills into national curricula, ensuring that students are equipped with the competencies needed for the digital age. Vietnam's Role in the Emerging Digital Economy Vietnam’s latest legislative initiative places it at the forefront of a global trend where emerging markets are leading the charge in crypto adoption. A recent survey by Consensys highlighted Vietnam as one of the fastest-growing digital asset markets, supported by a young, tech-savvy population and growing smartphone penetration. International companies are already taking notice. Earlier this year, crypto derivatives exchange Bitget launched BitEXC, a custom-built trading platform tailored for Vietnamese users—an indication that global firms are preparing for a more regulated and accessible market. As the country prepares for the law’s implementation in 2026, businesses and regulators alike are watching closely. If successful, Vietnam could become a model for digital policy frameworks, offering a blueprint for how to simultaneously foster innovation, protect consumers, and uphold international financial standards. Brazil Ends Crypto Tax Exemptions with New Flat 17.5% Rate Under Provisional Measure 1303 Meanwhile, in a sweeping shift that could reshape the financial strategies of both retail and institutional investors, the Brazilian government has eliminated its longstanding tax exemption for small-scale crypto gains and implemented a flat 17.5% capital gains tax on all digital asset profits. The change comes under Provisional Measure 1303, part of a broader government initiative to increase public revenue through financial market taxation. Provisional Measure 1303 (Source: Brazil Government ) Previously, Brazilian residents were exempt from paying income tax on crypto sales under 35,000 Brazilian reals (roughly $6,300) per month. Above that threshold, capital gains were taxed on a progressive scale ranging from 15% to 22.5%, with the highest bracket applying to trades exceeding 30 million reals. Effective as of June 12, 2025, the new regime removes these thresholds, enforcing a uniform 17.5% tax rate across the board—regardless of transaction volume, wallet size, or investor type. Impact on Retail and Wealthy Investors The move marks a dramatic departure from a system that many small traders had relied on for tax relief. Under the old rules, small monthly trades went untaxed, allowing casual or beginner investors to explore crypto markets without immediate tax burdens. Now, even modest gains will be subject to the new flat rate, raising the barrier for entry and dampening enthusiasm among low-capital participants. Conversely, high-net-worth individuals and institutional traders may benefit from the flat tax, which could lower their effective tax liability. Under the previous system, large transactions—particularly those above 5 million reals—were subject to tax rates up to 22.5%. With the 17.5% cap now in place, Brazil's wealthier investors could see reduced tax bills on large-scale crypto activity. Perhaps more significantly, Provisional Measure 1303 expands the tax base to include self-custodied crypto wallets and foreign-held digital assets, making it harder for investors to sidestep local tax obligations through offshore strategies. According to local reporting from Portal do Bitcoin, the measure introduces quarterly tax assessments, giving investors the ability to offset losses over a rolling five-quarter period. However, this window will be reduced starting in 2026, tightening loss recovery options. The inclusion of self-custody wallets means that even crypto not held on centralized exchanges—long considered a regulatory gray area—will now be monitored for capital gains. Investors who previously stored funds in private wallets to avoid surveillance may now be compelled to declare holdings and gains under stricter transparency requirements. Other Financial Sectors Affected The government’s changes are not limited to crypto. Several once-exempt financial instruments are also being pulled into the tax net. Profits from Agribusiness and Real Estate Credit Letters (LCAs and LCIs) as well as Receivables Certificates (CRIs and CRAs) will now face a 5% income tax, ending their tax-free status. Meanwhile, revenue generated from betting and gambling has also been hit, with tax rates rising from 12% to 18%, further reflecting the government’s aggressive stance on extracting revenue from non-traditional financial sectors. These updates follow political backlash from an earlier attempt by Brazil’s Finance Ministry to increase the Financial Transaction Tax (IOF)—a plan that was ultimately abandoned amid strong opposition from both Congress and financial industry stakeholders. Brazil’s tax overhaul comes at a time when global regulators are tightening their grip on the cryptocurrency sector, particularly in emerging economies with large unbanked populations and rapidly growing crypto user bases. As the world’s seventh-largest crypto market, Brazil has historically embraced digital assets as tools for financial inclusion and inflation protection. But this latest pivot demonstrates the Brazilian government’s growing concern over unregulated capital flows, offshore tax evasion, and rising crypto-linked fraud, all while seeking new avenues to fund social programs and infrastructure. Bitcoin for Wages? Brazil Considers Crypto Salaries In March 2025, Brazilian lawmakers introduced a bill proposing that employers be allowed to pay up to 50% of wages in cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. The bill, still under discussion, would prohibit full crypto-based salary payments for standard employees but permit full payment in digital assets for foreign workers and independent contractors, provided agreements are contractually defined. All payments would need to reference official exchange rates determined by institutions authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil, ensuring price stability and transparency in salary conversions. While the bill has not yet passed, it represents the country’s dual-track approach: tighten regulation while enabling innovation. If approved, it could make Brazil one of the first major economies to formally embrace crypto-denominated wages under a centralized regulatory structure.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9574/brazil-and-vietnam-reshape-crypto-markets-with-landmark-regulations,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

The acquisition, valued at approximately 16.88 billion yen, about $110 million, marks a major milestone in the firm’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 1,112 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 10,000 BTC* pic.twitter.com/XlM13kQnS9 — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 16, 2025 The latest purchase was financed through the issuance of a new $210 million bond to EVO Fund, also announced on June 16. These zero-interest bonds are scheduled to mature in December 2025 but can be redeemed earlier. The entire amount raised is being directed toward buying more Bitcoin, continuing the company’s focused approach to BTC accumulation. While the firm expects little impact on its full-year earnings, it has said it will update the market if anything changes.

That final figure would represent 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Alongside its Bitcoin buying, the company uses internal performance metrics to track progress. One of these, BTC Yield, measures how much Bitcoin is held per fully diluted share and is designed to reflect the impact of both buying BTC and issuing shares. As of June 16, the yield for the current quarter was 87.2%. Past quarters have seen even sharper increases, including a 309.8% rise in Q4 2024. To finance its expansion, Metaplanet has also raised money through stock sales. It granted EVO Fund 21 million new share rights in five tranches in January, with flexible pricing and no discounts. The firm’s aggressive capital raise and BTC acquisitions have positioned it as Asia’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the eighth largest holder globally.

2025-06-16T03:52:13,"Big News for XRP Holders: Cardano Founder Confirms XRP DeFi Package and RLUSD Talks","The post Big News for XRP Holders: Cardano Founder Confirms XRP DeFi Package and RLUSD Talks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In an exciting reveal, Charles Hoskinson has teased new updates over the integration of XRP and other Ripple-related assets on the Cardano network . This was revealed in response to a user asking whether RLUSD would be added to Cardano. There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi and the RealUSD talks. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) June 14, 2025 Charles replied that there is already a full XRP integration package in the works. “There is a whole XRP package with the glacier drop, lace wallet support, XRP DeFi, and the RealUSD talks,” he said. Glacier Drop to Include XRP Support and Midnight Airdrop The Glacier Drop is Midnight’s multi-chain airdrop, which was revealed during Consensus 2025 in Toronto. It will target around 37 million blockchains , including the XRP Ledger, but only retail users will be eligible for it. As part of the Glacier Drop, Midnight will airdrop two tokens: NIGHT (governance) and DUST (privacy-focused). XRP holders can qualify by storing their tokens in eligible wallets. Lace Wallet Set to Add XRP Hoskinson recently confirmed that Lace Wallet, Cardano’s lightweight, multi-chain wallet, will soon support XRP. This would allow users to send, receive, and store XRP alongside assets like ADA and Bitcoin. He has shown strong support for Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD . Launched in December, Real USD (RLUSD) currently runs on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger, but Cardano may soon be added in the future. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Saylor Joins Pakistan’s Crypto Mission , XRP DeFi Use Cases XRP’s integration into Cardano could bring fresh DeFi use cases like lending and borrowing, and other financial services within the Cardano ecosystem. In late 2024, Hoskinson said Cardano could offer XRP some “amazing” DeFi tools. In February, a Wanchain bridge went live, allowing native XRP to connect to Cardano. The update turned heads, given Hoskinson’s past disagreements with the XRP community. But his recent comments hint at a shift in tone, as he opened up about the need for more collaboration and less competition within the crypto industry. Recently, Charles has also proposed diversifying $100 million worth of ADA into stablecoins and even Bitcoin, aiming to bring BTC into Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem and create a multi-asset treasury model. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-16T01:34:12,"Bitcoin mining difficulty dips slightly after record highs","Bitcoin’s mining difficulty has dropped slightly after reaching its highest level ever at the end of May. On Saturday, June 15, the network recorded a small but notable decrease in difficulty, bringing it down to approximately 126.4 trillion. This follows the all-time peak of 126.9 trillion on May 31, according to data from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant. The drop is slight, but that’s a landmark for mining. Bitcoin’s difficulty is automatically adjusted approximately every two weeks to reflect changes in the total hashrate, the sum of all miners’ computing power aiming for solutions to the Bitcoin network . When additional miners join the network, the difficulty increases to help maintain block production at regular intervals. When miners go offline because of cost or inefficiency, the difficulty drops in adjusting. The hashrate is still robust, surpassing a psychological barrier of 1 zetahash per second (ZH/s) in April. Rising costs challenge miners While it remains a tad less tough, several miners struggle with heavier workloads. The April 2024 halving, a scheduled phenomenon that cuts Bitcoin’s block reward in half every four years, slashed the reward for successfully mining a block to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC for miners, which translates into half the revenue for the same work. Factors such as surging electricity prices, rising hardware costs, and the pressure to stay updated with the latest technological turnover have caused many smaller or medium mining operations to be on the brink. Production costs are expensive for some small-scale miners, particularly in regions with relatively high electric power prices or relatively inefficient power supply systems. For those miners, keeping operations going is burning cash, a high-stakes wager, given that they either have access to cheap energy or anticipate a sharp rise in the price of Bitcoin shortly. Big players grow despite headwinds While many miners are scrambling , larger publicly traded companies do the opposite: ramping up and holding onto Bitcoin. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) said it produced roughly 35% more Bitcoin mined in May despite facing industry headwinds. The firm also mined 950 BTC for the month, an increase from April’s amount. Rather than liquidating coins into fiat to cover costs — as many miners often tend to do — MARA decided to hold onto those obtained through Bitcoin mining and increased the size of their corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC. “Record production month for MARA, and we sold zero Bitcoin,” said Salman Khan, Marathon’s chief financial officer, in a June 3 post on X . CleanSpark, another major mining company with a degree of emphasis on renewable energy, also reported solid results. The company reportedly mined 694 BTC during the month, an increase of approximately 9% from the prior month. CleanSpark’s capacity of hashrate, an essential performance measure, rose to 45.6 exahashes per second (EH/s) by the end of May. CleanSpark CEO Zack Bradford said that the increase was attributable to continued investment in cleaner forms of energy and improved mining hardware. He added that they had intentionally scaled their footprint over the years to remain profitable in tough macroeconomic environments. Both companies are part of a new breed of miners who consider Bitcoin a revenue source and a strategic financial asset. It has boiled down to holding Bitcoin on the balance sheet, a decision increasingly adopted by the corporate treasuries experimenting with crypto.
