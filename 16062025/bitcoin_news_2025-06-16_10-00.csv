2025-06-16T07:47:50,"Brazil ends crypto tax break, imposes 17.5% levy on gains","Brazil is taxing cryptocurrency profits at a flat rate, having scrapped the monthly exemption previously granted to small-scale investors. Starting June 12, a 17.5% capital gains tax applies to all crypto transactions, regardless of the value or volume, as part of Provisional Measure 1303 , introduced by the federal government to increase revenue from financial market activities. Under the new regulations, taxation applies to crypto assets held in self-custody wallets and digital assets stored overseas. Brazilian investors must now declare all gains quarterly, with the ability to offset losses from the previous five quarters. However, this offset window will be reduced from 2026 onward. Previously, Brazilians could sell up to 35,000 reais (approximately $6,300) worth of crypto per month without paying income tax. Larger transactions activated a tiered tax structure starting at 15% and topping out at 22.5% for those moving over 30 million reais annually.

This tax overhaul arrives at a time when Brazil, already Latin America’s largest crypto market and ranked among the world’s top 10 in terms of adoption, is actively pursuing broader crypto integration, from regulated salary payments to a proposed sovereign Bitcoin reserve. In March, lawmakers introduced Bill PL 957/2025 to permit employees to receive part of their salaries in cryptocurrency. At least 50% of wages must still be paid in reals, but expatriates and foreign remote workers may receive full payment in digital assets under Central Bank oversight. Employers opting for crypto-based payrolls would be required to issue detailed statements and provide educational material on virtual asset use, risks, fraud prevention, and conversion procedures. Separately, Brazil is advancing Bill PL 4501/2024 , which would authorize the allocation of up to 5% of the country’s $370 billion treasury into a Bitcoin strategic reserve. The proposal, currently under review in the Chamber of Deputies, seeks to diversify national reserves and position Bitcoin as a sovereign hedge. If passed, Brazil would become the first G20 nation to formalize Bitcoin into law as a reserve asset through legislative channels rather than executive action.

2025-06-16T07:40:41,"Escalating Geopolitical Tensions: Analyzing the Crypto Market Impact","BitcoinWorld Escalating Geopolitical Tensions: Analyzing the Crypto Market Impact Recent reports citing Fars News Agency via JinSe Finance indicate a potential rise in Geopolitical Tensions involving Iran and the United States in the Middle East. While this news primarily concerns international relations and security, it’s crucial for investors and enthusiasts in the digital asset space to understand how such developments can ripple through global financial markets, including cryptocurrencies. How Do Geopolitical Tensions Influence the Crypto Market? The relationship between geopolitical instability and the cryptocurrency market is complex and often debated. Historically, periods of global uncertainty have led investors to seek perceived ‘safe haven’ assets. Traditionally, gold has fulfilled this role, but in recent years, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have sometimes exhibited similar behavior. The primary way Geopolitical Tensions exert a Crypto Market Impact is through their effect on investor sentiment and risk appetite. When global risks rise, investors may: Move away from riskier assets (like stocks, and sometimes, unfortunately, crypto) towards perceived safer ones. Increase demand for assets seen as outside the control of traditional financial systems, potentially benefiting decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. React to potential economic consequences, such as changes in oil prices, inflation expectations, or central bank policies, which can indirectly affect crypto valuations. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the potential volatility that can arise from international conflicts. Is Bitcoin a True Bitcoin Safe Haven? The concept of Bitcoin serving as a Bitcoin Safe Haven asset during times of crisis is a hotly debated topic within the crypto community and traditional finance. Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, limited supply, and independence from any single government or central bank make it an ideal store of value when traditional systems face stress. Arguments for Bitcoin as a safe haven: Decentralization: Not controlled by any single entity, making it resistant to confiscation or manipulation by governments. Global Accessibility: Can be accessed and transferred across borders, potentially useful in regions experiencing capital controls or economic instability. Limited Supply: The fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin is often compared to precious metals like gold. Arguments against Bitcoin as a safe haven: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be extremely volatile, which contradicts the traditional definition of a stable safe haven asset. Correlation with Tech Stocks: At times, Bitcoin has shown correlation with risk-on tech stocks, suggesting it’s still viewed as a growth asset rather than purely defensive. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape adds another layer of risk. Past events have shown mixed results. During some crises, Bitcoin’s price has surged, while in others, it has dropped along with broader markets. The current situation involving Iran and the US could serve as another test case for Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative. Understanding Market Volatility Amidst Middle East Tensions Increased Geopolitical Tensions , particularly in a strategically important region like the Middle East, almost invariably lead to increased Market Volatility across global financial markets. The crypto market, known for its inherent volatility, is particularly susceptible to sharp price swings in response to significant external events. Why does geopolitical news cause volatility? Uncertainty: The primary driver is uncertainty about the potential scale, duration, and economic consequences of the conflict. Investor Fear: Fear can trigger panic selling or rapid shifts in portfolio allocation. Liquidity Shifts: Large investors or institutions may move significant capital, causing price dislocations. News Cycles: Rapidly developing news can lead to knee-jerk reactions from traders. For those holding Middle East Crypto assets or operating within the region, volatility can be amplified by local factors, though the global nature of major cryptocurrencies means the impact is felt worldwide. Middle East Crypto Landscape and Regional Impact The Middle East Crypto landscape is diverse and rapidly evolving. Countries in the region have varying stances on digital assets, from outright bans to active promotion of blockchain technology and crypto adoption. Geopolitical instability can influence this landscape in several ways: Increased Adoption (Potentially): In areas facing economic instability or sanctions, there can be increased interest in using cryptocurrencies as an alternative store of value or means of transaction, though this often operates in grey areas. Regulatory Responses: Governments might tighten regulations on crypto to prevent illicit use or capital flight, or conversely, explore digital currencies as a strategic tool. Infrastructure Development: Investment in crypto and blockchain infrastructure might slow down or accelerate depending on the perceived risks and opportunities. While the news focuses on military plans, the broader economic and financial implications for the region’s growing engagement with digital assets are worth monitoring. Any escalation could influence local crypto markets and user behavior. Potential Scenarios and Crypto Market Impact Analyzing potential scenarios helps us understand the range of possible outcomes for the Crypto Market Impact . While predicting market movements is impossible, we can consider how different levels of escalation might affect digital asset prices and sentiment: Scenario 1: De-escalation or Containment If tensions ease or remain contained without direct conflict, the initial market reaction might reverse. Risk appetite could return, potentially benefiting growth assets, including some cryptocurrencies. Market volatility might decrease. Scenario 2: Limited Escalation Specific, limited incidents could cause temporary spikes in volatility. Bitcoin might see a brief rally if perceived as a safe haven, but this could be short-lived if broader market panic sets in. Altcoins, often considered riskier, might experience sharper declines. Scenario 3: Significant Escalation A major conflict would likely trigger significant global financial turmoil. Initial reaction could be a flight to safety, potentially boosting traditional assets like gold and possibly testing Bitcoin’s safe haven narrative on a larger scale. However, widespread economic disruption and fear could also lead to a sell-off across all asset classes, including crypto, as investors prioritize liquidity. Long-term Crypto Market Impact would depend on the duration and economic consequences of the conflict. Investors should remain vigilant, avoid making impulsive decisions based on headlines, and consider how potential geopolitical shifts align with their long-term investment strategy in digital assets. Conclusion Reports of Iran’s potential plans targeting U.S. military bases underscore the ever-present risk of Geopolitical Tensions impacting global markets. While the direct implications are strategic and humanitarian, the indirect effects on the Crypto Market Impact are undeniable. Whether Bitcoin truly acts as a reliable Bitcoin Safe Haven during such events remains a subject of ongoing observation, but increased Market Volatility is a likely consequence. The developing situation in the Middle East Crypto landscape adds another layer of complexity. Staying informed about global events and understanding their potential ripple effects on digital assets is crucial for navigating the unpredictable nature of both geopolitics and the cryptocurrency market.

2025-06-16T07:39:08,"Analysis Company Claims Abnormal Activity in Bitcoin’s Movements – Here’s What It Means","Cryptocurrency analytics platform CryptoQuant has published a remarkable analysis of Bitcoin’s relationship with traditional macro indicators in the current market cycle. The report claimed that Bitcoin has diverged “abnormally” from its historical correlation with US bond yields, which could indicate that BTC’s role in the macroeconomic system is undergoing a structural change. According to CryptoQuant analysts, macroeconomics has become the dominant trend in today’s cryptocurrency markets. For this reason, investors are closely following macro indicators, especially the US Dollar Index (DXY) and US Treasury yields. These indicators provide important signals about the state of global liquidity and institutional investor sentiment. Related News: List of the 15 Altcoins Developers Focused on Most in the Last Week Published In the published analysis, a chart comparing Bitcoin with DXY and 5, 10 and 30-year US bond yields draws attention. According to historical data; When DXY and bond yields rise, capital flows out of riskier assets, often leading to corrections for assets like Bitcoin. Bear cycles in the crypto market often coincide with such bullish periods. When DXY and bond yields weaken, risk appetite increases. These periods usually coincide with periods of easing monetary policy or rising expectations of a rate cut from the Fed, triggering an upward trend in crypto markets. However, what is striking in the current cycle is that Bitcoin is diverging from this traditional macro model. Despite bond yields reaching the highest levels in Bitcoin history, the BTC price continues to rise. Bitcoin seems to be gaining momentum, especially when the DXY starts to fall. This “abnormal” divergence may indicate that Bitcoin’s role in macroeconomic dynamics is reshaping. According to CryptoQuant analysts, this is due to Bitcoin now being perceived more as a store of value. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-16T07:34:54,"Liverpool Named UK’s Crypto Capital as Residents Lead in Bitcoin and Stock Investing","Liverpool has been crowned the UK’s new crypto capital, topping the charts for digital asset engagement in a nationwide study of online habits. Key Takeaways: Liverpool leads the UK in crypto and stock market engagement, with 13% of residents actively investing. Regional online habits vary widely, with London favoring dating apps and Sheffield dominating TikTok and streaming. Despite growing digital engagement, many Britons report feeling fatigued by excessive screen time. According to a report commissioned by telecommunications firm Openreach , 13% of Liverpool residents regularly invest in cryptocurrencies and monitor stock markets, more than any other city in the country. The study, which explored the online behavior of Britons, paints a picture of a nation increasingly plugged into the financial and digital world. Liverpool Leads UK in Bitcoin Interest, Becoming Crypto Capital While London may lead in dating app usage and Sheffield dominates in TikTok and streaming, Liverpool stands out for its enthusiasm toward financial markets, especially Bitcoin. The data underscores how regional differences shape online activity across the UK. In contrast to Liverpool’s investment focus, Manchester showed a clear preference for Instagram, while Leeds leaned heavily into Facebook. Sheffield residents led the country in both TikTok engagement and hours spent online, with 32% spending more than five hours a day connected, far surpassing the 11% figure in Brighton. The national average time spent online sits at three and a half hours daily, though 20% of respondents admitted to clocking more than five hours. Nighttime browsing was a common habit, with 64% going online between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., and 19% of users turning to YouTube during those hours. The survey was released to mark the 25th anniversary of the UK’s first home broadband installation in Basildon, Essex.

They will “look to build a Bitcoin reserve.” pic.twitter.com/xnBoDBJuip — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) April 11, 2025 But alongside the findings of increased connectivity, the study also revealed a rising sense of digital fatigue. Around 43% of respondents felt they wasted time online, while 37% cited concerns over “doom-scrolling.” A third of those surveyed believed they would feel more relaxed if they spent less time on the internet. “It’s fascinating to see how different parts of the UK are embracing the online world and adapting to it in unique ways,” said Katie Milligan, deputy CEO of Openreach. “At the same time, it’s encouraging that many recognise the importance of taking time away from devices and digital connectivity.” UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

2025-06-16T07:30:54,"Brace For Impact: Bitcoin Price Primed For Deep Correction Below $90,000","The Bitcoin price, while still holding above $100,000, has not exactly inspired confidence in the crypto community recently. This comes as the digital asset failed to break above new all-time highs during last week’s rallies and, with the Israel-Iran conflict, saw a sharp plunge, erasing its weekly gains. Amid this, the bears have gained even more ground and are now more in control of the cryptocurrency’s price. Thus, the probability of a deep crash is heightened during this time. Bitcoin Price Could Crash Below $90,000 In a TradingView post, pseudonymous crypto analyst MIRZA has called for a possible Bitcoin price crash that could send the market spiraling even more. The crypto analyst points to the rising weakness of the Bitcoin price and the formation of bearish patterns on its price chart. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forms Descending Triangle Pattern Amid Israel-Iran Tensions The first notable bearish development was the fact that the Bitcoin price had been unable to break above $111,000 despite coming close last week. Since this is where the resistance for the previous all-time high lies, it shows that there is still not enough strength in the digital asset to continue its ascent. The result of this was the decline that sent it back toward the $103,000 as bears took a stand once more. This bearish drop suggests that the asset is now forming a potential double top or a lower high structure. Both of this are bad signs for any asset as it suggests that the upward momentum has ended and there is nowhere to go but down. This change in momentum toward the negative suggests that there could be a liquidity grab at lower levels. The crypto analyst predicts that there is a possibility that the upward trend could continue if the Bitcoin price is able to break above $107,000 and maintain it. Otherwise, the Bitcoin price is expected to crash by more than 15%, pushing it below $90,000 and as low as $85,000 before a bottom is established. BTC Bearish Sentiment Grows MIRZA is not the only crypto analyst who has called a possible price crash for Bitcoin. RLinda, also took to the platform to share what she expects next for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap. She points out that the Israel-Iran conflict was the reason that the Bitcoin price lost its bullish trend and was trending back downward at this point. Related Reading: XRP Price Still On Track For $1.5T Market Cap And 27% Crypto Market Dominance However, Bitcoin continues to hold support above $100,000 so far, which has shown some strength. As a result, the analyst explains that the BTC price could end up ranging between $102,500 and $106,200 for a while as a result. The end of this, however, could end up going two ways. If Bitcoin breaks above $106,200, then it has a shot to rise above $110,000 again. However, if it loses the $102,500 support, then the next crash would send it toward $100,000 again.

2025-06-16T07:30:14,"Argentina Is Cardano’s Biggest Opportunity Yet, Says Hoskinson","In an AMA on June 15, Charles Hoskinson declared Argentina the single most promising frontier for Cardano’s expansion, citing a confluence of political reform, crypto-driven economic liberalization, and Cardano’s entrenched presence on the ground. The IOG founder positioned Argentina as the platform’s next major strategic play after years of foundational work across Africa—arguing that the stakes, scale, and timing in Latin America now far exceed those of past initiatives. Argentina Is Cardano Territory Now “Argentina is likely going to be the first country of the modern era to have private money over central banks,” Hoskinson stated , contrasting it directly with other so-called crypto nations. “That’ll all be cryptocurrencies for private money,” he added, noting that nearly $100 billion of Argentina’s $700 billion GDP is now in crypto. He credited much of this transformation to President Javier Milei , whom he praised in strikingly idealistic terms: “Our good friend down in Argentina, Milei, did not let the people down. He did quite the opposite. He actually got it done He opened his economy up.” Hoskinson went so far as to call Milei “the prince that’s promised”—a notable departure from his far more critical remarks on other national leaders like El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele, whom he described as “authoritarian” and “opaque.” The contrast between the two couldn’t be sharper. While El Salvador received widespread media coverage for making Bitcoin legal tender, Hoskinson dismissed its relevance: “Let me get this straight—a dictator who stayed in office longer than the Constitution permitted […] who arrests any of his political opponents […] that’s Bitcoin Land?” He added, “Where’s the blockchain transparency? Where are the audits? Is that real Bitcoin or ‘Chivo’ Bitcoin?” By contrast, Argentina’s pivot is, in his eyes, structurally aligned with Cardano’s ethos. He emphasized that Milei doesn’t just tolerate crypto; he actively disintermediates central banks, encouraging a system where “you don’t need to pass a law—just do it.” Cardano, Hoskinson argued, already holds a strategic first-mover advantage in the region. “We had the largest office of any cryptocurrency in the top 10 in Buenos Aires,” he said. “A 100-person office that we set up in the old Google office. All politicians came and said, ‘Wow, these guys are serious.’” That reputation, he asserted, gives Cardano not only credibility but leverage in shaping the blockchain infrastructure across Latin America. While Hoskinson acknowledged past challenges in Africa—particularly the derailment of Ethiopia’s blockchain ambitions due to political instability—he maintained that IOG and Cardano have learned from those early setbacks. “Africa still is in the portfolio,” he confirmed. “But we’re a lot wiser now.” The new strategy emphasizes microcredit, payments, and sustainable, bottom-up fintech rather than fragile government partnerships. Returning to Argentina, Hoskinson pointed out that the political conditions now enable real adoption at scale, with infrastructure and education already underway. He left no doubt about Cardano’s readiness: “We’re not going to lose this. We’re going to move quickly.” At press time, ADA traded at $0.645.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-cardano-biggest-opportunity-hoskinson/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|Argentina|Cardano news|Cardano Price|Charles Hoskinson",cryptocompare

2025-06-16T07:17:51,"Is MicroStrategy’s BTC Buying Spree Putting the Crypto Market at Risk?","The post Is MicroStrategy’s BTC Buying Spree Putting the Crypto Market at Risk? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A viral post on X by a user named CHAIN MIND is sending shockwaves across the crypto community, comparing MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to a ticking time bomb — and warning it could collapse even harder than FTX. The post questions whether MicroStrategy’s $62 billion Bitcoin bet is an asset or a growing liability — and what could happen to the broader crypto market if the company’s high-risk strategy begins to unravel. MicroStrategy Holds 582,000 BTC Worth Over $62 Billion MicroStrategy is currently the largest public holder of Bitcoin, with over 582,000 BTC, valued at approximately $62 billion. This gives the company control of 2.77% of Bitcoin’s total supply — an unprecedented level for a single public entity. While the aggressive accumulation has made headlines, critics argue that the method behind it could be deeply flawed. Share Dilution, Debt, and a Never-Ending Bitcoin Buying Cycle According to CHAIN MIND, MicroStrategy uses a cyclical strategy: Issue new shares or debt Use the proceeds to buy BTC Announce the purchase Watch the stock price climb Repeat the process In 2025 alone, MicroStrategy has added 133,850 BTC to its balance sheet, including 26,695 BTC purchased just last month. And it’s not slowing down — a new $1 billion share sale has been announced via an ATM (At-the-Market) program, further diluting shareholder value. “They are leveraging their own equity to buy Bitcoin in a loop — and most investors have no idea how risky that is,” warns CHAIN MIND. New Accounting Rules Reveal $5.9 Billion in Unrealized Losses Adding fuel to the fire, recent accounting rule changes now force companies to disclose unrealized losses on Bitcoin holdings. For MicroStrategy, this meant reporting $5.9 billion in paper losses in Q1 2025 alone. This revelation triggered a class-action lawsuit by shareholders, who allege that the company failed to disclose the risks posed by the accounting changes. Could a Bitcoin Crash Trigger a MicroStrategy Meltdown? MicroStrategy’s average Bitcoin buy price is now $70,000. A drop below this level could severely pressure the company’s balance sheet. If Bitcoin falls 22% below this mark, analysts at Standard Chartered warn that it could force large-scale liquidations and send shockwaves through corporate Bitcoin investors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Saylor Joins Pakistan’s Crypto Mission , To understand the magnitude: Public companies collectively hold about 764,070 BTC MicroStrategy alone holds 582,000 BTC (71%) The second-largest holders, Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms, trail far behind If MicroStrategy is forced to sell, it won’t just hurt shareholders — it could tank the entire crypto market. Why This Matters for Every Bitcoin Investor CHAIN MIND closes the thread with a strong warning: “If you hold Bitcoin, your fate is now partially tied to MicroStrategy’s. You better understand what that means.” The post has sparked heated debate, raising a critical question — is MicroStrategy driving the Bitcoin bull run, or dangerously overleveraged like FTX before its crash? .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-16T07:15:29,"VanEck Flags Emerging Risk for Bitcoin-Holding Firms — Can Companies Avoid Value Erosion?","VanEck is warning that the Bitcoin treasury strategy adopted by several public companies may be on shaky ground, as rising risks threaten to erode rather than enhance shareholder value. The firm’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel, said some firms are approaching a critical threshold, where continued Bitcoin accumulation may end up eroding, rather than creating, shareholder value. In a Monday X post , Sigel pointed to the growing risk posed by at-the-market, or ATM, share issuance programs used by these firms to fund Bitcoin purchases. No public BTC treasury company has traded below its Bitcoin NAV for a sustained period. But at least one is now approaching parity. As some of these companies raise capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to buy BTC, a risk is emerging: If the stock trades at or near… — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) June 16, 2025 Time for Safeguards as Premiums Shrink? When stocks trade well above their Bitcoin net asset value, or NAV, issuing new equity brings in a premium. But once that stock price nears parity with the value of its Bitcoin holdings, dilution sets in. “That is not capital formation. It is erosion,” Sigel wrote. He argued that companies using Bitcoin as a treasury asset should adopt guardrails while premiums still exist. Among the measures he recommends is pausing ATM programs if the stock trades below 0.95 times NAV for 10 or more trading days. Additionally, he suggests launching strategic reviews if the discount continues. He also advises prioritizing buybacks when Bitcoin rises but the stock price does not reflect that gain. VanEck Flags Familiar Pattern as BTC-Rich Firms Face Shareholder Pain Sigel added that executive compensation should be tied to NAV per share growth. In contrast, it should not depend on the size of a firm’s Bitcoin holdings or the total number of shares issued. He drew comparisons to the crypto mining sector, where relentless share issuance and inflated pay packages led to long-term shareholder losses. “No need for a sequel,” he warned. While no public company has consistently traded below its Bitcoin NAV, VanEck’s Sigel noted that Semler Scientific, a California-based medical technology firm, is now close. Semler entered the crypto market in May 2024 and has since accumulated 3,808 BTC, worth roughly $405m. Despite Bitcoin’s strong performance this year, Semler’s stock has dropped more than 45% year to date, dragging its market capitalization to about $435m. As a result, its multiple of NAV, or mNAV, has slipped below 1x, landing near 0.82x. The gap shows that investor confidence in Bitcoin does not always lead to equity gains. This is especially true when companies rely on aggressive capital raises to fund their crypto purchases. Semler, like many firms pursuing a Bitcoin treasury strategy, has raised funds through both equity and debt offerings. This approach is based on the belief that rising Bitcoin prices will eventually boost the stock as well. However, as Sigel pointed out, those gains are never guaranteed. Without structural discipline, companies risk eroding value just as fast as they aim to create it.

2025-06-16T07:10:33,"Can ADA escape bearish momentum as a key support zone approaches?","Cardano may be nearing a bullish reversal as it forms a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart, a structure commonly associated with trend reversals. According to data from crypto.news, Cardano ( ADA ) was priced at $0.6404 with a market cap of $23.12 billion as of press time. At its present price, the token is down 15% over the past 30 days and remains 44% below its year-to-date highs. Cardano earlier hit its 2025 high on March 3, when it surged 75% within a single day, largely driven by its inclusion in U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed crypto strategic reserve, announced a day prior. Another contributing factor was investor optimism around the potential approval of Grayscale’s spot Cardano ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. However, sentiment has since cooled as network activity declined and the SEC delayed its decision on the ETF until July 15, 2025. You might also like: Ethereum eyes recovery as whale inflows surge — is a breakout above $2.6K brewing? Despite recent weakness, ADA’s technical structure is showing signs of potential recovery. The formation of a falling wedge pattern, a bullish reversal indicator, is developing, with price action narrowing toward a crucial support level. ADA price, 20-day EMA and MACD chart — June 16 | Source: crypto.news ADA is approaching the $0.51 zone, a level previously defended by bulls during a corrective phase in April. A continued drop toward this level could precede a trend reversal if buyers regain control. The token has also slipped below its 20-day exponential moving average, reinforcing short-term bearish pressure. The MACD remains negative, indicating a lack of bullish momentum, while the Relative Strength Index stands at 41, a signal that points to bearish conditions without yet reaching oversold territory. ADA RSI chart — June 16 | Source: crypto.news A decisive breakout above the wedge and key resistance at $0.68 could signal a reversal and drive ADA toward the $0.86 level, approximately 34% above current prices. Conversely, failure to hold above $0.51 could expose ADA to a deeper decline toward $0.32, the next major support. While price action remains weak, fresh developments may offer a catalyst for recovery. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently confirmed that XRP will be integrated into Lace Wallet, Cardano’s native wallet platform. The move will allow users to manage XRP alongside ADA and Bitcoin, increasing utility and cross-asset exposure. Moreover, Cardano is exploring XRP-based DeFi initiatives and potential integration of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, which could boost liquidity across its ecosystem. Further upside catalysts include the anticipated Glacier airdrop, linked to Cardano’s Midnight protocol, and Hoskinson’s proposal to convert $100 million worth of ADA into Bitcoin and stablecoins. The treasury strategy aims to generate non-inflationary revenue and stimulate growth within the Cardano DeFi ecosystem.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous analyst Credible tells his 70,500 YouTube subscribers that if demand for Bitcoin ramps up, it is possible for BTC to consolidate above $100,00 before sparking the next leg up. The trader also says that Bitcoin’s bullish market structure will not be invalidated even if BTC drops all the way down to $92,000. “In the most bullish scenario… this green zone ($100,000 to $105,000) would hold and we’d form a tightening consolidation and then rip to the upside in the impulse… So in this scenario, Bitcoin basically really just does go sideways here. And in case, a lot of the altcoins that I’m looking at have little leg down left to hit the ideal buy zones across the board on a number of alts that I’m looking at. And that’s why I think that Bitcoin could make one more lower low, potentially in the zone here ($92,000 to $95,00), or in the most bullish case, just go sideways while alts bleed a little bit.” Source: Credible Crypto/YouTube While Credible thinks that Bitcoin is gearing up for rallies to new all-time highs, he highlights that it is still within the realm of possibility for BTC to plunge below $90,000 or even $80,000, according to the principles of Elliott Wave Theory. Elliott Wave Theory states that a bullish asset tends to witness a five-wave rally, where waves one, three and five are moves to the upside, while waves two and four are corrective periods. Says Credible, “The correction isn’t complete, and so we’re not quite ready yet to take off… If the correction isn’t complete, it doesn’t mean that if we break this low here at $100,000, that all of a sudden things have changed and it’s terrible. No. Again, since we’ve completed this impulse (from $74,000 to $112,000), the correction that follows, which we’re in right now, can go down to $97,000. It can go down to $91,000. It can even go down to $85,000. It doesn’t make a difference as long as it’s above the origin ($74,000).” Source: Credible Crypto/YouTube Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that Bitcoin is in the midst of consolidating within a major wave three rally that started when Bitcoin dropped to $74,000 in April and is en route toward a new all-time high of $238,000. But Credible warns that his wave three outlook for BTC will be invalidated if Bitcoin drops below $74,000. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,379.

Pakistan, which has made bold moves regarding Bitcoin (BTC), has now started talks with Strategy founder Michael Saylor.

The meeting between the parties focused on the country's cryptocurrency policies and the possible use of Bitcoin as part of its national reserves. While voicing his support for Pakistan’s crypto efforts, Saylor stated that he is open to serving as an advisor for the country’s crypto strategy. Pakistan is making recent moves to become a crypto-friendly country, with the government setting up a crypto authority to regulate crypto last month. At this point, the official Bilal Bin Saqib announced at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference held in Las Vegas at the end of May that Pakistan will establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Related News: Surprise Country with Binance Founder CZ as Advisor Announces They Will Establish Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve! ""Thank You USA!"" This decision represents a significant shift from the Pakistani government’s previous stance that it would never legalize Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as Pakistan had previously maintained that cryptocurrencies would never be legal in the country. However, Pakistan's attitude towards crypto began to change earlier this year. The Pakistani government initially established a “National Crypto Council” in February 2025. This council was established to oversee the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and attract foreign investment. Afterwards, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ), one of the most influential names in the industry, was appointed as a Strategic Advisor to the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC). Just three days after CZ’s appointment, Pakistan’s Finance Minister’s advisor Bilal Bin Saqib announced plans to allocate some of the country’s surplus electricity to Bitcoin mining and AI data centers. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-16T06:34:36,"Bitcoin Price Volatility Signal Goes Off – Is a Surge Ahead?","This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. A key indicator suggests that bitcoin's BTC price could soon become more volatile, possibly leading to the next leg higher in the cryptocurrency. This indicator is based on the gap between the bollinger bands, which are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-week simple moving average of the cryptocurrency's price. When the gap widens, it indicates that the market is more active and volatile – a phenomenon historically observed ahead of significant upward moves in BTC. When the gap narrows, it indicates less activity. The gap, also known as the bollinger band spread, could soon widen in a positive sign for the bulls, as the MACD histogram linked to the same gap has turned positive. Using the spread between the bollinger bands as input in the MACD histogram generates bullish or bearish volatility signals, identifying periods of turbulence and calm. Traders typically use the indicator to detect trend reversals in prices. The upper pane displays bitcoin's weekly open, high, low, and close (per UTC) in candlestick format. The middle pane displays the spread, or the gap between the bollinger bands, with the MACD linked to the spread in the lower pane. The MACD has now flipped positive, indicating a renewed widening of the spread or volatility boom ahead. By default, volatility is price-agnostic, meaning an impending activity could be bullish or bearish. That said, a closer look at the above chart reveals that previous positive crossovers of the MACD (marked by vertical lines) presaged major bull runs, including the late 2020 and late 2024 price rallies. Let's see if history repeats itself.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/16/bitcoin-price-volatility-signal-goes-off-is-a-surge-ahead,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Volatility|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-16T06:28:22,"Michael Saylor to advise Pakistan on national Bitcoin strategy","Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor has expressed willingness to advise Pakistan on its Bitcoin reserve strategy following a high-level meeting with the country’s finance leaders. According to local media , Saylor met with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and State Minister on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib in Islamabad on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s emerging digital asset framework and its plan to integrate Bitcoin into its sovereign reserve strategy. Saylor, whose company holds the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury , discussed how Bitcoin could support national resilience and long-term economic transformation. He noted that Pakistan “has many brilliant people” and emphasized that leadership and clarity would attract capital to the country. The Finance Ministry shared a video of the meeting, in which Saylor stated that when the world sees a nation taking a leadership role in Bitcoin, “they get behind the leader and they send their money to you.” “I look forward to working with you,” he told the ministers, signalling his willingness to support Pakistan’s Bitcoin reserve initiative in an advisory capacity. You might also like: Michael Saylor boasts Strategy’s ‘indestructible balance sheet’ Saqib’s office described the meeting as a milestone in Pakistan’s bid to build a “robust digital assets policy framework” and position itself as a “Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market.” Saqib believes Pakistan can adopt a similar model to Saylor’s, pointing to how he “transformed a mid-sized software firm” into a Bitcoin powerhouse through strategic conviction. With “the talent, story, and energy” already in place, Saqib argued that there’s no reason Pakistan, as a nation, can’t follow the same path. The meeting comes weeks after Pakistan confirmed plans to create a national Bitcoin reserve , just days after establishing the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority. Speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas in May, Saqib announced that the government was setting up a long-term Bitcoin wallet and had no plans to sell its holdings, framing the initiative as a matter of state strategy. Pakistan also plans to allocate 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres, a move designed to monetise stranded energy assets and attract foreign capital. Officials have framed this as part of a broader effort to modernize the power and technology sectors. The Pakistan Crypto Council, launched in March, has been central to these developments. Saqib serves as both the CEO of the council and a state minister. In June, the council presented a draft legal framework for crypto regulation, which the Finance Ministry agreed to fast-track. Pakistan has previously tapped other global crypto figures for guidance, including Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao, who came on board as a strategic adviser to help shape its blockchain infrastructure and regulatory landscape.

Saylor praised Pakistan’s progressive approach to cryptocurrency adoption and urged the country to consider Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset for monetary resilience. “Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience,” he said , adding, “Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.” Pakistan’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In March, the country launched the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), which aims to regulate and integrate blockchain technology into its financial system.

We have the talent, the story, and the energy.” According to the Ministry of Finance press release on Sunday, the dialogue was hailed as a “milestone” in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework, attract global institutional interest, and “position itself as a Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market.” The PCC is set to play a pivotal role in “formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan,” the Finance Division said.

In a recent post , Lubin highlighted the increasing demand for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) coming from institutional investors. He believes that the spike in corporations that stock up on ETH and BTC by adopting a digital asset treasury strategy is a big indicator that the financial system is shifting to DeFi . Therefore, he predicts that Wall Street will soon dive into decentralized protocols and digital assets as more and more companies join the race. This is because he believes Wall Street figureheads care about financial instruments that are consistently climbing higher in value. And right now, crypto is on their watchlist. “They will be motivated to deep dive and learn what’s up with these strategies. They will have to deeply understand the details of Bitcoin and Ethereum and the strategies of MSTR and SBET. They will have do go deep on DeFi on Ethereum,” said Lubis. In addition, he believes it is up to the crypto space builders and developers to get Wall Street “excited” about decentralized finance by continuing to grow innovation within the space and aim to widen mainstream adoption of DeFi alongside crypto. You might also like: Europe’s first Bitcoin Treasury firm plans to raise $340m to buy more BTC Wall Street to spearhead accelerated shift to DeFi Lubin sees the shift already beginning with financial regulators like the SEC no longer chasing after crypto firms as they once did during the Biden administration under Gary Gensler .

Despite the major advancements already made, he believes that the shift has only just begun and is on its way towards an acceleration fueled by institutional demand. In early June, Ethereum’s price movements showed signs of an incoming rally as Wall Street demand signaled a potential comeback for the token.

2025-06-16T06:04:09,"Ethereum eyes recovery as whale inflows surge — is a breakout above $2.6K brewing?","Ethereum is showing fresh signs of strength as more big investors enter the market. The second-largest cryptocurrency by value is trading at $2,575, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Over the last week, its price has moved between $2,473 and $2,869, during a time when global markets have been uneasy due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran. Trading activity around Ethereum ( ETH ) has picked up sharply. In the past day, daily spot trading volume rose over 32% to $14.27 billion. At the same time, data from Coinglass shows that futures trading volume is up 26.46% to $53.09 billion. Open interest, or money locked into ETH futures, has gone up by 1.20% to $35.13 billion. This shows that more traders are placing new bets, likely expecting a bigger move in price. On-chain data also points to growing interest. According to a June 14 post by Santiment, wallets holding between 1,000 and 100,000 ETH have been buying heavily. These larger holders, often called whales and sharks, have added 1.49 million ETH in the past month. Their total share of the ETH supply is now 26.98%. At the same time, many smaller holders appear to have sold for profit, meaning large players are buying while others cash out. https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1933662569954164978?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw You might also like: Will Ethereum price reach $3,000 in June?

Other companies, such as Cumberland and Galaxy Digital, are also expanding their holdings, indicating strong interest from big institutional players. On the technical side, Ethereum is trading just below its 20-day average and moving within a tighter price range. Bollinger Bands are starting to narrow, a sign that volatility is compressing ahead of a potential breakout . The relative strength index is neutral at 52, but increasing volume and whale activity may help push the price higher. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Although they continue to show some weakness, momentum indicators like the 10-period momentum and the moving average convergence divergence seem to be bottoming out. If the MACD line crosses above the signal line in the coming sessions, it would be a bullish sign of renewed upward momentum. The next major resistance zone is located around $2,870 if bulls are able to push the price above $2,600 with volume confirmation. A close above that would open the door toward $3,000. On the downside, a retest of the lower Bollinger Band around $2,400 might occur if the price is unable to stay above the 20-day average.

2025-06-16T05:38:22,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Eases Slightly After Record High","Despite rising operational costs, leading miners like Marathon Digital and CleanSpark are not only expanding production but also choosing to hold their mined BTC. This could mean that miners have long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s value. Meanwhile, institutional players like Strategy and its co-founder Michael Saylor also continue accumulating. Market sentiment is also still bullish, supported by strong ETF inflows and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as an alternative to gold and Treasuries. Analysts warn, however, that geopolitical shocks could still challenge this momentum. Mining Difficulty Slips but Bitcoin Miners Still Battle Bitcoin's mining difficulty saw a slight decline, dropping to approximately 126.4 trillion after reaching a record high of 126.9 trillion on May 31. This adjustment, while minor, happened amid increasing financial pressure on miners due to reduced block rewards after the April 2024 halving, rising energy costs, and sustained high network hashrate. These combined factors are pushing up competition and production costs, testing the profitability and resilience of mining operations. Bitcoin mining difficulty (Source: CryptoQuant ) Despite these headwinds, some publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies are not only managing to stay afloat but are expanding aggressively and adopting a new approach by holding onto their mined Bitcoin instead of selling it. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is a major player in this trend. In May, the company boosted its Bitcoin output by 35% by mining 950 BTC during a month that was marked by record hashrate levels and heightened market volatility. MARA’s decision to keep all the Bitcoin it mined pushed its corporate treasury to 49,179 BTC, which made it one of the largest institutional holders of Bitcoin globally. “Record production month for MARA — and we sold zero Bitcoin,” CFO Salman Khan said in a post on June 3. CleanSpark, another publicly listed mining company focused on sustainable energy, also reported gains . The firm produced 694 BTC in May, which was up 9% from April, and now holds 12,502 BTC in reserves. According to CEO Zack Bradford, CleanSpark increased its operational hashrate to 45.6 exahashes per second by the end of May, representing a 7.5% increase from the previous month. Bitcoin miners are some of the top Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The shift in strategy by companies like MARA and CleanSpark could mean that there is a deeper confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Saylor Signals New BTC Buy Mining companies are not the only institutions interested in hoarding Bitcoin. For now, BTC is holding steady above $105,000 despite escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, including Israeli airstrikes on Tehran and concerns over potential disruptions to global oil supply. The relative price stability of Bitcoin comes at a time when global financial markets are bracing for increased volatility when trading resumes on Monday. In a move that suggests continued confidence in Bitcoin, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor posted a BTC chart that many see as a sign of another imminent Bitcoin purchase by the company. Strategy’s most recent acquisition took place on June 9, when it bought 1,045 BTC worth around $110 million. This brought the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings to 582,000 BTC. According to data from SaylorTracker, Strategy is now up more than 50% on its Bitcoin investment, which translates into over $20 billion in unrealized gains. Saylor’s timing is interesting, as the announcement was made during a weekend of heightened conflict between Israel and Iran. Despite these geopolitical developments, Bitcoin only experienced a minor 3% dip since the conflict escalated. This price stability has been supported by strong investor interest in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which recorded more than $1.3 billion in net inflows over the past week. According to Farside Investors , BTC ETFs saw five straight days of capital inflows, which means that there is sustained demand for exposure to Bitcoin. Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Source: Alternative ) Market sentiment is also still bullish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index standing at 61 . This suggests that investors are still optimistic in the face of global uncertainty. However, not all analysts share this confidence. Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin warned that if Iran were to close the Strait of Hormuz—a crucial passage for 20% of the world’s oil shipments—it could cause a spike in energy prices. Such a development would have huge ripple effects across global markets, and could potentially drag down risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, due to increased economic pressures. While Bitcoin’s current performance points to its role as a hedge against geopolitical turmoil, the events in the Middle East and their broader economic consequences will still be key variables influencing market sentiment over the next few days. Woes Push Investors Toward Bitcoin Overall, Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a viable alternative to traditional stores of value like gold and US Treasuries, according to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley . In a recent statement, Horsley shed some light on Bitcoin’s total addressable market as not only the $16 trillion gold market but also the $30 trillion-plus held in US Treasury securities by institutions and individual investors. His comments came in response to economist Mohamed El-Erian , who explained that US Treasury flows are no longer a reliable indicator of investor sentiment during times of market stress. Instead, El-Erian suggested that analysts look to flows into gold and silver, traditional safe havens, for clues about where capital is moving during rising uncertainty. Bitcoin’s positioning as a digital alternative to gold has gained momentum, especially as investors seek tools to hedge against geopolitical risks, inflation, and market instability. With its decentralized design and capped supply, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a savings technology that offers protection from the risks tied to fiat currencies and government-managed financial systems. The recent geopolitical developments and fiscal concerns have only strengthened this narrative. In the United States, President Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” has come under scrutiny for its projected $2.5 trillion in deficit spending, which adds to the country’s already staggering $37 trillion national debt. Critics, including Elon Musk and other fiscal conservatives, argue that the bill undermines the long-term financial stability of the country. The bond market reacted sharply to these concerns in April of 2025, particularly after Trump’s proposed trade tariffs and the growing debt load. Investors dumped government bonds, which led to a spike in yields as they demanded higher returns to offset the perceived risk of holding US debt. Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, said that the market was clearly rattled by Trump’s fiscal policies and that calming the situation would require a major shift in economic strategy. Against this backdrop of fiscal instability and geopolitical tension, Bitcoin continues to attract attention as a potential safe haven.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9573/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-eases-slightly-after-record-high,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|MINING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

With rising adoption, TVL, and institutional interest, SUI could be eyeing long-term price targets of $5, $10, or even higher in the coming months. SUI started the year strong as it briefly crossed the $5 mark. But it further dropped over 65% as the selling pressure kicked in. Despite the drop, the buyers quickly stepped in and helped the price recover. The interest is growing again now and the momentum looks set to continue. SUI is currently trading at $3.07, up 2.9% in the last 24 hours. It is showing mixed technical signals with most moving averages bearish. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is around 41, indicating that momentum has cooled, and the MACD also points to a slowdown. If SUI holds above $3.10, it could climb to $3.50 this week. A rise above $3.50 may trigger a bigger rally; but if it drops below $3.00, then more selling could follow. Will SUI End June at $4? SUI started off the month slow and is stuck in a tight range as bears tried to push the price down. However, buying pressure is expected to rise in the next few days breaking past its resistance levels. The outlook for June remains bullish, with SUI likely to end the month between $3.80 and $4.00. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Saylor Joins Pakistan’s Crypto Mission , Analysts said that SUI is shaping up to be a major player in the next bull run.

The announcement comes following a decision by its board of directors to issue the 18th series of ordinary bonds to Evo Fund.

As reported earlier, Metaplanet’s stock surged more than 4,800% over the past year, after its pivot to Bitcoin investment strategy. Metaplanet is now Japan’s most shorted stock, says CEO as Bitcoin bulls warn of a global short squeeze. “Really bad timing to be short,” says Blockstream’s Adam Back. #Bitcoin #Metaplanet https://t.co/aWGJO2iQGi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 21, 2025 Seamus Rocca, CEO at Xapo Bank, shared his perspective on the rising corporate Bitcoin allocations recently. In an email to Cryptonews, he said that the increase in corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is “significant.” However, “it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions,” Rocca added. “It’s about allocating what a business can afford to hold over a five-to-ten-year horizon, without being forced to sell into volatility.” Further, he said that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet “represent high-conviction outliers,” with bold strategies that align with their unique business plans. “In this space, patience and discipline can be underrated virtues,” he told Cryptonews. “Our view has been, and remains, that Bitcoin deserves serious consideration—but with a disciplined, long-term framework: focus on the asset itself, avoid speculative trading, and size positions responsibly.” Company Adapts Strategy Amid Yen Depreciation Metaplanet’s recent announcement to issue $210 million in 0% ordinary bonds comes at a time when Japan is facing economic challenges, characterized by high debt levels and yen depreciation. As a result, the strategy underscores Metaplanet’s commitment to leveraging Bitcoin’s potential for long-term appreciation. The Japanese Yen kicked off the week on a weaker note. However, the anticipation that the Bank of Japan might push for tighter monetary conditions, along with trade-related uncertainties, lends some support to the safe-haven Japanese Yen.

Saylor reportedly met with top Pakistani officials over the weekend to explore how crypto could help reshape the country’s financial future. The talks, described by officials as a “landmark discussion,” brought Saylor together with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib . The agenda focused on how Bitcoin could be used in sovereign reserves and monetary policy. Meanwhile, Pakistan is accelerating efforts to become a digital asset leader in the Global South. “Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation, and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” said Aurangzeb, who also chairs the Pakistan Crypto Council. Pakistan Finds an Ally in MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Saylor, who heads the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, welcomed Pakistan’s outreach. In a video posted by a finance ministry official, he praised the country’s clarity and commitment.

The meeting comes after a series of bold steps by Islamabad. In March, the government established the Pakistan Crypto Council to create a legal framework for digital assets. Then in April, it introduced the country’s first national crypto policy, designed to align with FATF standards. Soon after, the government created the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority. In addition, it announced a state-backed strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. With Support from Zhao and Trump Allies, Pakistan’s Crypto Plan Gains Weight Saylor is not the only high-profile figure showing interest. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao was appointed a strategic advisor to the PCC in April. His addition, despite past legal controversies, is seen by officials as a signal of global credibility. Others from US political and financial circles have also entered the picture. Gentry Beach Jr., a close ally of President Donald Trump, visited Islamabad as part of a US delegation helping shape the council’s structure. Meanwhile, Zachary Witkoff, son of Trump associate and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, signed a deal in April between his firm, World Liberty Financial, and the PCC. The agreement aims to embed blockchain technology into Pakistan’s financial systems. Additionally, the company is reportedly linked to the Trump family, with Eric, Donald Jr. and Jared Kushner holding a controlling stake.
