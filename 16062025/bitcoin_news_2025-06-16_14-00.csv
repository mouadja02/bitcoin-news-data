2025-06-16T11:47:24,"Top Companies Buying Bitcoin in 2025 – MicroStrategy No Longer Alone","The post Top Companies Buying Bitcoin in 2025 – MicroStrategy No Longer Alone appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A new report from ‘MicroStrategist|BitcoinPower.Law ’ uncovers an accelerating global trend: corporations are aggressively accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries. While MicroStrategy holds a significant lead , smaller, agile firms are rapidly increasing their Bitcoin holdings, signaling a dynamic shift in the corporate crypto landscape. MicroStrategy’s Dominance: A Double-Edged Sword MicroStrategy remains the undisputed leader in corporate Bitcoin holdings, boasting a massive 582,000 BTC tokens. This translates to an impressive 2.771% of Bitcoin’s total supply , dwarfing the second-largest holder, Marathon Digital Holdings, which possesses 49,179 BTC (0.234% of total supply). However, MicroStrategy’s substantial lead comes with heightened expectations. The report suggests that the company’s ability to further expand its Bitcoin reserves hinges on continued access to bond funding. Bitcoin’s Market Trajectory: What the Numbers Say Bitcoin is currently trading above its long-term power law trendline, indicating strong upward momentum. Based on the power law model, projected median Bitcoin prices are: $336,000 by 2030 $998,000 by 2035 In the past year, Bitcoin’s price has surged by over 61.3%, and in the last 30 days, it has climbed 3.4% to reach $107,036. Despite a pause in the global M2 money supply, the report highlights that Bitcoin typically lags liquidity by 12 weeks, suggesting potential for further growth in the coming months. The Rise of Agile Accumulators: Smaller Firms Making Big Moves The report emphasizes that smaller companies are exhibiting the fastest Bitcoin accumulation per share, often seeing their share prices rise in tandem with their increasing “stacking speed.” Here’s a look at some notable smaller players: Semler Scientific: Holds 3,808 BTC tokens and has acquired over 1,424 BTC in 2025 alone. The company’s valuation could see a boost if ongoing legal issues related to its QuantaFlo device (which led to a $29.75 million settlement in principle) are fully resolved. ALTBG: Possesses approximately 620 BTC, valued at $66,098,274. The company appears to be fairly valued and is reportedly preparing for substantial Bitcoin acquisitions. MetaPlanet: Owns 8,888 BTC, with a value of around $947,550,746. Investors are advised to exercise caution as its price appears overvalued. Smarter Web (SWC): Holds around 10.6 BTC, valued at $1,130,067. SWC stands out with a high daily BTC yield of 9.6%, though the report cautions about potential reversals if momentum fades. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Michael Saylor Backs Japan’s Metaplanet After Record-Breaking BTC Push , Navigating the Risks: High Valuations and Hype Cycles The analysis warns that companies with high market Net Asset Value (mNAV) and high days to close (DTC) may be overhyped. A slowdown in Bitcoin stacking by these firms could lead to sharp declines in their share prices. Identifying Smart Bitcoin Stacking Opportunities The report advises investors to look for companies that balance rapid Bitcoin accumulation with sustainable growth. Key tools for guiding investment decisions include mNAV, DTC, and fair value charts. Crucially, investors are cautioned to avoid companies at their price peaks during hype cycles. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a new research report, Coinbase says that stablecoins are at the front and center of “the future of money.” According to research done for Coinbase by The Block Pro Research, 81% of crypto-aware small and medium businesses (SMBs) are interested in using stablecoins, while the number of Fortune 500 companies that say their firm plans to use or are interested in stablecoins has gone up over 200% from 2024. “With over 161 million stablecoin holders globally, plus a 54% growth in global stablecoin supply year-over-year, 2025 is shaping up to be the breakout year for stablecoins.” Coinbase says stablecoins are currently the dominant force powering on-chain utility and real-time global payments. “According to new research… organic stablecoin transfer volume has reached unprecedented levels with the two highest monthly volume transfers in history happening in the last 12 months. December 2024 set a monthly volume record of $719 billion, followed closely by April 2025’s $717.1 billion. Consumers, institutions, and small and medium businesses (SMBs) alike have identified stablecoins as a key solution to addressing their biggest financial pain points. Use cases include remittances with near-instant and low-cost cross-border transactions, lower payment processing fees, increased payroll efficiencies, inflation protection, and bridging payments gaps for the under and unbanked.” At time of writing, the entire stablecoin sector has a market cap of $260 billion, according to data from CoinGecko .

2025-06-16T11:37:38,"How High/Low Can Bitcoin Price Go This Week?","The post How High/Low Can Bitcoin Price Go This Week? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is at a decisive crossroads this week, with bulls eyeing a breakout past key resistance. Despite a recent decline in price, the sentiment across the derivatives and spot markets is seeking to go all bullish. With BTC price trading around $107,095 and posting nearly 2% daily gains, the broader crypto market is also watching closely. Liquidity zones below could act as traps for short sellers, while sustained momentum above $107k could ignite an altcoin rally. Join me in this pursuit of deriving the potential Bitcoin price targets for this week. Onchain Data: Options Market Goes Bullish The most telling signal this week comes from the options market. As per Glassnode , the 25 Delta Skew, a metric to measure the demand for calls versus puts, has turned heavily bullish: 1-week skew jumped from -2.6% to +10.1% 1-month skew rose from -2.2% to +4.9% This shift highlights traders rapidly accumulating short-dated call options, expecting upward volatility. It is worth noting that the divergence between rising skew and stagnant spot prices suggests that the market is anticipating an imminent breakout, which is not yet priced in. Such skew dynamics generally come before sharp directional moves, with the current bias suggesting upside. The surge in skew, especially for near-term expirations, stresses confidence in a bullish catalyst within the next few days. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Calm Before the Breakout Storm According to a post by analyst Michael van de Poppe , Bitcoin’s price structure indicates that a larger expansion could unfold if BTC price sustains above the $107,000 mark. The chart analysis shared by him shows that the $106.6k to $107k range remains the crucial area for momentum ignition. He further mentions that if the liquidity build-up around $105.5k is broken, a sweep toward $103k is likely. Successively, the spot buy zones lie in the $103k level, with further safety nets below $100k. That being said, psychological elements like geopolitical stability, particularly in the Middle East, could boost risk-on appetite and trigger a breakout momentum. If bulls clear $107k, an upside move toward $108k could be on the horizon, which could potentially open the gates to $110.5k. Also read our Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 for long-term price forecasts. FAQs What price levels are key to watch this week? Resistance lies at $107k–$108.9k, while support zones are around $105.5k and $103k. What does the 25 Delta Skew tell us? It signals that traders are expecting volatility and are skewed heavily toward short-term upside. Could BTC price fall below $100k again? Only if $105.5k and $103k support fail, a move under $100k would likely occur, and be liquidity-driven.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/how-high-low-can-bitcoin-price-go-this-week/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

In a recent post on X, Steph highlighted a striking similarity between XRP’s current price structure and the path Bitcoin followed before its explosive rally in April 2025. The pattern is sparking renewed optimism that XRP may soon follow suit, potentially launching a powerful upward move. Bitcoin’s Playbook: Rally, Retrace, and Rebound Bitcoin’s surge began in November 2024 when it broke past $80,000 and rallied toward an all-time high of $108,000 by December. This move was fueled by optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s re-election, increased institutional demand, and growing confidence in digital assets as a hedge amid economic uncertainty. After the peak, Bitcoin entered a correction phase in early 2025, dipping to around $75,000–$77,000 by March. However, in Q2, it sharply reversed course. Breaking out of its downtrend, Bitcoin regained momentum and set a new all-time high of over $112,000 by May. #XRP is about to explode. Just like Bitcoin did! pic.twitter.com/BXEpRkRnxx — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) June 15, 2025 XRP: A Step Behind, But Catching Up? XRP closely mirrored Bitcoin’s path in late 2024. As Bitcoin surged, XRP climbed as well, reaching highs above $3 by early 2025. But just like Bitcoin, XRP retraced, dropping to a consolidation range between $2.00 and $2.50. Where things differ is what happened next. While Bitcoin has already staged a strong recovery and continues higher, XRP remains in consolidation. This delay may signal an opportunity. XRP now appears to be in the same chart position Bitcoin was in just before its April breakout. “ XRP is about to explode . Just like Bitcoin did,” according to Steph. Fractal Behavior and Market Psychology In crypto markets, it’s not uncommon for altcoins to mimic Bitcoin’s major moves with a time lag. This “fractal” behavior, where assets repeat similar patterns under different conditions, can often precede sharp price shifts. Traders watching XRP believe that if the pattern holds, a breakout could be imminent. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Currently trading around $2.20, XRP is showing classic pre-breakout signs: tightening price action, lower volume, and higher lows. These technical signals echo what Bitcoin displayed before its sharp move higher in April. Beyond technicals, XRP is backed by improved fundamentals. XRP has been ruled not to be a security when sold on exchanges, significantly de-risking the asset for institutional investors. Ripple’s strategic advancements have further solidified XRP’s role in real-world use cases, including cross-border payments and liquidity management. Despite this progress, XRP’s price has yet to reflect these developments, adding to speculation that a major move is brewing. A Familiar Setup, a New Opportunity Steph’s analysis presents a compelling case: XRP may simply be running behind Bitcoin on the same path. While past patterns don’t guarantee future performance, the similarities are hard to ignore. If XRP continues to mirror Bitcoin’s playbook, it may not be long before it breaks out of its current range, potentially delivering the explosive move investors have been waiting for.

Trader Tardigrade, a widely followed analyst on X , has identified a classic “golden cross” formation on the BTC daily chart, a bullish crossover where the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) rises above the 200-day SMA. Historically, this pattern signals the beginning of major uptrends. This is the fourth golden cross Bitcoin has posted since 2023. The previous three saw price gains of 49%, 125%, and 68%. Applying these historical averages, Tardigrade projects a conservative upside target of $152,000, about 44% higher than today’s price of $106,802. #Bitcoin 50 SMA and 200 SMA formed a Golden Cross This signal has boosted $BTC by 49%, 125%, and 68% since 2023 whenever it has occurred. If $BTC experiences its worst and best gains from this point, it could reach $152k and $229k. These targets are reasonable given the recent… pic.twitter.com/PGEinfxpHE — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) June 14, 2025 Under stronger market conditions, however, the analyst sees Bitcoin potentially soaring to $229,000, a move that would represent a 118% rally. These predictions are rooted in more than just chart patterns. Bitcoin is already up roughly 47% from its April lows and has rallied 656% since the current market cycle began in late 2022. For traders watching closely, the golden cross is not just a pattern; it’s a potential roadmap. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Resistance Near $107K Remains Key As of now, Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading near a critical resistance zone at $107,270. This level has acted as a ceiling multiple times over the past two weeks, and a breakout of this level can turn the price forecast bullish. The current 1-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle formation, with price compressing between rising support and declining resistance lines. The 50-period EMA at $105,853 has turned upward, confirming short-term bullish momentum. MACD readings support this thesis as the indicator line crosses above the signal, though there’s no aggressive divergence. A recent green candle with a long upper wick suggests sellers are active just above current levels, meaning a breakout will require volume and conviction. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The candlestick structure shows higher lows forming, but without follow-through confirmation, it’s still a coin toss between a breakout and a reversal. A close above $107,270 would put bulls in the driver’s seat. Failure could send BTC back toward support at $105,437 or even $104,532. BTC/USD Trade Strategy: Breakout or Pullback? Whether you’re a novice or seasoned trader, this setup presents an actionable opportunity: Bullish Entry: Above $107,270 close with volume Targets: $108,349 and $109,254 Stop-Loss: Below $105,400 Bearish Setup: Close below $105,437 Target: $104,532 Stop: Above $106,200 With momentum aligning behind the golden cross and Bitcoin nearing an inflection point, this is a critical juncture for bulls and bears alike. A confirmed breakout could validate Tardigrade’s $229K thesis, while a rejection may delay upside for weeks.

Metaplanet Stock Soars Metaplanet’s stock (MTPLF) jumped over 30%, rising from 1,769 JPY to 2,301 JPY after the company revealed it had purchased 1,112 Bitcoin for around $117.2 million. The average price per coin came in at $105,435. This major buy pushed Metaplanet’s total holdings to 10,000 BTC – reaching its 2025 target well ahead of schedule. The firm also reported a 266.1% year-to-date return on its Bitcoin strategy in 2025, underscoring the strength of its bold accumulation plan. Huge Money Plan for More Bitcoin But they’re not stopping there. Metaplanet plans to grow its holdings to 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026 – a symbolic nod to Bitcoin’s hard cap of 21 million coins. To make that happen, the company has issued 555 million MS warrants, aiming to raise 770.9 billion yen ($5.34 billion). The entire amount is set to be used for more Bitcoin purchases. This is the largest issuance of its kind in Japanese capital market history, and it’s also the first MS warrant in Japan priced above market value, a move that signals serious confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Saylor Still Leads With Strategy’s Massive Holdings While Metaplanet is making headlines, Saylor’s firm Strategy still holds the crown. As of June 9, the company owns 582,000 BTC, valued at around $62.3 billion, with a one-year return of 158%. On Sunday, Saylor dropped a subtle hint at another upcoming buy, posting “Bigger Dots are ₿etter” along with a chart showing Strategy’s weekly BTC accumulations.

2025-06-16T11:30:35,"Bitcoin Price: Explosive Bullish Signal Eyed by Analyst","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Explosive Bullish Signal Eyed by Analyst Are you watching the Bitcoin price closely? Many in the crypto community are, and a recent observation from a seasoned analyst suggests exciting times might be ahead. Get ready to dive into the technical signals that could be pointing towards significant upward momentum for BTC in the near term. Decoding the Latest BTC Price Prediction Crypto analyst Omkar Godbole, known for his technical insights shared on platforms like CoinDesk, has highlighted potential catalysts for positive volatility in the Bitcoin price . His recent analysis points to specific technical indicators on Bitcoin’s weekly chart that have historically preceded periods of strong upward movement. Understanding these indicators is crucial for anyone trying to make sense of potential future price action. It’s not just about hoping for a rally; it’s about identifying the underlying technical shifts that market participants watch. Why Bullish Indicators Are Catching Attention Godbole’s analysis focuses on two key technical tools: the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) and the Bollinger Bands. Let’s break down why their current state is considered significant: MACD Crossover: The MACD is a momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. A bullish signal often occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, especially when it moves into positive territory (above the zero line). Godbole notes that on Bitcoin’s weekly chart, the MACD has indeed shifted into positive territory. This suggests that the shorter-term momentum is starting to outpace the longer-term momentum, a classic sign traders look for when anticipating a potential uptrend. Think of it as the market’s engine starting to rev up after a period of consolidation or decline. Bollinger Bands Widening: Bollinger Bands measure market volatility. They consist of a simple moving average and upper and lower bands set a standard deviation away from the average. When the bands contract, it signals low volatility and often precedes a significant price move. When they start to widen, it indicates increasing volatility. The observation that the gap between the Bollinger Bands is widening suggests that a period of low volatility is ending, and a larger price swing – potentially to the upside, given the MACD signal – could be imminent. This widening is like a coiled spring starting to release energy. These two indicators, when seen together displaying bullish signals, provide a compelling technical picture that supports the analyst’s view of potential upward movement for the Bitcoin price . Implementing a Basic MACD Strategy in Crypto For traders and investors, understanding indicators like the MACD isn’t just academic; it can inform trading strategies. While Godbole’s observation is on the weekly chart (suggesting a longer-term perspective), the principles of a basic MACD strategy can be applied across different timeframes. A common approach involves looking for: Bullish Crossovers: When the MACD line crosses above the signal line. This is often interpreted as a buy signal. Positive Territory: When the MACD is above the zero line, confirming bullish momentum. Divergence: If the price makes a lower low but the MACD makes a higher low, it’s called bullish divergence and can signal potential trend reversal. Applying this to the current scenario, the weekly MACD moving into positive territory is a strong signal according to this strategy. However, it’s crucial to remember that no indicator is foolproof. A robust MACD strategy should always be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis and strict risk management. Broader Implications for Crypto Market Analysis Bitcoin often acts as the tide that lifts or lowers all boats in the cryptocurrency market. A significant bullish move in the Bitcoin price typically has positive ripple effects across the altcoin market. Traders performing crypto market analysis often look to Bitcoin’s chart for early signs of overall market sentiment shifts. If Bitcoin enters a period of strong upward volatility as suggested by the technical indicators, we could see renewed interest and capital flow into altcoins as well. This could lead to broader rallies across the digital asset space. Conversely, if Bitcoin’s move falters, it can quickly dampen sentiment across the entire market. Therefore, even if your primary interest is in altcoins, keeping a close eye on Bitcoin’s technical health and price action, guided by insights from reliable crypto market analysis , is essential. Historical Precedent: Do These Signals Always Deliver on the BTC Price Prediction ? The analyst mentions that historical data suggests such trajectories typically precede an upcoming bull run. It’s true that strong technical signals, particularly on higher timeframes like the weekly chart, have often aligned with the beginning of significant upward trends in Bitcoin’s history. For example, similar MACD movements and volatility expansions have been observed before previous major bull cycles. These indicators capture shifts in market dynamics – changing momentum, increasing participation, and accumulating pressure – that can lead to explosive price movements. However, it’s vital to approach any BTC price prediction based on historical data with caution. The crypto market is known for its volatility and unpredictability. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Unexpected macroeconomic events, regulatory news, or changes in market structure can override even the strongest technical signals. Therefore, while the historical context provides a compelling narrative and adds weight to the analyst’s view, it should serve as a potential scenario rather than a guaranteed outcome. Actionable Insights and Key Takeaways So, what should you do with this information? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep watching the Bitcoin price and pay attention to how these technical indicators evolve on the weekly chart. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t rely solely on one analyst’s view. Explore other technical and fundamental factors influencing Bitcoin. Consider Risk Management: If you plan to trade based on potential bullish signals, always use stop-loss orders and manage your position sizes appropriately. The potential for positive volatility also means potential for negative volatility if the signal fails. Look for Confirmation: See if other indicators or market factors align with the bullish view before making significant decisions. This analysis provides a technical lens through which to view the current state of the crypto market analysis for Bitcoin. It highlights potential upside based on established indicators. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope on the Horizon? The observation by analyst Omkar Godbole regarding the weekly MACD moving into positive territory and the widening Bollinger Bands offers a compelling technical argument for potential bullish momentum in the Bitcoin price . These are signals that have historically coincided with the lead-up to significant upward moves. While no BTC price prediction is ever certain, the confluence of these bullish indicators provides a technical foundation for optimism among market participants. Traders employing a disciplined MACD strategy and comprehensive crypto market analysis will be watching closely to see if these signals translate into sustained upward price action. As always, navigating the crypto market requires careful consideration, thorough research, and a strong understanding of risk.

2025-06-16T11:20:48,"Bitcoin Whales and Retail Investors: Powerful Signal as Holding Reaches New Lows","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whales and Retail Investors: Powerful Signal as Holding Reaches New Lows Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? One of the most insightful ways to gauge market sentiment is by looking at on-chain data, specifically how investors are moving their assets. Recently, a significant trend has emerged concerning Bitcoin Holding behavior, and it’s catching the attention of analysts. Understanding BTC Inflows: What Do They Tell Us? Exchange inflows refer to the amount of cryptocurrency being sent from private wallets or cold storage onto centralized exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, etc. Why is this data important? Because investors typically move assets onto exchanges when they intend to sell them, trade them for other assets, or use them for short-term activities. Conversely, low inflows suggest investors are keeping their assets off exchanges, often a sign they plan to hold for the long term. Crypto analyst Darkfost recently highlighted a crucial data point on CryptoQuant: BTC Inflows to Binance reached their lowest level since the start of the current market cycle on June 16th. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a significant drop-off in the supply of Bitcoin being made readily available for potential selling on one of the world’s largest exchanges. Bitcoin Whales and Retail: A Unified Front? What makes this particular data point so compelling is that this low inflow trend isn’t limited to just one type of investor. Darkfost’s analysis indicates that both large investors (often referred to as Bitcoin Whales due to their massive holdings) and smaller, everyday investors ( Retail Crypto Investors ) are exhibiting this same behavior. This alignment between different market participants is relatively uncommon and carries significant weight. Whales: These entities control substantial amounts of BTC. Their movements can significantly impact market supply and demand. When whales move BTC *onto* exchanges, it often precedes large sell-offs. When they keep it off, it signals confidence or anticipation of higher prices. Retail Investors: While individual retail holdings are smaller, their collective actions represent broader market sentiment. If retail is sending BTC to exchanges in large volumes, it can indicate panic selling or profit-taking. Low retail inflows suggest they are content to hold. The fact that both groups are showing synchronized low inflows suggests a widespread conviction to hold rather than sell at current price levels. This could indicate: Strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential and higher future prices. A strategic pause, waiting for clearer macroeconomic signals (like interest rate decisions or inflation data) before making major moves. An accumulation phase where investors are buying dips and transferring BTC to cold storage. What Does This Signal for Crypto Market Sentiment? This coordinated holding pattern is generally interpreted as a positive sign for overall Crypto Market Sentiment . Reduced selling pressure from both major and minor players removes a significant potential headwind for price appreciation. While it doesn’t guarantee immediate price pumps, it builds a foundation for potential future rallies by limiting the available supply on exchanges. Think of it like a supply squeeze – if fewer people are willing to sell, even modest buying pressure can have a more pronounced effect on price. Historically, periods where investors show a strong propensity for Bitcoin Holding , especially when confirmed by low exchange inflows, have often preceded upward price movements. It suggests the market is in an accumulation or holding phase, where participants are positioning themselves for future gains rather than exiting their positions. Challenges and Considerations While low inflows are a bullish indicator, it’s important to consider the full picture. Other factors influencing the market include macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, institutional adoption, and global events. Additionally, some large transactions occur off-exchange (OTC deals), which wouldn’t show up in exchange inflow data. However, the consistent low inflow trend across both whale and retail addresses onto major exchanges remains a compelling data point. Actionable Insight For investors tracking the market, paying attention to on-chain metrics like exchange inflows can provide valuable context beyond just price charts. While not financial advice, understanding that large segments of the market are choosing to hold rather than sell can help inform your own perspective on current market strength and potential future direction. Compelling Summary The recent data showing historically low Bitcoin inflows to Binance from both whales and retail investors is a powerful signal. It indicates a widespread preference for holding BTC, reflecting either strong long-term conviction or a strategic wait-and-see approach. This synchronized Bitcoin Holding behavior reduces potential selling pressure and is generally seen as a positive underlying factor for the Crypto Market Sentiment , suggesting that many participants anticipate further gains down the line.

When Will the Law Come Into Effect? The Digital Technology Law is set to go live on January 1, 2026. It will provide legal frameworks not just for digital assets, but also for AI, blockchain , and semiconductor development, positioning Vietnam as a rising digital powerhouse in Asia. This move reflects the country’s strategic ambition to boost productivity, innovation, and intelligence through legal clarity and technology governance. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Hong Kong’s MemeStrategy Adds 2,440 Solana and 1 Bitcoin to Its Crypto Treasury , International Compliance: A Key Priority Vietnam’s inclusion on the FATF grey list for weak crypto regulations has long hindered its global reputation.

As implementation begins, Vietnam will: Set detailed regulatory guidelines for licensing and operations Enforce compliance standards for financial institutions and crypto service providers Require strict adherence to AML, CFT, and cybersecurity protocols This sweeping reform is expected to fuel foreign investment, foster innovation in digital industries, and secure Vietnam’s place on the global tech stage. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-16T11:11:38,"Metaplanet Overtakes Coinbase After Buying More Bitcoin","This happened after Metaplanet’s latest purchase of 1,112 BTC worth $117 million. With total holdings now at 10,000 BTC, Metaplanet’s accumulation pace has intensified. The company also plans to acquire up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Investor confidence appears strong, with the firm’s share price up 22% on the day of the announcement and over 430% year-to-date. Meanwhile, VanEck’s Matthew Sigel issued a warning to Bitcoin-buying firms about potential shareholder dilution if stock prices fall below BTC net asset value. He specifically pointed to Semler Scientific’s recent struggles. Despite the concerns, institutional inflows into crypto investment products remain robust, with $1.9 billion in inflows last week. Metaplanet Hits 10,000 Bitcoin Japanese investment firm Metaplanet officially became the seventh-largest publicly traded company holding Bitcoin. This allowed it to surpass Coinbase after acquiring an additional 1,112 BTC. The latest purchase was announced on Monday, and was valued at 16.88 billion Japanese yen, or approximately $117 million. With this acquisition, Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached 10,000 BTC, more than Coinbase’s 9,267 BTC according to data from Bitbo . The company now holds Bitcoin at an average price of 13.9 million yen, or roughly $96,400 per BTC. This milestone happened just two weeks after Metaplanet became the eighth-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, which proves the speed and intensity of its accumulation strategy. On the same day, Metaplanet revealed that it secured $210 million through zero-interest bonds, which were immediately directed toward Bitcoin purchases. This move aligns with the company’s bold new strategy of acquiring up to 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. This goal will require an additional 200,000 BTC to be purchased over the next 18 months. Investor enthusiasm around Metaplanet’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy was reflected in its share price , which soared more than 22% on Monday to reach 1,895 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The stock also saw a meteoric rise of over 430% since the start of the year, fueled by the firm’s very impressive Bitcoin accumulation. Metaplanet YTD share price (Source: Google Finance ) The announcement was also announced in the midst of the geopolitical tensions that caused Bitcoin’s price to dip from $110,000 to $103,000 in just three days. Despite the market volatility, institutional interest in Bitcoin is still robust. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor confirmed his firm’s continued buying plans despite the global uncertainty, and Bitcoin ETFs saw five consecutive days of net inflows last week. Bitwise Asset Management CEO Hunter Horsley added to the optimism by suggesting that Bitcoin’s potential is not limited to replacing gold but could also challenge the $30 trillion US Treasuries market as a dominant store of value. VanEck Warns Bitcoin Buying Firms to Rethink Strategy Public companies aggressively buying Bitcoin may soon need to rethink their strategies, according to VanEck’s head of digital assets research, Matthew Sigel. In a post on X , Sigel warned that as some firms continue raising capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to purchase Bitcoin, a new risk is emerging—shareholder dilution if stock prices fall too close to or below the net asset value (NAV) of their Bitcoin holdings. While no public firm has consistently traded below the NAV of its Bitcoin, Sigel pointed out that Semler Scientific is nearing this threshold. The medical tech company began buying Bitcoin in May of 2024 and has since gathered 3,808 BTC, which is currently valued at over $404 million. However, despite Bitcoin’s ongoing rally this year, Semler’s stock plunged more than 45%, bringing its market cap down to around $434.7 million. Its multiple of NAV has slipped to roughly 0.821x, which means that the stock is trading at a discount to its Bitcoin value. Semler Scientific YTD share price (Source: Google Finance ) Sigel warned that firms relying on ATM offerings to fund BTC acquisitions should implement safeguards immediately. He suggested halting ATM programs if the stock trades below 0.95x NAV for at least 10 consecutive days. Companies should also consider prioritizing stock buybacks when Bitcoin’s price increases but the firm’s equity fails to follow suit. If the discount persists, a strategic review should be launched that potentially lead to a merger, a spinoff, or an exit from the Bitcoin strategy entirely. He also advised that executive compensation should focus on growing net asset value per share, not the size of the Bitcoin position or the number of shares outstanding. Sigel explained that while there is still time to make calculated adjustments, continuing to dilute shareholders when trading at NAV levels becomes detrimental rather than strategic. Institutional Crypto Inflows Show No Signs of Slowing Despite these warnings, crypto investment products extended their streak of weekly inflows. Global crypto exchange-traded products recorded $1.9 billion in inflows for the week ending June 13, bringing the nine-week total to $12.9 billion. According to CoinShares , the year-to-date inflows into crypto ETPs have now reached a record $13.2 billion, pushing total assets under management up to $179 billion from $175.9 billion the previous week. Weekly crypto asset flows (Source: CoinShares ) Bitcoin investment products led the inflows once again by rebounding after two weeks of minor outflows with $1.3 billion added. Short-Bitcoin products also attracted $3.7 million in inflows, though their overall AUM remained modest at $96 million. Ethereum products followed with $583 million in inflows, which was their strongest week since February. Other altcoins also saw renewed interest. XRP products, which experienced three weeks of outflows, registered $11.8 million in inflows. Sui products added another $3.5 million to their total. Flows by asset (Source: CoinShares ) Meanwhile, BlackRock’s iShares crypto ETFs stood out among issuers by bringing in $1.5 billion last week and pushing their year-to-date inflows to $14.2 billion. Other US-based ETFs posted modest inflows of up to $95 million, while Europe’s CoinShares XBT Provider saw outflows of $17 million. Despite the impressive nine-week run of inflows, many issuers are still in the red for the year. Grayscale remains the largest loser with over $1.6 billion in year-to-date outflows, while ProShares is the only issuer with zero outflows so far this year, having accumulated $437 million in inflows. James Butterfill , head of research at CoinShares, shares that digital assets showed resilience during a week of geopolitical tension after Israel’s airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. The conflict led to increased demand for traditional safe-haven assets like gold, which spiked to $3,448. Bitcoin , whichtraded near $110,000 early in the week, dropped to $103,000 after the news broke, but quickly rebounded to $106,000 by week’s end. Ethereum also experienced volatility by briefly falling from $2,869 to $2,473 before recovering.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9578/metaplanet-overtakes-coinbase-after-buying-more-bitcoin,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-06-16T11:10:20,"Crucial Update: Iran Nuclear Program & Rising Geopolitical Risk Impacting Crypto","BitcoinWorld Crucial Update: Iran Nuclear Program & Rising Geopolitical Risk Impacting Crypto In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying ahead means understanding not just blockchain trends, but also the broader global forces at play. One such critical factor is Geopolitical risk , and recent developments surrounding the Iran nuclear program highlight just how interconnected global security and financial markets, including crypto, truly are. What’s Happening with the Iran Nuclear Program? Recent statements from key figures in the Middle East have brought the long-standing issue of the Iran nuclear program back into the spotlight. According to reports, Iran’s president has asserted that the nation has no intention of pursuing nuclear weapons. This statement, reportedly shared via accounts like The Spectator Index on platforms like X, aims to clarify Iran’s position amidst escalating regional tensions. This assertion comes shortly after comments made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As reported by The Times of Israel, Netanyahu indicated a potential willingness to pause Israel’s military campaign in certain contexts, provided Iran agrees to U.S. demands regarding the cessation of its nuclear activities. This exchange underscores the high stakes and the delicate diplomatic dance surrounding Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Understanding the historical context is crucial here. The Iran nuclear program has been a source of international concern for decades, leading to sanctions, negotiations, and periods of heightened tension. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, was an attempt to curb Iran’s program in exchange for sanctions relief, but its future remains uncertain after the U.S. withdrawal in 2018. Why Do Middle East Tensions Matter for Global Markets? The simple answer is stability. The Middle East tensions , particularly those involving key regional players like Iran and Israel, have a ripple effect across the globe. This region is vital for global energy supplies, and any conflict or significant instability can directly impact oil prices, which in turn affects broader economic outlooks and investor sentiment. Moreover, geopolitical flashpoints like the Middle East tensions contribute significantly to overall Geopolitical risk . This risk isn’t confined to the immediate area; it influences international relations, trade routes, and the willingness of investors to take on risk anywhere in the world. When major powers or regional players are in conflict or at odds over critical issues like nuclear proliferation, uncertainty rises dramatically. Here are a few ways Middle East tensions translate into global economic concerns: Energy Supply Disruption: The Strait of Hormuz, a critical shipping lane for oil, is located near Iran. Tensions can threaten this supply. Increased Defense Spending: Regional instability often leads to increased military expenditures, diverting resources. Sanctions and Economic Pressure: International efforts to curb nuclear programs often involve economic sanctions that impact global trade and financial systems. Refugee Crises: Conflict can lead to humanitarian crises with international implications. How Does Geopolitical Risk Influence the Crypto Market Impact? Now, let’s connect the dots to the world of digital assets. The Crypto market impact from rising Geopolitical risk is a subject of ongoing debate and observation. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have sometimes been referred to as ‘digital gold’ or safe-haven assets, suggesting they might perform well during times of traditional market uncertainty or geopolitical strife. The theory is that in times of crisis, investors might seek alternative stores of value outside of traditional financial systems or fiat currencies, which could be directly affected by conflicts or sanctions. Cryptocurrencies, being decentralized, theoretically offer an escape route from state control or geographically specific risks. However, the reality is more complex. The crypto market is still relatively young and highly sensitive to overall market sentiment. While some investors might view crypto as a hedge against geopolitical instability, others may simply see it as a risky asset class to sell off during times of uncertainty, contributing to Market volatility . Consider these potential scenarios for Crypto market impact during periods of heightened Middle East tensions and concerns over the Iran nuclear program : Safe-Haven Narrative Boost: Increased demand for Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies as investors flee perceived risk in traditional assets. Risk-Off Sentiment: A broad market sell-off where investors reduce exposure to all ‘risk assets,’ including cryptocurrencies, leading to price declines. Increased Volatility: Prices swinging wildly based on news headlines and shifting sentiment, making trading riskier. Focus on Privacy Coins: Potential increased interest in privacy-focused cryptocurrencies depending on the nature of the geopolitical event. Navigating Market Volatility: What Can Crypto Investors Do? Given the potential for Market volatility driven by global events like developments related to the Iran nuclear program and broader Middle East tensions , what steps can crypto investors consider? First and foremost, stay informed. While direct correlations between specific geopolitical events and immediate crypto price movements can be difficult to predict reliably, understanding the macro environment is key. Pay attention to major global news sources, not just crypto-specific ones. Secondly, consider your risk tolerance and investment strategy. If you are a long-term holder, short-term Market volatility might be less concerning than if you are an active trader. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your comfort level regarding potential price swings. Actionable insights for investors: Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Your crypto portfolio should ideally be diversified, and your overall investment strategy might include assets outside of crypto. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Investing a fixed amount at regular intervals can help mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak during volatile times. Set Realistic Expectations: Understand that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and geopolitical events can amplify this. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Reacting impulsively to news headlines can lead to poor investment choices. Stick to your pre-defined strategy. While the direct, causal link between every twist and turn in the Iran nuclear program discussions and specific crypto price movements isn’t always clear or immediate, the underlying theme of Geopolitical risk and Middle East tensions undeniably contributes to the global economic climate that influences the crypto market’s overall health and triggers periods of heightened Market volatility . Conclusion: Geopolitics and the Future of Crypto The statements from Iran’s president and Israel’s prime minister serve as a potent reminder that global politics and security issues are inextricably linked to financial stability. Developments surrounding the Iran nuclear program and the broader landscape of Middle East tensions contribute significantly to the global backdrop of Geopolitical risk . For the cryptocurrency world, this translates into potential Crypto market impact , primarily through increased Market volatility . While crypto’s role as a safe haven is still debated, its sensitivity to macro-economic and geopolitical shifts is evident. Staying informed about these global dynamics is not just about understanding world events; it’s a crucial part of navigating the complex and interconnected future of finance and digital assets.

2025-06-16T11:00:00,"Which Crypto Will Boom in 2025? Experts Point to Bitcoin Solaris as the Ultimate Bitcoin Successor","The crypto market is buzzing with speculation, but one question dominates every investor’s mind: Which crypto will boom in 2025? While many tokens are battling for attention, a growing wave of experts and insiders are pointing toward a rising star that blends legacy, innovation, and next-gen accessibility, Bitcoin Solaris. In a landscape hungry for the next big leap, this might just be the ultimate Bitcoin successor. The Legacy of Bitcoin and the Limits of XRP Bitcoin will always be the pioneer, a foundational asset that reshaped global finance. Yet, its slow transaction speeds and high energy demands make it less suited for today’s fast-paced, mobile-first environment. XRP, on the other hand, promised fast transactions and bank integrations, and while its tech is solid, ongoing legal battles and stagnant ecosystem growth have caused many to look elsewhere. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) charges in, not just as an alternative, but as a reinvention of what Bitcoin could be in 2025 and beyond. A Wealth-Building Machine with Real Utility At its core, Bitcoin Solaris is a tool for wealth generation. But not through speculation, through action. Its standout feature? Mobile mining through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app, allowing users to contribute to the network directly from their smartphones. No need for expensive rigs or complex setups. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Built to Boom in 2025 The technology under the hood of BTC-S is what separates it from countless hype coins.

2025-06-16T10:57:52,"VanEck analyst warns BTC Treasury model may backfire","Matthew Sigel, the head of digital assets research at VanEck, a global investment management firm managing billions of assets, believes there is trouble brewing on the horizon for companies in the corporate Bitcoin treasury sweepstakes. Sigel highlighted the developing issue for Bitcoin treasury companies in a lengthy X post. However, he also shared some alternative solutions for companies nearing the hypothetical danger zone to consider. $SMLR 👀 — matthew sigel, recovering CFA (@matthew_sigel) June 16, 2025 Sigel sees a problem for Bitcoin treasury companies Sigel’s post began by highlighting how no public BTC treasury company has yet to trade below its Bitcoin NAV for a sustained period. However, he claimed one is now approaching break-even territory, an emerging risk for some companies that raise capital through large at-the-market (ATM) programs to buy BTC. According to Sigel, if the stock trades at or near NAV (net asset value), continued equity issuance can dilute rather than create value, which would lead to capital erosion rather than formation. Under normal circumstances, companies like Semler and Strategy have stock prices that trade above the value of their Bitcoin (at a premium) which means that investors are willing to pay more for the stock than just the Bitcoin it owns. However, Sigel says at least one company’s stock price is getting very close to its Bitcoin NAV and if the stock price falls to or below the NAV, it’s a red flag. If the stock price is close to or below NAV, selling new shares becomes self-harming as it dilutes the value for existing shareholders, meaning each share represents a smaller piece of the company’s Bitcoin, something investors don’t like to hear. At break-even level, offerings no longer create value. Instead, they destroy shareholder value. It can also become extractive with the company’s management, who keep raising money via ATM offerings, reaping more benefits than the shareholders. Sigel offers solutions he believes could help Sigel has advised companies pursuing a Bitcoin treasury strategy to adopt safeguards now, while premiums still exist. He suggested announcing a pause to ATM issuance if the stock trades below 0.95 times NAV for 10 or more trading days and prioritizing buybacks when BTC appreciates, but the equity fails to reflect that value. He also mentioned launching a strategic review if NAV discount persists which might include a merger, spinoff, or sunset of the BTC strategy. As far as Sigel is concerned, “executive compensation should be aligned with NAV per share growth, not with the size of the Bitcoin position or total share count.” He highlighted how it has happened before with the BTC miners , pointing out that there was persistent issuance and outsized executive pay, things the industry could do without this time. “Once you are trading at NAV, shareholder dilution is no longer strategic. It is extractive,” Sigel wrot e . “Boards and shareholders should act with discipline now, while they still have the benefit of optionality.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

MemeStrategy bought 2,440 SOL tokens , worth about HKD 2.9 million (around USD 370,000), using OSL Group, a government-approved crypto platform. This shows MemeStrategy is serious about getting into the crypto space and signals a big step forward for Hong Kong’s crypto scene, too.

Similar to U.S.-listed firms like Upexi Inc. and Classover, MemeStrategy is adding Solana to its reserves. While the investment amount is modest, it shows increasing trust in alternative blockchain ecosystems like Solana. The platform’s proof-of-stake model, offering staking rewards and fast transaction speeds, makes it an attractive option for companies looking to integrate blockchain technology . Hong Kong Strengthens Its Crypto Credentials \The transaction is seen as a major strategic move by MemeStrategy. It was carried out via OSL, the first platform licensed under Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) virtual asset trading framework.

With MemeStrategy stepping into Solana, Hong Kong could be setting the stage for institutional crypto adoption in Asia. While companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla led the way with big Bitcoin bets in the West, Asia is taking a more regulated and diversified approach. By embracing platforms like Solana through licensed channels, Hong Kong is signaling that it’s ready to support the next wave of global crypto adoption, one that reaches beyond just Bitcoin. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-16T10:50:14,"Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Soar Past 10,000 BTC Milestone","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Soar Past 10,000 BTC Milestone Big news shaking up the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets! Metaplanet, a publicly listed company based in Japan, has just announced a significant milestone in its ambitious Bitcoin strategy. They’ve officially crossed the 10,000 BTC mark, solidifying their position as a major player in the world of institutional Bitcoin adoption, particularly within the Japanese market. For those following the space, Metaplanet has become synonymous with a bold Bitcoin accumulation strategy. This latest announcement, shared via their official X account, confirms the purchase of an additional 1,112 BTC. This single transaction dramatically boosts their total holdings, placing them firmly in the ranks of companies making substantial BTC investment commitments. Metaplanet Bitcoin: How Did They Reach 10,000 BTC? Reaching 10,000 BTC isn’t a small feat for any company, let alone one pivoting its core strategy around digital assets. Metaplanet’s journey to this impressive figure has been marked by consistent, strategic purchases. The latest acquisition of 1,112 BTC is a crucial step, but it’s part of a larger, ongoing plan for Bitcoin accumulation. Here’s a look at some key aspects of their approach: Consistent Strategy: Metaplanet hasn’t made just one or two purchases; they’ve demonstrated a pattern of regular Bitcoin accumulation, signalling a long-term view rather than speculative trading. Transparency: They’ve been relatively open about their Bitcoin strategy and holdings, which builds confidence among investors interested in their unique corporate treasury approach. Dedicated Funding: Unlike some companies that might allocate a small percentage of existing reserves, Metaplanet has actively sought dedicated funding mechanisms specifically for acquiring Bitcoin. This dedication highlights their conviction in Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset and a hedge against macroeconomic factors like currency devaluation and inflation. Funding This Massive BTC Investment: The Bond Strategy Explained One of the most interesting aspects of Metaplanet’s strategy is how they fund their Bitcoin accumulation. The latest purchase, and presumably future ones, are being financed through a significant issuance of bonds. Specifically, they recently decided to issue $210 million in 0% ordinary bonds. Let’s break down why this is noteworthy: Zero Percent Interest: Issuing bonds with a 0% interest rate is highly advantageous for the company. It means they can borrow a substantial amount of capital without the burden of regular interest payments, freeing up cash flow. Capital Allocation: The explicit purpose of these bonds is to fund further Bitcoin accumulation. This clearly signals to the market that the company is leveraging debt specifically to increase its exposure to BTC. Balance Sheet Strategy: By issuing debt to acquire Bitcoin, Metaplanet is essentially transforming liabilities (the bonds) into an asset (Bitcoin) on their balance sheet. The bet is that the appreciation of Bitcoin will significantly outweigh the principal amount of the bonds when they eventually need to be repaid. This strategy isn’t without risks, primarily tied to Bitcoin’s price volatility. However, it demonstrates a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and represents a creative approach to corporate treasury management in the digital age. Japan Bitcoin Scene: Metaplanet Leading Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s moves are particularly significant within the context of the Japan Bitcoin market. While institutional adoption has been gaining traction globally, Japan has sometimes been perceived as more cautious or slower to adopt compared to regions like North America. Metaplanet is changing that narrative. As a publicly listed Japanese company openly pursuing a Bitcoin-centric treasury strategy, they are acting as a pioneer. Their actions could pave the way for other Japanese corporations to consider similar strategies. What makes their position in the Japan Bitcoin market stand out? Public Profile: Being a listed company means their actions are visible and subject to public scrutiny, potentially influencing perceptions of Bitcoin among other businesses and investors in Japan. Regulatory Navigation: Successfully operating and executing a Bitcoin strategy within Japan’s regulatory framework provides a potential blueprint or case study for others. Local Impact: Increased institutional interest from domestic companies like Metaplanet can contribute to the growth and maturity of the local crypto ecosystem. While companies like MicroStrategy are larger in scale globally, Metaplanet’s role as a domestic leader in Japan’s institutional Bitcoin space is crucial for the regional adoption narrative. The Journey of Bitcoin Accumulation: Metaplanet’s Milestones Reaching 10,000 BTC is a major milestone, but it’s the result of a consistent journey of Bitcoin accumulation. Metaplanet began publicly announcing its Bitcoin strategy and purchases in 2024, quickly accumulating significant amounts. Here’s a simplified look at their rapid accumulation journey (approximate figures based on public announcements): Date (Approx.) Purchase Amount (BTC) Cumulative Holdings (BTC) May 2024 ~117.7 ~117.7 June 2024 (Early) ~250 ~367.7 June 2024 (Mid) ~23.3 ~391 June 2024 (Late) ~500 ~891 June/July 2024 ~1,112 ~2,003 July 2024 ~1,112 (Latest) 10,000 (Total after multiple purchases) Note: The path to 10,000 BTC involved multiple purchases not all detailed here, but the table illustrates the acceleration of their Bitcoin accumulation efforts. The latest 1,112 BTC purchase specifically took them over the 10k threshold from a previous figure (which wasn’t explicitly 8888 BTC, but the cumulative total reached 10k with this latest buy). This aggressive accumulation strategy underscores their confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation potential and its role as a store of value. What Does This Mean for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption Globally? Metaplanet’s success in reaching 10,000 BTC isn’t just a win for the company; it’s a significant data point for the broader narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Every time a publicly traded company successfully integrates Bitcoin into its treasury strategy, it adds legitimacy to the asset class. Here’s why this matters globally: Validation: It provides further validation of Bitcoin as a legitimate, investable asset class for corporate treasuries, not just speculative investors. Case Study: Metaplanet serves as a case study for other companies, particularly in Asia, demonstrating that it’s possible to navigate the complexities and regulatory landscape to implement a significant BTC investment strategy. Increased Demand: Institutional buying creates consistent demand for Bitcoin, which can have positive implications for its price and market stability over the long term. Diversification Trend: While Metaplanet is focusing heavily on BTC, their move is part of a larger trend where companies are exploring alternatives to traditional cash holdings, especially in environments of inflation or currency concerns. Metaplanet’s journey from announcing its Bitcoin strategy to accumulating 10,000 BTC in a relatively short period is a powerful example of how quickly institutional sentiment can shift and translate into tangible Bitcoin accumulation. Benefits and Potential Challenges of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Bet Taking a significant position in Bitcoin like Metaplanet has done comes with potential upsides and inherent risks. Potential Benefits: Upside Potential: If Bitcoin’s price continues to appreciate over the long term, Metaplanet’s treasury holdings could see substantial growth, potentially exceeding the value of their traditional business operations. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. For a Japanese company, this could be particularly relevant given economic conditions and currency fluctuations. Investor Attraction: This strategy can attract a new class of investors who are specifically looking for exposure to Bitcoin through traditional equity markets. First-Mover Advantage (in Japan): Being one of the first major publicly traded companies in Japan to adopt this strategy gives them a unique position. Potential Challenges and Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings. A sharp downturn could negatively impact Metaplanet’s balance sheet and potentially its stock price. Regulatory Risk: While they are operating within current regulations, future changes in crypto regulations in Japan or globally could pose challenges. Market Perception: Some traditional investors might view the strategy as overly risky or speculative, potentially limiting their investor base. Execution Risk: Managing a large amount of Bitcoin securely requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure. Metaplanet’s leadership has clearly weighed these factors and decided that the potential benefits of being a Bitcoin-centric company outweigh the risks, especially over a long investment horizon. Actionable Insights for Investors What can individual investors learn from Metaplanet’s bold move and significant BTC investment? While retail investors don’t have the same tools (like issuing 0% bonds), the core principles behind Metaplanet’s strategy offer valuable lessons: Conviction in the Asset: Metaplanet’s actions demonstrate strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For individual investors, this highlights the importance of doing your own research and developing conviction in your investment choices. Long-Term Perspective: Accumulating 10,000 BTC is not a short-term trade. It’s a long-term treasury strategy. This reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is often best approached with a multi-year investment horizon to potentially ride out volatility. Understanding Macro Trends: Metaplanet’s move is partly driven by macroeconomic factors (currency, inflation). Understanding how global economics might influence asset classes like Bitcoin is crucial for informed investment decisions. Strategic Allocation: While most individuals won’t put *all* their assets into Bitcoin, Metaplanet’s strategy prompts thought about how digital assets might fit into a broader, diversified portfolio, depending on individual risk tolerance and goals. Metaplanet’s journey is a powerful example of a company adapting to a changing financial landscape and placing a significant bet on the future of digital assets. In conclusion, Metaplanet reaching the 10,000 BTC milestone is a landmark event, particularly for the Japan Bitcoin ecosystem. It underscores the increasing pace of institutional Bitcoin adoption and showcases a creative, debt-financed approach to Bitcoin accumulation. As Metaplanet continues its journey, the market will be watching closely to see how this pioneering strategy unfolds and influences the broader corporate world’s view of Bitcoin as a treasury asset.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 LINK Crypto Price Forecast 2026 LINK Price Prediction 2027 Chainlink Price Analysis 2028 LINK Coin Price Prediction 2029 Chainlink Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency N/A Token LINK Price $ 13.66651798 4.32% Market Cap $ 8,980,268,563.9576 Trading Volume $ N/A Circulating Supply N/A All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) began the year on a downward trajectory, but by April, momentum started to shift. Early in the month, LINK began recovering from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a key neckline at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has struggled to sustain its position near this neckline, pulling back toward the support level of the rounded bottom by mid-June. This rounded bottom support also aligns with the LINK crypto’s multi-year support zone near $13. The continuation of this short-term price advance would require a break and a daily close above the $18 neckline. As this could indicate a potential upward move, with LINK targeting a retest of the $24 resistance level in June, an area supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. Should LINK break past the $24 mark, forecasts for late 2025 suggest the token could climb as high as $32.

Key Takeaways: Digital asset funds saw $1.9 billion in weekly inflows, pushing YTD totals to a record $13.2 billion. Bitcoin and Ethereum led inflows with $1.3 billion and $583 million. US investors drove most of the inflows, signaling strong institutional demand. The inflows mark the ninth consecutive week of gains and bring year-to-date inflows to a record $13.2 billion, according to a Monday report by CoinShares . Bitcoin led the charge with $1.3 billion in inflows, bouncing back after two weeks of minor outflows. Short Bitcoin Products See $3.7M Inflows, But AUM Remains Small Short-bitcoin products also attracted $3.7 million, though assets under management remain modest at $96 million. Ethereum recorded its strongest week since February, bringing in $583 million. The move included its largest single-day inflow in four months and brings ETH’s recent run to $2 billion, equivalent to 14% of its total assets under management. Regional participation remained concentrated in the U.S., which accounted for nearly all of last week’s inflows. Switzerland, Germany, and Canada followed with more moderate contributions. Meanwhile, Hong Kong and Brazil saw outflows of $56.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Elsewhere, XRP snapped a three-week losing streak with $11.8 million in inflows, while Sui products continued to attract interest with $3.5 million. The latest data suggests that institutional appetite for digital assets remains intact, even as traditional markets face macro uncertainty. BlackRock’s IBIT Becomes Fastest ETF to Reach $70B in Assets BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become the fastest ETF in history to reach $70 billion in assets, doing so just 341 days after launch, five times faster than the previous record-holder, the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). Among the 12 Bitcoin ETFs on the market, IBIT stands out as the dominant leader, far ahead of Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC, which each manage about $20 billion.

By November, it had already surpassed BlackRock’s own gold ETF in size, and in December, it became the fastest ETF to hit $50 billion in assets. Analysts have described IBIT’s rise as unmatched across any asset class or ETF type. Meanwhile, seven major asset managers, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and VanEck, submitted new or amended filings for spot Solana ETFs with the SEC on June 13. The filings mark the largest coordinated push for Solana-based investment products to date, with notable entries from 21Shares, Bitwise, and Franklin Templeton. Despite the excitement, analysts caution that approval may take time. Bloomberg’s James Seyffart pointed to the long road taken by Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting that the inclusion of staking language in all filings could complicate SEC approval. Staking was absent from earlier BTC and ETH ETF approvals, and the SEC has yet to greenlight staking in any fund.

Based on reports from CoinGecko, Ether is up 5% in the last 14 days and 5.4% over the past month. It’s trading around $2,625 almost 45% below its all‑time high. The slow grind suggests neither buyers nor sellers have full conviction. Still, big holders continue to stack coins, waiting for the next catalyst. Rising Activity On Layer 2 And Services On‑chain data shows whales directing attention to specific services. Transaction volume in Ethereum Name Service jumped over 300% in the second week of July. Lending protocols on Ethereum saw a more than 200% rise. Meanwhile, transfers of USDC on layer 2 networks—Base, Arbitrum and Optimism—all posted triple‑digit gains. These numbers point to growing use of scaling layers and services beyond simple trading. Spot ETF Inflows Update Institutional interest has been strong too. US spot Ether products saw inflows for 19 straight days before a small pullback. That streak brought in $1.37 billion, mostly into BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust. On the day the run ended, the funds recorded just a little over $2 million in outflows. It’s a minor wobble in what has so far been a solid embrace of Ether by big financial firms.

2025-06-16T10:30:31,"Pakistan Taps Michael Saylor To Shape Sovereign Bitcoin Policy","Pakistan’s sprint toward a state-level Bitcoin strategy has drawn an influential new ally. On Sunday, June 15, entrepreneur-turned-Bitcoin evangelist Michael Saylor held a video meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib to explore how the world’s oldest cryptocurrency could sit inside the country’s sovereign reserves. The Finance Ministry described the conversation as a “milestone” in Pakistan’s digital-assets agenda, and Saylor, whose firm Strategy holds the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, offered to continue “in an advisory capacity.” Michael Saylor Joins Pakistan’s Bitcoin Pivot According to the press note seen by local media Dawn, discussion centred on whether Bitcoin can underpin monetary resilience in an economy that has long relied on dollar liquidity and IMF balance-of-payments support. Saylor, credited with turning a mid-tier software vendor into a $100-billion market-cap vehicle for Bitcoin exposure, framed the asset as “the strongest instrument for long-term national resilience.” He argued that Pakistan can seize a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance,” echoing his thesis that digital scarcity is an antidote to fiat debasement. The video feed, later posted to X by Finance-Ministry media chief Hamid Raza Wattoo and widely circulated by crypto outlets, captured Saylor linking capital flows to reputational credibility. “The most important thing is leadership — intellectual leadership — and that they trust you,” he told Aurangzeb and Saqib. “If the world trusts you and they hear your words … the capital and the capability will flow to Pakistan. It’s there; it wants to find a home.” He closed by saying, “I look forward to working with you.” Aurangzeb, who heads the newly created Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), responded that Islamabad “aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation and inclusive growth.” Saqib called Saylor’s trajectory proof that Bitcoin now carries “sovereign-grade” status. “If private individuals can build that in the US, why can’t Pakistan, as a nation, do the same? We have the talent, the story, and the energy,” he said. Saylor’s credibility in the role is anchored in Strategy’s 582,000-Bitcoin cache, currently valued at roughly $61 billion, amassed through successive equity and debt offerings since 2020. His endorsement comes as Pakistan tries to codify rules for custody, mining and taxation. The PCC, launched in March, has already formed a technical committee for a draft Digital-Assets Act and is coordinating with the State Bank of Pakistan, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Action Task Force. Parallel legislation would create the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) as an umbrella watchdog. Yet the legal landscape is still contested. Only two weeks ago, senior State Bank officials reminded lawmakers that “cryptocurrency remains banned” under existing directives and that enforcement cases are being forwarded to law-enforcement agencies. The juxtaposition of an official Bitcoin reserve with a de jure ban has produced what Dawn characterised as a “policy in disarray.” Pakistan’s political leadership has nevertheless accelerated operational plans. In late May Saqib unveiled a state-managed Bitcoin cold wallet at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas and secured Cabinet approval to dedicate 2,000 megawatts of surplus power for Bitcoin mining and AI data-centre workloads. The capital-hungry energy policy is seen in Islamabad as a way to monetise excess generation capacity while building a strategic stockpile of BTC that could, in theory, diversify external reserves currently dominated by dollars and gold. Saylor’s expected advisory remit has not yet been formalised, and neither side disclosed whether Strategy would take a commercial stake. But the meeting underscores Pakistan’s intent to import not just technology but also intellectual capital. Saqib, fresh from a US roadshow that included talks with New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the New York Crypto Council, noted that “Pakistan is establishing itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency economy and setting trends rather than following them.” For now, the largest obstacle remains regulatory coherence. A sovereign Bitcoin reserve, ministerial advocacy and Saylor’s star power have vaulted Pakistan into the global spotlight, but a statutory framework acceptable to both domestic regulators and the IMF will determine whether the country can convert momentum into durable policy.

Shares of Metaplanet surged more than 17% to 1,769 yen on Monday morning in Tokyo, according to Yahoo Finance data . Since the start of the year, its stock has risen over 408%, reflecting investor enthusiasm around its Bitcoin-heavy strategy. A key indicator Metaplanet tracks is its bitcoin yield, the percentage change in the ratio of total BTC holdings to fully diluted shares outstanding. According to the firm’s internal figures, this metric has posted strong quarterly growth, with yields reaching 309.8% in Q4 2024 and 87.2% so far in Q2 2025. Looking ahead, Metaplanet has laid out an ambitious roadmap. The company n ow targets 210,000 BTC under management by the end of 2027. Japanese investment firm @Metaplanet_JP has unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. #Metaplanet #Bitcoin https://t.co/jCQ3G0uzPC — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 6, 2025 Having reached 10,000 BTC, it would need to acquire an additional 200,000 BTC over the next 18 months to stay on track. Metaplanet Becomes Japan’s Most Shorted Stock as Bitcoin Strategy Deepens The Tokyo-listed firm, once a budget hotel operator, has continued to mimic MicroStrategy’s playbook, buying 1,088 BTC on June 2 at an average price of ¥15.5 million (~$108,600) per coin. Metaplanet’s aggressive pivot to a Bitcoin-focused strategy has made it Japan’s most shorted stock , despite a staggering 4,800% rise in share price over the past year. Metaplanet is now Japan’s most shorted stock, says CEO as Bitcoin bulls warn of a global short squeeze. “Really bad timing to be short,” says Blockstream’s Adam Back. #Bitcoin #Metaplanet https://t.co/aWGJO2iQGi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 21, 2025 Metaplanet’s Bitcoin accumulation is being fueled by rapid capital market activity. On May 29, the company issued ¥3.2 billion ($21 million) in zero-coupon bonds , its 17th round, shortly after a ¥7.5 billion ($50 million) issuance . The proceeds are going directly into Bitcoin buys. Metaplanet announced issuance of its 17th series of ordinary bonds bearing no interest for $21 million, to fund additional BTC purchases. #Metaplanet #BitcoinPurchase #BondIssuance https://t.co/qYqXHbjSJr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 29, 2025 Globally, 116 public companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Recent additions include GameStop and Sweden’s H100. Giants like Tesla and Marathon Digital still lead, with over $1 billion in BTC each. Even after Bitcoin dipped from $110K to $103K last week amid geopolitical tensions, institutional appetite hasn’t slowed. ETFs recorded five straight days of inflows, totaling over $1.3 billion, according to Farside Investors. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently argued that Bitcoin could eventually rival the $30 trillion U.S. Treasuries market. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor reaffirmed that Strategy would continue buying BTC, highlighting how the “Bitcoin standard” playbook is still influencing corporate treasury strategies worldwide.

2025-06-16T10:26:28,"3 U.S. Economic Data Reports That Could Impact Bitcoin Price This Week","The post 3 U.S. Economic Data Reports That Could Impact Bitcoin Price This Week appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News This week could be a turning point for crypto markets – not because of a new ETF or token hype, but thanks to three major U.S. economic updates that could shake up the Fed’s next move. With retail sales, jobless claims, and the FOMC rate decision all dropping within days, Bitcoin traders are watching the macro landscape closely. If signs of a slowing economy get louder, rate-cut bets go up and that’s usually good news for Bitcoin. Let’s look at what’s coming. Retail Sales Dip Could Spark Talk of Rate Cuts Retail sales data is due this week, and economists aren’t optimistic. They expect a 0.6% drop from April to May, signaling that U.S. consumers may be pulling back. That matters more than it sounds. Consumer spending drives about 70% of the U.S. economy, and if it’s losing steam, it strengthens the case for the Fed to cut interest rates sooner rather than later. Some of the slowdown may be tied to renewed uncertainty around Trump’s tariffs. But for Bitcoin, the takeaway is simple: weaker sales = higher chance of rate cuts = potential BTC boost. On the flip side, if retail sales come in stronger than expected, the dollar could gain and Bitcoin might take a hit short term. Jobless Claims Rise, and That’s a Crypto Signal Too Also on the calendar: initial jobless claims, moved to Wednesday due to the Juneteenth holiday. Economists expect a rise to 250,000, up from 248,000 last week – already the highest since October. It may seem like a small shift, but for markets, it’s a big signal. A rising number of people filing for unemployment shows that the labor market is starting to crack and that puts pressure on the Fed to pivot. As one analyst wrote, “The labor market is CRACKING… Weakness = Fed pivot = crypto moon.” That sentiment is picking up across the board. All Eyes on the Fed Rate Decision The big one is Wednesday’s FOMC meeting. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, there’s a 96.7% chance the Fed will keep rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. No surprises expected, but if one does come, it could move markets fast. The other wildcard? Trump. He’s been vocal about pushing the Fed to act faster. After last week’s CPI data, he posted : “Fed should lower one full point. Would pay much less interest on debt coming due. So important.” The market still expects cuts to start in September. But if the Fed blinks early, Bitcoin could rally hard. Lower rates make non-yielding assets like crypto more attractive. Bitcoin Already on the Move Bitcoin is already showing some signs of action. It’s up nearly 1% in the past few hours, trading at $106,576 at the time of writing. It’s a subtle move, but traders know what’s coming. If this week’s economic data confirms a slowdown, and the Fed hints at a shift, we could be looking at a strong move from BTC. In short: the macro signals are lining up. And in crypto, that’s when the big moves tend to happen.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/3-u-s-economic-data-reports-that-could-impact-bitcoin-price-this-week/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-16T10:20:56,"Urgent Warning: VanEck Advises Bitcoin Treasury Companies to Protect Against Shareholder Dilution","BitcoinWorld Urgent Warning: VanEck Advises Bitcoin Treasury Companies to Protect Against Shareholder Dilution In the dynamic world where traditional corporate finance meets the cutting edge of digital assets, a critical piece of advice has emerged for Bitcoin treasury companies . These firms, holding significant amounts of BTC on their balance sheets, face unique challenges as their stock performance intertwines with the volatile price of Bitcoin. Understanding the potential pitfalls and implementing smart strategies is paramount for safeguarding value. Why Bitcoin Treasury Companies Face Unique Challenges Companies that have added Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries have done so for various reasons, including a hedge against inflation, a store of value, or simply belief in the asset’s future potential. However, this also ties their stock valuation closely to Bitcoin’s price movements. While many such companies have traded at a premium to their Net Asset Value (NAV) – essentially, the value of their underlying assets per share – this isn’t a guarantee. The market’s perception, operational performance, and overall crypto sentiment can cause this premium to shrink, or even turn into a discount. Matthew Sigel, Head of Digital Assets Research at VanEck , a prominent investment management firm, recently highlighted a developing situation on X (formerly Twitter). He pointed out that while no public company holding substantial Bitcoin has consistently traded below its NAV, at least one is now seeing its stock price approach that critical level. This signals a potential inflection point where financial strategies become crucial. Understanding Net Asset Value (NAV) in this Context For a company whose primary asset is Bitcoin, the Net Asset Value per share is roughly calculated by taking the total market value of their Bitcoin holdings plus other assets, subtracting liabilities, and dividing by the number of outstanding shares. When a company’s stock trades significantly above its NAV, investors are essentially paying a premium for exposure to Bitcoin through that company, often due to management expertise, operational business, or market sentiment. However, when the stock price gets close to or dips below the NAV, it suggests the market values the company less than the sum of its parts, specifically its Bitcoin holdings. This situation presents risks, particularly when the company needs to raise capital. The Risk of Shareholder Dilution Through ATM Offerings One common method for public companies to raise funds is through At-The-Market (ATM) offerings. This allows a company to sell new shares into the open market gradually at prevailing prices. For Bitcoin treasury companies, ATM offerings have sometimes been used to raise capital specifically to buy more Bitcoin, aiming to increase their BTC holdings and potentially boost future value. However, Mr. Sigel’s warning centers on the danger of executing ATM offerings when the stock price is trading too close to or below NAV. Issuing new shares at such a price means that existing shareholders’ ownership stake is diluted at a value that doesn’t fully reflect the underlying asset value. In essence, you’re selling a dollar’s worth of assets (via the share price) for less than a dollar. This shareholder dilution can erode the value held by existing investors, counteracting the potential benefits of acquiring more Bitcoin, especially if the new capital isn’t deployed effectively or if the discount to NAV persists or worsens. VanEck’s Actionable Advice: Strategies to Prevent Dilution To navigate this tricky situation and protect shareholder interests, VanEck offers several concrete recommendations for Bitcoin treasury companies : Halt ATM Sales Near NAV: A primary piece of advice is to stop issuing new shares through ATM offerings if the stock price trades consistently below a certain threshold relative to NAV. Sigel suggested a benchmark, such as trading below 0.95 times NAV for 10 consecutive days, as a trigger to pause ATM sales. This prevents selling shares at a significant discount to the underlying asset value. Implement Share Buybacks Strategically: When Bitcoin’s price rises but the company’s stock underperforms (potentially widening a discount or failing to keep pace with NAV), companies should consider using available capital for share buybacks. Buying back shares when they are trading at a discount to NAV is accretive to the remaining shareholders’ value. It reduces the number of outstanding shares, meaning each remaining share represents a larger portion of the company’s assets, including its valuable Bitcoin holdings. Explore Strategic Options for Lingering Discounts: If a company’s stock consistently trades at a significant discount to its NAV over a prolonged period, more drastic measures might be necessary. Sigel suggests exploring strategic options like mergers or spinoffs. A merger with another entity might unlock value or provide operational synergies. A spinoff could potentially separate the Bitcoin treasury part from an operating business, allowing the market to value each component more appropriately. These options aim to resolve persistent undervaluation and maximize shareholder value. Why This Matters for Investors For investors holding stock in companies with significant Bitcoin treasuries, understanding the relationship between the stock price and NAV is crucial. A widening discount could signal undervaluation, but also potential issues with management strategy or market perception. Conversely, smart financial management, like strategic buybacks when the stock is undervalued relative to NAV, can be a positive sign. VanEck’s guidance underscores the importance of financial prudence even for companies bullish on digital assets. While accumulating Bitcoin is a core strategy for these firms, how they manage their capital structure and interact with the equity markets directly impacts shareholder returns, independent of Bitcoin’s price performance. Conclusion: Protecting Value in the Intersection of Crypto and Equity The advice from VanEck’s Matthew Sigel serves as a timely reminder for Bitcoin treasury companies . As stock prices fluctuate and potentially approach net asset value , the risk of shareholder dilution through methods like ATM offerings becomes more pronounced. By implementing disciplined financial strategies – knowing when to halt share sales, utilizing buybacks effectively, and being open to strategic changes if discounts persist – these companies can better protect and enhance value for their shareholders in the evolving landscape where corporate balance sheets meet digital assets. To learn more about the latest Bitcoin treasury trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin institutional adoption.

Following the rise, Cardano ( ADA ) is now one of the most actively staked blockchain networks, according to a June 16 update on X by Cardano trading platform TapTools. Staking addresses are wallets that have locked up ADA to earn rewards and contribute to network security. A consistent rise often indicates longer-term user engagement. JUST IN: Cardano $ADA has surpassed 1.3 million staking addresses, highlighting its status as one of the world’s most actively staked blockchain networks. pic.twitter.com/HDUnJ8mmRH — TapTools (@TapTools) June 16, 2025 This rise follows Bitstamp’s May 28 decision to allow UK customers to stake ADA on its platform, making it easier for more people to join the process. Cardano’s developers have also been working on changes behind the scenes. To create a more adaptable and reliable system, on June 6, they unveiled plans to improve the network’s node structure. As part of the planned upgrades, the developers are looking at new reward models to support smaller stake pool operators and encourage broader participation .

Over the past week, it has moved between $0.6184 and $0.7263. Trading volume has risen to over $419 million in the last 24 hours, up 30.6% in the last day. On the derivatives side, Coinglass data show that volume decreased slightly to $870.21 million, but open interest increased 3.28% to $778.49 million. This combination indicates that traders are increasing their positions while awaiting the next move in the price. Looking at the daily chart, Cardano is starting to show signs of recovery after finding support near $0.61. It’s now trading just below its 20-day moving average, which sits around $0.675. This line has acted as a resistance level over the past few weeks. A clean break above it could open the way for a retest of the recent high near $0.73. Cardano price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The Bollinger Bands are starting to tighten slightly, which often comes before a larger price move. Currently, the price is sitting in the lower half of the band, suggesting some upward room if momentum picks up. The upper band is near $0.74, which lines up with last week’s top. With the relative strength index at 42, ADA has not yet entered overbought territory and could rise even higher if buyers return. As the RSI previously fell below 40, the recent rebound may indicate a short-term change in momentum. The price may revert to the $0.62–$0.61 range if it is rejected in the $0.675–$0.70 range. A break below that would be more bearish and could open the door to a deeper pullback. If ADA breaks out above the current resistance levels, there may be short-term upside potential, but for now, the trend is neutral.

2025-06-16T10:19:54,"Hyperliquid’s HYPE token breaks all-time high, eyes more gains ahead","HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid, hit a new all-time high of $44.69 on June 16 and appears poised for further gains after breaking out of multiple bullish technical setups. According to data from crypto.news, this latest high surpassed its previous record of $43.96 set just last week. Hyperliquid’s ( HYPE ) market capitalization rose to over $14.8 million, while daily trading volume climbed 25% compared to the previous day, reflecting continued interest and momentum among traders. The rally has been supported by significant growth in Hyperliquid’s Layer-1 ecosystem. Data from DeFi Llama shows that the total value locked on Hyperliquid has surged to $2.53 billion, marking an increase of over 80% in the past 30 days. Hyperliquid’s total stablecoin supply on its Layer-1 chain has also increased to $3.73 billion, up from $2 billion in January 2025. This growth underscores increased transactional activity and liquidity across its ecosystem, with stablecoins often serving as the backbone for decentralized trading and lending applications. You might also like: Japan’s Metaplanet reaches its 2025 target of 10K Bitcoin after latest 1,112 BTC purchase Hyperliquid’s perpetual exchange has also continued to assert dominance within the derivatives space. Over the past 30 days, it has processed over $246.8 billion in trading volume, nearly triple the combined volume of the other top-ten decentralized perpetual platforms. The exchange’s competitive edge is largely attributed to its high leverage offerings, allowing users to access up to 40x leverage, a feature that has attracted aggressive short-term traders. Further on-chain data shows whales have been increasingly accumulating HYPE tokens over the past few weeks. Hype price analysis From a technical standpoint, HYPE has confirmed multiple bullish breakout patterns on the 1-day USDT chart. On June 9, the token broke out of a bullish pennant formation, a continuation pattern that typically signals the resumption of an uptrend. HYPE 1-day price chart — June 16 | Source: crypto.news Following this, HYPE also rallied above a bull flag pattern that had developed over the past week, further validating bullish sentiment. Moreover, the token has breached a critical resistance zone at $35.13, which had previously marked the upper boundary of a long-term cup-and-handle pattern that began forming in December 2024. The breakout above this level represents a significant technical milestone, often viewed as a signal for sustained upward movement. Momentum indicators also support the bullish case with both the MACD and RSI lines trending higher on the 4-hour chart, suggesting strengthening upward momentum and increased buying pressure. HYPE MACD and RSI chart — June 16 | Source: crypto.news However, there are some risks. Notably, whales and long-term holders could be looking to lock in some gains, which is typical when an asset hits an all-time high. For instance, Onchain Lens reported that a whale who held a long position in HYPE is currently sitting on profits of over $13.7 million. Meanwhile, Coinglass data shows that Hyperliquid whales are tilting slightly bearish, with 51.09% of total positions and over 50.8% of margin currently allocated to shorts. This positioning may be indicative of short-term caution, as whales often hedge or reduce long exposure at key resistance levels to manage downside risk. While not necessarily a sign of a broader bearish reversal, it could contribute to short-term volatility. Therefore, if bullish momentum persists, the token could next target the psychological resistance level of $50, up 12.8% from the current price level. On the contrary, if whale activity intensifies on the sell side or if broader market sentiment weakens, a drop below the $35 support level would invalidate the current bullish outlook and potentially signal the start of a deeper correction.

2025-06-16T10:19:02,"Pakistan Engages Michael Saylor in Bold Push Toward Bitcoin-Backed Economy","Pakistan has taken a significant leap toward integrating digital assets into its economic roadmap by hosting bitcoin BTC advocate Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (MSTR). In a high-profile meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib, discussions centered around positioning bitcoin as a sovereign-grade asset to bolster Pakistan’s monetary resilience and digital future. Saylor, known for transforming Strategy into the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, praised Pakistan’s openness to innovation. The company’s bitcoin holdings now total approximately 582,000 BTC, valued at over $62 billion, a strategy that has lifted its market cap from $1.2 billion to $105 billion since 2020. Minister Aurangzeb emphasized Pakistan’s ambition to become a leader in digital asset adoption across the Global South, highlighting its commitment to regulation, inclusion and innovation. Bilal Bin Saqib drew attention to Saylor’s remarkable trajectory, stating that Pakistan possesses the talent and determination to replicate such transformative success on a national scale. Saylor applauded Pakistan’s proactive approach, calling Bitcoin the “strongest asset for long-term national resilience.” He added that countries like Pakistan have a unique chance to leap ahead in the financial landscape by embracing digital assets early. This meeting marks a pivotal step in Pakistan’s efforts to build a comprehensive digital assets framework and attract global institutional attention in the emerging Web3 economy.

2025-06-16T10:18:45,"Metaplanet Hits 10,000 BTC Mark Following $210M Bond-Backed Acquisition","Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has announced the acquisition of an additional 1,112 BTC, bringing its total holdings to 10,000 BTC as part of its aggressive Bitcoin Treasury Operations strategy. The latest purchase was executed for approximately ¥16.883 billion or $117 million. Metaplanet’s 10,000 BTC Milestone This development closely follows the issuance of Metaplanet’s 18th Series of Ordinary Bonds, through which it raised $210 million from EVO FUND. The bonds, bearing zero interest and redeemable at face value by December 12, 2025, were explicitly designated for Bitcoin purchases. According to the company’s press release , the 10,000 BTC milestone was achieved through a series of strategic acquisitions funded by both equity and debt instruments, including multiple tranches of stock acquisition rights and a steady stream of zero-coupon bond issuances. This move also marks the completion of the firm’s “210 Million Plan,” under which EVO FUND was granted 210 million 0%-discount rights. Over the past year, Metaplanet’s BTC Yield, which happens to be an important performance indicator tracking BTC per fully diluted share, has soared. This reflected both increased Bitcoin holdings and shareholder accretion despite dilution. As of June 16, the BTC Yield stood at 87.2% quarter-to-date. The company recorded 3,526 BTC in BTC Gain for Q2 2025, translating to a ¥53.412 billion increase in Bitcoin value denominated in yen. With its BTC holdings now totaling 10,000, Metaplanet has overtaken Coinbase, which holds 9,267 BTC, based on figures reported by Bitbo. The scale and pace of its recent purchases position Metaplanet as one of Asia’s most prominent corporate holders of Bitcoin. The firm now aims to amass a total of 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Having already accumulated 10,000 BTC, it must secure the remaining 200,000 BTC within the upcoming 18 months. Companies Betting Big on BTC A growing number of public companies are integrating digital assets into their treasuries, with 117 firms now collectively holding over 800,000 BTC. The latest to join this trend is Mercurity Fintech Holding (MFH), which announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a dedicated BTC treasury reserve. The New York-based fintech firm plans to revamp its treasury operations by leveraging tokenized finance, with Bitcoin at the core of its strategy. MFH said that it will store its BTC using institutional-grade blockchain custody infrastructure and incorporate staking services and tokenized treasury tools to enhance yield and capital efficiency. In a similar move, Oslo-based crypto brokerage K33 has also begun holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet, after a $6.22 million raise through interest-free loans and new equity and warrant issuances.

2025-06-16T10:18:25,"H100 ramps up Bitcoin accumulation strategy with $15.8M convertible loan from Adam Back","Swedish health tech giant H100 Group has secured an initial $15.82 million convertible loan from Adam Back to accelerate its BTC accumulation strategy, with plans for additional tranches. On June 16, Swedish-listed H100 Group announced that it had signed a new investment agreement with Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, securing an initial convertible loan guarantee of 150 million SEK (approximately $15.82 million). The funds raised from this convertible loan will be used to purchase Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of H100 Group’s long-term Bitcoin asset allocation strategy. This comes on the heels of an earlier capital raise announced in late May, when H100 Group secured 21 million SEK (approximately $2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans. The funding round was also led by Adam Back, who invested $1.4 million, with additional contributions totaling $800,000 from investment firms including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners. H100’s latest raise reflects a broader trend among European firms turning to structured financing to fund Bitcoin accumulation. Earlier this month, The Blockchain Group, listed on Euronext Growth Paris, received shareholder approval to raise over €10 billion for Bitcoin purchases via a mix of bonds and equity issuances.

Notably, the U.K.-listed technology and digital services provider, The Smarter Web Company, recently invested approximately £2 million (around $2.7 million) in Bitcoin, adding 24.54 BTC to its crypto treasury and bringing its total holdings to 83.24 BTC. In April, U.K.-listed Abraxas Capital also made headlines with an acquisition of nearly 3,000 BTC, representing an investment of roughly $250 million. Meanwhile, analysts remain divided on the rise of corporate Bitcoin treasuries. While some see it as a forward-thinking financial strategy, others caution against the significant risks involved. Journalist Sean Williams recently criticized many of these firms as unprofitable entities relying on Bitcoin as a speculative lifeline, describing the trend as a “dumpster fire in the making.” You might also like: The Blockchain Group gets shareholder backing to raise over €10B for Bitcoin expansion",crypto_news,https://crypto.news/h100-ramps-up-bitcoin-accumulation-strategy-with-15-8m-convertible-loan-from-adam-back/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","News|Bitcoin|Cryptocurrency|DeFi",cryptocompare
