2025-06-12T07:53:43,"Why “there’s not going to be enough Bitcoin” according to Bitwise CEO","The parabolic run of Bitcoin in recent years has ignited debates about demand, supply, and where the broader crypto market is headed next. While many investors are focused on higher price milestones beyond $110K, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes a major real shift is on the horizon. According to Horsley, once Bitcoin ( BTC ) crosses the $130,000 to $150,000 price levels, long-time holders will likely stop selling. He emphasized that many of these individuals and institutions accumulated Bitcoin years ago at much lower prices, and the recent price upticks have translated into profit-taking for the majority. I think once Bitcoin breaks through eg $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin. Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices, are selling some. That said, once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) June 10, 2025 But in his view, that trend may soon change. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more confident holders become and Horsely believes that rather than selling, many will likely turn to alternative liquidity options that don’t require them to part with their assets. This shift could remove even more supply from circulation and put upward pressure on prices. You might also like: Will Bitcoin continue rising? Analyst eyes breakout as demand outpaces supply Not everyone agrees with Horsley’s view. Market participants argue that the inherent ‘buy-and-sell’ nature will trigger profit-seeking behavior as prices rise, resulting in more sell-offs. However, current market data supports Horsley’s thesis. Bitcoin supply dries up Recent on-chain analytics has revealed a tightening BTC supply, lower short-term selling pressure, and growing signs that investors are becoming more confident in holding their Bitcoin for the long term. According to a June 10 CryptoQuant report , the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges continues to fall. Over the past year alone, more than 550,000 BTC has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges. The numbers build on previous findings that exchange balances have dropped to their lowest levels in over eight years, an indicator that more investors are opting to store their assets privately rather than sell them. Also fueling the supply crunch is the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin. From ETFs to national reserves, global financial heavyweights are building long-term positions. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs launched in January now hold around 6% of the total BTC supply, and more countries are exploring creating their various dedicated Bitcoin reserves. Unlike retail traders, these institutional investors do not chase short-term gains, supporting the idea that more Bitcoin may be taken out of circulation and held for the long haul.

2025-06-12T07:52:33,"Japan eyes G7 support to thwart North Korea’s crypto-funded weapons programme","Japan will reportedly urge G7 nations to take coordinated action against North Korea’s cryptocurrency thefts at the upcoming summit in Canada. According to local media , Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to raise the issue during the G7 meetings scheduled from June 15 to 17, citing the growing threat of cyber-enabled financial crime linked to North Korea. The proposal will mark the first time the G7 formally considers a collective response to crypto theft tied to state-sponsored actors. The Group of Seven comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union. Ishiba is expected to call for enhanced cooperation among G7 members to tighten oversight of digital asset markets and curb illicit flows that finance weapons development . Officials believe that cutting off these funding channels is crucial to strengthening non-proliferation efforts and regional security. One of the catalysts behind Japan’s push is the $307 million hack of DMM Bitcoin , one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges. Japanese police and the FBI linked the May 2023 incident to a North Korean hacking group known as TraderTraitor, also referred to as Jade Sleet and UNC4899.

The malware gave the attackers access to Ginco’s internal systems, which they later exploited to manipulate a transaction request at DMM Bitcoin, leading to the theft. Over 4,500 BTC, valued at $307 million at the time, was stolen, prompting the exchange to shut down its operations. Authorities traced the stolen funds to wallets controlled by the TraderTraitor group, a collective previously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury for engaging in cyberattacks to fund North Korea’s weapons programme. Beyond Japan, North Korean-linked hackers have been tied to some of the largest crypto-related heists in recent years, including attacks on crypto exchange Bybit, the Ronin Bridge, Harmony, and various other DeFi platforms. In response, authorities across the globe have stepped up enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a forfeiture action to seize over $7.7 million in crypto assets tied to North Korean IT workers embedded in blockchain firms as part of the DPRK RevGen initiative launched in 2024 to disrupt illicit revenue networks. Last year, the U.S. and South Korea signed a bilateral agreement to develop joint technologies to combat cryptocurrency theft by enhancing detection and response capabilities against DPRK-linked cyber actors.

2025-06-12T07:51:20,"Binance prepares to welcome Syrian traders after U.S. lifts sanctions","Binance declared that it is prepared to open its platform to Syrian residents interested in trading cryptocurrency. The shift follows the recent suspension of U.S. sanctions on Syria. According to a recent notice issued by the crypto exchange, Syria is no longer classified under the “prohibited country” category. This means that Syrian residents can now register themselves on the platform and access crypto-related services through the crypto exchange . The services now available to Syrian traders include spot and futures trading, staking and earn products, Binance Pay for cross-border payments, and educational content in Arabic. “This means we can now onboard and support Syrian residents, granting full access to products and services,” wrote the exchange in its notice. In May 2025, President Trump announced that the U.S. would lift its sanctions on Syria following a change in leadership. The current government, led by Syria’s new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, successfully overthrew the leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Al-Assad ruled over Syria from 1971 to 2024. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” said Trump according to an Al-Jazeera report .

The shift indicates a major opportunity for Binance to reach the untapped Syrian markets, considering Syria is ranked among the top 10 countries globally for most crypto-related search activity since 2021. The spike in crypto interest in Syria may be due to the economic instability and high inflation in the region which led to Syrian residents relying on informal financial systems to combat the unreliable local currency. “We’re proud to offer real solutions that support Syria’s economic recovery and help grow its digital economy, in line with international efforts and applicable regulations,” wrote the exchange. In 1979, due to the radical al-Assad regime at the time, the U.S. and many other countries classified the country as “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, which led to a ban on arms and financial restrictions, including foreign assistance. This meant that foreign entities like crypto exchanges could not officially operate in the region or facilitate crypto-related services for its residents. At the beginning of this year, the Syrian government declared that it plans to explore Bitcoin ( BTC ) legalization as well as other cryptocurrencies. The nation aimed to use crypto as a way to rebuild its post-war economy.

2025-06-12T07:50:09,"GameStop Unveils Strategic $1.75B Convertible Notes Plan After Bitcoin Purchase","BitcoinWorld GameStop Unveils Strategic $1.75B Convertible Notes Plan After Bitcoin Purchase In a move that has once again captured the attention of both traditional finance circles and the cryptocurrency community, GameStop (GME) has announced a significant financial maneuver. Following closely on the heels of its notable Bitcoin purchase, the company is now planning a substantial capital raise through a convertible notes offering. This latest development adds another fascinating layer to GameStop’s evolving strategy, blending traditional corporate finance with a foray into digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for GameStop, its investors, and the broader landscape of crypto investment . Understanding GameStop’s Strategic Convertible Notes Offering According to information circulating, including a report from Solid Intel on X, GameStop is reportedly planning a private offering of senior convertible notes aimed at raising a significant $1.75 billion. But what exactly are convertible notes, and why would a company like GameStop choose this route? Convertible notes are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a predetermined number of shares of the issuing company’s common stock at a later date, usually at the option of the noteholder or under specific conditions. Think of them as a hybrid of debt and equity. Here are a few key aspects of convertible notes: Lower Interest Rates: Because they offer the potential for equity upside, convertible notes typically carry lower interest rates compared to traditional corporate bonds. This reduces the company’s ongoing cash interest payments. Delayed Dilution: Unlike issuing common stock directly, convertible notes only result in stock dilution if and when they are converted. This delays the impact on the company’s earnings per share. Flexibility: They can be structured in various ways, offering flexibility in terms of conversion price, maturity date, and conversion triggers. For GameStop , a company that has experienced significant volatility in its GME stock price, this type of financing could be appealing. It allows them to raise a large amount of capital without immediately diluting existing shareholders, while potentially benefiting from lower borrowing costs. The Timing: GameStop’s Bitcoin Purchase Precedes Capital Raise What makes this offering particularly intriguing is its timing. The news of the planned $1.75 billion convertible notes offering comes shortly after GameStop revealed its significant investment in Bitcoin. Between May and early June, the company purchased 4,710 BTC. At current market prices, this represents a substantial holding, worth tens of millions of dollars. This raises an important question: Is there a direct link between the Bitcoin purchase and the capital raise? While the official announcement regarding the use of proceeds from the notes offering hasn’t specified funding further crypto buys, the sequence of events is noteworthy. Companies typically raise capital for general corporate purposes, working capital, potential acquisitions, or investments. GameStop’s recent actions suggest a potential shift or expansion in its strategic priorities, which now evidently includes holding digital assets. Could the Bitcoin purchase be an initial step in a broader digital asset strategy that requires significant capital? Or is the capital raise simply a timely move to strengthen the balance sheet and fund other initiatives, with the Bitcoin holding being a separate treasury management decision? Without explicit details from GameStop, much remains open to interpretation. Implications for GME Stock and Future Strategy How might this convertible notes offering impact GME stock ? There are a few potential angles to consider: Positive: Capital Infusion: Raising $1.75 billion provides GameStop with a substantial war chest. This capital could be used to fund transformation efforts, invest in e-commerce capabilities, explore new business ventures (perhaps related to gaming or digital assets), or simply provide financial stability. This influx of cash is generally seen as positive for a company’s operational capacity. Negative: Potential Dilution: The primary concern with convertible notes is the potential for future stock dilution. If the notes are converted into shares, it increases the total number of outstanding shares, which can put downward pressure on the stock price and dilute the value of existing shares. The conversion price relative to the current stock price will be a critical factor. Investor Sentiment: The market’s reaction will depend on how investors perceive the company’s use of funds and the terms of the offering. If the capital is seen as fueling a credible, growth-oriented strategy, it could be positive. If the terms are unfavorable or the use of funds is unclear, it could lead to skepticism. This capital raise, combined with the Bitcoin purchase , suggests GameStop under CEO Ryan Cohen is continuing to explore various avenues beyond its traditional retail model. The strategic direction appears to involve strengthening its financial position while potentially experimenting with new asset classes or business models. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? GameStop’s decision to hold Bitcoin and potentially use a large capital raise in proximity to this move sends a signal to the market regarding corporate adoption of digital assets. While not on the scale of MicroStrategy, GameStop is a well-known, albeit unconventional, public company making a direct crypto investment . Here’s what this could signify for the broader crypto investment landscape: Increasing Legitimacy: More public companies holding Bitcoin in their treasury can lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a store of value or a treasury asset. Potential Trendsetter: While GameStop’s situation is unique, its move might encourage other companies, particularly in the tech or gaming sectors, to consider similar treasury strategies. Market Interest: It brings cryptocurrency into the conversation for traditional stock investors who follow GameStop, potentially piquing their interest in digital assets. However, it’s also important to note that GameStop’s financial strategy is complex and influenced by its unique market position. Its crypto investment should be viewed within the context of its overall business transformation efforts and capital structure decisions. Challenges and Opportunities in GameStop’s Bold Move GameStop’s strategy, while potentially transformative, is not without its challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Execution Risk: Successfully deploying $1.75 billion into initiatives that generate returns and transform the business is a significant undertaking. Market Volatility: Both GME stock and Bitcoin are known for high volatility, adding layers of risk to the company’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Dilution Management: Managing the potential future dilution from the convertible notes requires careful financial planning and communication with shareholders. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for corporate crypto holdings and related activities is still evolving. Opportunities: Financial Flexibility: The capital raise provides significant flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives without being constrained by cash flow. Potential Asset Appreciation: The Bitcoin holding offers potential upside if the value of BTC increases. Strategic Pivots: The capital allows GameStop to make substantial investments in new business areas that could redefine the company. Investor Engagement: The combination of meme stock status, strategic capital raise, and crypto exposure keeps GameStop highly relevant and engaging for a certain segment of the investor base. The coming months will be crucial in observing how GameStop utilizes this significant capital and whether its foray into crypto investment becomes a more central part of its strategy or remains a treasury diversification tactic. Conclusion: A Strategic Blend of Tradition and Innovation GameStop’s planned $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, hot on the heels of its Bitcoin purchase , represents a fascinating intersection of traditional corporate finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This move provides the company with substantial capital, offering opportunities for strategic investment and business transformation, while also introducing the potential for future dilution of GME stock . The inclusion of a significant crypto investment adds a layer of modern treasury management to the mix, potentially signaling a broader corporate trend. As GameStop navigates this complex financial landscape, all eyes will be on how effectively it deploys these resources to reshape its future.

2025-06-12T07:40:12,"Solana ETF: Accelerating Potential for SEC Approval","BitcoinWorld Solana ETF: Accelerating Potential for SEC Approval Exciting news is circulating in the crypto world regarding the potential for a Solana ETF in the United States. A recent report from Bloomberg suggests that the likelihood of a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund product receiving approval is growing stronger. This development is significant for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market, indicating a potential expansion of regulated investment avenues beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What’s Happening with the SEC Solana ETF Approval Process? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a crucial role in approving or denying financial products like ETFs. According to Bloomberg, the SEC has taken a notable step by engaging directly with asset management firms that have filed for a Solana ETF. At least three companies have reportedly received requests from the SEC to amend their S-1 filings. These filings are the initial registration documents required for securities offerings. The SEC’s requests focus on specific details within these applications, particularly concerning: Redemption Mechanisms: How investors will be able to redeem their ETF shares (e.g., for cash or potentially in-kind SOL). Solana Staking Rewards: Whether and how any rewards generated from staking the underlying SOL held by the fund will be handled and paid out to investors. Historically, the SEC’s engagement with applicants, asking for detailed amendments rather than issuing outright rejections, has been interpreted as a positive sign. It suggests the regulator is actively reviewing the applications and working through potential structural and operational considerations necessary for approval. Why Are These SEC Requests Seen as a Positive Signal for a Solana ETF ? Market analysts and commentators view the SEC’s requests for S-1 amendments as a significant step forward. It indicates that the SEC is moving beyond initial review and is delving into the practicalities of how a Solana ETF would operate under U.S. regulations. This level of engagement is a stark contrast to periods where the regulator seemed hesitant or unwilling to discuss the specifics of crypto-related investment products. Noelle Acheson, a respected voice in the crypto space and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, has asserted that the fact the SEC is requesting amendments suggests a potential approval timeline that could be relatively short – perhaps within a few days or at most a few weeks. This sentiment echoes the optimism seen during the final stages of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval process. The focus on redemption mechanisms is standard for any ETF, but the inquiry into staking rewards is particularly noteworthy for a Proof-of-Stake asset like Solana. It shows the SEC is grappling with the unique features of these cryptocurrencies and how they fit within the traditional financial framework of an ETF. Addressing the Nuances of Solana Staking in an ETF Structure Solana operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows SOL holders to ‘stake’ their tokens to support network operations and earn rewards. For a Solana ETF holding actual SOL tokens, the question of how to handle these potential staking rewards is critical. There are several potential approaches fund issuers might propose or the SEC might require: Reinvestment: Staking rewards could be automatically reinvested back into the fund, increasing the net asset value (NAV) over time. Cash Distribution: Rewards could be periodically distributed to ETF shareholders as cash income. Fund Manager Decision: The fund’s structure might allow the manager discretion on how to handle rewards, within regulatory guidelines. The SEC’s focus on this aspect highlights the complexity of translating native crypto economics into a traditional ETF wrapper. Clarifying how staking rewards will be managed is essential for investor understanding and regulatory compliance. The Broader Picture: Crypto ETF Landscape and Institutional Interest The potential approval of a Solana ETF follows the landmark approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year and the recent approvals of Ethereum spot ETFs (though trading has not yet begun for Ethereum). This progression suggests a growing regulatory comfort level with certain cryptocurrencies as underlying assets for regulated investment products. A Solana ETF would provide investors with another regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to the SOL token without directly buying, storing, or securing the cryptocurrency themselves. This accessibility is particularly appealing to traditional financial advisors and institutional investors who operate within strict compliance frameworks. The entry of multiple asset management giants preparing applications underscores the significant market demand they perceive for a SOL investment product. Companies like Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck, who were also pioneers in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF races, are among those positioning themselves for a potential SOL ETF launch. Who’s Preparing for a SOL ETF Launch and What’s the Timeline? Reports indicate that at least seven asset management companies are actively working on preparing or have already filed applications for a spot SOL ETF . This includes major players in the crypto asset management space such as: Grayscale Bitwise VanEck And others… The competition among these firms highlights the anticipated demand and the race to be among the first to market if approval is granted. Regarding a timeline, while Noelle Acheson suggested days or weeks based on the S-1 amendments, previous reporting by Bitcoin World indicated that the SEC could potentially approve such a product within three to five weeks. These timelines are estimates and depend heavily on the SEC’s review process and any further questions or requirements they may have for the applicants. Benefits of a Potential Solana ETF Increased Accessibility: Allows traditional investors to gain exposure via brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: Offers a regulated investment vehicle for SOL. Enhanced Liquidity: May bring more capital into the Solana ecosystem. Institutional Adoption: Facilitates investment from large funds and institutions. Potential Staking Yield: Depending on the structure, investors might benefit from staking rewards. Challenges and Considerations Regulatory Hurdles Remain: While positive, approval is not guaranteed and depends on addressing SEC concerns. Staking Complexity: Handling staking rewards within an ETF framework is novel and requires clear rules. Market Volatility: The price of SOL, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. Custody and Security: Ensuring secure custody of the underlying SOL tokens is paramount. Actionable Insights for Readers If you are interested in the potential of a Solana ETF, here are a few things to consider: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring news from the SEC, asset managers, and financial news outlets like Bloomberg. Understand the Risks: An ETF tracks the price of the underlying asset, which in this case is a volatile cryptocurrency. Research Specific ETFs: If approved, compare the structures, fees, and how staking rewards (if any) are handled by different issuers. Consult a Financial Advisor: Determine if a Solana ETF fits your investment goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Optimism Builds for a Solana Investment Future The news that the SEC is actively engaging with Solana ETF applicants and requesting detailed amendments to S-1 filings is a genuinely positive development. While not a guarantee of approval, it signals that the regulatory path is being explored and potentially cleared. The focus on crucial aspects like redemptions and staking rewards shows the SEC is doing its due diligence. With multiple asset managers vying to launch a product and analysts suggesting a potentially rapid timeline once these details are ironed out, optimism for a U.S. Solana ETF is undeniably accelerating. This could mark another significant step in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, offering investors regulated access to the dynamic Solana ecosystem.

Liquidations Surge as Traders Get Caught Off Guard? As price action turned against the bulls, liquidations began to mount. In the past 24 hours, 112,143 traders were liquidated, amounting to a total of $327.94 million wiped out across exchanges. The single-largest liquidation occurred on Binance’s BTCUSD perpetual pair, totaling $2.15 million.

2025-06-12T07:20:17,"Semler Scientific: Why Tom Lee Sees Unexpected Opportunity in This Bitcoin Treasury Stock’s Deep NAV Discount","BitcoinWorld Semler Scientific: Why Tom Lee Sees Unexpected Opportunity in This Bitcoin Treasury Stock’s Deep NAV Discount In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments, sometimes the most intriguing opportunities appear in unexpected places. Case in point: Semler Scientific (SMLR) . This medical technology firm recently made headlines by pivoting towards a Bitcoin treasury stock strategy, accumulating a significant amount of the digital asset on its balance sheet. However, its journey hasn’t been without turbulence, presenting a fascinating puzzle for investors. Semler Scientific’s Bold Pivot: Becoming a Bitcoin Treasury Stock Traditionally known for providing innovative products and services to healthcare providers, Semler Scientific took a decisive step into the world of digital assets. Recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, the company began converting its cash reserves into BTC. This strategic shift transformed Semler Scientific from a pure medical tech play into something hybrid – a medical technology company with a substantial Bitcoin treasury. This move places it alongside a growing, albeit still small, group of publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, effectively making it a Bitcoin treasury stock . This strategy offers investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin through traditional stock markets. Instead of buying BTC directly or through complex instruments, investors can purchase shares of companies like Semler, whose value is increasingly tied to their Bitcoin holdings. It’s a strategy that appeals to some institutional investors and those who prefer the regulatory familiarity of equity markets. Unpacking the Current Situation: The Significant BTC NAV Discount Despite its significant Bitcoin holdings, Semler Scientific’s stock has faced considerable pressure recently. The company’s share price has experienced a notable decline, leading to a situation where its market capitalization is now significantly lower than the value of its Bitcoin assets alone. This phenomenon is known as trading at a BTC NAV discount . Let’s break down the numbers as reported: Bitcoin Holdings: 4,449 BTC Approximate Value of BTC Holdings: Around $491 million (based on reported figures) Current Market Capitalization (SMLR stock): Around $420 million Discount Ratio: Trading at approximately 0.859x its Bitcoin Net Asset Value (NAV) What does a 0.859x BTC NAV discount mean? It means that for every dollar’s worth of Bitcoin the company holds, the market is valuing the entire company (including its medical tech business) at only about 86 cents. This deep discount highlights a significant divergence between the intrinsic value represented by the Bitcoin on the balance sheet and the market’s current perception of the company’s overall worth. This situation also presents a challenge for Semler’s corporate strategy. When a company’s stock trades below its NAV, issuing new shares to raise capital becomes dilutive. This is because selling shares at a price below the value of the underlying assets per share effectively reduces the NAV per share for existing shareholders. Under these conditions, Semler can no longer issue shares accretively (i.e., in a way that increases the NAV per share), limiting one potential avenue for growth or capital raising. Why Does Tom Lee Remain Bullish on SMLR Stock? In the face of this stock underperformance and the seemingly disadvantageous trading position, one prominent voice remains notably optimistic: Fundstrat’s head of research, Tom Lee . Known for his often bullish stance on Bitcoin and the broader market, Lee has included Semler Scientific in his curated list of investment opportunities, specifically within his “Granny Shot” portfolio. What is the “Granny Shot” portfolio? It’s a concept Lee uses to highlight unconventional or overlooked investment ideas that possess significant potential upside, often involving unique situations or strategies not widely appreciated by the mainstream market. By including SMLR stock in this portfolio, Tom Lee signals his belief that despite the current challenges and the deep BTC NAV discount , there are underlying factors that make Semler an attractive, albeit perhaps non-obvious, investment. Tom Lee’s bullishness likely stems from several potential factors: Deep Value Play: The significant discount to NAV could be seen as a mispricing by the market, offering an opportunity to buy assets (the Bitcoin) at a discount through the stock. Leverage to Bitcoin Price: As a Bitcoin treasury stock , Semler offers leveraged exposure to potential increases in the price of Bitcoin. If BTC’s value rises, the value of Semler’s holdings increases proportionally, which could eventually narrow the discount and boost the stock price. Belief in the Core Business: While the Bitcoin treasury aspect is key, Tom Lee might also see underlying value or future potential in Semler’s core medical technology business, which the market is currently heavily discounting due to the focus on the Bitcoin play. Potential for Corporate Action: A significant NAV discount can sometimes trigger corporate actions aimed at closing the gap, such as share buybacks (if the company has free cash flow from its operations) or strategic adjustments. For Tom Lee , Semler Scientific appears to represent a classic “value trap” turned potential opportunity – a situation where an asset is trading below its perceived intrinsic value, waiting for a catalyst to unlock that value. Challenges and Considerations for Semler Scientific While the deep discount might look appealing on paper, it’s crucial to understand the challenges Semler Scientific faces: Market Perception: Investors may be hesitant about a medical tech company diversifying so heavily into a volatile asset like Bitcoin, leading to uncertainty and a lower valuation multiple compared to either pure tech or pure Bitcoin plays. Operational Cash Flow: The ability to leverage the Bitcoin holdings or close the discount might depend on the profitability and cash flow generation of the core medical tech business. If the core business struggles, it limits financial flexibility. Bitcoin Price Volatility: While a rising BTC price is a tailwind, a falling price exacerbates the situation, potentially widening the discount and further pressuring the stock. Inability to Issue Accretively: As mentioned, trading below NAV makes issuing shares for expansion or acquisitions disadvantageous, hindering a common corporate finance tool. These factors contribute to the discount and represent real hurdles that Semler must navigate. Is SMLR Stock a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap? This is the central question for investors considering Semler Scientific. The deep BTC NAV discount , coupled with Tom Lee ‘s endorsement, presents a compelling case for potential upside. It offers leveraged exposure to Bitcoin in a potentially undervalued package. However, the discount exists for reasons. The market is clearly assigning a lower value to the combination of the medical tech business and the Bitcoin treasury than the sum of their parts. Investors must weigh whether the current challenges are temporary headwinds or structural issues that will persist. Key questions for potential investors: Do you believe in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin? Do you see potential for the discount to narrow over time, either through a rising Bitcoin price, improved performance in the core business, or strategic corporate actions? Are you comfortable with the volatility associated with both a small-cap stock and Bitcoin? Semler Scientific is not a low-risk investment. It’s a speculative play that combines the uncertainties of a niche medical tech business with the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Tom Lee’s bullish view provides a notable perspective, but it’s essential for investors to conduct their own thorough research and understand the risks involved. Conclusion: A Bullish Endorsement Amidst the Discount Semler Scientific’s transformation into a Bitcoin treasury stock has created a unique investment scenario. Trading at a significant BTC NAV discount , the company faces clear challenges, including a recent sharp decline in its SMLR stock price and limitations on issuing shares accretively. Yet, prominent figures like Tom Lee see beyond the current struggles, viewing the deep discount as an potential opportunity within his “Granny Shot” investment framework. Whether Semler can successfully navigate its challenges, leverage its Bitcoin holdings, and ultimately see its market valuation align more closely with its underlying assets remains to be seen. For investors intrigued by the intersection of traditional markets and cryptocurrency, Semler Scientific offers a complex, high-risk, high-reward proposition worth watching closely.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Hougan says that more public companies are buying Bitcoin to hold on their balance sheets as a hedge against the declining strength of the dollar due to money printing and other factors. “We think this is a megatrend that’s going to accelerate into the future. One [reason], of course, is increased worries about the dollar. Corporations globally are sitting on record amounts of cash and what they’ve historically done is park it in short-term US Treasuries or, in fact, in cash accounts. But with the huge money printing and growing deficits, that no longer seems like a valid approach. They need another way to protect their wealth from degradation and they are turning to the best horse in that race, which is Bitcoin.” Hougan predicts that publicly traded companies with Bitcoin treasuries will one day number in the thousands as investors also start to favor companies employing the strategy. “The investing audience has just recognized this is a positive strategy. And so companies are being rewarded for taking this bold step of putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet. We think there will ultimately be thousands of companies that do this. We think we’re in inning one or two of this megatrend period, but you’re seeing it accelerate over time.

The United States leads with 207,189 BTC , followed by China with 194,000 BTC and the United Kingdom with 61,000 BTC . The report highlights that these holdings are not from open market purchases but have mostly come from seizures and enforcement actions . ETFs Take the Lead in Bitcoin Accumulation Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly growing as dominant holders. They now control 1,390,267 BTC , worth about $150 billion . The largest holder is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust , which owns 665,638.1 BTC . Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust follow with 198,685.8 BTC and 185,203.6 BTC , respectively. These numbers reflect rising institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset. Public Companies Double Down on BTC Public companies have become aggressive buyers, collectively holding 763,479 BTC , valued at $82.38 billion . MicroStrategy continues to lead this category with a staggering 582,000 BTC in reserves. Other key players include Marathon Digital Holdings with 49,179 BTC and Riot Platforms with 19,225 BTC . This further signals Bitcoin’s growing role as a strategic asset for corporations seeking to protect against inflation and economic uncertainty. Centralized Exchanges Still Hold a Large Share The report also confirms that centralized exchanges make up a significant portion of the 6.1 million BTC controlled by centralized entities. Current BTC exchange reserves stand at 2.5 million BTC . However, analysts believe much of this Bitcoin belongs to retail users , not the exchanges themselves. Still, the inclusion of exchanges highlights the role of custodial platforms in Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Private Companies Show Distributed Ownership In contrast to public firms, private companies collectively hold 457,870 BTC , valued at around $49.4 billion . The distribution is more spread out in this segment. Block.one holds 140,000 BTC , while Tether Holdings owns 100,521 BTC . Other notable holders include Xapo Bank with 38,931 BTC and Twenty One Capital with 37,229.7 BTC . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Sell-off to Stop After $130K Breakout, Says Bitwise CEO , Bitcoin’s Price Mirrors Institutional Growth The report highlights that institutional Bitcoin holdings have surged 924% over the past decade . During the same period, Bitcoin’s price jumped from under $1,000 to over $100,000 . In just the past year, the price has climbed 60.2% , showing increased stability and mainstream acceptance. This price performance is closely tied to growing institutional interest, which has created a stronger foundation for Bitcoin as an asset class. Conclusion: Bitcoin Matures, but Risks Remain The data reflects a structural transformation in Bitcoin’s ownership landscape. With governments, ETFs, public companies, and exchanges holding a large share of circulating BTC, Bitcoin is now entering a phase of institutional maturity .However, despite this evolution, Bitcoin still remains a risk-on asset , subject to macroeconomic forces and market sentiment. Its volatility may have reduced, but it has not disappeared. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ETFs controlling substantial Bitcoin signals its mainstream acceptance and legitimization. This attracts more institutional capital, potentially leading to increased price stability, enhanced liquidity, and a more robust market infrastructure. Why are public companies increasing their Bitcoin holdings rapidly? Public companies are increasing Bitcoin holdings rapidly to hedge against inflation, diversify treasury reserves, signal support for the crypto industry, and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential for significant appreciation, similar to MicroStrategy’s strategy. How does institutional ownership influence Bitcoin’s price stability and volatility? Institutional ownership, particularly from long-term holders like ETFs, tends to increase Bitcoin’s price stability by providing consistent demand and reducing sharp sell-offs during market downturns, thus lessening overall volatility. What risks remain despite Bitcoin’s growing maturity and institutional adoption? Despite maturity, Bitcoin remains a risk-on asset, susceptible to macroeconomic forces, market sentiment, and inherent volatility.

2025-06-12T07:00:22,"Financial Advisors Reveal Cautious Hesitation on Bitcoin Investment and Crypto","BitcoinWorld Financial Advisors Reveal Cautious Hesitation on Bitcoin Investment and Crypto The world of finance is constantly evolving, and few areas have seen as much dynamic change as the cryptocurrency market. With the advent of products like the spot Bitcoin ETF, many expected a flood of mainstream interest, particularly from financial advisors guiding their clients. However, the reality seems more measured. Despite these new accessible avenues, many financial advisors are still approaching the digital asset space with significant caution, particularly when it comes to recommending Bitcoin investment . Why the Hesitation? Understanding Financial Advisors’ Concerns A recent report highlighted that, even a year and a half after the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a large number of financial advisors remain hesitant. Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex, noted that most advisors are not yet recommending clients allocate significant portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. The reasons cited for this reluctance are multifaceted and deeply rooted in traditional financial principles and concerns specific to the nascent crypto industry. Let’s break down the primary worries: Volatility: This is perhaps the most frequently cited concern. The crypto market, especially Bitcoin, is known for its dramatic price swings. Advisors are trained to manage risk and preserve client capital, and the potential for rapid, significant losses in a highly volatile asset class is a major deterrent. Unlike traditional assets that often have historical data spanning decades or even centuries, the relatively short history of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies makes long-term risk assessment challenging for many advisors. Energy Consumption: The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, particularly its energy footprint, remains a point of contention and concern for many, including clients who may prioritize sustainable investments. While there are ongoing efforts to shift towards more renewable energy sources in mining and alternative consensus mechanisms (like Ethereum’s proof-of-stake), the perception of high energy use persists and can be a barrier to recommendation. Potential for Criminal Exploitation: Early associations of crypto with illicit activities, dark web markets, and scams have left a lingering stigma. While the transparency of public blockchains often aids in tracking illicit funds, and regulatory bodies are increasing oversight, advisors worry about the potential for fraud, hacking, and lack of robust consumer protection compared to regulated traditional finance products. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite some progress, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and unclear in many jurisdictions. Advisors need clarity on how assets are classified, taxed, and protected under law before confidently recommending them to a broad client base. Lack of Familiarity and Education: Many financial advisors received their training and certifications before cryptocurrencies became prominent. Understanding the underlying technology (blockchain), different types of digital assets, wallet security, and the nuances of the crypto market requires dedicated education and time investment, which can be a hurdle for busy professionals. The Role of the Spot Bitcoin ETF: A Game Changer, But Not Yet a Full Catalyst for Crypto Adoption? The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin ETF products in major markets like the U.S. were widely seen as a pivotal moment for crypto adoption . These products offer investors exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, or securing the underlying asset. For advisors, ETFs provide a familiar, regulated wrapper through which they can potentially access the asset class using existing brokerage accounts and compliance frameworks. However, while the ETF structure addresses some logistical barriers, it doesn’t eliminate the fundamental concerns about the asset itself. The ETF still tracks an asset subject to significant crypto market volatility , and the underlying concerns about its nature (energy, crime perception) are not mitigated by the wrapper. Think of it like this: an ETF makes it easier to buy gold, but it doesn’t change gold’s properties or its market dynamics. Similarly, a spot Bitcoin ETF makes it easier to buy Bitcoin exposure, but the inherent characteristics of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain the same. Bridging the Gap: What Needs to Happen for Increased Bitcoin Investment Recommendations? For financial advisors to become more comfortable recommending Bitcoin investment and other crypto assets, several developments are likely necessary: More Education: Industry-wide efforts to educate advisors on the technology, market dynamics, risk management strategies specific to crypto, and the evolving regulatory landscape are crucial. Increased Regulatory Clarity: Clearer rules regarding classification, taxation, and consumer protection would significantly reduce advisor liability concerns. Demonstrated Track Record: As the market matures and navigates various cycles, a longer track record of performance and resilience might build confidence. Improved Infrastructure: Continued development of secure, regulated, and user-friendly infrastructure for accessing and managing digital assets is vital. Addressing ESG Concerns: Visible and verifiable progress on reducing the environmental impact of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies and highlighting the sustainability of alternative consensus mechanisms can help. Ultimately, the pace of crypto adoption among traditional financial advisors will depend on a combination of market maturation, regulatory evolution, and increased understanding within the advisory community. While the spot Bitcoin ETF was a significant step, it’s clear that the journey towards widespread advisor endorsement of Bitcoin investment is still underway, heavily influenced by ongoing concerns about crypto market volatility and other factors. Conclusion: A Cautious Path Forward for Financial Advisors and Crypto The current landscape shows that while the door has been opened for easier access via products like the spot Bitcoin ETF , the majority of financial advisors are exercising significant caution. Their primary duty is to protect and grow their clients’ wealth responsibly, and the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with Bitcoin investment and the broader crypto market, particularly its volatility and perceived risks, mean that widespread recommendation is not yet a reality. The path to greater crypto adoption in traditional portfolios will require continued education, regulatory progress, and the industry effectively addressing the legitimate concerns held by financial professionals.

2025-06-12T07:00:14,"Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim – ‘Up Only’ Ahead?","As Ethereum (ETH) attempts to reclaim its January 2025 price range, the cryptocurrency has been holding a recently recovered level, leading some analysts to suggest another 10% surge before new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback Ethereum Breakout Eyes $3,100 Ethereum has reclaimed the key $2,800 barrier for the first time since February, nearing the $2,900 level on Wednesday morning. The King of Altcoins had been trading between the $2,475-$2,680 range since its May breakout, unable to turn the range’s upper boundary into support. During last week’s retracement, ETH dropped to the $2,400 support before bouncing over the weekend. The crypto market’s recovery saw Ethereum surge toward the key resistance, finally breaking past it at the start of the week and hitting a three-month high of $2,879 today. Following this performance, Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show noted that the cryptocurrency had broken out of an ascending triangle formation and now targets the $3,100 resistance. The analyst previously highlighted ETH’s triangle pattern, which began forming at the start of last month’s recovery rally. During that period, the price compressed between the support and resistance lines, with the latter situated around the $2,700 mark. He forecasted a 15% surge toward the $3,100 level if the altcoin reclaimed the crucial resistance level. Based on this, Ethereum could climb another 10.7% if it holds its current range. Runefelt also pointed out another bullish formation in ETH’s trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC). According to the ETH/BTC chart, Ethereum also formed a bullish pennant pattern during the May rally. Amid this week’s recovery, the cryptocurrency has broken out of the formation’s upper boundary, eyeing a 30% surge toward the 0.03300 mark. ETH To Repeat History? Market Watcher Kaleo highlighted the resemblance between ETH’s performance between 2020 and 2025. According to the analyst, there are “a lot of similarities on the chart to where we are now vs. where we were in 2020.” As he explained, in the Spring of 2020, Ethereum experienced a major sell-off, fueled by the COVID-19 crash, which sent its price below a key higher timeframe (HFT) support. However, once the ascending trendline was reclaimed as support, ETH was “up only for the next 20 months.” Kaleo detailed the recent sell-off, caused by the Trump Tariffs scare, sent the altcoin below its multi-year ascending support trendline, adding that “ETH is currently on the verge of reclaiming that line.” Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 – Is A Recovery Around The Corner? The analyst suggested that if history repeats, investors could see “another great ETH bull run and accompanying alt season.” Meanwhile, analyst DonAlt affirmed that ETH’s chart looks “pretty good” amid its HTF range reclaim. To him, a new all-time high (ATH) is likely if the $3,800 resistance is reclaimed, while the rally’s invalidation level is a close below the $2,200 mark. As of this writing, ETH trades at $2,803, a 6.7% increase in the daily timeframe.

Dogecoin DOGE was down nearly 4% at 19 cents, while Tron's TRX TRX slipped 5.5% to 27 cents. XRP XRP, BNB Chain’s BNB BNB, Solana’s SOL SOL, and Cardano’s ADA ADA showed losses as much as 3%. Ether ETH, which outperformed BTC last week amid a surge in ETF inflows and bullish derivatives activity, also showed signs of cooling off after briefly topping $2,800. While the sentiment remains largely positive, multiple tokens are now hovering near local resistance levels, prompting cautious traders to lock in gains. Traders say the broader backdrop remains constructive. Momentum is quietly building across crypto markets, with underlying structural shifts catching the smart money’s attention. Macro conditions in focus as IPO market becomes red hot “Mainstream sentiment on crypto has turned around noticeably, especially on the back of Circle’s successful IPO, with Gemini and Bullish having filed their own listing intentions with the SEC recently,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message. “BTC treasury plays have also been in vogue with a seemingly endless stream of companies looking to copy the MSTR playbook, not to mention the stablecoin excitement both in TradFi and onchain (e.g., Plasma),"" he said. Macroeconomic developments may also be playing a role. Progress on U.S.-China trade talks and a softening inflation print have created a more favorable outlook for risk assets, some say, bolstering sentiment across equity and digital asset markets. “The U.S.-China deal progress and softer CPI data are encouraging signs for global markets, easing inflationary pressures and creating a more stable economic outlook,” said Jeffrey Ding, Chief Analyst, HashKey Group, in a Telegram message. “We're optimistic that digital assets will continue to grow as macroeconomic influences find resolution while institutions further integrate within the industry,” Ding added. Kraken economist Thomas Perfumo mirrored that institutional angle. “The broad rally in crypto markets reflects its evolving role as a macro hedge amid rising real yield volatility and growing concerns over fiscal deficits,” Perfumo said in an email to CoinDesk. “We’re witnessing a virtuous cycle: the adoption of structural bid vehicles like spot ETFs — particularly within a more favorable U.S. regulatory environment — is absorbing supply far faster than anticipated,” he added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/12/bitcoin-dogecoin-ether-could-see-profit-taking-even-as-macro-conditions-improve,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|BNB","Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T06:44:22,"Ukraine advances crypto reserve mission with strategic bill","Ukrainian lawmakers are taking the next step toward bringing crypto into the nation’s financial reserves with a newly proposed bill. A group of lawmakers submitted a draft bill on June 10, 2025, proposing amendments to the Law on the National Bank of Ukraine that would allow virtual assets to be included in the country’s gold and foreign currency reserves. The initiative was led by MP Yaroslav Zhelezniak and co-sponsored by seven other members. The move follows Zhelezniak’s remarks in May, when he first mentioned plans to create a national crypto reserve as part of a broader effort to modernize Ukraine’s digital asset framework. Commenting on the bill, Zhelezniak emphasized that it would grant the bank the right to include virtual assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the nation’s reserves.

Proper management of crypto reserves could strengthen macroeconomic stability and unlock new opportunities for digital economic growth,” he shared via Telegram. The National Bank will, however, retain the freedom to decide the accumulation process at its own discretion. Zhelezniak added that the idea isn’t unprecedented, citing similar ongoing efforts by countries such as the United States , Switzerland, El Salvador , and Kyrgyzstan , among others. The bill has already drawn the interest of industry leaders. Binance’s regional head for Central and Eastern Europe, Kirill Khomyakov, who has been in talks with Zhelezniak regarding the proposal, said the bill could introduce regulatory benefits to Ukraine’s crypto sector.

If passed, it would make Ukraine the first European country to establish a state-run Bitcoin reserve. Similarly, other countries like Taiwan , Brazil , the Czech Republic, and Russia are also working on incorporating digital assets into their national reserves.

2025-06-12T06:42:27,"France makes new arrests in ongoing crypto kidnapping case","French authorities have arrested more suspects believed to be linked to a string of violent abductions targeting cryptocurrency executives and their families. According to a June 11 Barron’s report , the latest arrests were made on Tuesday as part of the ongoing investigation into a kidnapping-for-ransom operation. Officials have not disclosed the exact number of suspects apprehended, but sources familiar with the case confirmed that they are being held under France’s anti-organized crime provisions, which allow up to 96 hours of detention without charge. The arrests are tied to the May 1 abduction of the father of a wealthy crypto entrepreneur, who was forcibly taken from Paris’s 14th arrondissement in broad daylight by four masked men. The attackers, posing as delivery workers, reportedly forced the man into a van while onlookers watched. In an effort to extort millions of euros in cryptocurrency, the kidnappers reportedly cut off one of the victim’s fingers. A tactical police unit later rescued him after being held for several days in a house on the outskirts of Paris. Subsequently, authorities launched a wide-scale manhunt to dismantle what they described as a coordinated extortion network targeting individuals with substantial cryptocurrency holdings. You might also like: France brings charges against 25 in crypto kidnapping conspiracy The latest arrests come just days after Moroccan police detained 24-year-old Badiss Mohamed Amide Bajjou in Tangier. Bajjou, a dual French-Moroccan national, is accused of masterminding multiple abduction plots, including the January kidnapping of David Balland, co-founder of French crypto wallet provider Ledger. Acting on a French-issued Interpol red notice, Moroccan authorities seized Bajjou along with a cache of weapons, electronic devices, and suspected illicit funds. French officials have requested his extradition. Investigators believe Bajjou played a central role in coordinating the broader network, which recruited young operatives via social media and messaging platforms. By May 31, French prosecutors had charged 25 people , aged between 16 and 23, in connection with attempted kidnappings. Most of the accused were from the Paris region, while others came from countries such as Senegal, Angola, and Russia. Authorities say they were recruited with promises of financial gains and used as foot soldiers in high-risk operations. Among the cases tied to the group is the failed May 13 abduction of the daughter and grandson of Paymium CEO Pierre Noizat. The incident occurred in central Paris and was captured on video by bystanders. Though the attackers fled, authorities later linked the attempt to the same network.

2025-06-12T06:40:28,"Urgent: Trump Organization’s Campaign Anniversary Announcement Sparks Trump Crypto Speculation","BitcoinWorld Urgent: Trump Organization’s Campaign Anniversary Announcement Sparks Trump Crypto Speculation A significant event is set to unfold at Trump Tower, capturing the attention of various sectors, including those keenly watching the intersection of politics and finance, particularly within the cryptocurrency space. The Trump Organization has announced a “major announcement” scheduled for Monday. This date holds particular significance, marking the 10th anniversary of Donald Trump’s initial campaign launch that ultimately led to the presidency. While details remain under wraps, the event is slated to be led by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, according to reports from Forbes. Given the increasing relevance of Digital Assets in the political and business spheres, many are speculating on what this announcement could entail and whether it might touch upon the crypto market. The Trump brand has previously ventured into the digital asset world, notably with NFT collections, making any major organizational announcement potentially relevant to crypto enthusiasts and investors. What is the Trump Organization’s Campaign Anniversary Announcement? The core of the news revolves around a planned event at Trump Tower in New York City. It’s timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign launch, a pivotal moment in recent political history. The event is positioned as a “major announcement,” suggesting it’s more than just a simple commemoration. Leadership for the event falls to Donald Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who are deeply involved in the Trump Organization’s business operations. As of now, the specific nature of the announcement has not been disclosed. This lack of detail naturally fuels speculation across various industries, including real estate, media, and potentially, the digital asset space. The timing, coinciding with a significant political anniversary and occurring during an election year, adds another layer of intrigue. Why Does a Trump Organization Announcement Matter for Trump Crypto and Bitcoin Politics? For those involved in cryptocurrency, particularly those interested in how political figures and large organizations interact with the space, this announcement is noteworthy. Here’s why: Past Engagement: The Trump brand has already dipped its toes into the Digital Assets market through official NFT releases, which generated significant revenue and engagement. This demonstrates a willingness to explore and utilize blockchain technology for commercial purposes. Evolving Stance: While past statements from Donald Trump regarding Bitcoin have sometimes been skeptical, his actions (like the NFT launches) and the increasing adoption of crypto by parts of the Republican party suggest a potentially evolving stance. Any announcement from the Organization could signal a further shift or concrete move in this direction. Brand Influence: The Trump Organization is a global brand. A major announcement, especially one involving new ventures or technologies, could influence public perception and potentially adoption rates of related technologies or assets. Political Context: Occurring on a Campaign Anniversary during an election cycle, the announcement could have political undertones or directly relate to campaign strategy, which increasingly includes discussions around economic policy, technology, and regulation – areas relevant to crypto. Considering these factors, the crypto community is right to watch this announcement closely for any potential signals or direct implications for the market and the future of Bitcoin Politics . Exploring Potential Scenarios: Could Digital Assets Be Involved? Without concrete information, speculation is rife. However, based on the Trump Organization’s history and the current landscape, several possibilities could have relevance to the crypto world: Scenario 1: A New Digital Asset Venture The announcement could involve launching a new NFT collection, perhaps tied to the campaign anniversary or other Trump properties/events. It could also potentially involve exploring other blockchain applications, such as tokenizing assets or launching a fan token. This would directly impact the Trump Crypto landscape. Scenario 2: Adoption of Crypto Payments The Organization could announce that its properties (hotels, golf courses, etc.) will begin accepting cryptocurrency payments. This would be a significant step for mainstream adoption, though regulatory hurdles and practical implementation would be challenges. Scenario 3: Investment in Crypto or Blockchain Technology The announcement might reveal an investment by the Trump Organization into cryptocurrency holdings or into a blockchain technology company. This would signal institutional interest, albeit from a private organization tied to a political figure. Scenario 4: Political Stance Update with Crypto Implications While the announcement is from the Organization and not the campaign directly, the lines are often blurred. The event could be used as a platform to signal a more defined or favorable stance on Bitcoin , other cryptocurrencies, or crypto regulation from the Trump camp, impacting Bitcoin Politics discussions. Scenario 5: Unrelated Business Announcement with Indirect Impact The announcement could be related to a completely different business venture (real estate, media, etc.). However, even this could have indirect effects on market sentiment or the political climate, which in turn can affect crypto. Here’s a quick look at how different political figures have approached crypto (illustrative, not exhaustive): Political Figure/Group General Stance/Action Potential Impact on Crypto Donald Trump Skepticism voiced, but launched NFTs. Evolving stance? Influences conservative view, potential for adoption via brand. Joe Biden Administration Focus on regulation, consumer protection, exploring CBDCs. Shapes regulatory environment, potential for stricter rules. Pro-Crypto Legislators (various parties) Advocate for clear regulation, innovation. Drives legislative efforts for clarity and growth. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Trump Organization Engaging with Digital Assets? Engagement from a high-profile organization like the Trump Organization with Digital Assets presents both opportunities and hurdles. Potential Benefits: Increased Visibility: Involvement from a globally recognized brand brings cryptocurrency into the mainstream conversation for a specific demographic. Potential Adoption: If the Organization integrates crypto into its businesses (e.g., payments), it could drive real-world utility and adoption. Signaling to Markets: A positive announcement could be interpreted by some as a bullish signal, potentially influencing market sentiment around Trump Crypto and related assets. Innovation Exploration: Continued exploration of NFTs or other blockchain tech demonstrates a willingness to innovate within traditional business models. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The crypto landscape is still navigating complex and evolving regulations. Any major move could face scrutiny. Market Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies is highly volatile, posing financial risks for organizations holding or transacting in them. Public Perception: Crypto still faces skepticism from some segments of the population. Association with a polarizing political figure could further complicate public acceptance. Technical Complexity: Implementing blockchain solutions or handling crypto transactions requires specific technical expertise and infrastructure. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts How should the crypto community react to this impending announcement? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Monitor official announcements from the Trump Organization and reliable news sources on Monday. Avoid relying solely on social media speculation. Analyze the Details: If the announcement involves crypto, carefully analyze the specifics. What assets are involved? What is the scope of the initiative? What are the terms? Assess the Impact: Consider how the announcement might affect market sentiment, potential adoption, and the broader conversation around Bitcoin Politics and Digital Assets . Evaluate Risk: Any investment decisions should be based on thorough research and an understanding of the inherent risks in the crypto market, regardless of news headlines. Look for Regulatory Signals: Pay attention to any commentary from regulators or policymakers in response to the announcement, as this could provide clues about the future regulatory environment for Trump Crypto initiatives or similar ventures. The event on the Campaign Anniversary is a reminder of how interconnected the worlds of business, politics, and technology are becoming. Developments from major organizations, even those not traditionally seen as crypto-native, can send ripples through the market. Conclusion: Anticipating the Unveiling and Its Crypto Footprint The Trump Organization’s planned “major announcement” on the 10th anniversary of Donald Trump’s campaign launch is undeniably a significant event from a political and business perspective. For the cryptocurrency world, it represents a moment of keen anticipation and speculation. While the core details remain confidential until Monday, the Trump brand’s previous foray into NFTs ensures that any major organizational move is viewed through the lens of potential implications for Digital Assets and the evolving landscape of Bitcoin Politics . Whether the announcement directly involves Trump Crypto initiatives, signals a shift in stance towards Bitcoin , or pertains to unrelated business ventures, its timing and prominence guarantee it will be closely watched. The coming days will reveal the specifics, allowing the market and observers to fully assess the impact on the dynamic intersection of traditional power structures and the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency.

Recently, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said that once bitcoin hits $130,000, BTC holders will stop selling and start locking in for the long term. Let’s see why he believes so! Bitcoin Selling Dries Up Above $130K In a recent tweet post, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley shared a key insight about Bitcoin’s future. He believes that once Bitcoin crosses into the $130K to $150K range, most holders won’t want to sell. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading near $107K. Some older wallets — especially those holding since the early days are taking profits, which makes sense given the massive gains. But Horsley points out that this selling pressure could fade soon. Once BTC breaks past its all-time highs, more holders may start seeing it as long-term wealth. BTC Is Leaving Exchanges On-chain data suggest that a growing number of Bitcoins are being withdrawn from exchanges and moved into cold storage. Since early 2025, exchange balances have dropped 14%, down to just 2.5 million BTC, the lowest since August 2022. Meanwhile, institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, MicroStrategy, and Metaplanet are holding billions in Bitcoin. These entities aren’t short-term traders. They’re thinking in years, not months. Borrowing Instead of Selling As Bitcoin’s value grows, so does the number of lending platforms offering BTC-backed loans. According to Bitbo, long-term holders (those holding for over 155 days) are up around 215% , with an average buy price of $34,414. Horsley also noted that instead of selling, these holders might borrow against their Bitcoin, keeping their assets while still unlocking value. That means even less Bitcoin will be available for buyers.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-sell-off-to-stop-after-130k-breakout-says-bitwise-ceo/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING","News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T06:20:45,"Invesco Crypto ETF: Former JPMorgan Executive Hired to Lead Massive Digital Asset Expansion","BitcoinWorld Invesco Crypto ETF: Former JPMorgan Executive Hired to Lead Massive Digital Asset Expansion The world of finance is undergoing a rapid transformation, with traditional financial institutions increasingly looking towards digital assets. A significant move signaling this shift comes from global asset management giant Invesco. They have made a strategic hire aimed squarely at bolstering their presence in the burgeoning Digital Asset Management space, particularly focusing on the highly anticipated Invesco Crypto ETF business. Who is Kathleen Wrynn and Why Her Move from JPMorgan Crypto Matters? Invesco recently announced the appointment of Kathleen Wrynn, a seasoned executive with a background rooted in the traditional finance powerhouse, JPMorgan Chase. Wrynn, identified as a blockchain expert, is stepping into a pivotal role at Invesco, taking the reins of their digital assets business. This hire is noteworthy because it brings expertise directly from a major global bank – a significant player in the financial ecosystem, even one whose CEO has historically expressed skepticism towards certain cryptocurrencies while the institution itself explores blockchain and digital currencies. Her transition from JPMorgan Crypto -related or blockchain initiatives to leading a dedicated digital asset unit at Invesco highlights several key trends: Bridging the Gap: It underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and the crypto world, with talent flowing between the two sectors. Institutional Focus: Executives with large-scale institutional experience are crucial for navigating the complexities of regulatory compliance, large asset management, and serving institutional clients in the crypto space. Expertise Validation: Hiring a ‘blockchain expert’ from a firm like JPMorgan validates the technical and strategic importance of distributed ledger technology within established financial frameworks. Wrynn’s background at JPMorgan Chase, a firm actively exploring blockchain technology for payments and other applications, likely provides her with unique insights into institutional needs, operational challenges, and the potential applications of digital assets beyond just investment products. What Does This Mean for Invesco Crypto ETF Strategy? One of the primary areas Wrynn will oversee is Invesco’s crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) business. ETFs are a popular investment vehicle in traditional finance, offering investors exposure to an asset or basket of assets without directly owning the underlying. Bringing this structure to cryptocurrencies has been a major focus for asset managers seeking to make digital assets more accessible to a broader range of investors, including institutions and retail clients via regulated channels. While the U.S. market currently has Bitcoin futures ETFs, the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF has been a highly anticipated event. Invesco, like many other major asset managers, has been actively pursuing regulatory approval for such products. Wrynn’s leadership is expected to significantly impact the Invesco Crypto ETF strategy by: Driving Product Development: Accelerating the development and potential launch of new crypto-related ETF products, potentially including those tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, or baskets of digital assets, depending on regulatory developments. Navigating Regulation: Leveraging her institutional experience to effectively navigate the complex and evolving regulatory landscape surrounding crypto investment products globally. Scaling the Business: Building out the infrastructure and operational capabilities required to manage a potentially billion-dollar digital asset portfolio within the ETF framework. This focus on ETFs underscores Invesco’s commitment to providing regulated and familiar investment structures for clients looking to gain exposure to the crypto market. The Bigger Picture: Accelerating Institutional Crypto Adoption Kathleen Wrynn’s appointment is more than just a personnel change; it’s a clear indicator of the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption . Major financial players, who were once hesitant or even dismissive of cryptocurrencies, are now actively building digital asset divisions, launching products, and exploring blockchain technology. Why the shift? Several factors are driving institutions towards crypto: Client Demand: Institutional clients, from hedge funds to wealth managers and even pension funds, are increasingly asking for exposure to digital assets. Potential for Returns: Despite volatility, the high growth potential of the crypto market is attractive for diversification and alpha generation. Technological Innovation: Institutions recognize the underlying blockchain technology’s potential to revolutionize payments, settlements, and asset management itself (hence the interest in tokenization). Competitive Pressure: As peers enter the space, firms face pressure to offer similar services or risk being left behind. Invesco’s move to hire top-tier talent specifically for digital assets is a strategic play to capture a significant share of this growing institutional interest. It positions them alongside other financial giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Schwab, who are also making significant strides in the crypto and digital asset space. The appointment signals that Invesco is not just dipping its toes in the water but is making a serious commitment to becoming a major player in the future of finance, driven by digital assets and the increasing wave of Institutional Crypto Adoption . Beyond ETFs: The World of Crypto Asset Management and Tokenized Assets Wrynn’s role extends beyond just the Invesco Crypto ETF business. She will also be responsible for overseeing the management of various tokenized assets. This highlights the broader scope of Invesco’s digital asset strategy, which encompasses the wider field of Crypto Asset Management . Crypto Asset Management involves a range of activities, including: Investing in cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. Developing and managing investment products (like ETFs, funds, etc.). Providing custody and security solutions for digital assets. Exploring and implementing strategies related to blockchain technology and tokenization. Tokenized assets represent ownership stakes in real-world assets (like real estate, art, commodities, or even traditional securities) that are represented as digital tokens on a blockchain. This has the potential to increase liquidity, reduce transaction costs, and enable fractional ownership. Wrynn’s oversight of tokenized assets suggests Invesco is looking beyond just the volatile world of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They appear to be positioning themselves for a future where a wider range of assets are digitized and managed on blockchain platforms. This proactive approach in Crypto Asset Management could give Invesco a competitive edge as the tokenization trend gains momentum. Challenges and Opportunities in the Evolving Landscape While the opportunities in digital assets and Crypto Asset Management are vast, the landscape is not without its challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle in many jurisdictions, particularly regarding specific products like spot crypto ETFs and the classification of various digital assets. Market volatility is another inherent characteristic of the crypto space, which requires robust risk management strategies. Security concerns, while improving, still necessitate specialized infrastructure for custody and protection of digital assets. However, the opportunities are equally compelling. The potential for growth in the digital asset market is substantial. As regulatory clarity emerges and institutional infrastructure develops, accessibility for both institutional and retail investors is expected to increase significantly. Firms like Invesco, by investing in top talent and developing comprehensive digital asset strategies covering both ETFs and tokenization, are positioning themselves to capitalize on this future growth. Conclusion: Invesco’s Bold Play in the Future of Finance Invesco’s decision to hire Kathleen Wrynn from JPMorgan Chase to lead its digital assets and Invesco Crypto ETF business is a powerful statement. It signals a serious commitment from a major asset manager to the future of digital assets and the increasing wave of Institutional Crypto Adoption . By bringing in expertise from the traditional finance world, Invesco is equipping itself with the knowledge and experience needed to navigate this complex, rapidly evolving space, manage a growing digital asset portfolio, and potentially launch innovative products like crypto ETFs and explore the potential of tokenized assets. This hire is a clear indicator that digital assets are moving from the fringes to the mainstream of global finance, and firms like Invesco are determined to be at the forefront of this transformation in Crypto Asset Management .

2025-06-12T06:17:54,"Anthony Scaramucci says Solana will Seamlessly Substitute Banks for IPOs","SkyBridge’s Anthony Scaramucci, while speaking at the Solana Accelerate conference, made some key predictions about the Solana ecosystem. Scaramucci most notably affirmed that bringing Initial public offerings (IPOs) on-chain is possible and allows non-traditional users affiliated with banks to purchase IPOs through their wallets. “You can actually crowdsource the public offering through the tokenization process.” He remarked. When asked about the state of institutional investors and their interest levels in Solana, he revealed that he was authoring a book on Solana titled “Solana Rising”. While interviewing Chief technology officers from around Wall Street for the book, he revealed that Solana’s scale, functionality, affordability, and throughput position the network to become one of the principal rail systems. “If Bitcoin is the operating layer for money, Solana will be the operating layer for real-world assets, stocks, bonds, and tokenization.” He asserted . Speaking of skeptics, particularly Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, who maintains that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and has shown almost no interest in the broader crypto market, Scaramucci believes he will “come around.” He explains that Dimon, who is surrounded by Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is tasked with regulating the financial system, is understandably “towing the line.” He further credits the Trump administration for reshaping the system. Scaramucci conclusively disclosed that what he and Michael Saylor have their gaze fixed upon is the process of assets transitioning into yield-bearing assets. “Solana certainly, you have the staking situation but Solana is going to be a healthy enough operating system where you’re going to be able to lend your Solana out, go to a Goldman Sachs of crypto like a Galaxy post up your Solana. Sure, you’ll get your staking, but you will also be able to lend it out and get yield in addition to that.” He remarked.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/anthony-scaramucci-says-solana-will-seamlessly-substitute-banks-for-ipos-2/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY","Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana",cryptocompare

The company expanded its treasury reserves by purchasing 100 Bitcoins worth approximately 10 million euros (about $10.8 million) in May 2025. Evertz Pharma’s interest in Bitcoin is not new. The company began accumulating BTC in December 2020 with its first purchase of €2 million, and has since been building a digital reserve by regularly allocating a portion of its profits to Bitcoin. The company’s General Manager, Dominik Evertz, said in a statement on the subject: “In line with our mission to promote science-based natural beauty, we act with a forward-looking mindset. With its rarity and global tradability, BTC complements our reserve strategy and strengthens our company’s long-term resilience.” Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Unleashes Listing Storm - Announcements Coming One After Another - Here's the Latest Altcoin They've Chosen With the latest purchase of 100 BTC, Evertz Pharma stands out from its competitors in the sector and traditional treasury management practices. “We will continue to purchase Bitcoin with our company profits and are constantly evaluating new ways to sustainably increase our assets,” said Group CFO Tobias Evertz. Unlike BTC investors like Strategy or Metaplanet, which are publicly traded companies, Evertz Pharma operates as a private German company.

Binance Opens Doors For Syrian Residents For a long time, Syrians had to watch from a distance as the crypto industry grew rapidly across the world. The local currency lost value, and many people had to depend on money sent from family members living abroad. Some even turned to crypto to protect their savings. But they couldn’t use major platforms like Binance due to the sanctions. That all changes now. With the restrictions lifted, Binance has removed Syria from its list of prohibited countries. This move doesn’t just reopen access, it signals a fresh start for Syrians who can now use crypto tools to improve their financial lives. Binance even says it will help new Syrian users through educational tools and support in Arabic. Their goal is to make sure everyone can use crypto easily and safely. What Syrians Can Do Now on Binance With the ban lifted, Syrian users can now tap into the full suite of Binance services, from spot and futures trading to staking, stablecoins, and even Binance Pay for cross-border payments. The platform has also introduced Arabic educational resources to help new users learn how to navigate crypto safely and confidently. Whether it’s buying Bitcoin, sending USDT to family abroad, or earning yield on crypto holdings, Syrians can now do it all within Binance’s secure environment — just like the rest of the world’s 270 million users. Crypto Interest Was Already High in Syria Even before these U.S. sanctions, Syria ranked high in crypto-related internet searches. That shows how interested people already were in learning about digital currencies. Many just needed a safe and legal way to get started.

2025-06-12T06:10:50,"Trade Tariffs: US Treasury Secretary Hints at Potential Negotiation Deadline Extension, What’s the Impact on Crypto?","BitcoinWorld Trade Tariffs: US Treasury Secretary Hints at Potential Negotiation Deadline Extension, What’s the Impact on Crypto? In a move that could signal shifting tides in international commerce, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that the Trade Tariffs negotiation deadline for certain countries, initially set for July 9, may be extended. This announcement injects a degree of flexibility into ongoing discussions that have significant implications, not just for traditional markets but potentially for the volatile world of cryptocurrency as well. For those navigating the digital asset space, understanding these broader economic signals is paramount. Why Does a Trade Tariffs Negotiation Deadline Extension Matter? Trade tariffs are essentially taxes imposed on imported goods. They are used by countries for various reasons, including protecting domestic industries, generating revenue, or as a tool in foreign policy negotiations. When tariffs are high or trade relationships are uncertain, it creates friction in the Global Economy . Businesses face higher costs, consumers may see increased prices, and overall economic activity can slow down. The original Negotiation Deadline of July 9 was a critical point. Failure to reach an agreement by this date could have led to the imposition of new tariffs or the escalation of existing ones. An extension, as suggested by the US Treasury Secretary , doesn’t necessarily mean a deal is imminent, but it does suggest a willingness to continue dialogue rather than immediately resorting to protectionist measures. This prolonged period of negotiation can lead to: Continued uncertainty for businesses planning supply chains and investments. Potential for markets to react positively to de-escalation hopes or negatively to prolonged indecision. A window for diplomatic solutions to be explored more fully. The Broader Global Economy Picture Trade policies are fundamental pillars of the Global Economy . Interconnected supply chains mean that tariffs imposed by one country can have ripple effects across the world. For example, a tariff on raw materials could increase manufacturing costs in another country, impacting their exports. Uncertainty surrounding trade agreements can lead companies to delay investment decisions, further dampening economic growth. Economists closely watch trade negotiations because they are indicators of international cooperation and economic stability. Positive developments can boost confidence, while breakdowns can trigger volatility. The statement from the US Treasury Secretary is being scrutinized for clues about the health of international trade relations and the potential path forward. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact? The cryptocurrency market, while often driven by its own unique dynamics like technological advancements, adoption rates, and regulatory news, does not exist in a vacuum. It is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors and global market sentiment. Developments regarding Trade Tariffs and the stability of the Global Economy can have a tangible Crypto Market Impact . Here’s how the potential extension of the Negotiation Deadline and the broader trade picture could affect crypto: Risk Appetite: Global economic uncertainty often leads investors to become more risk-averse. They might move away from assets perceived as higher risk, like cryptocurrencies, towards safer havens such as government bonds or gold. Conversely, signs of de-escalation or stability in trade talks could increase risk appetite, potentially benefiting crypto. Inflation and Monetary Policy: Tariffs can contribute to inflation by increasing the cost of imported goods. Central banks might react to inflationary pressures by adjusting interest rates. Changes in monetary policy, particularly by major central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve, have historically had a significant impact on the crypto market. USD Strength: Trade tensions can influence the strength of the U.S. dollar. A stronger dollar can sometimes put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are often priced in USD. Investor Confidence: Positive news on trade negotiations, even just an extension indicating ongoing talks, can boost overall investor confidence in the stability of the global financial system. This confidence can sometimes spill over into alternative asset classes like crypto. The statement by the US Treasury Secretary , while not directly about crypto, adds another layer to the complex macroeconomic environment that crypto investors must consider. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for market fluctuations based on global economic news like the Trade Tariffs situation, what can crypto investors do? Stay Informed: Pay attention to major economic announcements, not just crypto-specific news. Global trade developments, inflation data, and central bank decisions are crucial. Understand Correlation: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react to significant shifts in traditional markets and economic indicators. While not always perfectly correlated, the relationship is growing. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Consider diversifying within the crypto space (different assets, sectors) and across different asset classes based on your risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: For many, crypto is a long-term investment. Short-term volatility driven by macroeconomic news might be less concerning if you have a long-term investment horizon. Risk Management: Use tools like stop-losses and avoid over-leveraging, especially during periods of high uncertainty driven by global events. The potential extension of the Negotiation Deadline provides a brief pause, but the underlying issues related to Trade Tariffs remain. The reaction of the Global Economy and its subsequent Crypto Market Impact will depend on the progress and eventual outcome of these ongoing discussions. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on the Horizon The indication from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the Trade Tariffs Negotiation Deadline might be pushed past July 9 is a notable development in the ongoing saga of international trade relations. It highlights the complex interplay of global politics and economics. While this news might seem distant from the world of Bitcoin and altcoins, its potential impact on the Global Economy is undeniable, and macroeconomic shifts increasingly influence the Crypto Market Impact . Whether this extension leads to a breakthrough or simply prolongs uncertainty remains to be seen. For those invested in the digital future, staying informed about these broader economic signals is essential for making well-rounded decisions in a connected world.

2025-06-12T06:05:35,"Bitcoin Maximalist Admits XRP and Solana Are Becoming New Financial Base Layer","In a recent panel discussion shared by Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), four industry figures—Dave Weisberger, President of BetterTrade.digital; Tillman Holloway, CEO of Arch Public Inc.; Andrew Parish, co-founder of Arch Public Inc.; and Joshua Frank, CEO of The Tie—examined the emerging roles of digital assets, including XRP and Solana. Xaif shared a snippet of the discussion where Weisberger spoke about the real, scalable function of cryptocurrencies beyond speculation. He explored how certain cryptocurrencies are positioning themselves as core infrastructure for global financial systems. Weisberger, known for his Bitcoin maximalist stance, acknowledged that the value of these assets ultimately depends on utility, not narrative. :Bitcoin maxis himself says The future is being built now on $XRP XRP is emerging as the base layer for global payments Positioned beyond memes—real infrastructure Could underlie stablecoins like RLUSD, Chasecoin, and even JPMorgan’s token Interoperability with… pic.twitter.com/8zmGfLm8Ap — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) June 10, 2025 Targeting Global Payments and Trade He identified XRP and Solana as key contenders in this shift. XRP is aligning itself with cross-border payments, while Solana is gaining traction in trading systems. According to Weisberger, both are “vying to be the base layer to support new transaction modalities.” If these platforms enable real-world financial activity more efficiently than existing systems, they will increase in value. Currently, the financial ecosystem relies on centralized exchanges and proprietary systems. XRP and Solana represent a move toward decentralized, programmable alternatives. XRP, in particular, is targeting the payments space, with the potential to overthrow systems like SWIFT . Weisberger noted that if XRP underlies the stablecoins that become part of global financial infrastructure, such as RLUSD, or even stablecoins from major banks like Chase Coin, or JPMorgan’s token, it would gain long-term value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, adoption is key to this long-term growth, as Weisberger noted that without adoption at that scale, the asset cannot gain this long-term value. Utility Will Decide Longevity Solana, while often associated with retail-level activity such as meme coins , is increasingly positioned as a platform capable of supporting broader trading infrastructure. “If Solana broadens beyond memes to trading of everything,” Weisberger said, its value could rise significantly. The key, once again, is utility. While Ethereum was briefly mentioned in similar terms for its role in tokenization, the focus remained on XRP and Solana due to their specific paths toward becoming integral to payments and trading, respectively. Each is carving out a potential role in an ecosystem that demands efficiency, scalability, and interoperability. As the financial sector increasingly experiments with blockchain-based solutions, the underlying infrastructure will matter more than hype cycles. Whether institutions choose XRP to underlie stablecoins and transform global payments or adopt Solana, the utility of the underlying technology will be the defining factor.

2025-06-12T06:00:35,"Bitcoin Nears All-Time High as Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside","Bitcoin continues to show signs of recovery as its price rebounds from a brief correction last week. At the time of writing, the crypto is trading at $109,693, reflecting a 0.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Despite this upward movement, the current price remains roughly 2% below its all-time high of over $111,000, recorded last month. This ongoing strength in price performance has been accompanied by notable on-chain signals, particularly from large holders. CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan recently analyzed the current market structure and behavior of Bitcoin whales. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers From $100K Dip While On-Chain Data Shows Rising Miner Activity Bitcoin Whale Behavior Suggests Further Upside In his latest analysis, Dan observed that despite Bitcoin hovering near record levels, there is little evidence of the profit-taking behavior typically observed during previous market tops. According to him, whales are not engaging in mass selloffs, suggesting that these investors expect the rally to continue. Dan emphasized that these large holders are likely waiting for more pronounced market euphoria and higher valuations before initiating substantial sell activity, a pattern often seen near the final stages of a bull market. Bitcoin – Near All-Time Highs but No Profit-Taking “Whales show no intention of taking profits at this price level and are likely to wait for higher prices, where significant market overheating and a bubble form, before making their moves.” – By @DanCoinInvestor pic.twitter.com/W5PtrHo0Q5 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 Whale Exchange Activity Indicates Similar Move Further reinforcing the current sentiment, another CryptoQuant analyst, Darkfost, highlighted a significant trend in Binance whale behavior. According to Darkfost, historical data shows that when Bitcoin approaches or breaches its all-time high, there is typically a sharp rise in exchange inflows, driven by whales seeking to take profits. This pattern was visible during earlier cycle peaks, where inflows reached $5.3 billion in early 2024, and even higher levels of $8.45 billion and $7.24 billion in previous cycles. A strong bullish signal from Binance whales! “Today, however, inflows are just around $3 billion and are continuing to decline, suggesting that these whales prefer to keep holding.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full analysis ⤵️https://t.co/T1FlLnM4nK pic.twitter.com/O3XrqhAyEc — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 11, 2025 In contrast, recent inflows to Binance remain substantially lower. Darkfost reports current inflows hovering around $3 billion, and more importantly, on a declining trajectory. This divergence from historical patterns suggests that whales are refraining from selling at current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $1 Million?

2025-06-12T06:00:13,"Bitcoin Taps $110,000 Following Cooler-Than-Expected US Inflation Data – New High Coming?","Earlier today, Bitcoin (BTC) briefly climbed above the $110,000 mark after the release of cooler-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. The softer inflation reading strengthens the case for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to begin cutting interest rates – a development that could benefit risk-on assets like BTC. Bitcoin Gains As US Inflation Softens Today, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the May 2025 CPI report, showing signs that inflation is continuing to ease. Both the headline and core CPI readings came in below economists’ forecasts. Specifically, the headline CPI rose by just 0.1% in May, compared to the 0.2% consensus estimate. On a year-over-year (YoY) basis, the headline CPI registered at 2.4%, slightly below the expected 2.5%, and up from 2.3% in April. Core CPI – which excludes volatile components like food and energy – also rose by 0.1% in May, versus the forecasted 0.3%. The April figure was 0.2%. On a YoY basis, core CPI came in at 2.8%, marginally lower than the 2.9% consensus. Following the inflation report, BTC saw modest gains, climbing 0.6% to briefly touch the $110,000 level before retracing slightly. The data has increased the likelihood of a Fed rate cut in the near future. According to data from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) FedWatch Tool, traders are currently pricing in two rate cuts in 2025, with the first expected in September and the second in December. BTC also stands to benefit from easing geopolitical tensions. US President Donald Trump stated today that a trade deal with China “is done,” further boosting investor sentiment. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted a bullish golden cross forming on Bitcoin’s weekly chart. In a post on X, the analyst shared the following chart and emphasized the importance of BTC holding above the $109,000 level to confirm a potential breakout. A golden cross is a bullish technical pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average (MA) – typically the 50-day – crosses above a long-term MA like the 200-day. This crossover signals a potential shift in momentum and is often seen as an indicator of a sustained upward trend. Macroeconomic Conditions Favor A BTC Rally Beyond easing inflation, several macroeconomic indicators support a bullish outlook for BTC. Historically, Bitcoin tends to track M2 money supply, and a rise in global liquidity could contribute to further price appreciation. Some analysts are also drawing parallels between Bitcoin and gold. Crypto commentator Ted Pillows recently predicted that BTC could reach $130,000 by Q3 2025, mirroring gold’s performance in inflationary cycles. Importantly, the current Bitcoin market shows no signs of overheating. Unlike past bull runs, the current cycle lacks signs of retail-driven mania, suggesting there may still be significant upside potential. At press time, BTC trades at $109,876, up 1% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-taps-110000-following-cooler-than-expected-us-inflation-data-new-high-coming/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|core cpi|CPI report|crypto|cryptocurency|digital asset|gold|M2 Money Supply|US inflation",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T06:00:01,"Bitcoin Price: Glassnode Data Reveals Key Signals for Explosive Surge","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Glassnode Data Reveals Key Signals for Explosive Surge Are you watching the Bitcoin price closely? Recent analysis from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode suggests that the cryptocurrency market, particularly for Bitcoin, is entering a fascinating new phase. This isn’t just another day in the volatile world of digital assets; data points to underlying shifts that could be setting the stage for significant price movements. Understanding these shifts, especially through the lens of Glassnode data , is crucial for anyone navigating the current landscape. What is Glassnode Data Telling Us About the Bitcoin Market Cycle? Glassnode is renowned for providing deep insights into the behavior of market participants by analyzing blockchain data. Their latest observations highlight key trends that are historically associated with specific phases of the Bitcoin market cycle . Currently, two metrics stand out: Long-Term Holder (LTH) Dominance: LTHs are addresses that have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days. These participants are typically less reactive to short-term price swings and represent the conviction layer of the market. Glassnode’s data indicates that LTH supply continues to grow, even as the price hovers near previous highs. This is somewhat unusual for this point in the cycle, where profit-taking by LTHs often accelerates. Compressed Volatility: Volatility measures the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. Bitcoin’s price has been trading within a relatively tight range for an extended period, leading to volatility levels near decade lows. Low volatility periods in Bitcoin’s history have often preceded significant price breakouts. These combined signals suggest a market that is consolidating, with strong hands (LTHs) accumulating or holding firm, while price fluctuations remain minimal. This dynamic builds tension in the market, much like a coiled spring. Why Are Long-Term Holders Key to the Next Bitcoin Price Move? Long-term holders play a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s supply dynamics. When LTHs hold their coins, it reduces the available supply on exchanges and in the liquid market. Conversely, when they sell, it increases supply, potentially putting downward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Glassnode’s findings that LTH supply continues to trend upwards, despite Bitcoin being close to its all-time high, is a powerful signal. It implies that a significant portion of the market believes the current price is still undervalued or expects substantially higher prices in the future. This strong conviction among LTHs acts as a solid foundation, absorbing potential selling pressure from short-term traders or those taking initial profits. Historically, major price surges have occurred when the liquid supply of Bitcoin is constrained, and LTHs are in an accumulation or strong holding phase. The current trend, as highlighted by Glassnode data , aligns with this pattern, suggesting that the conditions for a supply squeeze might be forming. How Does Low Bitcoin Volatility Set the Stage for a Breakout? Low Bitcoin volatility might seem counterintuitive in a market known for its wild swings. However, periods of low volatility often represent phases of consolidation and indecision in the market. During these times, buying and selling pressures are relatively balanced, leading to tight trading ranges. Think of it like this: High Volatility: Price is moving sharply in one direction or the other, often driven by strong momentum or panic. Low Volatility: Price is relatively stable, indicating neither buyers nor sellers have clear dominance. Energy is building as the market awaits a catalyst. Glassnode’s observation that volatility is near decade lows suggests that this consolidation phase has been particularly prolonged and intense. This builds significant potential energy. When a catalyst eventually arrives – be it positive news, increased institutional adoption, or a shift in macroeconomic conditions – the market is poised for a sharp move as price discovers a new equilibrium. The direction of this move is often influenced by the underlying supply/demand dynamics, which, as we’ve seen, appear favorable due to LTH behavior according to Glassnode data . Is New Demand Outpacing Profit-Taking? The critical question for the immediate future of the Bitcoin price is whether incoming demand is sufficient to absorb the selling pressure from those looking to take profits. While long-term holders are broadly holding, some level of profit-taking is natural, especially as the price approaches or exceeds previous highs. According to reports referencing analyst commentary on platforms like Cointelegraph, the balance between new demand and profit-taking is the key factor. If new capital flowing into Bitcoin – perhaps via institutional investments, spot ETFs, or increased retail participation – exceeds the amount of Bitcoin being sold by existing holders (LTHs or short-term speculators), the price is likely to push higher into a phase of price discovery. Indicators that can help assess this balance, often tracked using Glassnode data , include: Demand Indicators Supply/Profit-Taking Indicators Exchange Net Flows (inflows vs. outflows) LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Stablecoin Market Cap & Flows Miner Selling Pressure On-Chain Transaction Volume (adjusted) Exchange Balances A sustained period of exchange outflows, increasing stablecoin market cap, and healthy transaction volume, coupled with restrained selling from LTHs (as suggested by the current trends), would strongly indicate that demand is winning this tug-of-war. Entering a New Market Phase: What Does Price Discovery Look Like? If the conditions described by Glassnode data – strong LTH conviction, low volatility, and robust new demand – align, Bitcoin could enter a fresh price discovery phase. This is a period where the price moves into uncharted territory, above previous all-time highs. Price discovery is characterized by: Rapid price increases, often with significant momentum. Less resistance from overhead supply, as few holders bought at these higher levels previously. Increased media attention and public interest, potentially attracting new participants. Volatility can increase, but primarily to the upside initially. For investors, understanding that the market might be on the cusp of such a phase is crucial. It shifts the focus from navigating sideways chop or potential dips to positioning for potential upside. However, it’s also a time when market sentiment can become euphoric, and managing risk remains paramount. Actionable Insights from Glassnode’s Analysis So, what can you take away from this analysis based on Glassnode data and current market conditions? Recognize the Phase: The market appears to be transitioning from a consolidation phase, characterized by low Bitcoin volatility and strong LTH holding, towards a potential expansion phase. Monitor Key Metrics: Keep an eye on LTH behavior (are they starting to distribute heavily?), exchange flows, and overall market sentiment. Glassnode’s weekly reports and on-chain dashboards are valuable resources. Assess Your Position: If you are a long-term investor, the current environment, according to Glassnode’s interpretation, might reinforce a conviction to hold. If you are a trader, prepare for potentially increased volatility and directional moves. Understand the Supply/Demand Balance: The core driver remains whether new capital inflow can absorb selling. This is the key determinant for sustaining a move into price discovery. While no analysis is a guarantee, the confluence of signals highlighted by Glassnode provides a compelling narrative for the current state of the Bitcoin market cycle . The quiet accumulation by long-term holders and the compressed volatility suggest that the market is patiently waiting for its next big move. Conclusion: The Stage is Set The latest insights derived from Glassnode data paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is in a unique position within its market cycle . The steadfast conviction of long-term holders , coupled with historically low Bitcoin volatility , creates a powerful setup. While the exact timing and magnitude of the next move remain uncertain, the underlying structure of the market, as revealed by on-chain metrics, strongly supports the potential for a significant upward breakout. The key will be whether incoming demand continues to outpace the natural profit-taking that occurs near previous highs. If it does, the stage is set for Bitcoin to enter a new and exciting phase of price discovery.

With no surprises and, apparently, no shocks to the markets either. Despite the uptick, Bitcoin, equities, and altcoins remained steady with no panic, no rally, but just quiet resilience. This suggests that the markets have priced in mild inflation as the new normal, as the investors are more focused on rate decisions, ETF flows, and broader macro narratives than a CPI number. Now that the BTC price has officially traded above $100,000 for 30 consecutive days for the first time in history, will the upswing continue toward new highs? Bitcoin has experienced a sustained adoption from states, banks, and corporations, which has marked a new era of institutional confidence in BTC. As per some reports , 116 public companies now hold 809.1K Bitcoin, up from 312.2K a year ago. Moreover, since early April alone, nearly 100K BTC has been added, with 25+ companies disclosing new holdings. The data also shows MicroStrategy and other institutions have intensified their accumulation since November 2024 when the market rose above the consolidation phase. Since then, the BTC price has maintained a strong ascending trend and is just 3% to 4% away from the ATH. Despite this, the whales remain optimistic and not interested in taking away their profits. The above chart shows the net realized profit or loss, which has spiked each time the BTC price surged above the consolidation. This was aimed to extract profit as the whales and the investors may not be confident about the upcoming price action. However, the current breakout does not appear to have attracted them to take out the profit, as the whales seem to be bullish on Bitcoin and expect the price to maintain a strong upswing. This suggests the BTC price may continue to maintain a strong ascending trend and eventually mark a new ATH soon. Currently, Bitcoin has entered the final resistance zone ahead of an ATH but has still not broken the barrier yet. Moreover, the price is squeezing with a significant rise in the volume from around $36 billion to close to $60 billion. This suggests panic selling but the question remains whether the price will hold the key levels around $106K after plunging below $108K. If this happens, then a new ATH could be a few weeks away; otherwise, the Bitcoin (BTC) price may face a deeper correction and reach levels just below $100,000 and further trigger a strong upswing to mark a new ATH.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-prediction-2025-is-this-a-calm-of-maturity-or-just-the-eye-before-the-next-storm/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
