2025-06-12T14:54:53,"3 Picks for the Best Crypto Presale to Invest in a Competitive Market: Nexchain, Mind of PEPE & BTC Bull","In a market filled with hype and speculation, only a few crypto presale projects stand out with real potential. Nexchain is leading the charge, already raising over $4.2 million with real tech and clear goals. It’s quickly emerging as the best crypto presale to buy right now thanks to its AI-first infrastructure and active developer traction. Alongside Nexchain , meme-based coins like Mind of PEPE and BTC Bull are gaining early attention in this cycle’s crypto presale list. If you're exploring crypto coins on presale, these three may be worth watching closely. Nexchain: AI Utility Meets Crypto Presale Growth With over $4.2 million raised, a price point of $0.07, and major features already live, Nexchain is gaining trust across the crypto presale list. Nexchain stands out as a fully AI-powered Layer 1 blockchain that supports 400,000 transactions per second with gas fees as low as $0.001. Its hybrid consensus system combines Proof-of-Stake with intelligent validation through AI, making it a reliable platform for enterprise, DeFi, and cross-chain apps. The Nexchain testnet is already functional, and integration with AI services, developer tools, and DeFi modules is underway. This isn’t just a roadmap—it’s real progress. Currently in Stage 17 of its presale crypto, the NEX token offers a potential ROI of 4.3x, with a target listing price of $0.30. For those looking to buy presale crypto with long-term utility, Nexchain offers one of the most compelling entries before public launch. If you're seeking top crypto presales with lasting impact, Nexchain may truly be the best crypto presale to buy right now.

As of today, its token price sits at $0.001200 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $235,347 USD. Despite recent dips, down 26.48% in the last 24 hours, the project continues to attract interest due to its AI-driven concept and meme-driven community. The $MIND token grants holders access to unique insights and evolving AI models. While its price action is volatile, the blend of narrative and emerging tech has earned it a spot among new crypto token presales being discussed across the Web3 space. BTC Bull: Bullish Bitcoin Narrative in Meme Form BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) rides the Bitcoin maxis' favorite idea—that Bitcoin will smash past $1 million. Launched on the Ethereum network, BTC Bull is still in its crypto presale phase. Its appeal lies in the promise of $BTC airdrops when Bitcoin hits key levels like $150K and $200K. These milestones aim to turn passive hype into active engagement. The project is heavily reliant on community-driven momentum, and its future depends on continued interest in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. As crypto ico presale tokens go, BTC Bull is clearly meme-first, but could see traction if Bitcoin sentiment surges in the months ahead.

Nexchain is already delivering on its roadmap with live features, working infrastructure, and serious traction. With $4.2 million raised and a fast-selling presale, it's emerging as the best crypto presale to buy right now for both retail and strategic investors.

2025-06-12T14:51:45,"GameStop’s $1.75b Bitcoin play sends shares into tailspin","After buying $513 million worth of Bitcoin in May, GameStop wants $1.75 billion more, and Wall Street isn’t happy. The stock fell over 15% as doubts linger over the company’s pivot from retailer to crypto whale. GameStop (GME) shares took a nosedive on June 12, barely a day after the brick-and-mortar retailer announced a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, potentially to add more Bitcoin ( BTC ) to its balance sheet. The company’s stock was already trending downward following a lackluster quarterly performance. On June 11, GameStop reported a 17% revenue dip in the first quarter of 2025, despite ongoing demand for online gaming. Shares fell over 5% that day and slid further on Thursday, as Wall Street remains uncertain whether the company can reverse its financial trajectory through a crypto accumulation strategy. Why GameStop is investing in Bitcoin GameStop did not confirm or deny speculation that it would use the $1.75 billion to buy Bitcoin. However, the June 11 announcement stated that proceeds from the convertible notes offering would be used for “investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions.” You might also like: Crypto is near a ‘tipping point,’ FSB chair warns Part of that policy includes strengthening its corporate balance sheet with digital assets, signaling a strategic pivot driven by both survival and ambition. Facing shrinking revenues and the waning relevance of its core retail business, GameStop appears to be borrowing from Strategy’s playbook, leveraging Bitcoin as both an economic hedge and a growth catalyst. Strategy’s aggressive move into Bitcoin has reshaped its market narrative. Since first investing in BTC in August 2020, its stock has surged 256%, climbing from $110 to $392 per share as of early June and far outperforming both the S&P 500 and broader tech sector benchmarks. Meanwhile, core software revenue remained mostly flat, dipping from $481 million in 2020 to $463 million in 2024, cementing Bitcoin as the primary driver of shareholder value. Bitcoin’s long-term upside and growing institutional adoption present a speculative but potentially high-reward strategy that could help GameStop reinvent itself. By acquiring 4,710 BTC in May and signaling plans for more through the new convertible notes offering, the company is making a clear bet that Bitcoin’s potential could reinvigorate investor confidence and address its operational challenges. GameStop’s recent Bitcoin purchase positioned it as the 13 th largest corporate holder of the original cryptocurrency, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data.

2025-06-12T14:50:16,"GameStop plummeted by 19% on Bitcoin buy plan","GameStop shares got destroyed Thursday after the company said it wants to raise $1.75 billion through a convertible note sale, triggering a massive selloff. The money, according to GameStop, will be used for “general corporate purposes,” but also for crypto buys—more specifically, Bitcoin. Right after the news dropped , GameStop plunged over 15% in premarket trading and then 4% more after the Bell, making it a 19% drop at press time. This came just a day after the stock already dropped 5% due to falling sales. Investors didn’t like the idea of a meme stock that just lost revenue throwing itself even deeper into Bitcoin. GameStop follows MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy with debt sale The company wants to copy the MicroStrategy playbook. That’s the software firm now called Strategy, which bought billions of dollars in Bitcoin and used different securities, including convertible debt, to pay for it. The result? Strategy became the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder and its stock went wild—sometimes up, sometimes down. Now GameStop wants the same kind of “magic,” except it’s already sinking. In April, GameStop added 4,710 bitcoins to its books. That haul was worth more than $500 million at the time. This week’s bond deal could send that number way higher. CEO Ryan Cohen said the decision came from macro concerns. He said Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature makes it a hedge against “certain risks.” Sounds a lot like what Michael Saylor once said, but this time the market didn’t bite. Analysts aren’t buying the vision either. Michael Pachter from Wedbush doubled down on his “underperform” rating. He said the stock already trades at 2.4 times its cash, and that the Bitcoin pivot doesn’t make sense. In his words, GameStop is still leaning on “greater fools” who think the price will just keep going up. He said, “they’re converting more cash to crypto, expecting to get an even bigger premium—it won’t happen.” GameStop is already under pressure from dropping revenue. Its Q1 2024 sales fell 17% year-over-year, coming in at $732.4 million. Online gaming is gaining momentum, and that’s killing traffic at the company’s physical stores. This weakness in the core business makes the risky crypto bet look even worse. NFT failure, regulatory exits, and herd behavior drive skepticism GameStop already tried playing in the crypto world once, and it didn’t end well. Back in May 2021, it announced plans to build a NFT marketplace tied to Ethereum. Business Insider called it an “ambitious plan to become the Amazon of gaming.” That didn’t happen. The beta version of the NFT platform went live in July 2022, with a curated marketplace that vetted creators. But things went sideways fast. One artist minted an NFT based on “The Falling Man” photo from 9/11, and GameStop banned the account. Another user uploaded hundreds of HTML5 game NFTs without owning the rights. GameStop took them down, killed the minting ability, and cleaned the listings—but the NFTs still live on the blockchain. By December 2022, the company laid off most of the NFT team. In August 2023, it said it would shut down its crypto and NFT wallet, blaming “regulatory uncertainty.” Then in January 2024, GameStop announced its NFT marketplace would close for good on February 2, 2024. So not only is the company diving deeper into Bitcoin, it’s doing so right after completely exiting the NFT space it hyped up just two years ago. Crypto veterans watching this play know the cycle. First there’s hype, then FOMO kicks in, and then retail investors get wrecked. Economics professor Burton Malkiel described it perfectly in his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street : people get drawn into rising assets—even if they make no sense—because they hear stories of early winners. And then they don’t want to miss out. Herd mentality kicks in, and boom—bubble. Even with the $1.75 billion in new convertible debt coming in, investors have doubts. The idea of issuing debt just to buy more volatile assets like Bitcoin, when your own business is already bleeding, isn’t getting much love from Wall Street. They’ve already seen this play out with other firms, and it didn’t always end well. This entire week was a gut-punch for GameStop. On Tuesday, revenue miss. On Wednesday, 5% drop. And by Thursday morning, another 15% wiped off after announcing the bond sale and Bitcoin plans. The market has clearly voted, and the vote is a big fat no.

Nakamoto’s untouched fortune has made them into the ranks of the world’s richest. As Bitcoin soars past $107,000, the mystery of Nakamoto’s wealth and identity continues to fascinate the crypto universe. Nakamoto’s net worth depends on Bitcoin’s value. With rising crypto adoption demand, institutional interests, and a pro-crypto US president in the office, Will Nakamoto tops the list? From Pennies to Billions: The Rise of Nakamoto’s Empire Nakamoto is believed to have mined nearly 1.1 million Bitcoins between 2009 and 2010, when the digital currency was virtually worthless. Fast forward 16 years, and Arkham’s blockchain data reveals that this dormant stock, untouched for over a decade, is now estimated at a whopping $118 billion. With Bitcoin trading at $106,840 ( check live ), Nakamoto’s wealth places them among global elites, rivaling tech titans and oil barons, yet their identity remains unknown. What is Making Bitcoin Go Up? Bitcoin’s recent rally has amplified Nakamoto’s fortune. After peaking at a record $111,980 on May 22, 2025, the cryptocurrency hit $110,651 on Monday and tested $110,435 on Wednesday before dipping 1.69% in the last 24 hours. A U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report that was milder than anticipated indicated a 0.1% increase in prices for April and a 2.4% annual inflation rate. This enabled Federal Reserve rate reductions, moving crypto market activity, and elevating Nakamoto’s portfolio to over $120 billion at its highest point this week. Will Nakamoto Surpass Elon Musk To Become the World’s Richest? So far, Elon Musk is sitting on top with a net worth of $411.4 B. Nakamoto’s net worth is directly dependent on the market value of Bitcoin. With 1.096 million BTC in his kitty, Bitcoin value must cross $381,928 to beat Elon Musk. However, these numbers are out of reach, but we can expect wonders in this highly volatile crypto market. Nakamoto’s Legacy in Crypto As Bitcoin makes its foundation strong in the financial world, Nakamoto’s untouched $118 billion fortune represents the transformative power of cryptocurrency. With the crypto market buzzing, the question remains: will Nakamoto ever touch their billions, or will this fortune remain a digital legend?",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/satoshi-nakamoto-now-among-worlds-richest-as-bitcoin-hits-118b-wallet-value/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM","News",cryptocompare

Horizontal support at $107,000 is holding so far. Will there be a bounce from here, or could there be further to fall? Source: Alternative.me A $BTC dip waiting to be bought back up The last big 10% surge for Bitcoin finally ran out of steam at over $110,000, went sideways for a couple of days, and then fell back down on Wednesday and into Thursday. It now remains to be seen whether the bears can take a tighter grip and force the price down further, or whether the current very positive market sentiment will see this dip bought back up again. Is a bounce about to occur? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC reveals that the support at $107,000 is quite a good one and will be key to hold for the bulls. It can be seen that a bounce did occur at this horizontal level, but it can also be observed that the bears are trying their best to make this level fail. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom, and with the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs on their way down it may not be too much longer before a positive price impulse takes $BTC back up again. Daily chart points of concern Source: TradingView The daily time frame is showing some potential points of concern. While the price is currently holding nicely above the $107,000 support, the Stochastic RSI is showing a cross down of the indicator lines, and at the same time the RSI, at the bottom of the chart, has the indicator posturing to cross down below the moving average line (yellow). Bull market following parabolic curve on 2-month time frame Source: TradingView The 2-month time frame for $BTC makes for interesting viewing. Firstly it must be noted how since the beginning of this bull market the price has kept to a parabolic curve, with the last touch of this line at around $75,000. With this curve so closely respected, the moment the price starts falling through is the moment to sit up and take notice that the beginning of a bear market could be nigh. Near the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has the indicators near the top of their limits, but should the fast (blue) indicator line cross back above the slow (orange) indicator line this would signal a continuation of upside price momentum. The RSI at the bottom of the chart has its indicator rising above the 80.00 level. This will need to keep rising and eventually get above 91.50 in order to cancel out bearish divergence.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt is warning of a 75% correction to $27,290 from recent highs of $112,000. He notes that the breakdown below the ascending channel and series of lower highs is similar to the 2022 bear market when Bitcoin dropped from $69,000 in late 2021. NEW: Peter Brandt hints at a 75% #Bitcoin crash repeat — but crypto analysts aren’t buying it. pic.twitter.com/h8cAB5IQXE — Coinpaper (@coinpapercom) June 12, 2025 Brandt’s warning isn’t just technical. He points to deteriorating market structure and sentiment as key supports fail. This has amplified investor anxiety, especially with the broader macro and geopolitical backdrop. Geopolitical Tensions Intensify Market Risks; Bitcoin Under Pressure Global conflicts are fueling the fire. Reports of Israel preparing to strike Iran have caused risk-off sentiment. The Russia-Ukraine war has escalated with drone strikes on Kharkiv, deepening investor caution. While uncertainty usually boosts safe-haven assets, Bitcoin is not capturing traditional safe-haven flows. It’s weakening along with broader risk assets.

GameStop added 4,700 BTC since May, and Mercurity Fintech plans to raise $800 million for a BTC treasury reserve. But institutional demand hasn’t yet offset broader market pressure. Bitcoin Technical Breakdown Weighs on Bears Technically, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish amid BTC’s breakdown below the trendline and the 50-period EMA ($107,985), which is clear. MACD confirms with a bearish crossover and widening gap, indicating downward momentum. Rejection candles from $110,376 and lower highs have formed a near-term bearish pattern. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview BTC is testing immediate support at $106,401. If that fails, further declines to $105,180 or $104,026 are more likely. The market is at a crossroads, either a breakdown to Brandt’s $27,000 target or a short-lived bounce on institutional accumulation. Trade Setup for Short Sellers: Entry: Short on rejection near $108,000 Stop-loss: Above $108,800 (above EMA) Target 1: $106,400 Target 2: $105,180 Risk Level: 6/10 Summary Bitcoin’s price action is weakening its technical structure and poses high bear risk. With macro headwinds, geopolitical tensions, and a veteran trader’s warning, BTC may be starting a bigger correction. Watch levels closely and be prepared for more volatility. The market is fragile; a break below $106,000 could be the start of a bigger move. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $107K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,103,849.89 out of its $8,153,354 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike.

2025-06-12T14:21:32,"Analyst: 31% CAGR Could Push Bitcoin to $168K by Fall 2025","Prominent analyst Axel Adler Jr. is forecasting a potential surge to $168,000 for Bitcoin (BTC) by October 2025, even as the number one cryptocurrency’s march towards a new all-time high faces a critical test at the $110,000 resistance level. His bullish projection is predicated on a 31% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), up from just 7% in April, which he believes signals a strong uptrend zone. $168K by October Adler shared the insight via a June 12 post on X, in which he pointed out that even though the current CAGR remained “well below historical peaks of 50–80%,” favorable fundamentals and continued futures market momentum could propel BTC to $168,000 by the start of Q4 2025. However, hours later, he issued a cautionary note for the near term, citing a “soft reversal point” marked by decreasing open interest (OI) and positive funding rates. “As long as funding remains positive but open interest is declining, you should expect a short-term correction or consolidation below $108K,” the market watcher warned. Fellow analyst Michaël van de Poppe echoed the sentiment, pointing to BTC’s inability to break past $110,000: “Couldn’t break through the $110,000 area and therefore, we should have some correction,” the crypto enthusiast posted. Still, he suggested that traders did not need to worry as long as BTC stayed above $106,000. Despite significant tailwinds, including positive progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and favorable May CPI data reported on June 12, the asset got rejected near its May 22 all-time high of $111,814. It tumbled by more than $3,00 from yesterday’s peak, trading around $107,000 at press time, reflecting a 2% 24-hour dip. While showing some resilience with a 2.4% weekly gain and a 4.5% monthly increase, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently underperforming the broader digital asset market, which grew 6.7% over the past seven days. Holder Dynamics and Retail Resurgence Shaping Market Meanwhile, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley forecasted a shift in holder behavior once BTC clears $130,000, suggesting investors will choose to borrow against their holdings rather than sell. Additionally, retail sentiment is on the rise. As of June 11, market intelligence platform Santiment reported a 2-to-1 ratio of positive to negative BTC-related posts on social media, the highest since U.S. President Donald Trump’s election over seven months ago. However, the current Fear and Greed Index reads 71, firmly putting it in “greed” territory, and raising concerns about a potential local top. Still, recent data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant highlighted an unusual market duality: while long-term holders are pocketing up to $930 million in daily profits, they are simultaneously increasing their net positions, suggesting that institutional conviction remains strong.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped below $107,000, down from this week’s high of $110,200. Other altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Chainlink ( LINK ) also retreated. This article explores the top five reasons why a crypto bull run may happen soon. 1. Bitcoin has strong technicals and fundamentals The first key reason for a potential crypto bull run is Bitcoin’s strong fundamentals. Demand continues to rise, with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds seeing significant inflows this year. Cumulative inflows since their launch in January last year have reached $45.2 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT holding over $72 billion in assets. More companies, including GameStop, Semler Scientific, Trump Media, and MetaPlanet, have continued to accumulate Bitcoin. This wave of accumulation has pushed the total Bitcoin supply on exchanges down to 1.1 million, compared to 3.2 million in 2020. Bitcoin supply on exchanges | Source: Santiment From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has formed a cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart. The initial phase is complete, and price action is now developing the handle section. A break above the all-time high of $111,900 would signal further gains. This would likely spark a broader crypto bull run, lifting other altcoins along with it.

Ethereum ETFs are surging Another potential catalyst for a crypto bull run is the rising demand for Ethereum ETFs. According to SoSoValue data, spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded inflows for five consecutive weeks, adding over $1.2 billion in assets and bringing the cumulative total to $3.7 billion. This trend may reflect growing investor confidence that Ethereum will continue to climb. This crypto.news article noted that ETH price has formed a bullish flag and a golden cross pattern, pointing to more gains. 3. Altcoin ETFs are coming The odds of spot altcoin ETFs are also rising, which could further fuel the market. Polymarket data shows that approval odds for an XRP ETF have jumped to 88%, while Solana’s ( SOL ) have risen to 90%. Other potential approvals will be Litecoin ( LTC ), Hedera Hashgraph, and Sui ( SUI ). These approvals will likely lead to more inflows from Wall Street investors, pushing prices higher. 4. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts Crypto prices will be boosted by the Federal Reserve, which will likely start cutting interest rates this year. Polymarket traders anticipate between 2 and three cuts this year, and more in 2026. Odds of Fed cuts rose after the US published a muted consumer inflation report on Wednesday. That report showed that the headline CPI rose to 2.4% in May, lower than the expected 2.5%. At the same time, Trump is said to be considering Scott Bessent to be the next Fed Chair in 2026. Bessent, the current Treasury Secretary, is expected to be more dovish than Powell. He is also more supportive of the crypto industry. 5. Trade tensions could ease Finally, there are signs that trade tensions between the US and China will cool now that the latter is using rare earth materials effectively, giving it an upper hand in negotiations. China will likely block these rare earth materials again if the US imposes new tariffs, a move that would disrupt the manufacturing sector. There are additional reasons to expect a renewed bull run in 2025. The U.S. Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, which introduces regulatory clarity for the stablecoin industry. Meanwhile, some companies are beginning to add altcoins like XRP and Solana to their treasuries, and the global M2 money supply is soaring.

Key Takeaways: Mercurity plans to raise $800M to build a long-term Bitcoin treasury reserve. The initiative includes tokenized treasury tools to enhance yield and asset durability. Over 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, signaling accelerating institutional adoption. The move aligns with a broader trend of corporations incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets as a strategic asset. According to the company’s Wednesday statement , the funds will be used to transition part of Mercurity’s reserves into Bitcoin, integrated within a blockchain-native custody and staking framework. Tokenized Treasury Tools to Boost Yield The initiative includes tokenized treasury management tools designed to boost yield and strengthen asset duration. CEO Shi Qiu said the reserve reflects the company’s belief that Bitcoin will become a core pillar of future financial infrastructure. “We’re building this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the future financial infrastructure,” Qiu said. If completed, the raise would allow Mercurity to acquire roughly 7,433 BTC at current market prices, making it the 11th largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, surpassing GameStop’s 4,710 BTC , based on figures from Bitbo.

Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. Metaplanet Announces $5.4B Capital Raise to Buy Bitcoin Last week, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. The firm announced to raise $5.4 billion to accelerate its Bitcoin purchase by issuing 555 million shares of Moving-Strike Warrants, a first of its kind raise in Japan’s market of this size. The move, outlined in its updated “555 Million Plan,” would give the company ownership of roughly 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. The announcement marks a major acceleration from Metaplanet’s prior “21 Million Plan,” under which it aimed for 21,000 BTC by 2026. After surpassing interim goals and climbing to 8,888 BTC, placing it tenth globally in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the company is now setting its sights far higher. To fund this aggressive acquisition drive, Metaplanet will issue 555 million new shares through moving strike warrants, an innovative financing mechanism designed to optimize capital raising with minimal dilution.

But ETF Analyst Explains: ""XRP and This Altcoin Will Get Approval Before SOL!""","After the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETF approval, ETF applications came for many altcoins such as Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC) and XRP. However, although the SEC has evaluated the applications made so far, it has not made a final decision by delaying it. At this point, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas stated that the summer months could be the altcoin ETF approval season. Balchunas also argued that Solana could be the first altcoin to receive approval. “Get ready for an Altcoin ETF Summer, likely led by Solana (and some basket products),” the Bloomberg analyst wrote. Related News: Bloomberg Analyst Explains: ""Get Ready for the Altcoin ETF Summer! This Altcoin Will Be the First to Get Approval!"" At this point, while the market continues to grow anticipation for SOL, ETF Store President Nate Geraci stated that Grayscale’s multi-asset fund containing XRP and Cardano (ADA) could receive approval before any Solana ETF. Nate Geraci shared on his X account that he believes the Grayscale Digital Large Cap (GDLC) Fund could receive approval before the Solana ETFs pending at the US SEC. Geraci said that “it’s pretty clear where this is all going,” pointing specifically to XRP and Cardano. Grayscale’s GLDC fund is a basket consisting of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). Notably, the fund includes all five cryptocurrencies listed for inclusion in the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, while the fund is only available to accredited investors. According to Bloomberg Intelligence data, the probability of approval for the Solana ETF is set at 90%, for Litecoin 90% and for XRP 85%. Dogecoin follows with an 80% probability, while other altcoin ETFs such as Cardano, Hedera (HBAR) and Avalanche (AVAX) are estimated to have a 75% chance of getting the green light. Sounds like this may be first in line for approval before spot sol ETFs… Includes XRP & Cardano.

2025-06-12T13:56:58,"Coinbase Lists New Altcoins: Don’t Miss Your Chance to Buy These 3 Meme Coins","Is altcoin season coming? Well, popular crypto exchange Coinbase has announced that it will list several new altcoins, including utility tokens like $CAKE and $SQD, but also meme tokens like $FARTCOIN. Folks can start trading them from Thursday 12 p.m. EST. Needless to say, Fartcoin is the most popular among the new listings. It has a massive market cap of $1.34B , which also makes it the second-largest Solana meme coin , just behind $TRUMP. This ‘stinky’ token, which came into popularity in October 2024 when the Truth Terminal AI chatbot promoted it , has surged more than 44% over the past week. And, considering that $FARTCOIN is now bouncing off the 20 EMA on the weekly chart, its Coinbase listing could be the push it needs to hit a new all-time high of $2.75. Read on as we spill more positive meme coin updates and point you towards the three best meme coins to buy right now. $DOGE Jumps After Musk’s Apology Tweet After a two-day long online brawl between power and money, i.e., Trump and Musk, the latter tweeted to express regret on his earlier posts about the president, acknowledging that he ‘ went too far .’ Dogecoin ($DOGE), a top meme coin that’s heavily influenced by Musk’s tweets, welcomed this news with open arms and jumped 6.32% to $0.20 . It’s worth noting that the correlation between Musk and $DOGE became stronger after his appointment to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In other news, Bloomberg has also upgraded the chances of a Dogecoin ETF approval to 80% , which is now more than Cardano’s 75%. As you can probably guess, a $DOGE ETF will boost market participation in Dogecoin, potentially throwing it to new heights. With all the recent news pointing towards an alt season just around the corner, surely you’d like some suggestions to prepare for the new market frenzy. We hear you, and we’re here to deliver. Here are our top three best altcoins to buy before the next rally. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Solana Layer 2 is the Altcoin to Buy Right Now Solaxy ($SOLX) , unlike $FARTCOIN and the like, is a new meme coin with real utility. It plans to alleviate Solana’s pain points and restore its efficiency, which is the main reason why meme coins flock to it in the first place. Solana has been struggling with congestion ever since the success of $TRUMP and $MELANIA flooded the network with transaction requests. Solaxy, however, will solve this by building the first true L2 solution on Solana. This will reduce the traffic on the network’s mainnet by offloading transactions onto a sidechain. The transactions will then be validated on the L1. This will keep the security intact, ensuring that investors benefit from both the L2’s speed and the L1’s security. Additionally, Solaxy’s recent collaboration with Hyperlane will also benefit Solana, because it’ll plug the Solaxy blockchain directly into Ethereum. This multi-chain approach will allow investors to tap into both Ethereum’s liquidity and Solana’s efficiency. The project is currently in presale for four more days, which is noteworthy because it means you can buy Solaxy for some of its lowest-ever prices. One $SOLX is available for just $0.001754, and the presale has raised a whopping $48M so far. After listing this June, our Solaxy price prediction sees the coin potentially hitting $0.032. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Bitcoin-Themed Meme Coin Offering Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is one of the best cryptos to buy now on account of its unique way of supporting Bitcoin’s growth. If you buy $BTCBULL and store the tokens in Best Wallet , every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone – $150K and $200K – you’ll receive free $BTC directly in your crypto wallet. In addition to a game-changing airdrop idea, BTC Bull Token also plans to burn a part of the total token supply at regular intervals. A token burn event will take place every time Bitcoin’s price climbs up by $50K. Accordingly, the first burn event will take place at $125K, followed by another at $175K, and so on. Investors, both retailers and crypto whales, are flocking to BTC Bull Token’s presale. It’s currently ongoing, with over $7.1M in funding and counting. Don’t miss out on the best pro-Bitcoin meme coin yet and buy $BTCBULL for just $0.00256 each. We forecast $BTCBULL climbing up to $0.06 after listing in 2025. 3. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Viral Meme Coin Blending Humor and Finance Speaking of meme coins, SPX6900 has emerged as one of the top trending cryptos , with a gain of more than 40% over the past week. Its mission is to claim victory over the traditional S&P 500 stock market index by overtaking it in market capitalization. Absurd? Yes. Thrilling for meme coin degens? Also yes! Despite having no traditional utility or intrinsic value, $SPX has been a force to reckon with on the exchanges. It’s solid evidence that community-backing is often the most important thing as far a meme coin’s success is concerned. Currently trading at $1.64 , $SPX is on an unprecedented bull run, making new all-time highs as we speak. Bottom Line All in all, Coinbase legitimizing meme coins like $FARTCOIN, combined with the unexpected Musk-Trump reconciliation, has created a bullish narrative for the altcoin economy, with $DOGE and $SPX leading the charge. We believe new top altcoins like Solaxy ($SOLX) and BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) could benefit from this new era of community-backed surges in the digital asset space. That said, none of this is financial advice, and we urge you to do your own research before investing.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-lists-altcoins-dont-miss-your-chance-to-buy-these-3-meme-coins/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T13:50:35,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Presale at $7 Could Replicate Early Bitcoin’s 10,000% Gains","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Presale at $7 Could Replicate Early Bitcoin’s 10,000% Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Imagine stumbling upon Bitcoin in 2010. A $100 investment could have morphed into millions by today. That window may be closed, but crypto experts now whisper about a similar generational opportunity: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Currently in presale at just $7, analysts believe its unique fusion of Bitcoin’s security with next-gen scalability could ignite returns reminiscent of Bitcoin’s legendary 10,000% ascent. With its presale rocketing past $4.1 million and over 11,000 users seizing early positions, the momentum is undeniable. Could this be your second chance at crypto history? Beyond Bitcoin: The Foundation for Exponential Growth Bitcoin revolutionized finance, proving digital scarcity and decentralized value. Yet, its limitations – slow transactions, high energy costs, and limited programmability – created room for evolution. Enter Bitcoin Solaris. It doesn’t replace Bitcoin; it builds upon its legacy with a revolutionary dual-layer architecture designed for the modern world. This isn’t just another altcoin; it’s engineered to solve the bottlenecks holding back mass adoption and user wealth creation. The Engine Room: How BTC-S Outpaces the Past Bitcoin Solaris’s power lies under the hood. It’s a groundbreaking hybrid consensus mechanism that merges the ironclad security of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) base layer with the blazing speed and efficiency of a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Solaris Layer. Base Layer (PoW): Utilizes battle-tested SHA-256, compatible with existing Bitcoin mining hardware, ensuring robust security and decentralization. Blocks settle every 5 minutes, anchoring the network. Solaris Layer (DPoS): Where the magic happens. 21 elected validators process transactions with 2-second finality, enabling over 100,000 TPS – dwarfing traditional blockchains. Validators rotate daily, and malicious actors face slashing, maintaining integrity. Cross-Layer Synergy: Critical state updates and validator sets are immutably logged on the secure Base Layer, creating a trustless bridge between security and speed. This architecture delivers enterprise-grade scalability (100,000+ TPS) alongside Bitcoin-grade security, enabling complex applications previously impossible on legacy chains. Your Path to Wealth: Mining, Staking & The Presale Advantage Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just tech; it’s a wealth-generation platform accessible to everyone. Forget expensive mining rigs and soaring electricity bills: Democratized Mobile Mining: The upcoming Solaris Nova app promises to turn any smartphone into a potential mining device, leveraging the Solaris Layer’s efficiency. Earn BTC-S simply by participating. Powerful Staking Rewards: Holders earn substantial yields (20% of all block rewards) by staking BTC-S. Dynamic APY and compound rewards incentivize long-term participation, growing your holdings passively. The $7 Presale Opportunity With a current presale price of $7 and a planned launch at $20, early entry offers a potential 233% gain at launch. Add the 9% bonus and long-term growth potential, and the 10,000% analogy starts to make sense. Phase 7 is ending soon, with the price rising to $8, and only about seven weeks remain before the July 31, 2025, launch. Over $4.1 million has been raised and 11,000+ users have already secured their positions, recognizing this as one of the market’s fastest and most explosive presale opportunities. The Fastest-Growing Crypto of 2025? Explore BTC-S Now Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: Mining Evolution Feature Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin Solaris Mining Accessibility Specialized ASICs Only Smartphone (Solaris Nova) Energy Consumption Extremely High Highly Efficient Barrier to Entry Very High (Cost/Tech) Very Low Primary Reward Block Rewards Block Rewards + Staking Potential ROI Mature, Lower Growth Early Stage, High Growth Why Crypto Insiders Are Buzzing: Performance Meets Potential The hype isn’t baseless. Bitcoin Solaris tackles crypto’s trilemma – security, scalability, decentralization – head-on. Its Solana-inspired smart contracts (built in Rust) unlock a vast ecosystem: DeFi protocols handle lending, borrowing, and high-speed DEXs. Enterprise solutions for supply chains and digital identity. Thriving NFT markets and play-to-earn gaming with negligible fees. Real-world applications in IoT, healthcare, and governance (DAOs). Coupled with its staggering throughput and mobile-first approach, this positions Bitcoin Solaris for mass adoption. Influencers and deep-dive analysts are taking notice. Detailed reviews breaking down its unique value proposition are emerging from voices like 2Bit Crypto and Ben Crypto , further validating the project’s potential to reshape the landscape. Security You Can Trust: Audits and Transparency Building a foundation for massive growth requires unshakeable security. Bitcoin Solaris prioritizes this with: Resistance to 51% attacks via its robust PoW base layer. Byzantine Fault Tolerance on the Solaris Layer. Mitigations against long-range attacks. Optional Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy. Its commitment is proven: comprehensive audits by leading firms Cyberscope and Freshcoins provide independent verification of the protocol’s resilience.

2025-06-12T13:40:48,"Bitcoin Price: How Subdued US Inflation Could Fuel an EXPLOSIVE Rally","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: How Subdued US Inflation Could Fuel an EXPLOSIVE Rally Are you watching the Bitcoin price with anticipation? Recent economic data out of the United States suggests that a key hurdle for further upward movement might be easing. According to a leading crypto strategist, cooling US inflation could be the catalyst the crypto market needs to ignite the next phase of its rally. The Inflation Factor: Why It Matters for the Crypto Market Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, plays a significant role in the broader financial landscape, and increasingly, in the crypto market . When inflation is high, central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve often raise interest rates to cool down the economy. Higher interest rates can make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive compared to safer investments like bonds or even cash. Conversely, when US inflation shows signs of cooling, it can signal to the market that the central bank might slow down or even reverse its rate hikes. This potential for ‘policy easing’ can increase liquidity in the system and make investors more willing to take on risk, often benefiting assets like Bitcoin. Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, highlighted this connection in a recent communication. He pointed to the latest U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data for May, which registered a 2.4% year-over-year increase. This figure came in slightly below the forecasted 2.5%, a subtle but potentially significant signal that inflationary pressures might be moderating faster than expected. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Targets on the Horizon Based on this improving economic outlook, Mena offered some compelling price targets for Bitcoin. While acknowledging the inherent volatility of the market, he suggested that a sustained break above the resistance zone of $105,000–$110,000 could pave the way for rapid ascent. Initial Target: A move towards $120,000 following a decisive break of the $105k-$110k range. Mid-Term Target: Potentially reaching $138,500 by the end of summer. Long-Term Outlook: A bullish scenario where the Bitcoin price could even touch $200,000 by the end of the year is now considered a possibility, fueled by continued positive macro trends and increasing adoption. These predictions underscore the strategist’s view that the current environment is becoming increasingly favorable for significant upside movement. Beyond Inflation: Other Macro Factors at Play While US inflation is a critical piece of the puzzle, it’s not the only macro factor influencing the outlook for Bitcoin. Mena also cited broader improvements in macroeconomic clarity as contributing to a more positive sentiment. This clarity reduces uncertainty for investors and institutions, making them more comfortable allocating capital to the digital asset space. The potential for central banks globally to shift towards more accommodative monetary policies further supports this trend, suggesting an environment where risk assets could thrive. The Rise of Institutional Adoption A key driver Mena expects to accelerate capital inflows is the continued rise in institutional adoption . We’ve already seen significant steps in this area, particularly with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Mena anticipates this trend will only strengthen, with: Increased participation from traditional financial institutions. Growing interest from corporate treasuries looking to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Continued rollout of state-level Bitcoin reserve programs within the U.S. These developments represent substantial new sources of demand for Bitcoin, which Mena believes will significantly boost ETF inflows in the coming months. Higher ETF inflows directly translate to more BTC being bought and held, reducing supply on exchanges and potentially driving the Bitcoin price higher. Putting It All Together: A Bullish Case for Bitcoin The confluence of cooling US inflation , improving macroeconomic clarity, the potential for policy easing, and accelerating institutional adoption paints a decidedly bullish picture for the crypto market , specifically for Bitcoin. While volatility is always a factor, the foundational elements for a significant rally appear to be falling into place. Investors are keenly watching economic indicators and capital flows, as these macro factors are expected to play a crucial role in determining whether Bitcoin can reach the ambitious targets outlined by strategists like Matt Mena. Summary: Navigating the Path Ahead In summary, the recent dip in US inflation is viewed by strategists at 21Shares as a potential green light for a substantial Bitcoin price rally. Coupled with growing institutional adoption and a clearer macroeconomic picture, the conditions are becoming increasingly ripe for Bitcoin to test new highs. While the path may not be linear, the underlying macro factors appear to be aligning in favor of the digital asset, suggesting exciting times potentially lie ahead for the crypto market .

2025-06-12T13:40:33,"Solana Stumble: DeFi Development Corp’s SEC Setback Slows $1B Ambition","DeFi Development Corp, a Nasdaq-listed company aiming to become a major Solana holder, has hit a regulatory speed bump. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected the company’s S-3 filing—an important step in its plan to raise $1 billion—due to compliance issues related to internal financial reporting. In a filing submitted on Wednesday, DeFi Development Corp said it would withdraw its S-3 registration after the SEC found it ineligible due to the absence of a required management report on internal controls over financial reporting. The firm acknowledged the withdrawal was “consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.” Solana Plans Still in Motion Despite the SEC’s rejection, DeFi Development Corp emphasized that its plans are far from over. The company said it intends to refile a resale registration statement at a later date to continue pursuing its capital raise. The original filing, made on April 25, outlined a broad use of funds including corporate expansion and additional Solana purchases . This isn’t DeFi Development Corp’s first move in the Solana ecosystem. In a separate announcement on May 28, the firm revealed it had adopted liquid staking strategies using the dfdvSOL token, converting a portion of its SOL holdings into these yield-generating assets. It had also cautioned that price volatility could affect the value of its SOL holdings, with the potential need to convert tokens into cash at a loss. Notably, Bitcoin remains the top digital asset on corporate balance sheets—with over 3 million BTC held across institutions, currently worth more than $342 billion. However, DeFi Development Corp is carving out a unique path as a Solana-focused treasury firm. From Real Estate to Crypto Treasury Originally a real estate financing company leveraging AI to match lenders and property buyers, DeFi Development Corp has fully shifted to the blockchain sector . Its transformation began in earnest with its first Solana purchase of 2,858 tokens on April 8. By May 15, the company had made its 11th Solana acquisition, bringing its total holdings to 609,190 SOL—valued at over $97 million based on current prices. The company’s leadership has also seen a shake-up. A group of former Kraken exchange executives purchased 728,632 shares of DeFi Development Corp on April 7. Joseph Onorati, Kraken’s former chief strategy officer, now serves as chairman and CEO, steering the firm’s bold move into Solana territory.

Ether ETFs Continue Hot Streak Data indicates that BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack, attracting $163.6 million in fresh funds. The massive inflow coincides with Ethereum’s jump above the $2,800 mark for the first time in almost four months. The last time the inflows into the nine ETH ETFs surpassed that threshold was on February 2, when investors added $276 million into BlackRock’s ETHA, and Ethereum’s price hovered at around $2,900. Fidelity’s FBTC had an inflow of $37.28 million, Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and Bitwise’s BITW also posted minor inflows. Wednesday was the 18th consecutive session with positive flows for the spot ETH ETFs, underscoring the improving sentiment towards the underlying asset. Notably, the Ether ETFs outpaced flows into their spot Bitcoin counterparts, which gathered $164.5 million inflows on Wednesday. Since they went live last July, the Ethereum products have recorded around $3.74 billion in net inflows. ETH Price Rally Imminent? According to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum was trading at around $2,742, representing a 2.3% decline over the past day. While Bitcoin recently registered a new all-time high above $111,000, the second-biggest crypto by market cap remains over 43% below its 2021 peak of around $4,878. Despite falling out of investors’ favor and vastly underperforming BTC this year, the ETH ETFs are enjoying a resurgence as President Donald Trump’s family has, in recent months, revived interest in altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. That being said, the healthy flows reflect the market’s increasing optimism. The money flows could help Ether surpass its three-year-old price record in the coming months.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/spot-ethereum-etfs-mark-best-day-in-four-months-with-240-million-in-investments-outpacing-bitcoin-funds/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T13:37:56,"Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee","The post Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On June 12, Brazil’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill 4501/2023 passed first committee, pushing the country closer to holding $BTC as part of its national reserve. The significant move suggests the creation of a national reserve termed “RESBiT,” which allows up to 5% of the country’s foreign exchange to be allocated to Bitcoin. Key Highlights of Brazil’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Bill Project No. 4,501 of 2024 “Provides for the formation of a Sovereign Strategic Reserve of Bitcoins by the Federal Government and other measures”, stated the proposal of the bill. The Brazil Bitcoin Reserve bill 4501/2023 was introduced by Brazilian Federal Deputy Eros Biondini and received favorable feedback of approval from the Economic Development Committee– two of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies. When the reserve was initially introduced, it aimed to back Brazil’s central bank currency using blockchain and AI for transactions. This legislation aims to create a national Bitcoin reserve that would hold up to 5% of the country’s reserve. The bill highlights that the Central Bank of Brazil and the Ministry of Finance will be the operating bodies managing reserves using stringent security protocols as cold wallets. It will be required to submit audited transparency reports to Congress every six months. The Bitcoin reserve bill also aims to diversify the Treasury’s assets by supporting a country’s central bank digital currency. What is the Brazilian Government Saying About the Bitcoin Bill? Luis Gastao, the rapporteur of the proposal and also a Brazilian Congressman, emphasised that if Brazil adopts this Bitcoin Reserve plan, it can help reduce reliance on fiat currency. He added that it could also assist in diversifying its assets. He added – “We are advocating for a cautious and gradual implementation strategy to balance the potential benefits and risks of adding Bitcoin to Brazil’s official reserves.” Final Note Additionally, this new Bitcoin reserve bill is seeking approval from the committee on technology, constitution, and finance for further consideration. If the bill is ultimately passed, Brazil will second Latin American Country, just behind El Salvador, to legally establish a bitcoin reserve. However, Brazil’s approach is considered more structured. Brazil’s initiative for a Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve can steer other nations’ tech policies. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-12T13:37:33,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bulls Must Wait For New ATH As Rally Stalls","Bitcoin’s (BTC) push toward a new all-time high stalled after reaching $110,253. The decline comes despite encouraging US macroeconomic data. However, analysts are optimistic about a recovery and a rally to $115,000. BTC is down nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $106,943, with sellers in control. Centralized Treasuries Hold A Third Of The Bitcoin Supply A recent research report by Gemini and Glassnode has revealed that centralized Bitcoin treasuries hold around 31% of the total Bitcoin supply. Centralized treasuries, including those of governments, exchange-traded funds, and public companies, control 30.9% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin , signaling a shift towards institutional-grade infrastructure. The total Bitcoin with institutional and custodial entities stands at 6.1 million BTC , worth $668 billion at current prices. This represents a staggering 924% increase in the Bitcoin supply held by these entities over the past decade. According to Glassnode and Gemini, the jump in BTC holdings by institutional funds, governments, and treasuries shows that they view the asset as a strategic store of value. “During the same period, the spot price of Bitcoin has climbed from under $1,000 to over $100,000, reinforcing the thesis that institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a strategic asset.” Centralized exchanges hold around half of that figure and may be holding them for retail investors and individual customers. The report also stated that the top three entities across all institutional categories control between 65% and 90% of the total holdings. “In contrast, private company holdings appear more distributed, reflecting a broader base of engagement.” Bitwise CEO Believes Selling Pressure Will Vanish Once BTC Taps $130,000 Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes Bitcoin sell pressure will evaporate once the asset’s price crosses $130,000. Horsley stated in a post on X, “I think once Bitcoin breaks through $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin. Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices, are selling some. That said, once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this will peter off. And from there on, when people need liquidity, they are going to borrow from an ever-growing set of lenders. All of which will further propel the price. There's simply not going to be enough Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could reach the $130,000-$150,000 price range this year thanks to growing demand and institutional adoption. According to Horsley, the current selling pressure is from early buyers of Bitcoin, who acquired the flagship cryptocurrency at low prices and have decided to sell some of their assets. “Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices are selling some. Once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this will peter off.” Horsley believes there will not be enough Bitcoin in the market, and holders must find alternative avenues of accessing liquidity. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a bullish note, surging past $110,000 on Monday. Sellers attempted to take control on Tuesday as the price fell to a low of $108,335 but were unsuccessful as BTC rebounded to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. However, selling pressure overwhelmed buyers on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42% to $108,687. The flagship cryptocurrency continues to trade in the red during the ongoing session, trading at around $107,400. BTC’s brief rally past $110,000 came as US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers came in cooler-than-expected. The CPI rose 2.4% year-over-year against an expected 2.5%, while Core CPI also beat estimates, rising 2.8% against a forecasted 2.9%. Analysts expect risk assets like BTC to rally if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. However, the chances of a rate cut next week remain low as headline CPI is rising for the first time since January. Overall market sentiment around BTC remains bullish, and softer-than-expected CPI data could see BTC rebound and surge to new highs above $115,000. US Producer Price Index (PPI) data could be a BTC and crypto rally. PPI is expected to rise 0.2% month-over-month, while core PPI is expected to rise 0.3%. Lower-than-expected numbers could reinforce dovish expectations over the second half of the year. Bitfinex analysts believe BTC could reach $111,000 despite heightened volatility and a substantial decline to below $108,000 this week. Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, believes soft inflation numbers could increase the likelihood of a rate cut, giving assets like BTC a boost. The Bitfinex analyst believes this could drive the price to $111,000 even though its upside depends on the performance of the S&P 500. “ BTC’s tight correlation with the S&P 500 (30D r ~0.63) reveals its current role as a liquidity barometer rather than a volatility hedge. This correlation makes BTC highly sensitive to SPX range-bound conditions, and until the index breaks out, BTC’s upside remains constrained.” BTC started the previous week with a sharp drop to $103,768. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday and slipped below $105,000 on Wednesday after dropping almost 1% to $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC continued to push higher over the weekend, rising 1.15% on Saturday and registering a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC rallied over 4%, surging past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settling at $110,251. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42%. Slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,687. The current session sees BTC down nearly 2%, trading around $107,054 as it struggles to stay above $107,000.

2025-06-12T13:34:00,"ETF With XRP, Cardano Exposure To Win SEC Approval Next Before Solana Funds, Expert Points Out","Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, has forecasted the next spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) to secure approval from the US. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a recent post, Geraci suggested that an ETF directly tracking the price of Solana (SOL) may not be next in line for a green light. In his opinion, America’s top financial cop could approve a Grayscale multi-token fund containing XRP and Cardano before the spot SOL ETFs. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF To Be Approved Next? Nate Geraci believes the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund might be “first in line for approval before spot sol ETFs.” Asset manager Grayscale filed to convert the existing private fund into a publicly available exchange-traded fund last October. The SEC later acknowledged the application in late 2024. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which was created in 2018, holds a crypto index portfolio comprising Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). The fund heavily leans towards BTC with a 78.77% weighting at press time, according to the Grayscale site . The rest includes ETH with 12.40%, while XRP, SOL, and ADA take up 4.86%, 3.04%, and 0.93%, respectively. As of June 12, the fund has roughly $796 million in assets under management (AUM) and is only available to accredited investors. Observers are hopeful about its approval odds because it contains only a tiny portion of altcoins with lower liquidity. Crypto index ETFs became a focus for issuers after a hybrid Bitcoin-Ethereum fund debuted last year amid a softer stance on digital asset regulation in the US. In December, the SEC greenlighted the first batch of combo crypto ETFs sponsored by Hashdex and Fidelity. It remains to be seen whether the regulator will approve one consisting of other altcoins such as SOL and XRP. SOL ETF Approval Odds A slew of spot ETF filings from would-be issuers like VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital suggest strong demand for regulated SOL investment vehicles. As ZyCrypto reported earlier, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas thinks the SEC could “act early” on Solana and staking ETF filings, pegging the approval odds at 90%. “Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way.” Approval of these funds could unlock institutional capital, boost demand for SOL, and potentially propel prices higher, with some strategists forecasting targets as high as $500 .",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/etf-with-xrp-cardano-exposure-to-win-sec-approval-next-before-solana-funds-expert-points-out/,"ADA|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Ripple|SOL|Solana|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T13:28:44,"Crypto is near a ‘tipping point,’ FSB chair warns","Outgoing Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot has warned that crypto may pose a threat to global financial stability, citing growing connections between crypto and traditional finance. The FSB has long maintained that “crypto does not yet pose a systemic risk, but recent developments suggest we may be approaching a tipping point,” Knot said while speaking in Madrid on Thursday. He pointed to the role of stablecoins in linking the two financial systems. “Stablecoin issuers, for example, now hold substantial amounts of U.S. Treasuries. This is a segment we must monitor closely.” You might also like: Bitcoin nears all-time highs, but Google search interest is near a 5-year low. Why? Retail traders access to crypto Knot also flagged the rapid growth in retail crypto access via exchange-traded funds. “Barriers for retail users have dropped significantly, particularly with the introduction of crypto ETFs . The interlinkages with the traditional financial system continue to grow,”Knot said. While noting that crypto’s rise has been driven in part by inefficiencies in cross-border payments, Knot emphasized the need for appropriate regulation. “The crypto ecosystem will continue to evolve — and so must our regulatory frameworks.” He said jurisdictions are actively developing rules, and that “the FSB’s recommendations offer a common foundation. This is especially important given the inherently cross-border nature of crypto.” Knot also discussed parallel concerns with climate change and the financial sector’s preparedness. But he ended by underscoring the importance of global coordination across all areas: “Financial stability is an international public good. Every single issue I have mentioned today — NBFI, banking, crypto, payments, climate — they all cross borders. And so must our response be.” Knot’s term at the FSB ends June 30.

GameStop Plans $1.75 Billion Raise GameStop is set to offer a $1.75 billion convertible senior note offering. The notes, which carry no interest, will mature in June 2032, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer said , adding that the offering’s conversion price will be determined later. The offering includes an option for initial purchasers to buy an additional $250 million in notes within two weeks of the initial issuance. Notably, the notes are only available to qualified institutional buyers The company didn’t explicitly say in the blog post that the proceeds would be used to fund additional Bitcoin purchases, but said it plans to make investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s investment policy in addition to potential acquisitions. Gamestop announced in March that it had updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin’s use “as a Treasury Reserve Asset.” GameStop’s move to adopt the world’s oldest and largest crypto as a treasury reserve asset reflects a growing trend among public and private companies turning to Bitcoin to safeguard cash reserves or reposition themselves as Bitcoin acquisition vehicles. GameStop Recently Purchased $500 Million in BTC GameStop completed its initial offering of convertible senior notes in early April, a $1.5 billion offering that left GameStop with $1.48 billion in net proceeds. Part of the proceeds was used to scoop up 4,710 Bitcoin — worth $513 million at the time — on May 28. The company’s 4,710 Bitcoin stash currently positions it as the 13th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data tracked by BitcoinTreasuries.NET. However, GameStop’s shares have tumbled over 9% from $28.36 since the company signaled that it plans to accumulate Bitcoin on March 26. The latest offering follows GameStop’s latest earnings report, which shows lackluster year-over-year sales. Moreover, its first-quarter revenue fell 17% to $732.4 million, down from $881.8 million a year ago. After falling more than 5% in Wednesday’s trading session, the company’s stock dropped another 10% in after-hours trading following the poor Q1 earnings.

Binance Now Offers Service in Syria: Years of Access Blockage Comes to an End This has given millions of Syrian users, who have been excluded from the digital asset economy for years, the opportunity to join Binance’s global network of over 270 million users. In the past, Binance was unable to provide services to users in Syria due to US sanctions.

2025-06-12T13:23:31,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is This BTC’s Last Pullback Before Another All-Time High?","Bitcoin faced slight rejection at the crucial $111K resistance range, heading south by several grand. Nevertheless, the price is likely experiencing a corrective stage, expecting to find support soon and initiate another impulsive surge toward the $111K ATH. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC encountered slight rejection at the key $111K resistance region, signaling profit-taking by market participants at this critical level. However, the price has now entered a daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $106K and $108K, an area typically associated with strong demand and buying interest. This zone may provide the necessary support to halt the current corrective phase and trigger a bullish reversal. If Bitcoin manages to hold above this FVG, the price could soon resume its upward momentum, potentially initiating a fresh impulsive rally toward the $111K all-time high. However, a breakdown below the $106K-$108K FVG would increase the likelihood of a deeper correction, with the $100K level emerging as the next major support. Broadly speaking, BTC remains range-bound between the $100K support and the $111K resistance. While a breakout from either boundary could lead to a significant directional move, current market structure suggests a higher probability of an eventual bullish move, possibly setting a new all-time high in the coming months. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin faced rejection from a critical order block near the $110K level, reflecting renewed selling pressure. This rejection has initiated a short-term bearish retracement, pushing the price toward a key support zone. This zone includes a 4-hour order block between $106K and $105K, which coincides with a potential retest of a previously broken bullish flag pattern. A successful pullback to this region would validate the earlier breakout and set the stage for a renewed bullish surge. This move could mark the beginning of another upward impulse toward uncharted territory above $111K. Nonetheless, the price action around this support zone is critical. If Bitcoin fails to hold this level and breaks below the order block, the bullish scenario will be invalidated in the short term, increasing the risk of a correction down to the $100K support level. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets Recent on-chain activity indicates a strengthening case for Bitcoin’s continued uptrend, with key metrics showing reduced exchange supply and growing confidence from long-term investors. Data from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, reveals a notable trend: since June 6th, over 7,000 BTC have been steadily withdrawn from the platform. This consistent outflow, illustrated by a series of negative netflow days, suggests that investors are increasingly opting to move their holdings into cold storage rather than keeping them on exchanges for immediate trading. Such behavior typically signals a shift toward long-term holding and reduces the volume of Bitcoin readily available for sale, easing sell-side pressure on the market. This development coincides with increased accumulation from long-term holders. Together, the combination of significant BTC outflows from Binance and aggressive long-term accumulation paints a bullish picture. With fewer coins available for trading, reduced selling pressure, and signs of renewed investor confidence, the broader on-chain and technical landscape indicates a favorable setup for Bitcoin’s continued upward movement.

2025-06-12T13:20:39,"Russia floats fines and seizures as punishment for illegal miners and crypto payments","Authorities in Russia prepare to slap hefty fines on miners minting digital currencies outside the law, following the recent bust of large-scale illegal mining operations in Siberia. The penalties will be introduced through legislative changes, the authors of which have also taken the opportunity to target the use of cryptocurrencies for payments. In both cases, offenders may expect to have their coins seized by the state. ‘Gray’ miners to pay up to 2 million rubles for breaking the law The Russian government intends to go after illegal mining activities believed to be causing energy shortages and power grid breakdowns in a number of regions. Moscow wants to punish the so-called “gray” miners with serious fines and confiscation of the mined crypto. According to amendments to the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses drafted by the Ministry of Digital Development, companies involved in such operations will pay the state between 1 million and 2 million rubles ($25,000), the Russian-language edition of Forbes unveiled this week. Penalties for individual entrepreneurs and officials will range from 200,000 to 400,000 rubles ($5,000) while private citizens mining in their basements and garages will be fined between 100,000 and 200,000 rubles ($2,500), the article detailed. The existence of the bill, which is yet to hit the floor of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, was confirmed by Anton Gorelkin, deputy chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Information Policy, IT and Communications. Speaking to the business news portal RBC on Wednesday, the lawmaker revealed that the legislation stipulates the seizure of the illegally minted cryptocurrency, insisting that the changes should be approved “as soon as possible.” Russia seeks to impose ‘painful penalties’ for crypto payments The authors of the draft law have also sneaked in a text imposing similar monetary punishments and coin confiscation for any citizen or business using cryptocurrencies for payments outside Russia’s special legal regime that allows limited crypto settlements in foreign trade. In this case, fines may reach 1 million rubles for companies, 400,000 rubles for officials trespassing the law, and 200,000 rubles for ordinary Russians using Bitcoin and the like to buy goods and services instead of spending the only legal tender in Russia, the ruble. This kind of liability is “quite tough” against the general background of the code, Director Bank of Russia ’s legal department, Andrey Medvedev, admitted in May, while emphasizing: “But the key thing is that the digital currency that will be illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. This will be the most painful phenomenon.” Large illegal mining farms busted in Siberia Crypto mining was legalized in Russia last year. Legal entities and entrepreneurs engaged in the business are required to register with the Federal Tax Service, while private persons can mine without registration as long as their monthly electricity consumption does not exceed 6,000 kWh. Russian miners are also obliged to report the mined cryptocurrency to the Federal Financial Monitoring Service ( Rosfinmonitoring ), and failure to do so will also result in financial fines in the future. Growth in the industry has caused energy deficits in parts of the country, and the government in Moscow has already imposed a blanket ban on mining in 11 Russian regions, from the Far East to the Caucasus and the occupied territories of Ukraine. However, Duma member Anton Gorelkin is convinced that illegal crypto farms are the ones to blame for the excessive load on Russia’s power grids. The current mining prohibition does little to combat them, he said, noting that the restrictions primarily affect “white” miners. His statements and the news of the heavier penalties for illegal mining come after the discovery of two of the largest “gray” mining farms to date in Irkutsk earlier in June. Law enforcement officials found and seized a total of more than 4,700 mining devices operating at two separate sites in the Siberian Oblast, which has banned mining in its southern half.

2025-06-12T13:17:38,"Bitcoin Bulls Defend $100K as US-China Trade Deal Adds Pressure","Bitcoin is under renewed pressure as markets respond to the latest developments in the US-China trade deal. The proposed tariffs—now reportedly at 55%—are raising concerns among traders and economists, putting Bitcoin’s stability under the microscope just as it consolidates below all-time highs. Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, suggests that these geopolitical tensions may be more influential on Bitcoin’s short-term price than recent macroeconomic data, such as the CPI inflation report. Tariffs Seen as Major Economic Headwind “Despite having a relatively positive economic report, and news that we almost have a trade deal with China, TradFi and Crypto Markets were slightly down on Wednesday,” Alan wrote on X. He pointed to the sudden jump in tariffs from 30% to 55% as a likely driver of uncertainty. “55% is going to be felt throughout every aspect of the U.S. economy and it isn’t going to feel good,” he added. Liquidity Data Offers Some Optimism Despite the pressure, Alan remains cautiously optimistic. He reviewed order book data from Material Indicators’ proprietary FireCharts tool and found significant ask liquidity from $111,000 to $120,000. This data, paired with less bid liquidity below the current price, suggests bullish market structure remains intact. “TLDR: When in doubt, zoom out,” he advised, indicating that broader patterns are still favorable. Yearly Open Emerges as Key Support Level Alan identified the 2025 yearly open as a critical technical level for Bitcoin to maintain. “Support at the 2025 Yearly Open is my line in the sand,” he stated, implying that any move below this level would challenge bullish sentiment. Despite the lack of strong bids, he does not expect the market to sharply decline in the near term. “Support tests are healthy,” Alan said, showing confidence that the price structure will hold. $100,000 Psychological Level Remains Crucial Analysts across the market are now closely watching the $100,000 price level. This threshold has become a key psychological support, with potential long-term implications if it fails to hold. Alan, who has previously highlighted this level, reiterated its importance. “As I stated back in December when Bitcoin first started flirting with $100k, it will be important to see some consolidation above $100k with no wicks below to validate the R/S Flip,” he noted. Preparing for the Bear Market Ahead Beyond the current rally, analysts are considering how these support levels might serve Bitcoin in the next downtrend. Alan emphasized the role of $100,000 as a foundational level that could help structure future price floors during less bullish periods. “More importantly, this will build some structural support that could come into focus during the next bear market,” he said. Bitcoin at a Crossroads With the market digesting both macroeconomic data and trade-related uncertainty, Bitcoin’s future in the short term may hinge on its ability to hold $100,000. For now, bulls are defending that ground, with eyes on key liquidity zones and technical levels as the next chapter unfolds.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-bulls-defend-100k-as-us-china-trade-deal-adds-pressure/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today",cryptocompare

BTC was trading around $110,000 and rose to a peak of $110,350 but lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping to a low of $107,521 before rising to its current price of $107,792. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) also fell into bearish territory after crossing $2,800. Increased selling pressure saw the price slip to a low of $2,762 before moving to its current level. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 2%, while Solana (SOL) slipped below $160 and is currently trading at $159, down almost 4%.

Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. US Markets Rise After Positive Trade Talks, Favorable Inflation Data US markets rose on Wednesday after President Donald Trump claimed the US-China trade deal was almost done following two days of intense negotiations in London. Talks produced a tentative “framework deal,” easing tensions between the two global economies. However, the agreement still requires approval from Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tensions between the US and China escalated after talks in Geneva, with China cutting rare earth exports while the US targeted Chinese students linked to the Communist Party. While details of the deal are unclear, both sides claim good progress has been made. Economic data also hinted at a healthier economy, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 142 points while the Nasdaq Index rose 0.4%. Trump called the May Consumer Price Index numbers “great” and demanded a full percentage point rate cut, arguing it would reduce federal interest payments. “CPI just out. Great numbers! Fed should lower one full point. Would pay much less interest on debt coming due. So important!!!” The CPI rose 2.4% year-over-year in May, slightly below the predicted 2.5%. Meanwhile, Core CPI rose 2.8%. Monthly increases also registered marginal increases, with headline and core CP rising 0.1%, missing expectations. A rate cut weakens the US Dollar and lowers the yield on traditional assets, making risk assets like crypto more attractive. It also boosts market liquidity, driving more capital into digital assets. GENIUS Act Passes Crucial Test The GENIUS Act won a crucial vote 68-30 in the US Senate, paving the way for a final vote scheduled for next Monday. If passed, the bill will be the first national regulatory framework for stablecoins in the US. The act requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100% reserves, submit to annual audits if their market cap exceeds $50 billion, and adhere to rules for foreign issuers. The act could serve as a benchmark for stablecoin regulation in the US. Senate Majority Leader John Thune spoke favorably about the bill, adding that it will help bring crypto into the mainstream. “We want to bring cryptocurrency into the mainstream, and the GENIUS Act will help us do that.” However, not all lawmakers supported the bill. Senator Elizabeth Warren was highly critical of the bill and stated that it failed to address bipartisan amendments. She also warned of political risks linked to President Trump’s crypto dealings. Warren stated, “By passing the GENIUS Act, the Senate is not only about to bless this corruption, but to actively facilitate its expansion.” Industry leaders believe the bill could unlock institutional participation, with Yuval Rooz, CEO of blockchain firm Digital Asset, calling it a pivotal moment in crypto regulation. “The passage of the GENIUS Act marks a long-awaited shift from regulation by enforcement to regulation by clarity. It provides banks with a clear framework to confidently engage with stablecoins, unlocking stalled strategies by ensuring full reserves, regular audits, and substantive consumer protections.” Nigeria Issues Fresh Warning Against CBEX Exchange Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a fresh warning against the Crypto Bridge (CBEX) exchange. The exchange, also known as ST Technologies International Ltd, Smart Treasure, or Super Technology, has reportedly resumed operations despite lacking regulatory approval. According to the authorities, CBEX is soliciting payments from users looking to withdraw funds from the platform. The exchange is reportedly demanding $200 from users with balances exceeding $1,000, and $100 from accounts with lower balances. The SEC confirmed that CBEX and its associated entities are not registered to operate in the country. It also revealed enforcement actions had been initiated against the company and its promoters due to previous unapproved investment schemes. “The Nigerian public is accordingly advised to refrain from patronizing or transacting with CBEX or ST Technologies International Ltd (Smart Treasure or Super Technology) as they risk losing their funds.” Ukraine Mulls Crypto Asset Reserve Bill Ukrainian lawmakers have introduced a draft bill allowing the National Bank of Ukraine to include Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in the country’s reserves. The bill proposed amendments to the law on the National Bank of Ukraine to include crypto assets alongside gold and foreign currencies. The bill authorizes the Central Bank to acquire cryptocurrencies like BTC for the country’s reserves. Additionally, the bank will have full discretion over allocating portions of its reserves to crypto, how much to allocate, and when to do so. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses despite favorable Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, as the flagship cryptocurrency fell below $108,000. BTC is down nearly 1%, trading around $107,697. BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging past $110,000 on Monday. However, it lost momentum in subsequent sessions, slipping below $110,000 on Wednesday to settle at $108,687. While BTC is trading in the red, analysts believe the asset is entering a period of volatility before a short-term rally to $111,000, thanks to several macroeconomic factors. These factors include a potential breakthrough in US-China trade talks, and softer-than-expected inflation numbers, which could support a rally. Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, believes a possible agreement between the global economies could reduce market uncertainty and boost investor sentiment. However, he pointed out that the market could have already priced in a potential breakthrough, indicating a limited price impact. Kooner believes the most likely short-term effect will be increased volatility. The same applies to CPI numbers. According to Kooner, these developments suggest BTC could be preparing for a significant rally. “Core CPI up 0.1% m/m firms up rate cut bets, compresses real yields, and creates a vacuum above $111K for bitcoin. That move would likely be spot-driven, with ETF demand accelerating as the macro regime shifts toward easing.” Bitfinex analysts believe BTC could reach $111,000 despite heightened volatility and a substantial decline to below $108,000 this week. According to Kooner, soft inflation numbers could increase the likelihood of a rate cut, giving assets like BTC a boost. The Bitfinex analyst believes this could drive the price to $111,000 even though its upside depends on the performance of the S&P 500. “BTC’s tight correlation with the S&P 500 (30D r ~0.63) reveals its current role as a liquidity barometer rather than a volatility hedge. This correlation makes BTC highly sensitive to SPX range-bound conditions, and until the index breaks out, BTC’s upside remains constrained.” BTC started the previous week with a drop to $103,768 as selling pressure took hold. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and move to $105,902. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Bullish sentiment returned on Friday as the price rose almost 3% and settled at $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC remained positive over the weekend, rising .15% on Saturday and 0.20% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to surge past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at 110,253. Price action turned bearish on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at 108,687. The current session sees BTC down over 1%, trading around $107,483. If bearish sentiment persists, BTC could drop to $105,000. A bearish MACD suggests buyers have the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) teased a move past $2,900 on Wednesday but lost momentum after rising to an intraday high of $2,878 as its rally halted abruptly. ETH faces resistance at around $2,850 but briefly crossed this level after its futures open interest surged to an all-time high of 15.21 million ETH. Funding rates have also risen, indicating a growing risk appetite among ETH investors. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) accounted for most of the OI growth, with the Volatility Shares 2x Leveraged ETH ETF as the main catalyst behind the increase. The surge shows that institutional investors were behind the growing leverage demand. According to a K33 Research report, the ETH equivalent exposure of ETHU rose by 305,100 ETH, while the CME’s ETH OI rose by 295,250 ETH. The report concluded, “In other words, without VolatilityShares, CME's ETH OI would have declined by 9,850 ETH over the past two months. It is concerning to see one single entity cornering such a massive share of the market on CME, and it originates from a bunch of traders thirsting for leveraged long exposure in ETH.” ETH started the previous week positively, rising nearly 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and $2,600 to settle at $2,607. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday but recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $2,600 and move back to $2,607. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH plunged over 7%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $2,500 and settling at $2,415. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising almost 3% to $2,479. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose almost 2% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.57% to end the weekend at $2,511. ETH started the current week on a bullish note, rising nearly 7% to cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $2,680. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose over 5% to cross $2,800 and settle at $2,816. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,878 on Wednesday but lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.56% to slip below $2,800 and settle at $2,772. The current session sees the price marginally down, trading around $2,752. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) fell short of $170, losing momentum after reaching a high of $168 on Wednesday as markets turned bearish. SOL registered a substantial increase over the past few sessions after reports that US regulators are moving forward for spot SOL ETFs. The altcoin reclaimed $165 as selling pressure dried up, but turned bearish as volatility returned to the markets. SOL started the previous week in the red, registering a marginal decline to $165. It rose to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but lost momentum after reaching this level, ultimately dropping over 1% to $155. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.29% to $153. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as SOL plunged nearly 6%, slipping below $150 and settling at $144. SOL recovered on Friday, rising 2.47% and settling at $147. Source: TradingView The price remained in positive territory over the weekend, rising 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rose nearly 6%, crossing $160 and the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $161. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 2.44% to $165. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 2.48% to $161. SOL is down over 1% during the current session, trading at $159 after losing the $160 level. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) started the previous week positively, rising almost 1% to $0.196. It lost momentum on Tuesday after reaching an intraday high of $201 and fell 1.58% to $0.192. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell over 2% to $0.188. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as DOGE plunged nearly 9%, slipping below $0.180 and settling at $0.171. Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, DOGE rebounded on Friday, rising almost 5% to settle at $0.179. Source: TradingView DOGE continued to push higher on Saturday, rising almost 3% to reclaim $0.180 and settle at $0.184. However, it fell back on Sunday, dropping 0.49% to end the weekend in the red.

The current session sees DOGE down over 2%, trading around $0.189.
