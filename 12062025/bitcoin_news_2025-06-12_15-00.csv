2025-06-12T12:58:38,"Andrew Tate Lost Over $500K Trading Crypto: Now He’s Betting Big on Ethereum (ETH)","TL;DR Tate won only 27 out of 76 trades on Hyperliquid, which resulted in a substantial loss. A recently deleted post shows a painful streak of his. He is now long on Ethereum (ETH), which is currently yielding a paper profit of around $36,500. Not the Best Win Rate According to the analytics platform Lookonchain, Andrew Tate (a well-known social media figure and former professional kickboxer) has made a total of 76 trades, and 49 of those resulted in losses. In the aftermath, his win rate stands at around 35.5%, while his operations triggered financial damage of more than $580,000. Tate now has only one open position. He is long on Ethereum (ETH) with 25x leverage, and as of this writing, this brings him a profit of approximately $36,500 (at least on paper). The liquidation price of the position is set at $1,861, representing a 32% decline from ETH’s current price level of around $2,750. The popular X user Daniel revealed that Tate showed this exact trade (which has current profitability of 138%) “to promote his reflink.” However, the influencer apparently overlooked the fact that Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange where every wallet is traceable, which is how his other unsuccessful trades were exposed. Andrew Tate just showed his hyperliquid trade that was 138.5% profitable to promote his reflink. He apparently forgot that it was a DEX, so his wallet was quickly found and discovered that he was $600,000 in the red. Now he has deleted his post… No comments needed from me pic.twitter.com/yxkRyRypax — Daniel (@CCPool_Daniel) June 10, 2025 Daniel also unveiled that Tate later deleted that post. It is worth mentioning that the former kickboxer replied by saying: “I’ll make it all back with one trade. Watch this space.” Tate’s Previous Interaction With Crypto The popular influencer is no stranger to the world of crypto. Over the years, he has spoken out against the American dollar, instead backing bitcoin (BTC). In 2024, Tate also hopped on the meme coin bandwagon. He endorsed a token called DADDY, which, during its first days of trading, experienced a substantial price increase, with its market cap briefly exploding beyond $120 million. Currently, though, the asset is in a much worse condition. The valuation is down by around 90% since the all-time high registered in July 2024, whereas the capitalization now stands at a mere $22 million.

2025-06-12T12:51:35,"Bitcoin touches $110K as traders eye $107K pullback before ATH bid","As BTC traverses $107,686 , some analysts believe this pullback from the $110,000 zone is needed to shake off weak hands. Is the $107,000 Zone the Stepping Stone Towards New Historic Highs Given that Bitcoin recently came just a little shy of breaching its ATH after soaring past $110K, the apex cryptocurrency might be witnessing the calm before the storm as it seeks to scale new heights. Calling out this development , renowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated, “Bitcoin accelerated after the first breakout above $106,500 and we ran all the way towards $110,000. You can also see that the breakout above $108,900 accelerated price action (in this case to $110,500). The first period of consolidation typically lasts a few days.Then, we're going to have the next breakout above the ATH. Ideal zone to buy? I would estimate around $107,000-$ 108,000.” Therefore, the market analyst sees a buy-the-dip scenario playing out, which will be instrumental in enabling Bitcoin surpass its present ATH of $111, 814 set on May 22 this year. Market analyst Crypto King is also of a similar opinion that Bitcoin’s all-time high target is just a stone’s throw away because there are no signs of overheating. Source: Crypto King This is because on-chain data indicate no significant profit-taking from major holders since whales are most probably waiting for higher price levels. Crypto King added that with strong holder conviction, Bitcoin still had room to grow and soar to a new ATH this cycle. Therefore, time will tell whether the present BTC pullback will ignite the fire needed to set a fresh historic high price above $112K. How Institutional Capital, ETFs, and Corporate Treasuries Are Driving Sustained Bitcoin Buying Pressure In recent years, Bitcoin has evolved from a niche digital asset into a major financial instrument, increasingly influenced by institutional players. Three key forces—institutional capital, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and corporate treasuries—are now generating sustained buying pressure on Bitcoin, reshaping its market dynamics. Institutional Capital: From Skepticism to Strategic Allocation Institutional investors, including hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers, have shifted from skepticism to strategic Bitcoin allocation. This shift is driven by inflation concerns, diversification needs, and the growing legitimacy of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Institutions bring massive capital inflows and a long-term investment horizon. Unlike retail investors who may react to short-term volatility, institutions tend to hold their positions, reducing sell-side pressure and supporting steady price appreciation. ETFs: Making Bitcoin Accessible The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets like the U.S. has further boosted buying activity. ETFs allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning or managing the underlying asset. These financial products simplify access and align Bitcoin investment with traditional financial systems. Every dollar that flows into a spot ETF represents a direct purchase of Bitcoin, thereby creating constant upward demand. As ETF inflows grow, particularly from retirement accounts and institutional portfolios, this demand becomes a structurally persistent force in the market. Corporate Treasuries: Strategic Reserves in Bitcoin Corporations are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. High-profile examples like MicroStrategy and Tesla have paved the way, citing concerns over fiat devaluation and the search for yield in a low-interest environment. For instance, MicroStrategy recently increased its Bitcoin portfolio to 582,000 BTC . When corporations allocate a portion of their treasury into Bitcoin, they effectively remove that supply from circulation for the long term. This trend reduces the available float of Bitcoin, tightening supply and magnifying buying pressure, especially in a market with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. South Korean entertainment giant K Wave Media recently revealed plans to roll out a $500 million Bitcoin treasury investment. Conclusion The convergence of institutional capital, ETFs, and corporate treasury adoption is transforming Bitcoin’s demand profile. These players bring scale, credibility, and long-term commitment, making buying pressure more resilient and less speculative. As these trends deepen, Bitcoin's price dynamics are likely to become increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors and institutional strategies—marking a new era of maturity and sustained demand in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, as Bitcoin witnesses a pullback at the $107K level, the crypto community continues to wait with bated breath whether a fresh ATH is on the horizon.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9548/bitcoin-touches-110-k-as-traders-eye-107-k-pullback-before-ath-bid,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T12:50:17,"Bitcoin Institutional Adoption: Massive Shift Sees Nearly One-Third of Supply Centralized","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Institutional Adoption: Massive Shift Sees Nearly One-Third of Supply Centralized Are you tracking the big money moves in the crypto space? A recent deep dive into the world of Bitcoin holdings has revealed a truly significant trend that could redefine the market’s future. The data points to a massive shift: nearly one-third of the entire Bitcoin supply is now held by centralized institutions. Understanding the Shift in Bitcoin Supply Distribution Recent research by Gemini and Glassnode highlights a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s journey. Their findings indicate that approximately 30.9% of the circulating Bitcoin (BTC) supply is currently held in centralized treasuries. To put that into perspective, we’re talking about roughly 6.1 million BTC, valued at an astounding $668 billion at recent prices. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a staggering 924% increase over the past decade alone. This dramatic growth in Centralized Bitcoin holdings signifies a fundamental structural shift in who owns and controls a substantial portion of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin was born from a decentralized ethos, its increasing value and legitimacy are attracting major players from the traditional financial world. Who Are These Centralized Bitcoin Holders? When we talk about ‘centralized treasuries’ holding Bitcoin, who exactly are we referring to? The research points primarily to several key categories: Governments: Various nations have seized or acquired significant amounts of Bitcoin, often from criminal activities or through strategic purchases. Public Companies: A growing number of publicly traded companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset, following the lead of pioneers like MicroStrategy. Bitcoin ETFs and Investment Products: The launch and success of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, have created massive pools of institutionally managed Bitcoin. Centralized Exchanges: While exchanges hold Bitcoin on behalf of many users (including retail), the aggregate amount held on these platforms is often categorized as centralized holdings in such analyses, even if the beneficial owners are diverse. It’s crucial to note that while exchanges hold a large amount, a significant portion of this still belongs to individual retail investors. However, the trend of governments, public companies, and investment vehicles directly holding large, single-entity stashes is undeniable and forms the core of the increase in Centralized Bitcoin holdings. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Investors Entering the Market? The motivations behind this influx of Institutional Bitcoin investors are multifaceted. For many, Bitcoin is no longer viewed solely as a speculative digital curiosity but as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Here are some driving factors: Store of Value: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature appeal to institutions looking for assets outside the traditional fiat system. Digital Gold Narrative: It’s increasingly seen as a digital equivalent to gold, offering a potential safe haven asset in a digital age. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a portfolio can offer diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets (though this correlation can change). Growth Potential: Despite volatility, institutions recognize the long-term growth potential of a nascent asset class gaining global acceptance. Client Demand: For asset managers and financial advisors, there is increasing demand from their clients (both individual high-net-worth and institutional) for exposure to digital assets. This strategic shift by Institutional Bitcoin investors is a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s growing place in the global financial landscape. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Market Maturity? The significant increase in institutional holdings has profound implications for Bitcoin market maturity. As larger, more strategic players enter the space, several changes are likely to occur: Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Institutional holders often have longer time horizons and are less likely to panic sell based on short-term price swings compared to some retail traders. This can contribute to more stable market behavior over time. Increased Liquidity: While institutions holding long-term might reduce the *available* circulating supply for trading, their involvement often brings deeper liquidity pools and more robust trading infrastructure. Greater Legitimacy: Institutional adoption lends credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class, encouraging further regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance. Development of Financial Products: The demand from institutions drives the creation of sophisticated financial products and services around Bitcoin, further integrating it into the traditional financial system. The report suggests that Bitcoin is indeed entering a new phase characterized by this enhanced Bitcoin market maturity, moving beyond being purely a speculative tool towards becoming a recognized strategic asset. Comparing Institutional vs. Retail Holdings While institutional holdings are surging, it’s important not to overlook the vast number of retail investors who still hold a significant portion of the remaining supply. However, the concentration of wealth differs dramatically. Consider this simplified comparison: Characteristic Institutional Holders Retail Holders Holding Size Very Large (often thousands or millions of BTC) Small to Moderate (typically fractions or a few BTC) Motivation Strategic Treasury Reserve, Long-Term Investment, Diversification, Client Funds Speculation, Store of Value, Personal Investment, Early Adoption Time Horizon Long-Term (years) Mixed (short-term trading to long-term holding) Market Impact Potential for significant price moves with large trades, adds stability with long-term holding Cumulative impact from many small trades, often more reactive to news/volatility This comparison highlights how the increasing influence of institutional players is fundamentally altering the market dynamics and contributing to the observed Bitcoin market maturity. Challenges and Considerations of Centralized Holdings While Bitcoin institutional adoption brings many positives, the concentration of a significant portion of the Bitcoin supply distribution in centralized entities also raises important questions and potential challenges: Centralization Risk: While Bitcoin itself is decentralized, having large amounts controlled by a few entities introduces points of potential centralization regarding market influence. Single Points of Failure: Large institutional custodians could become targets for hackers or regulatory actions. Market Manipulation Concerns: Large holders could potentially coordinate actions to influence market prices, although the size and liquidity of the Bitcoin market make this increasingly difficult. Regulatory Pressure: Governments and regulators may exert pressure on large, identifiable holders, potentially impacting market access or trading rules. Understanding these aspects of Centralized Bitcoin holdings is crucial for a balanced view of the market’s evolution. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption? The trend suggests that Bitcoin institutional adoption is likely to continue. As more traditional investors gain access through regulated products like ETFs, and as more corporations consider Bitcoin for their balance sheets, the percentage of supply held by centralized entities could grow further. This ongoing shift in Bitcoin supply distribution will likely continue to shape market behavior, potentially leading to lower volatility over the long term, greater integration with traditional finance, and increased scrutiny from regulators. Actionable Insights for Investors For individual investors, this trend offers several takeaways: Acknowledge the Shift: Understand that the market is evolving. Institutional players are now a significant force. Focus on Long-Term Trends: The increasing institutional presence reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value rather than just a short-term trading instrument. Stay Informed: Keep track of institutional announcements, ETF flows, and regulatory developments, as these will increasingly impact the market. Consider Your Strategy: Re-evaluate your own investment strategy in light of these changes. Are you aligned with the long-term trends driven by institutional interest? The rise of Institutional Bitcoin investors is not just a statistic; it’s a signal of a maturing market and changing dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin The research revealing that nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s supply is held by centralized institutions marks a monumental milestone. It underscores the rapid pace of Bitcoin institutional adoption over the past decade and signals a fundamental transformation in the asset’s ownership structure. This concentration of Centralized Bitcoin holdings by governments, corporations, and investment vehicles points towards a future where Bitcoin is increasingly integrated into the traditional financial system, potentially leading to greater Bitcoin market maturity and stability. While challenges related to centralization and regulatory oversight remain, the trend is clear: Bitcoin is no longer solely the domain of early adopters and retail enthusiasts. Institutional Bitcoin investors are here, and their growing presence is reshaping the landscape of digital assets, heralding a new era for Bitcoin.

This happned as the crypto market turned red as trade fears made a comeback. This fall mainly arrived due to Donald Trump’s newly confirmed unilateral tariffs, which will be imposed within two weeks. In the due time, he plans to send final tariff offers to top trade partners. This bearish market mover news came right after the U.S. – China that handshaked in London which saw modest progress. Where the said, key agreements include access to rare earth minerals and Chinese student access to U.S. universities. Such developments reduce geopolitical stress and it is typically good news for risk assets like XRP and others like BTC and ETH. However, the optimis in short-term fell short, due to Trump’s pessiistic play for the crypto sector. Cooling Inflation, But XRP Price Drops Meanwhile, U.S. CPI for May cooled to 2.4% YoY, below the 2.5% forecast. This strengthens hopes the Fed might pause interest rate hikes. It is an long-term positive update for entire top crypto and altcoin’s like XRP. On the blockchain front, XRP Ledger now supports tokenized U.S. Treasuries via Ondo Finance . Similarly, the speculation about future ETF listings also adds long-term appeal to XRP price. Despite this positive developments, XRP price suffered 4% to $2.23. As the token mirrored broader crypto losses amid renewed market caution. Ripple vs. SEC: Eyes on June 16 Apart from these broader updates, the one that is most crucial is XRP’s internal lawsuit issues. On this issue, the XRP holders are focused keenly on date June 16, which is a key procedural date in Ripple’s ongoing legal case. Earlier, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claimed the case was nearly resolved. However, Judge Torres rejected a motion from both parties due to filing errors under Rule 60. 4 Days to Go: SEC vs Ripple The Ripple vs. SEC case could finally end on June 16.

On the other hand, positive signals from court might lift short-term sentiment. Moreover, currently, XRP price shows a 0.91 correlation with Bitcoin. This means XRP tends to track Bitcoin’s moves closely, and could wait for BTC to push beyond $112K, before XRP price makes an big leap. Recently, in short-term, it faced rejection at $2.33.

2025-06-12T12:48:07,"Bitcoin nears all-time highs, but Google search interest is near a 5-year low. Why?","Bitcoin has dominated headlines for years, smashing price records and cementing itself as a leading global asset. Yet barely anyone seems to be Googling it anymore. According to recent Google Trends data, global search interest for “Bitcoin” ( BTC ) has dropped to its lowest point in five years, even as the asset trades at an impressive $107,000, just shy of its all-time high. Historically, big price surges in Bitcoin have gone hand-in-hand with public curiosity, especially during headline-making rallies. But this time around, the internet seems unusually quiet, and there may be several reasons for it. Google Trends chart showing declining search interest for Bitcoin | Google For one, the crypto market and broader industry have matured. Bitcoin is no longer a mystery or the hyped trend it was critiqued by the public to be years ago. After over a decade of making headlines, media coverage, and numerous bull runs, the crypto market giant has proven itself, and most people now know what it is. Additionally, unlike previous bull runs driven heavily by retail excitement, BTC’s rally today is shaped by stronger forces. Institutional interest is growing, alongside other factors including exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), corporate reserves, and government adoption across nations like the United States and El Salvador . This shows that investor base has broadened, making current rallies more grounded than frenzy-driven. You might also like: $30 to $1M: How this Bitcoin investor turned spare change into seven figures Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently noted on X that the low search interest may simply reflect this shift, adding that Bitcoin is now being quietly accumulated by institutions and corporates more than retail investors.

The crypto market is becoming increasingly saturated, and memecoins, AI tokens, and other fast trends may be dominating social feeds and soaking up the spotlight, even as Bitcoin maintains its dominance. Fewer searches do not necessarily mean less significance. In fact, the silent rally is likely a healthy sign suggesting that BTC is becoming a normalized, long-term asset class rather than just a trend. Meanwhile, institutional support for the crypto market giant is stronger than ever. Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood expects BTC’s value to multiply 15x in the next five years, and corporate heavyweights like Strategy and Metaplanet continue to accumulate the asset aggressively.

Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and ETHE funds also saw positive inflows, while Bitwise’s BITW fund also joined the list. Interest in ETH ETFs Increases on DeFi and Regulation Signals The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) greenlight of potential exemptions for DeFi has driven investor interest in Ethereum, according to Nick Ruck, Director of Research at LVRG. “While Bitcoin is breaking records and altcoins saw all-time highs last year, investors now believe Ethereum is still undervalued,” he said. SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, speaking at the agency’s recent Crypto Task Force meeting, emphasized the need to protect personal property in the digital environment and made statements in favor of DeFi. These statements, along with stablecoin regulations and private sector developments, have strengthened interest in Ethereum. Ethereum Derivatives Trading Surpasses Bitcoin Ethereum’s derivatives trading volume has surpassed $106 billion, surpassing Bitcoin’s $80.5 billion volume on the same day, according to Coinglass data, reflecting the growing interest of institutional investors in the ETH ecosystem. The ETH price rose above $2,800 on Wednesday, reaching its highest level since February, but is down 0.34% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,769.

Tether Investments is aiming to diversify the assets that back its stablecoin USDT, the world's largest such token with a market capitalization of $155 billion, expanding into tangible assets and precious metals, according to an announcement on Tuesday . Tether acquired 78,421,780 common shares in Elemental from La Mancha Investments, a Luxembourg-based mining investment firm. Elemental's Toronto-listed shares spiked nearly 23% to 1.77 Canadian dollars ($1.30) following the announcement. They closed at 1.53 Canadian dollars on Wednesday, 6.25% higher than before Tether's investment. At press time, Tether's stake is worth nearly $88 million. CEO Paolo Ardoino said the investment, which saw Tether take a stake of around 33.7% stake in Elemental, reflects its ""confidence in the fundamentals of gold and its critical role in financial markets."" ""Elemental's royalty model provides diversified exposure to gold production around the world, aligning strategically with our vision for Tether Gold and future commodity-backed digital asset infrastructure,"" he added. Tether referred to increasing its exposure to gold as a ""dual pillar strategy"", alongside its holdings of over 100,000 BTC ($10.7 billion). With regulation of stablecoins on the horizon in the U.S., issuers such as Tether are preparing for requirements to be compliant when it comes to the assets that back their tokens.

Elemental is a gold mining firm listed in Canada. According to a recent press release , the investment arm of the stablecoin issuer acquired a substantial amount of Elemental Altus Royalties shares from La Mancha Investment. The agreement signed on June 10 revealed that the firm has acquired a total of 78.4 million shares belonging to the Canadian-based company. The investment is meant to expand on the firm’s real-world holdings, expanding on its gold-backed digital asset XAUT ( XAUT ). Elemental Altus Royalties offers Tether ( USDT ) exposure to global gold production through a royalty and streaming model that reduces the direct operational risk that comes with mining. “This model aligns with Tether’s preference for strategic, low-risk exposure to real-world assets,” wrote the company. In addition, the investment firm signed an option agreement on the same day with AlphaStream Limited and its subsidiary, Alpha 1 SPV Limited. The private agreement gives Tether the ability to purchase an additional 34,444,580 shares after October 29, unless Elemental grants permission to redeem them earlier.

Inflation is 2.4% (up 0.1%), which is below the predicted rate of 2.5%. Again, the U.S. officials are calling for interstate rates to be cut. How realistic is that call, and will crypto charts respond to May’s CPI? Table of Contents New data Trump-Powell standoff and tariffs Meaning for the crypto market New data The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a May CPI rate of 2.4%, 0.1 percentage points down from April’s 0.2% inflation growth. It reveals that inflation continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace. It is the lowest yearly growth since February 2021. Economists had predicted a 0.2% increase, so the CPI news was generally met as a “no inflation” signal. 📈 It's CPI day!

ECAN US BEC pic.twitter.com/wsyeknMMjc — Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) June 11, 2025 The core basis, which doesn’t factor in volatile prices for food and energy, is in line with April’s 2.8%. Trump-Powell standoff and tariffs Tariffs deployed and then frozen for 90 days by Donald Trump have been seen as a factor that would drive the inflation rate up. However, the inflation turned out to be mild. The Federal Reserve’s Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have repeatedly said that the Fed is not in a hurry to cut rates and will rather monitor the situation to decide if action is required. Trump is publicly pressuring Powell, calling him names and referencing the recent European Central Bank rate cuts as a sign of Powell’s supposed error. On social media, Trump supporters allege that Trump will fire Powell. However, it is unlikely to happen, as the Fed is an independent agency with its own agenda, and the President of the United States has no power to fire the Fed chair. The U.S. Treasury head, Scott Bessent, is named as a possible successor to Powell. While keeping inflation in check is the Fed’s job, Bessent stated that the inflation is low “due to Trump.” Read more: The quiet campaign to make Scott Bessent the next Fed Chair — why crypto markets should care The primary objectives of the Fed are to keep inflation and unemployment rates in check. The agency does not have much leverage to influence these processes: it may cut or increase interest rates or print money. Following the COVID-19-induced inflation spike, the Fed is working diligently to return the U.S. inflation rate to its pre-COVID level of 2% or below. Generally, the Fed has been doing its job well. It raised interest rates in 2023 and managed to bring inflation from over 7% rate to 2.3% in April of 2025. TRUMP: FED SHOULD LOWER ONE FULL POINT — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) June 11, 2025 Trump is repeating that decreasing inflation is a good reason to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, as it would weaken the USD, encouraging foreign countries to buy U.S. goods even amid a tariff spike. From the Fed’s standpoint, inflation remains above the level the agency aims to achieve, while tariffs are a factor that makes the Fed even more cautious, as it doesn’t want to undo all the progress made in the last five years. It’s especially notable that calling the Fed for interest cuts now, when inflation is up, not down, contradicts what the Fed stands for. Therefore, had the Fed cut the rates now, it would have been inconsistent given the Fed’s previous actions. Thus, rate cuts are unlikely. Furthermore, some believe that tariffs will eventually lead to increased inflation. Inflation is showing a significant improvement due to the risk of recession. The only thing that has kept consumer demand high is the expectation of higher prices due to tariffs. People are buying goods in advance. Once the tariffs hit imported goods in August, prices will… — Simplified Engineer (@inqtelx) June 11, 2025 Meaning for the crypto market Bitcoin has established itself as a hedge against inflation. This time around, the CPI signal is ambiguous. If we look closely at how different people react to it, we may see the full spectrum. While some view the inflation spike and fear stronger spikes as the tariffs take effect (when the 90-day pause ends), others celebrate the “low” or even “no” inflation, as it turned out to be below expectations. Given the lack of unity in the reaction to the news and the overall uncertainty, the new CPI data will likely have a minimal impact on the crypto market. One possibility, however, is that the Fed may start printing money if it decides that interest rates are too high, even though it’s still early to cut them. If it happens, investors will flock to Bitcoin and gold. The money-printer-goes-brrr situation is not impossible. In April 2025, Fed official Neel Kashkari admitted that the agency has the tools to impact the state of the economy, and many believed he was referring to printing more fiat money.

A lot. Every day. Indeed, BlackRock has been buying Ethereum every single day for more than two weeks straight, and they don’t seem to be slowing down. According to fresh data from Arkham Intelligence (June 11), BlackRock has scooped up a total of $570 million worth of ETH over the past two weeks. The buying spree is notable not just for its size, but for its consistency: BlackRock has purchased Ethereum daily for over two weeks, a pattern rarely seen from a player of this size. BlackRock ETH buys. Source: Arkham At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,733, and BlackRock now holds around 1.487 million ETH, currently valued at $4.06 billion. While this is still smaller than its massive Bitcoin position — BlackRock holds 662,871 BTC, worth roughly $70.98 billion, the pace of its ETH accumulation is turning heads. BlackRock ETH and BTC holdings. Source: Arkham BlackRock is buying up ETH So why is BlackRock doubling down on Ethereum right now? The timing is key. Ethereum has been gaining institutional traction amid the push for an ETH ETF approval and growing interest in staking and tokenization use cases. Meanwhile, ETH’s role in powering the next wave of decentralized finance is strengthening. For some, this signals a broader shift in how large institutions view the crypto landscape. Bitcoin remains the flagship, but Ethereum’s versatility, powering smart contracts, DeFi, and tokenized assets is making it an increasingly attractive long-term bet. As the market watches for the next big catalyst, all eyes will be on whether BlackRock continues this aggressive ETH accumulation streak in the weeks ahead.

In a candid conversation with Dr. Jordan B. Peterson on June 9, Saylor described the financial climate during COVID-19 not as a health crisis alone but as a “war on currency” that threatened to wipe out decades of wealth preservation. “It wasn’t the war on Covid, it was the war on currency,” Saylor said, recalling the massive economic disruption caused by lockdowns and central bank money printing. He said he saw Main Street businesses collapsing while Wall Street rebounded on stimulus-fueled market rallies. “We had hyperinflation in financial assets,” he noted, highlighting the growing disparity between working-class Americans and financial elites. From Panic to Pivot: Cash Becomes a Liability By mid-2020, Saylor said he faced a stark financial reality. MicroStrategy held $500 million in cash reserves, but near-zero interest rates rendered that capital “non-performing.” With inflation eroding purchasing power, Saylor likened his situation to choosing between “a fast death or a slow death.” Determined to protect his company’s value, he began searching for a new form of capital preservation. Traditional options like real estate and stocks had already surged in price due to the low-rate environment, and art lacked the liquidity and scalability he sought. “I need a liquid fungible asset which will store my economic energy for an indefinite period of time,” he explained. It was at this point that he began considering Bitcoin, initially with skepticism. He reached out to long-time friend Eric Weiss of Blockchain Investment Group, and then immersed himself in educational content—videos, books, and podcasts. Eventually, he came to view Bitcoin as the digital age’s version of gold : a decentralized, non-sovereign store of value. Strategy Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In August 2020, Strategy made its first Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 21,454 BTC for $250 million. That move marked the beginning of a bold strategy that would eventually make the firm the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . As of now, the company holds 582,000 BTC—valued at approximately $63 billion—according to data from the Saylor Tracker. Reflecting on the decision, Saylor underscored the urgency of preserving value in uncertain times. “It took me 30 years to accumulate the money,” he said. “Why should I give up 30 years of my life?” The post Michael Saylor Reflects on Pandemic-Era Decisions That Led to Bitcoin Pivot appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/michael-saylor-reflects-on-pandemic-era-decisions-that-led-to-bitcoin-pivot/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Michael Saylor|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T12:30:51,"Evertz Pharma’s Bold Bitcoin Bet: German Firm Adds Another 100 BTC","BitcoinWorld Evertz Pharma’s Bold Bitcoin Bet: German Firm Adds Another 100 BTC In a move that underscores the growing trend of companies integrating digital assets into their financial strategies, German cosmetics firm Evertz Pharma has once again demonstrated its commitment to Bitcoin. This latest action highlights a broader shift towards corporate Bitcoin adoption, a topic gaining significant traction in the financial world. Why is Evertz Pharma Increasing its BTC Holdings? According to reports, Evertz Pharma GmbH recently added an additional 100 BTC to its balance sheet during May. This purchase amounted to approximately $10.8 million at the time, signaling continued confidence in the cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. This isn’t Evertz Pharma’s first foray into Bitcoin; the company initially invested €2 million in BTC back in December 2020. Since then, they have consistently allocated a portion of their corporate profits towards acquiring more Bitcoin, building what is effectively a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Several factors typically motivate companies to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy : Inflation Hedge: Concerns about inflation eroding the value of traditional fiat currencies are a primary driver. Bitcoin, with its capped supply, is seen by some as a potential store of value. Potential Appreciation: Companies may view Bitcoin as an asset with significant long-term growth potential, aiming to generate returns beyond their core business operations. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify corporate reserves away from traditional holdings like cash and bonds. Forward-Thinking Stance: Embracing Bitcoin can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Understanding the Trend of Institutional Adoption Evertz Pharma’s repeated BTC purchase is not an isolated incident. It fits into a larger narrative of institutional adoption that has been unfolding over the past few years. While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example with its massive Bitcoin holdings, other public and private companies globally have also started allocating capital to Bitcoin. This trend signifies a maturing market where cryptocurrencies are increasingly being considered alongside traditional assets. This growing institutional adoption provides several potential benefits: Increased Legitimacy: Corporate holdings lend credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Greater Stability: Large, long-term holders can potentially reduce market volatility compared to short-term retail trading. Infrastructure Development: As more institutions get involved, the infrastructure around buying, selling, and securing Bitcoin improves. Comparing Evertz Pharma’s Approach to Others While companies like MicroStrategy have taken a highly aggressive stance, using debt to acquire vast amounts of BTC, Evertz Pharma appears to be taking a more measured approach, using corporate profits. This indicates different levels of risk appetite and strategic goals within the corporate Bitcoin movement. Tesla’s on-again, off-again relationship with Bitcoin also shows that the path to corporate adoption isn’t always linear and can be influenced by market conditions and strategic pivots. Evertz Pharma’s consistent allocation, starting modestly and adding over time, could be a model for other smaller or more conservative companies considering a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Their initial €2 million investment in late 2020 and subsequent purchases demonstrate a sustained belief in Bitcoin’s role within their long-term financial planning. What Does This Latest BTC Purchase Mean for the Market? Every significant BTC purchase by a known entity like Evertz Pharma adds to the demand side of the market. While 100 BTC may seem small compared to the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, cumulative corporate buying represents a steady flow of capital into the ecosystem. This consistent demand, especially from entities with long-term holding intentions, can contribute to Bitcoin’s price stability and upward potential over time. Furthermore, such announcements serve as examples for other companies that might be on the fence. They demonstrate that it is possible for businesses, even outside the traditional tech or finance sectors (like a cosmetics firm), to successfully implement a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits are compelling for companies pursuing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, there are also significant challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to potential short-term paper losses that could impact financial reporting and shareholder perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can pose risks. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting and Tax Treatment: The accounting and tax rules for holding cryptocurrencies can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may be skeptical or critical of a company allocating funds to a volatile and relatively new asset class. Companies like Evertz Pharma must navigate these challenges by developing clear policies, ensuring strong security protocols, and potentially educating their stakeholders about their Bitcoin treasury strategy . Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors For businesses considering their own corporate Bitcoin allocation, Evertz Pharma’s journey offers a case study. Starting with a manageable amount, using profits rather than debt, and consistently adding to the position over time appear to be key aspects of their approach. Due diligence on security, regulation, and accounting is paramount. For investors, Evertz Pharma’s continued BTC purchase is another signal of increasing demand from non-traditional players. It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is gaining acceptance beyond individual investors and crypto-native companies, potentially broadening its long-term appeal. Conclusion: Evertz Pharma Leads the Way for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Evertz Pharma’s latest acquisition of 100 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a reaffirmation of a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy initiated years ago. This move by a German cosmetics firm highlights the expanding reach of institutional adoption across diverse industries. While challenges remain, the decision by companies like Evertz Pharma to allocate significant capital through repeated BTC purchase events underscores a growing conviction in Bitcoin as a viable component of corporate finance in the 21st century. Their measured, profit-driven approach provides a valuable example for others looking to navigate the exciting, yet complex, world of corporate Bitcoin .

2025-06-12T12:30:10,"Dogecoin Volume Remains Low Despite Price Rebound, What’s Going On?","The Dogecoin price has been on the rebound, with Bitcoin barreling toward its all-time high levels once again. The break of $110,000 triggered an altcoin run after the Ethereum price moved 10% in a single day, and by extension, Dogecoin also followed with a more than 5% rebound already. However, the meme coin’s volume has not risen as high as expected, and this could suggest low market participation from investors during this time. Dogecoin Volume Still Muted Despite the rebound toward $0.2, the Dogecoin volume has not seen a notable jump during this time. In fact, the volume remains well below levels seen back in May and continues to trend at levels recorded during the market decline. This could mean that Dogecoin is merely following the market direction and not necessarily being driven by factors of its own. According to data from Coinglass, the daily Dogecoin trading volume remains below $5 billion. This is low compared to the levels that the DOGE trading volume has risen to, especially during times of rapid recovery. For context, back in February, the Dogecoin daily trading volume had risen above the $10 billion mark as the market struggled. Then, back in May 2025, the meme coin had crossed the $10 billion mark once again when the market had recovered and DOGE pushed above $0.25. However, so far in the month of June, the Dogecoin trading volume is yet to cross the $10 billion mark, even after almost two weeks into the month. The highest daily volume recorded so far for the month is $5.89 billion on June 6, driven by shorters as the market tanked. Open Interest Show No Notable Moves In the same vein as the DOGE daily trading volume, the Dogecoin open interest has not recorded any notable movements during this time. Since the start of the month, open interest in the meme coin has remained rather steady, averaging around $2 billion on a daily basis. This suggests that crypto traders are not making any moves and opening more positions at the same time. It also points to the fact that investors are waiting to see what the market does before making their moves. As of June 11, the Dogecoin open interest was sitting at $2.11 billion, a decline from the $2.5 billion average recorded toward the end of May.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-volume-remains-low/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T12:24:46,"Strategy's Michael Saylor ran to Bitcoin after COVID lockdowns and stimulus threatened $500M reserves","Michael Saylor moved MicroStrategy, now called Strategy, into Bitcoin in 2020 after the U.S. government shut down the economy and flooded it with cash. In an interview with psychologist Dr. Jordan B. Peterson on Wednesday, he explained that the COVID lockdowns, combined with zero interest rates, made holding cash a financial risk. “We had $500 million. We couldn’t keep it in dollars. It wasn’t safe,” Saylor said. He called that year “a war on currency.” Saylor blamed the lockdowns for killing small businesses and putting regular workers out of jobs, while Wall Street made record profits. He said the system was broken and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive money printing only made it worse. By the summer of 2020, the stock market was booming, not because of real growth, but because of excess money pumped in. And none of that helped him earn interest on the company’s massive cash reserves, which just sat there doing nothing. Bitcoin became Strategy’s new treasury plan Saylor said he needed a safe place to store value that wouldn’t erode under government pressure. He rejected traditional options like real estate, stocks, or fine art, saying they were either overpriced or too hard to manage. “You can’t put $500 million in a Monet,” he said. In 2018, he thought Bitcoin was garbage. By 2020, after months of research through YouTube videos, books, and podcasts—helped along by his friend Eric Weiss—he changed his mind. Bitcoin became the answer. “It’s harder than gold, easier to move, and doesn’t depend on banks or governments,” he said. In August 2020, MicroStrategy bought 21,454 Bitcoins for $250 million. He said this was the company’s first step in converting its treasury to crypto. As of now, Strategy owns 582,000 Bitcoins, which is worth roughly $63 billion. The holdings made Strategy the largest corporate Bitcoin owner, based on the public tracker that monitors the firm’s crypto activity. Saylor said his decision was strictly about protecting value. He said the old financial system had failed him, and Bitcoin offered independence. That move has turned Strategy into a model for other companies trying to escape inflation. Chanos attacks Strategy’s model, Saylor responds live on air But not everyone is buying it. Short seller Jimmy Chanos has been going after Strategy’s business structure for weeks, calling it misleading. Speaking to Bloomberg TV last week, Chanos said Strategy’s shares trade at too high a premium compared to the actual value of the Bitcoin it owns. “It’s a great opportunity to short the stock and just buy the Bitcoin directly,” he said. At one point, the premium between stock price and underlying value hit 200%. Chanos said that was the perfect setup for an arbitrage trade. He also criticized how Saylor values the company. “This is like saying a $500,000 house is worth $1.5 million because it appreciated $50,000 and you multiplied that by 20,” Chanos said. “It’s nonsense.” He also described Saylor as “a wonderful salesman” who convinced investors to overpay based on hype. In his view, Strategy should be judged purely on its Bitcoin holdings, not any story around it. Saylor pushed back during his own Bloomberg interview on Wednesday morning. “We’re the biggest issuer of Bitcoin-backed credit instruments in the world,” he said. He said Chanos doesn’t understand that Strategy isn’t a passive trust. “Trusts can’t issue preferred shares. They can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can.” Saylor said Strategy actively uses its Bitcoin, unlike closed-end trusts, which simply sit on assets. Chanos responded that: “These are perpetual. They’re not redeemable. If he doesn’t pay dividends, they’re not cumulative. Who the hell would buy that?” Chanos said he entered his short position when the premium was around 2.2 to 2.3 times and said it should be closer to 1. As of now, it’s around 1.8. He said if it ever drops below 1, “I will have covered my shorts.” Saylor said that if the premium ever falls enough, Strategy plans to buy back shares. But he repeated his main point: Strategy is not a holding company. It operates. It issues instruments. It builds with Bitcoin. “We are not a closed-end trust. Trusts can’t leverage Bitcoin, they can’t issue preferred shares, they can’t issue permanent shares at a premium. We can,” he said. That’s his defense, and for now, he’s not backing off. Perhaps Chanos should’ve thought of that before opening those short positions. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-06-12T12:14:44,"Binance CEO Richard Teng Declares: Institutions Are Going All-In on Crypto","The post Binance CEO Richard Teng Declares: Institutions Are Going All-In on Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Binance CEO Richard Teng just dropped an update on Wall Street. In an X post , Teng declared the next decade won’t be about crypto hype but its deep integration into global finance. Forget the old “should we invest?” Institutions are now focused on how to make crypto a cornerstone of their strategies. Here’s why this shift is massive and what it means for the future. Institutions Are All In Teng points to real changes that are underway. Heavyweights like Moody’s and Alphaledger just pulled off a historic trial, tokenizing municipal bonds on the Solana blockchain with embedded credit ratings. This is the first time that tokenized debt on a public chain is being experimented with by a leading ratings agency. In the meantime, Vivek Ramaswamy co-founded Strive Asset Management, funded an incredible $750 million to buy distressed Bitcoin-linked debt, including claims from Mt. Gox. These aren’t small bets; they scream confidence in crypto as a legit, long-term asset class. Crypto Winter? It Might Be Over The long crypto winters we’ve seen in the past might be behind us. Michael Saylor—known for his massive Bitcoin investments – recently said as much, pointing to growing government support and clearer regulation as signs the space is maturing. Teng seems to agree. And the numbers back it up: a new survey from Coinbase found that 83% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto holdings in 2025. This isn’t about guessing what might happen. It’s already happening, whether people notice it or not. The Financial World’s New Playbook The rules are being rewritten by this institutional push. Wall Street is embracing digital assets with tokenized bonds and Bitcoin debt arrangements. Teng’s point is very clear: the discussion of cryptocurrency has moved from skepticism to strategy. A decade of unheard-of development and legitimacy is ahead of us when blockchain and finance clash. The takeaway? Richard Teng’s statement highlights that crypto’s institutional wave is here, and it’s bringing opportunity like never before.

2025-06-12T12:11:08,"US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Talked About Cryptocurrencies!","While important developments continue to occur regarding Bitcoin (BTC) and the cryptocurrency market in the USA, important statements came from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent touched on stablecoins, which have been a subject of debate in recent months, in his statement to the Senate subcommittee. Bessent said dollar-backed stablecoins could reach a market value of $2 trillion or more. Emphasizing that stablecoins have the potential to expand the global use of the US dollar, Bessent noted that Congress is advancing legislation requiring stablecoins to be backed by high-quality assets such as US Treasury Bonds. Bessent stated that there have been many incidents throughout history where the status of the dollar has been questioned, but such fears have been proven unfounded as new dynamics have given the US dollar new momentum. “This administration is committed to preserving Bitcoin’s reserve currency status in America and advancing blockchain technology. Stablecoin legislation backed by U.S. Treasury Bonds or Treasury Notes would create a market through these stablecoins that would expand the use of the U.S. dollar around the world. “I think 2 trillion is a very, very reasonable number for the stablecoin market, and I can see it being much higher.” The US Treasury Secretary recently reiterated that the US government is seeking to solidify the dollar’s reserve currency status by supporting legislation that would further embed stablecoins into the financial system and include strict rules that would ensure they are fully backed by Treasury bonds and other short-term government debt. Meanwhile, great efforts are being made to pass the GENIUS bill, which is seen as cryptocurrency-friendly, in Congress. Related News: New Development in the US's Cryptocurrency-Friendly GENIUS Bill!

2025-06-12T12:04:41,"Ethereum Eyes $3K After $1.8B in Shorts Liquidated at 15-week High","Ethereum’s Open Interest Soars to All-Time High Ethereum’s futures open interest (OI) has surpassed $40 billion for the first time ever, signaling record-high leverage and heightened market speculation. Open interest refers to the total number of active contracts that haven’t been settled or closed. Therefore, a high open interest suggests that more investors are either speculating on Ethereum’s future price or hedging their spot holdings to manage risk. An all-time high (ATH) in OI often precedes significant price movement, as a build-up of leveraged positions can lead to short squeezes or long squeezes, depending on trader bias. It can also lead to liquidations, which amplify price swings. CoinGlass data reveals $2B in long positions set for liquidation at $2,600 and $1.8B in shorts at $2,900, creating a high-stakes tug-of-war. With liquidity clustered at both ends, market makers face a pivotal decision on which side to target next. Therefore, caution should not be thrown to the wind because Ethereum’s price can go either way. At the time of this writing, ETH was experiencing a pullback to trade at $2,770 per CoinGecko data . Ethereum is Attracting More Institutional Interest Than Bitcoin Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have drawn over $800 million in the past two weeks, which is more than double Bitcoin’s inflows of around $400 million, according to SoSoValue data. This can be linked to the fact that there’s growing speculation that ETH ETFs will soon incorporate staking—allowing investors to earn yield on ETH holdings without handling the technical side themselves. As a result, this staking optionality is drawing fresh capital into Ethereum compared to Bitcoin ETFs, which lack similar yield features. Jeff Mei, the COO at crypto exchange BTSE, opined, “Investors are finally recognizing the compelling investment opportunity that Ethereum presents. It’s still trading well below its all-time highs, while Bitcoin is already near its ATH levels.” He added that there is a high probability that Ethereum will reach or surpass its ATH by year’s end. ETH’s historic high price currently sits at $4,878 recorded in November 2021. Ethereum exchange supply hitting a 7-year low also paints a bullish picture, thanks to the intensified hodling taking place. DeFi’s Resurgence Propels Ethereum to New Heights as TVL Surpasses $65 Billion and Institutional Demand Surges Ethereum’s momentum in mid‑2025 is being turbocharged by a resurgence in DeFi activity, fueled by record demand, infrastructure upgrades, and institutional inflows. Ethereum now commands roughly $65.45 billion of DeFi’s global total value locked (TVL), according to DeFiLlama data. Innovations Lowering Friction Upgrades like Spectra, EIP‑4844 blobs, and the forthcoming Pectra upgrade are reducing fees and boosting scalability, enabling smoother DeFi operations. Additionally, emerging ZK‑rollup solutions are proving capable of processing more than 70 swaps per second—a dramatic improvement over Ethereum’s base rate of ~12 TPS. These developments enhance composability and user experience in borrowing, staking, and trading. Diversified Protocol Strength Ethereum’s DeFi suite has broadened in functionality: Lido leads liquid staking, helping depositors earn staking yields while keeping assets liquid for DeFi use. Aave dominates lending markets with its GHO stablecoin and cross‑chain lending pools. EigenLayer and EtherFi enable restaking, allowing users to earn extra yield while bolstering network security. Sky (MakerDAO’s evolution) now offers high‑yield stablecoins and vaults, growing TVL over 55% in recent months. Institutional Capital & Macro Tailwinds Ethereum’s deep liquidity and strong developer ecosystem are drawing institutional interest. Whales are shifting assets into self‑custody and DeFi vs. exchanges, increasing on‑chain demand . Broader macro trends—potential interest‑rate cuts and stablecoin growth—boost DeFi yield attractiveness compared to traditional fixed income. Network Effects Amidst Competition Ethereum remains the dominant platform, hosting over half of the global DeFi TVL. Although competitive ecosystems are growing (Solana up 800% Y/Y, newer chains like Aptos gaining traction), none match Ethereum’s composability, developer momentum, or market share. Conclusion Ethereum’s DeFi renaissance—rooted in record TVL, cross‑protocol innovation, on‑chain capital flow, and protocol upgrades—has created a positive feedback loop. As TVL rises, more builders are incentivized to innovate, attracting users and assets, reinforcing Ethereum’s network effects. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how Ethereum plays out in the short term because liquidity is clustered in both bullish and bearish sides, with the psychological price of $3,000 expected to be a turning point.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9546/ethereum-eyes-3-k-after-1-8-b-in-shorts-liquidated-at-15-week-high,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","News|Ethereum",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T12:03:38,"Bitcoin Sentiment Explodes While Bitcoin Hyper Soars: Best Presale in 2025 About to Take Off?","There’s much ado about Bitcoin these days. After notching a new all-time of $111.9K on May 22, 2025, $BTC has been trading back and forth below that mark, never falling below $100K. But usually holding sideways between $105K-$110K. But Bitcoin sentiment is beginning to build again. Will it lead to a new push for the market? If so, then the aptly-named Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale could gain the most as Bitcoin’s first Layer-2 implementing the Solana Virtual Machine. Long-Time HODLers Selling at $100K One reason for the recent selling pressure might be long-term Bitcoin hodlers finally choosing to sell. Early investors who bought Bitcoin when the price was a few thousand (Bitcoin was below $10K only a few years ago, on July 1, 2020) might be finally ready to cash out now that $BTC has gone 10x or more from their original investment. Is that a bad sign for Bitcoin investors? Not necessarily. A potential tightening of Bitcoin’s supply will likely offset the increased selling pressure. On-chain data supports that conclusion, as the amount of exchange-held Bitcoins has steadily fallen, even as Bitcoin’s price rises. In fact, only weakening demand may have kept $BTC’s price down so far. And that’s not likely to continue forever. Bitwise CEO: ‘No One Is Going To Sell’ Once Bitcoin Breaks Through Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley thinks that tightening supply will only worsen once Bitcoin breaks through $130K-$150K. At that point, the HODLers will return, diamond hands and everything. If he’s correct, then the issue of tightening supply will kick in harder than ever. And the first and perhaps only immutable law of economics – supply and demand – could supercharge Bitcoin’s price. Institutional investors being more bullish than ever also helps the narrative, even as retail investors go back-and-forth with Bitcoin. Take GameStop, which recently purchased 4.7K Bitcoin and plans to offer $1.75B of convertible notes to potentially fund more purchases. A recent Santiment report shows that Bitcoin positivity is returning in the community , with positive comments outweighing the negative by more than 2-1. Growing Bitcoin hype means at least one thing: $BTC-centric presales like Bitcoin Hyper could grow big – fast. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Unlock Fast, Cheap Bitcoin Transactions with First Bitcoin Layer 2 More than a store of value; with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin can finally be everything it was meant to be – the home of crypto payments, meme coins , dApps, and smart contracts. The technical framework for Bitcoin Hyper is straightforward; with the Bitcoin Relay Program, any $BTC deposited to a specific Bitcoin address can be minted on the Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2. That Layer 2 leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for better throughput and increased scalability, and sets $HYPER up to be one of the strongest crypto presales so far in 2025. The end result is a Zero-Knowledge (ZK) equipped Layer 2, trustless but fully synced to the Bitcoin Layer 1 blockchain. $HYPER, the native token for the Bitcoin Layer 2, provides a number of benefits for $HYPER chain users. Those benefits include: Low gas fees, paid in $HYPER Staking rewards, currently 647% APY Participation incentives Developer bounties Bitcoin Hyper’s presale rocketed out of the gate, passing $1M raised in a matter of days. Token currently cost $0.01185, with $1.13M raised so far. That price could reach $0.02595 by the end of 2025 (for a 118% increase), according to our price prediction . Buy into the $HYPER , and join a community of visionaries who want to transform Bitcoin’s position in the dApp industry. Bullish Outlook Means Growing Demand for Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper As $BTC supply tightens, demand will only increase. That should fuel a further increase for both $BTC and related projects, like a groundbreaking Bitcoin Layer 2. And if you consider $HYPER’s utility is all about making Bitcoin more prepared for the adoption ahead, the project’s potential in the market becomes beyond clear. Remember, always do your own research; this isn’t financial advice.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-sentiment-explodes-while-bitcoin-hyper-soars-best-presale-in-2025/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T12:01:12,"Japan to Press G7 on Coordinated Crypto Crackdown Targeting North Korea","Japan is preparing to urge G7 nations to launch a coordinated response against North Korea’s growing involvement in cryptocurrency theft, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expected to raise the issue at the upcoming summit in Canada from June 15 to 17. Key Takeaways: Japan will urge G7 nations to coordinate action against North Korean crypto thefts at the June summit. The push follows a $307M hack on DMM Bitcoin, linked to North Korea’s TraderTraitor group. If adopted, it would mark the G7’s first joint response to nation-state threats in the crypto sector. According to Japanese media reports , Ishiba will call for greater collaboration among member states to improve oversight of digital asset markets and restrict illicit financial flows tied to state-sponsored hacking groups. The goal is to address cybercrime that supports North Korea’s weapons programs and undermines international non-proliferation efforts. G7 May Take First Joint Action on North Korea Crypto Threats If adopted, the initiative would mark the first time the G7 formally discusses collective action on crypto-related threats linked to a nation-state. The Group of Seven includes Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the U.S., and the European Union. Japan’s renewed focus comes in the wake of a $307 million theft from DMM Bitcoin, one of the country’s largest exchanges. Investigators from Japan’s National Police Agency and the FBI have attributed the May 2023 breach to the North Korean hacking group TraderTraitor , also known as Jade Sleet and UNC4899. The hack reportedly began with a social engineering scheme, where a North Korean operative posing as a recruiter gained access to an employee at Ginco, a wallet software provider servicing DMM Bitcoin. The operative deployed a malicious Python script that infiltrated Ginco’s internal systems. This access was later used to manipulate a transaction request, enabling the theft of more than 4,500 BTC. Authorities traced the stolen funds to wallets operated by TraderTraitor, a group already under U.S. sanctions for its role in cyberattacks aimed at funding North Korea’s military ambitions. The DMM incident forced the exchange to suspend operations and drew renewed attention to the vulnerabilities in crypto infrastructure. North Korea Linked to Major Crypto Hacks North Korea has also been linked to several other major crypto heists, including those targeting Bybit , the Ronin Bridge , Harmony, and various DeFi platforms. Global law enforcement is responding. The U.S. Department of Justice recently moved to seize over $7.7 million in digital assets tied to North Korean IT workers embedded in blockchain firms. Meanwhile, the U.S. and South Korea signed a bilateral agreement in 2023 to enhance their technical capabilities in detecting and countering DPRK cyber operations. North Korean cyber strategies continue to evolve. In April, Lazarus-linked operatives reportedly set up U.S.-based shell companies to distribute malware to crypto developers. Kraken recently thwarted an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean posing as a job candidate.

The government has proposed a strategy to redirect up to 2,000 megawatts (MW) of surplus energy to crypto mining and AI data centers, turning financial losses into potential gains. This marks a major shift in how the country looks at energy and digital assets. Pakistan’s troubling financial state resembles its urgency to take Bitcoin seriously and to resolve its decade-long energy issues as well. 5️⃣ Energy Allocation for Mining ➺ Last month, Pakistan announced to allocate 2,000 MW of electricity to power bitcoin mining and AI data centres. ➺ This will help monetize surplus energy, while also boosting SBR and job creation. ➺ An overall win for the country and its… pic.twitter.com/YS2Dul2Ehf — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) June 5, 2025 Unused Power Becomes a Massive Drain The country currently has an installed electricity capacity of 46,600 MW, but nearly 14% of this remains idle for much of the year. During low-demand winter months, consumption can drop to just 12,000 MW. Despite not being used, many of these plants continue receiving capacity payments, which are fixed fees paid whether electricity is generated or not. Moreover, these payments have now reached around $7.4 billion a year, heavily burdening the national budget and increasing electricity costs for citizens. Rapid Solar Growth Creates New Challenges Pakistan has also seen a boom in solar energy. In 2024 alone, net-metered solar capacity surged from 1.3 GW to nearly 4.9 GW, driven by an influx of over 17 GW of low-cost Chinese solar panels. While solar energy is a cleaner alternative, it has brought new issues like grid instability and uneven cost distribution. Non-solar users now pay higher rates, and poorer households struggle to access affordable energy solutions. Bitcoin Mining Offers a Digital Lifeline To address this growing imbalance, the government has floated the idea of using idle power for Bitcoin mining . The proposal suggests that crypto mining could absorb excess electricity during off-peak times, reduce pressure on the grid, and generate digital revenue. This could help offset the huge losses from capacity payments and offer a new income stream for the state. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Can Pakistan’s Bitcoin Mining Move Impact BTC Price?

The success of the plan will depend on how it is managed and whether the benefits are shared fairly. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The plan aims to convert idle electricity capacity, which costs Pakistan $7.4 billion annually in payments, into revenue through Bitcoin mining. This could offset losses and utilize surplus power, potentially reducing energy costs and easing grid pressure, especially during off-peak hours. What environmental impacts could arise from using old coal plants for crypto mining? Using old, inefficient power plants, often coal-fired, for crypto mining could significantly increase air pollution and carbon emissions, counteracting global efforts to combat climate change and potentially creating local environmental concerns. Could this energy strategy set a precedent for other countries facing similar crises? Yes, if successful, Pakistan’s strategy could serve as a unique blueprint for other developing nations with surplus energy capacity or seasonal energy imbalances, demonstrating how digital asset generation might address economic and energy challenges.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/pakistan-turns-to-bitcoin-mining-to-solve-7-4-billion-energy-crisis/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","News|Mining",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T12:00:36,"Ethereum ETF Inflows Surge: US Spot ETH ETFs See Massive $240.7M Inflow","BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF Inflows Surge: US Spot ETH ETFs See Massive $240.7M Inflow Get ready for some exciting news from the world of crypto finance! US spot Ethereum ETFs are making serious waves, demonstrating growing investor appetite for digital assets. On June 11, these investment vehicles saw a significant boost, recording a massive $240.7 million in total net inflows. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the 18th consecutive trading day of net inflows and stands out as the largest single-day inflow observed over the past four months. This surge in US spot Ethereum ETFs activity is a clear indicator of shifting market dynamics and increasing confidence. What Exactly Are US Spot Ethereum ETFs? Before diving deeper into the recent numbers, let’s quickly touch upon what US spot Ethereum ETFs are. An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or, in this case, cryptocurrencies. A “spot” ETF means the fund directly holds the underlying asset – Ethereum (ETH) – rather than derivatives or futures contracts. Think of it this way: When you buy shares of a spot Ethereum ETF, you are essentially gaining exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without needing to buy and hold ETH yourself on a crypto exchange. The ETF provider handles the complexities of buying, storing, and securing the actual Ethereum. These ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through standard brokerage accounts. The approval and launch of ETH ETF products in the US have been highly anticipated events, following the successful rollout of Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier in the year. They offer a regulated and familiar investment pathway for individuals and institutions alike. The Surge in Ethereum ETF Inflows: Breaking Down the Numbers The $240.7 million figure for June 11 is truly noteworthy. It highlights a significant influx of capital into these nascent products. According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, this single day represented the peak inflow over the last four months, signaling strong momentum for Ethereum ETF inflows . Let’s look at how the major players stacked up on that particular day: ETF Provider Ticker Net Inflows (June 11) BlackRock ETHA $164.05 million Fidelity FETH $37.28 million Grayscale (Mini) ETH $19.61 million Grayscale ETHE $13.30 million Bitwise ETHW $6.46 million As you can see, BlackRock’s ETHA dominated the inflows, capturing the lion’s share. Fidelity and Grayscale’s products also saw substantial capital injections. The fact that this marks the 18th consecutive day of net inflows suggests a sustained positive trend rather than just a brief blip. Why Do These Ethereum ETF Inflows Matter for the Crypto Market? The consistent and significant Ethereum ETF inflows are a bullish signal for several reasons: Institutional Adoption: ETFs are often preferred by large institutional investors, financial advisors, and traditional fund managers who might face regulatory or logistical hurdles investing directly in crypto. Inflows indicate that this class of investors is starting to allocate capital to Ethereum via these regulated products. Increased Accessibility: ETFs make investing in Ethereum as easy as buying a stock, opening up the market to a much broader base of retail investors who may be hesitant to use crypto exchanges. Market Validation: The demand for these products validates Ethereum as a significant asset class in traditional finance circles. Potential Price Impact: While not a direct one-to-one relationship, sustained inflows mean that ETF providers are buying large amounts of actual ETH on the market to back the shares being purchased by investors. This consistent buying pressure can positively influence the Ethereum price . The performance of Crypto ETF products, particularly Bitcoin and now Ethereum, is increasingly seen as a key metric for tracking the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Considering Investing? What Are the Benefits and Challenges of ETH ETFs? For investors looking at gaining exposure to Ethereum, the ETH ETF route offers distinct advantages and disadvantages compared to buying ETH directly: Benefits: Simplicity and Familiarity: Trade through existing brokerage accounts. Regulatory Oversight: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection not always present with direct crypto investments. Custody Handled: No need to worry about setting up wallets, managing private keys, or securing your ETH yourself. Liquidity: ETFs trade on major exchanges, typically offering high liquidity. Challenges: Fees: ETFs charge management fees (expense ratios) which can eat into returns over time. Tracking Error: The ETF’s performance might not perfectly mirror the spot price of Ethereum due to fees, trading costs, and operational factors. Indirect Ownership: You own shares of a fund that owns ETH, not the ETH itself. This means you cannot stake your ETH or use it in DeFi applications. Market Hours: ETFs only trade during traditional market hours, unlike the 24/7 crypto market. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial when deciding the best approach for your investment goals and risk tolerance regarding the Ethereum price exposure. What’s Next for US Spot Ethereum ETFs? The recent positive inflow trend suggests strong initial demand following the initial regulatory hurdles. The approval process itself was a significant catalyst, and the subsequent inflows indicate that investors were ready to jump in once the products became available. Future performance will likely depend on several factors: Overall Crypto Market Sentiment: As with any crypto-related product, performance is heavily tied to the broader market’s health and sentiment. Regulatory Environment: Continued clarity and favorable regulations could encourage more traditional finance players to engage. Product Competition: As more providers launch their ETH ETFs, competition could lead to lower fees, benefiting investors. Ethereum’s Development: Updates and developments within the Ethereum network itself could impact investor confidence and demand for ETH-related products. The success seen in Bitcoin ETFs, which have accumulated tens of billions in assets, sets a potential precedent for the growth trajectory of US spot Ethereum ETFs . Conclusion: A Strong Signal for Ethereum’s Future The news of Ethereum ETF inflows reaching $240.7 million on June 11, marking the largest single-day inflow in four months and the 18th consecutive day of positive flows, is undeniably a powerful signal. It underscores growing institutional and retail interest in Ethereum as an asset class and highlights the impact of regulated investment products like the ETH ETF on bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. While the market remains volatile, the sustained demand reflected in these inflows provides a compelling narrative for the increasing acceptance and potential future growth of Ethereum within the global financial landscape. It’s a development that investors and market watchers will continue to monitor closely.

2025-06-12T11:51:28,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 12, 2025","After two days of rising prices, the crypto market is down today. Nearly all top 100 coins have recorded decreases over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 4% to $3.51 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $132 billion. TL;DR: The market turns red today, most top 100 coins are down; BTC dropped to the $107,500 level, ETH is at $2,749; Ethereum’s bounce-back signals more than just price action; Volatility expectations are increasing; US spot ETH ETFs outperform their BTC counterparts: $240.29 million vs $164.57 million; Markets are digesting the news of the US-China trade agreement and the US inflation report; The dip may be a short-term development, but the market is at a crossroads. Crypto Winners & Losers In complete contrast to yesterday’s situation, all top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 1.7%, dropping from the $109,500 level to the current price of $107,563. Ethereum (ETH) is close by, decreasing by 1.6% to the price of $2,749. While Dogecoin (DOGE) was the highest gainer yesterday, it saw the highest drop in this category today: 6.2% to $0.1898. Moreover, most of the top 100 coins are down today. Only four are up, with SPX6900 (SPX) recording the highest increase of 8.1% to $1.68. Jupiter (JUP) saw the highest decrease, and the only double-digit one: 10.6% to $0.4538. The markets have seen a variety of significant developments this week, including the tentative trade agreement between the US and China, US inflation report, as well as the US Senate voting to invoke cloture on a substitute amendment to the stablecoin GENIUS Act . Big headline, but the devil’s in the details. Let’s see the terms before calling it a game-changer. Markets might pump short-term, but long-term trust takes more than a tweet. — GameCentric (@gamecentric_io) June 11, 2025 Speaking of stablecoins, Ant Group , the Jack Ma-backed fintech giant, plans to apply for stablecoin licenses in key Asian markets. It is eyeing licenses in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as in Luxembourg. Crypto Market Sensitivity to Price Fluctuations Rises Per Glassnode’s latest report, BTC is holding above the psychologically significant $100,000 level, indicating that investor confidence remains robust. At the same time, volatility expectations are rising. The dense concentration of coin supply near the current spot prices increases market sensitivity to price fluctuations, the analysts argue. That said, mature investors have no losses locked. Almost all loss-taking occurred from top buyers across the ATH formation. This suggests “a capitulation of only the most speculative of investors.” Yet, Options At-the-Money Implied Volatility “across all major tenors remain historically low, suggesting that options traders may be underpricing the likelihood of a volatility regime shift,” Glassnode says. Source: Glassnode However, many eyes are on Ethereum these days. Dom Harz, co-founder of Layer-2 BOB , commented that ETH’s price rise in recent days “marks a significant shift in sentiment toward an asset that had, until relatively recently, fallen out of favour.” Ethereum’s bounce-back signals more than just price action, Harz argues. “The momentum reflects a meaningful shift in sentiment, fuelled by a combination of technical progress, market activity, and regulatory signals.” The Pectra upgrade has gone live and been reinforced by the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commissioner Paul Atkins’ support for DeFi, as well as the strong performance of Circle’s record-breaking IPO, the co-founder says. “These are exciting times for DeFi and for Ethereum’s role in the industry’s next chapter. Hopefully, we are moving beyond the memecoin noise and back to building scalable, decentralised systems — the foundations for crypto’s future,” Harz concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $107,563, the lowest it’s been today, significantly moving away from the all-time high of $111,814, which it hit on 22 May. Notably, it’s also back to the levels seen at the beginning of this week before it started this latest push upwards. Also notably, this is a pullback from the intraday high of $110,269, indicating the coin’s initiative to move towards and above the ATH. The key support level stands at $97,600, while the resistance is at $115,400. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the same time period, Ethereum hit an intraday high of $2,870. It’s also interesting to note that this intraday high moves higher every day. Analysts argue that ETH is poised for further increases. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment slightly decreased within the greed zone. Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell from 65 yesterday to 61 today . This may indicate that the market is overheating and heading for a correction, but there are also movements towards the neutral zone, which would ease these concerns. “Encouragingly, the wave of fear in market sentiment did not translate into a meaningful shift in spending behavior,” Glassnode says. “When assessing losses locked in on-chain, only -$200M of losses were realized, with the magnitude significantly shallower than previous correction events. This suggests that loss-taking remained contained, with investors largely unfazed by the drawdown.” Meanwhile, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $164.57 million on Wednesday. BlackRock leads the list with $131.01 million. The cumulative total net inflow now stands at $45.22 billion. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have recorded 18 consecutive days of inflows. Today, they surpassed the BTC counterparts, with $240.29 million in inflows. BlackRock is the biggest contributor to this amount with $163.64 million on 11 June. The cumulative total net inflow climbed to $3.74 billion. According to Seamus Rocca, Chief Executive Officer of Xapo Bank , “the rise of corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is significant, but it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions. It’s about allocating what a business can afford to hold over a five-to-ten-year horizon, without being forced to sell into volatility.” Companies like Strategy and Metaplanet represent “high-conviction outliers, headline grabbers with bold strategies that align with their unique business aims.” However, for most others, a more measured approach is better suited – “one grounded in long-term belief, not short-term reliance on volatility. In this space, patience and discipline can be underrated virtues,” Rocca emphasizes. “Our view has been, and remains, that Bitcoin deserves serious consideration—but with a disciplined, long-term framework: focus on the asset itself, avoid speculative trading, and size positions responsibly,” Rocca concludes. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto and stock markets have increased in the last day, though crypto’s increase is notably higher. The S&P 500 has decreased by 0.27%, the Nasdaq-100 is down 0.37%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.0026%. The markets are reacting to and are still digesting the developments related to Wednesday’s US inflation report and the result of the trade talks between the US and China. Is this dip sustainable? The dip may be brief, followed by another rally, given the still prevailing bullish sentiment. However, the market stands at a crossroads, and further dips, even if short-term, are possible.

To deal with the potential losses, the investment bank is planning to put aside hundreds of millions of dollars more than it did in the previous quarter, Bloomberg reports . While speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference this week, Vis Raghavan, Citigroup’s head of banking, reportedly cautioned that the firm’s credit reserve build can change its outlook rapidly. “Given the macro environment, etc., cost of credit compared to last quarter, we expect to be up a few hundred million.” Bloomberg also reports, however, that analysts expect loan losses to go down in the second quarter. Raghavan said 80% of Citigroup’s corporate exposure is to entities with high creditworthiness. “We still have a few more weeks to go in this quarter, but on the credit overall, I’m incredibly reassured of the quality.” The executive reportedly notes, however, that the firm’s investment banking business has been hurt by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. “What investment banking likes is clarity. So either it’s really bad or really good, whatever it is, just give us the news, but it is that middle area of not knowing that really freezes market activity.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-12T11:40:18,"Bitcoin Adoption: Why Only 121 Public Companies Have Taken the Plunge (So Far)","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Adoption: Why Only 121 Public Companies Have Taken the Plunge (So Far) In the ever-evolving world of finance and technology, the idea of companies holding digital assets like Bitcoin is gaining traction. Yet, a recent insight from Bitwise Head of Research in Europe, André Dragosch, shared on X, highlights just how early we are in this trend. Citing data from Bitcoin Treasuries, Dragosch revealed a surprising statistic: only 121 public companies globally currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This number, when compared to the sheer volume of publicly listed companies worldwide – like the 5,000 included in the U.S. Wilshire 5000 Index alone – truly underscores the nascent stage of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . Understanding the Scope of Public Companies Holding Bitcoin The fact that merely 121 public entities out of tens of thousands worldwide have decided to allocate a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin is a powerful indicator. It’s not just about the number itself, but what it represents in the grand scheme of global corporate finance. Think about the vast number of publicly traded companies across major economies – from the United States and Europe to Asia and beyond. The vast majority have yet to dip their toes into the Bitcoin waters. The data from sources like Bitcoin Treasuries is crucial because it provides a transparent look at which companies are leading the charge and, more importantly, highlights the massive untouched market. While names like MicroStrategy and Tesla often come to mind when discussing Public Companies Holding Bitcoin , they are part of a very small, pioneering group. This isn’t mainstream yet; it’s still the early adopter phase. Why Are So Few Public Companies Holding Bitcoin on Balance Sheet? If Bitcoin offers potential benefits, why is the number of companies holding it so low? Several significant hurdles stand in the way of putting Bitcoin on Balance Sheet for many corporations. These challenges range from regulatory uncertainty to internal complexities: Regulatory Ambiguity: Governments worldwide are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies. This lack of clear rules creates uncertainty for corporations concerned about compliance and future legal requirements. Accounting Treatment: Accounting standards for digital assets are still developing. Companies face challenges in how to value, report, and manage the tax implications of holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Until recently, U.S. GAAP treated Bitcoin as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, often leading to impairment losses on price drops without recognizing gains until sold, which wasn’t appealing. New FASB rules offering fair-value accounting might change this. Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings. Corporations are typically risk-averse with treasury assets, prioritizing stability and liquidity. The volatility of Bitcoin is a major deterrent for many CFOs. Lack of Familiarity and Expertise: Understanding Bitcoin, its underlying technology, security requirements, and market dynamics requires specialized knowledge that many traditional corporate finance teams lack. Custody and Security Concerns: Safely storing and managing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols and reliable custody solutions, which can be complex and costly to implement at a corporate level. Stakeholder Skepticism: Boards of directors, shareholders, and even employees within a company might be skeptical or resistant to the idea of holding a volatile and relatively new asset like Bitcoin. Limited Use Cases for Treasury: Unlike traditional assets (cash, bonds) used for short-term needs or stable returns, Bitcoin’s primary appeal for treasury is long-term appreciation and inflation hedging, which doesn’t fit all corporate financial strategies. These factors combine to create a high barrier to entry, explaining why the list of Public Companies Holding Bitcoin remains exclusive. What’s the Appeal? Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Despite the challenges, the 121 companies that have adopted Bitcoin see significant potential upsides. For these pioneers, integrating Bitcoin for Businesses isn’t just a speculative bet; it’s often a strategic decision driven by several potential benefits: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation potentially devaluing fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by some as a potential store of value and hedge against purchasing power erosion. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on treasury assets that traditionally yield very little. Treasury Diversification: Adding a non-correlated or lowly-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a corporate treasury portfolio beyond traditional cash and fixed-income instruments. Innovation and Forward Thinking: Adopting Bitcoin can signal that a company is innovative, forward-thinking, and adaptable to new technologies, which can be attractive to investors and talent, particularly in the tech sector. Attracting Institutional Investment: As institutional interest grows, being a company already familiar with and holding digital assets could potentially make it more appealing to a certain class of investors interested in the space. These benefits, while accompanied by risks, are compelling enough for a small but growing number of companies to navigate the complexities and become pioneers in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . Examples of Institutional Bitcoin Investment in the Corporate World When we talk about the 121 Public Companies Holding Bitcoin , a few names inevitably dominate the conversation due to the size of their holdings and their vocal advocacy. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is arguably the most prominent example, having made substantial Bitcoin acquisitions a core part of its corporate strategy. Tesla, under Elon Musk, also made headlines with a significant purchase, though they have adjusted their holdings over time. Beyond these tech giants, companies across various sectors, from finance (like Block, formerly Square) to mining and even food service (though less common), are represented in the list of 121. Each company likely has its own specific reasons and strategies for holding Bitcoin, whether it’s primarily as a treasury reserve asset, for transactional purposes, or as part of a broader digital asset strategy. The actions of these leading companies serve as case studies and potential blueprints (or cautionary tales) for others considering Institutional Bitcoin Investment . Their experiences navigating the challenges and opportunities provide valuable insights for the corporate world. What Could Drive More Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? If the number is currently 121, what could potentially increase that number significantly in the future? Several factors could accelerate Corporate Bitcoin Adoption : Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulations and legal frameworks surrounding digital assets would significantly reduce uncertainty and risk for corporations. Improved Accounting Standards: The recent move by FASB towards fair-value accounting for crypto assets held by companies is a positive step that could make holding Bitcoin more attractive from a reporting perspective. More Robust Institutional Infrastructure: Further development of secure custody solutions, easier access to liquidity, and more sophisticated financial products tailored for institutions can lower operational barriers. Peer Adoption: As more companies, especially competitors within the same industry, begin holding Bitcoin, others may feel compelled to investigate or adopt it themselves to avoid being left behind or to understand a potential strategic advantage. Increased Education and Familiarity: As corporate finance professionals become more educated about digital assets, the perceived risks may decrease, and the potential benefits become clearer. Stable Market Conditions (Relative): While volatility is inherent, periods of relative stability or sustained upward trends could make the asset more palatable for risk-averse corporate treasuries. These potential catalysts suggest that while 121 is a small number now, it may not remain so indefinitely. The path to broader Bitcoin for Businesses adoption is being paved, albeit slowly. Conclusion: Early Days, Significant Potential The finding that only 121 public companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets is a stark reminder of how early we are in the journey of corporate digital asset integration. It highlights the significant challenges – regulatory, accounting, and psychological – that still deter the vast majority of corporations. However, it also points to immense potential. The 121 pioneers represent the thin edge of the wedge, demonstrating that holding Bitcoin is feasible and strategically beneficial for some. As the regulatory landscape matures, accounting standards improve, and the infrastructure for Institutional Bitcoin Investment becomes more robust, we could see this number grow substantially. The narrative isn’t that corporate adoption has failed; it’s that it’s just beginning. The coming years will reveal whether the early trickle turns into a steady stream of companies adding Bitcoin to their financial playbooks, fundamentally changing the landscape of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption .
