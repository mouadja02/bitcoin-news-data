2025-06-12T19:55:42,"This Factor Could Be Sending an ‘Early Warning Sign’ for Bitcoin, According to Trader Justin Bennett","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is displaying early warning signs of an upcoming pullback. In a new thread, crypto trader Justin Bennett tells his 115,800 followers on the social media platform X that BTC whales exiting long positions in favor of building short positions against retail could cause the crypto asset by market cap to slide down to $106,300. “BTC isn’t the most exciting market at the moment, but that $106,000 imbalance looks appealing if this holds. Technically still range-bound for now. It’s very early and therefore speculative, but whales were exiting long positions and building shorts against retail on Wednesday. This could change, but it could also be an early warning sign of a pullback into $106,300.” Source: Justine Bennett/X The trader’s chart indicates that if BTC were to slide, it would happen sometime during the next 48 hours. Bennett goes on to note that crypto traders should keep an eye on the health of stocks, particularly the S&P 500, as a dip below a specific level could cause it to crash back down to its lows in April and May. “The SPX is holding support now, but if this fails, especially at 5,960, those April and May gaps will be fair game. Not interested in it yet. Just watching.” Source: Justine Bennett/X The flagship digital asset is trading for $107,698 at time of writing, a 2% decrease during the last 24 hours.

2025-06-12T19:52:34,"Bitcoin Depot’s Strategic Acquisition Boosts Bitcoin ATM Network","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Depot’s Strategic Acquisition Boosts Bitcoin ATM Network In a significant move set to reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency access points, Bitcoin Depot (NASDAQ: BTM), a leading U.S.-based Bitcoin ATM operator, has announced a key acquisition . The company has successfully acquired the assets of Pelicoin , a prominent Crypto ATM operator primarily based in Louisiana. This strategic step is poised to substantially enhance Bitcoin Depot ‘s operational footprint, particularly within the vital Gulf South region. What Does the Bitcoin Depot Acquisition Mean? The Bitcoin Depot acquisition of Pelicoin ‘s assets is more than just a simple business transaction; it represents a calculated expansion strategy. By integrating Pelicoin ‘s existing infrastructure, Bitcoin Depot gains immediate access to a well-established network of Bitcoin ATM locations. This is crucial for a business model that relies heavily on physical accessibility for users looking to buy or sell cryptocurrency using cash. The primary benefit of this acquisition for Bitcoin Depot is the rapid expansion into new and existing markets without the time and cost associated with building new locations from scratch. It leverages Pelicoin ‘s established presence and customer base. Expanding the Bitcoin ATM and Crypto ATM Footprint The deal significantly bolsters Bitcoin Depot ‘s nationwide presence. While the exact number of locations acquired was not specified in the initial announcement, the addition of Pelicoin ‘s machines means more places where customers can easily interact with the crypto market. These new locations are strategically spread across several states, including: Louisiana Mississippi Tennessee Alabama Texas This expansion through the Pelicoin acquisition enhances the density of Bitcoin Depot ‘s network, making it more convenient for users in these states to find a nearby Bitcoin ATM or Crypto ATM . A larger, more accessible network is a direct competitive advantage in the burgeoning crypto ATM industry. Focus on the Gulf South: Pelicoin’s Role Pelicoin had built a strong presence in the Gulf South, particularly in Louisiana. By acquiring Pelicoin ‘s assets, Bitcoin Depot is specifically targeting growth in this geographical area. The Gulf South represents a market with increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, and having a robust network of Bitcoin ATM s there is key to capturing that demand. This regional focus allows Bitcoin Depot to consolidate its position and potentially become the dominant Crypto ATM operator in these states. It demonstrates a clear strategy to not just expand randomly, but to build density and market share in specific, promising regions. Benefits for Bitcoin Depot and Users For Bitcoin Depot , the benefits of the Pelicoin acquisition are clear: Accelerated Growth: Rapid expansion of the physical network. Market Share Increase: Strengthening its position as a leading operator. Operational Efficiencies: Potential synergies in managing a larger network. Enhanced Brand Visibility: More locations mean greater public awareness. For users, the benefits include: Increased Accessibility: More convenient locations to buy/sell crypto. Potential for Improved Service: Integration into Bitcoin Depot ‘s potentially larger support and maintenance network. The acquisition reinforces Bitcoin Depot ‘s commitment to expanding access to digital currencies for the everyday consumer, leveraging the familiar format of ATMs. Looking Ahead The Bitcoin Depot acquisition of Pelicoin marks a significant step in the consolidation and growth of the Bitcoin ATM market in the U.S. It highlights the ongoing importance of physical infrastructure in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space.

2025-06-12T19:43:27,"Czech government under pressure over bitcoin donation from ‘Silk Road’ entrepreneur","A controversial $45 million Bitcoin donation by an entrepreneur convicted of operating a dark web marketplace is rocking the Czech political scene. A Bitcoin (BTC) donation is shaking the Czech political landscape. On Thursday, June 12, the Czech opposition called for a no-confidence vote on the government over alleged corruption. The scandal involves the donation of 468 bitcoins, worth $45 million, to the state by an ex-convict. The benefactor was Tomáš Jiříkovský, a controversial entrepreneur and drug trafficker who operated a dark web marketplace for illegal drugs. He was convicted in 2017 for drug trafficking, fraud, and illegal weapons possession, and served his sentence until 2021. The payment, which was made to the Justice Ministry, was accepted by then-Minister Pavel Blazek. The funds were later liquidated into fiat and transferred to the state treasury. However, the donation prompted pressure from the opposition, and Blazek was forced to resign on May 31. You might also like: Czech Republic passes crypto-friendly law, exempts Bitcoin from capital gains While the funds were given to the state rather than to the minister personally, the opposition questioned the origins of the funds. The opposition accused the government of accepting the bitcoins without any AML or KYC checks. Without verifying their origin, it’s impossible to know whether they were connected to illegal activity. Czech story mirrors ‘Silk Road’ scandal Jiříkovský’s operations closely resemble those of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road. The platform was one of the first places where Bitcoin could be readily used, but it was also a hub for illegal drug trafficking. Ulbricht was pardoned in January 2025 by President Donald Trump after serving 11 years in jail. Interestingly, in June, he received a 300 Bitcoin donation from a “questionable source.” The scandal is rocking the crypto-friendly Czech government, which had hoped to attract crypto businesses with its flexible stance on MiCA regulations. It also risks undermining public trust in Bitcoin by associating it with illegal operations. Read more: Czech Republic might create a BTC reserve ahead of the U.S. administration.

2025-06-12T19:40:35,"Tencent Explores Massive Nexon Acquisition: What Happens to Their Bitcoin?","BitcoinWorld Tencent Explores Massive Nexon Acquisition: What Happens to Their Bitcoin? Big news is shaking up the tech and gaming worlds, and it has a fascinating angle for cryptocurrency enthusiasts! Chinese tech behemoth Tencent Holdings is reportedly casting a strategic eye on a potential Tencent Nexon acquisition . This isn’t just any gaming company; Nexon Co., originally from South Korea and now based in Japan, holds a significant place in the global gaming market, and notably, holds a considerable amount of Bitcoin. What’s Behind the Potential Tencent Nexon Acquisition? According to a Bloomberg report citing sources familiar with the matter, Tencent has reportedly initiated discussions with the family of Nexon’s late founder, Kim Jung-ju. The Kim family, through their investment vehicle NXC Corp. and its affiliate NXMH BV, holds a substantial 44.4% controlling stake in Nexon as of June 30 data. This stake is the core target of the potential deal exploration. For Tencent , a company already deeply embedded in the global gaming industry through investments and ownerships (like Riot Games, Epic Games, and significant stakes in others), acquiring Nexon would be a massive strategic move. Nexon boasts a strong portfolio of popular online games, particularly in Asia, including titles like MapleStory, Dungeon Fighter Online, and KartRider. A successful Gaming acquisition of this scale would further solidify Tencent’s dominance in the international gaming landscape. Nexon’s Bitcoin Holdings: A Key Crypto Angle Here’s where the story gets particularly interesting for our crypto-savvy readers. While the primary focus of a Tencent Nexon acquisition would be on gaming assets and market share, Nexon is one of the notable public companies that holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Data from Bitcoin Treasuries confirms that Nexon holds 1,717 Bitcoin . This Bitcoin was acquired at an average price of approximately $58,226 per coin. At the time of acquisition, this represented a significant corporate investment in the leading cryptocurrency. For a potential buyer like Tencent, a company known for its vast financial resources and diverse portfolio, Nexon’s Nexon Bitcoin holdings add an intriguing layer to the valuation and potential deal structure. How a tech giant like Tencent would approach these crypto assets during an acquisition process is a topic of much speculation within the crypto community. Exploring the Nexon NXC Stake and Family’s Options The reported discussions are centered around the significant Nexon NXC stake controlled by the Kim family. The family is currently working with financial advisers to carefully evaluate their options regarding this substantial holding. Selling a controlling stake in a company as large and successful as Nexon is a complex process with many potential paths, including selling to a single strategic buyer like Tencent, exploring other investors, or potentially pursuing other restructuring options. A Tencent investment of this magnitude would require significant capital and likely face regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions, given both companies’ global reach and market influence. The Kim family’s decision will hinge on various factors, including valuation, deal terms, and the future vision for Nexon. What Could This Gaming Acquisition Mean? A potential Gaming acquisition of Nexon by Tencent could have wide-ranging implications: For Tencent: Significant expansion of its gaming IP library and market presence, particularly in PC and mobile gaming in key Asian markets. For Nexon: Access to Tencent’s vast resources, distribution channels, and expertise, potentially accelerating global growth and game development. For the Gaming Industry: Further consolidation and increased dominance by Tencent, potentially impacting competition and developer relationships. For Nexon’s Bitcoin Holdings: This is perhaps the most fascinating question for crypto investors. Would Tencent retain the Bitcoin? Would it be sold as part of the deal? Or could Tencent, already exploring blockchain applications, see strategic value in these holdings? The fate of Nexon’s Nexon Bitcoin holdings under new ownership remains uncertain but is a key point of interest. Challenges and Considerations Any potential Tencent Nexon acquisition faces hurdles. Regulatory approval will be a major factor, especially considering antitrust concerns in markets where both companies operate extensively. Valuation discussions can be complex, particularly for a company with diverse assets, including non-traditional ones like significant Nexon Bitcoin holdings . The Kim family’s goals and the interests of minority shareholders also play crucial roles. Ultimately, the outcome of these reported explorations is yet to be determined. However, the prospect of a tech and gaming giant like Tencent potentially acquiring a company that is also a significant corporate holder of Bitcoin is a development worth watching closely, bridging the worlds of traditional tech M&A and the burgeoning digital asset space.

2025-06-12T19:35:05,"ANAP Accelerates Bitcoin Accumulation: Japanese Fashion Giant Targets 1000+ BTC","BitcoinWorld ANAP Accelerates Bitcoin Accumulation: Japanese Fashion Giant Targets 1000+ BTC In a move that continues to turn heads in both the fashion world and the cryptocurrency market, Japanese fashion company ANAP Holdings has once again boosted its Bitcoin reserves. This latest acquisition signals a clear and accelerating commitment to digital assets as part of their broader financial strategy. What exactly did they buy, and what does this tell us about their ambitious plans? ANAP’s Latest Bitcoin Purchase Detailed ANAP Holdings recently announced via a press release on June 11th that they had acquired an additional 23.0595 Bitcoin (BTC). This purchase came at a cost of 367.26 million yen, which translates to approximately $2.55 million at the time of the transaction. This isn’t their first rodeo in the crypto market, and it significantly adds to their growing digital treasury. Following this latest ANAP Bitcoin purchase , the company’s total holdings have increased to a substantial 125.9596 BTC. Their cumulative investment in Bitcoin now stands at 1.84 billion yen, roughly equivalent to $12.8 million. This puts their average purchase price for their entire Bitcoin stash at around $93,600 per BTC. It’s clear they’ve been accumulating over time, navigating the market’s fluctuations. Why is a Japanese Company Investing in Bitcoin? It might seem counterintuitive for a fashion company to dive deep into cryptocurrency, but the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is growing globally. Companies are increasingly exploring Bitcoin as an alternative asset class for various reasons, including: Treasury Reserve Asset: Holding Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Potential for Appreciation: Believing in Bitcoin’s long-term growth potential. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to their balance sheet. Innovation & Future Readiness: Signaling forward-thinking and adaptability in a digital economy. ANAP’s move places it among a growing list of publicly traded companies, albeit one of the more unique ones given its industry, that are allocating capital to digital assets. This demonstrates a strategic decision that goes beyond traditional corporate finance. ANAP’s Ambitious Crypto Investment Strategy What makes ANAP’s recent activity particularly noteworthy is not just the purchase itself, but the scale of their stated ambition. Earlier announcements revealed that ANAP plans to acquire a significant amount of Bitcoin – specifically, north of 1,000 BTC – by August. This latest purchase of 23 BTC, while notable, is just one step towards that much larger goal. Reaching the 1,000+ BTC target would represent a massive increase from their current 125+ BTC holdings. This aggressive accumulation target suggests a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition over the coming months and years. It positions their ANAP crypto investment as a major component of their future financial health, rather than just a speculative side venture. What Does This Japanese Company’s Bitcoin Plan Signify? The fact that a Japanese company Bitcoin investment of this scale is being pursued is significant for several reasons: Firstly, it highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within traditional corporate structures, even in markets like Japan, which has a well-regulated but sometimes cautious approach to crypto. Secondly, ANAP’s public declaration of a specific, high-volume target provides transparency into their Bitcoin investment strategy and timeline. This isn’t a quiet, minor allocation; it’s a stated objective that they are actively working towards, as evidenced by this latest purchase. Finally, as more diverse companies like ANAP enter the space, it could encourage others in non-traditional crypto industries to explore similar strategies, potentially driving further institutional adoption and market maturation. Benefits and Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings For ANAP, the potential benefits of holding a significant amount of Bitcoin include: Asset Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s price rises, their treasury value increases significantly. Inflation Hedge: Protection against the potential devaluation of fiat currency. Market Attention: Gaining visibility and potentially attracting investors interested in crypto-forward companies. However, there are also inherent challenges and risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, potentially leading to significant paper losses on their balance sheet. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Japan. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules often require companies to mark down the value of crypto holdings if the market price drops below their cost basis, even if the price later recovers. Security Risks: The responsibility of securely storing significant amounts of Bitcoin. ANAP’s decision suggests they have weighed these factors and believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks, particularly in the context of their long-term vision. Concluding Thoughts on ANAP’s Bitcoin Journey ANAP Holdings’ continued ANAP Bitcoin purchase and their ambitious target of acquiring over 1,000 BTC by August make them a fascinating case study in corporate Bitcoin adoption . This move by a Japanese company Bitcoin enthusiast demonstrates that the trend of integrating digital assets into traditional business models is far from limited to tech or finance sectors. Their explicit Bitcoin investment strategy provides a clear roadmap for their future financial positioning. As they work towards their goal, the market will be watching to see how this bold move impacts their balance sheet and sets a precedent for other companies in Japan and beyond.

2025-06-12T19:34:31,"What a Total US-China Trade Freeze Could Mean for Crypto","As tensions between the United States and China escalate , the idea of a full-scale trade freeze, once unthinkable, now feels increasingly plausible. In such a scenario, where both economic superpowers ban entirely each other’s goods and services, the global economy would be plunged. But how might crypto be affected? A Flight to Alternative Assets In times of geopolitical instability and economic upheaval, investors historically flee to “safe haven” assets. Gold has long held that role. However, over the past decade, Bitcoin has slowly but surely solidified its position as a digital alternative to gold. If US-China trade were to collapse completely, confidence in traditional financial systems and fiat currencies would likely take a hit. In such a scenario, Bitcoin could benefit as investors seek non-state, borderless alternatives to protect their wealth. A sudden increase in demand from institutional and retail investors could drive upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price, at least after initial market turbulence. Falling Dollar Dominance The US dollar currently dominates as the world’s reserve currency, largely due to America’s central role in global trade and finance. But if the US is no longer seen as a stable trading partner, trust in the dollar may erode, especially among countries that rely heavily on both Chinese and American markets. In that case, Bitcoin could increasingly be seen as a neutral alternative for settling cross-border payments or hedging against currency volatility. XRP could be a candidate here, too. This would be especially true in regions like Southeast Asia, Latin America, or Africa, where financial systems are strained and digital alternatives are gaining traction. Crypto Adoption in Emerging Markets A trade freeze would severely disrupt global supply chains and likely trigger inflation, currency depreciation, and capital restrictions, especially in emerging markets. In countries facing such pressures, crypto adoption could accelerate as individuals and businesses want to preserve value and conduct international transactions outside the traditional banking system. Bitcoin, stablecoins, and even DeFi platforms could be crucial in filling the gap, offering financial access and liquidity where local systems fail. Potential Government Crackdowns While crypto might benefit from instability in the private sector, governments may respond with increased scrutiny and regulation. The US and China are willing to crack down on crypto when it threatens monetary control or national interests. In a full-scale trade war, crypto could be viewed as a threat to economic sovereignty, causing tighter controls, bans, or surveillance. This risk is particularly high if Bitcoin becomes a major vehicle for capital flight or sanctions evasion. Expect Short-Term Volatility Despite its long-term promise, Bitcoin remains highly volatile. An abrupt and total freeze in US-China trade would likely spark global panic in financial markets, and crypto would most likely not be immune. Initial reactions could include sharp sell-offs as investors rush for liquidity. However, this could be followed by a speculative surge, as opportunistic buyers could bet on crypto’s role in a reshaped financial order.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/what-a-total-us-china-trade-freeze-could-mean-for-crypto/,"ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET","Cryptocurrency|News|China|Cryptocurrency News|USA",cryptocompare

The flagship coin has been forming a bullish continuation pattern after being rejected at its all-time high of around $111,900, which was set around May 22, 2025. Since June 9, 2025, BTC price has experienced a significant resistance level of around $110,500, thus resulting in a 2-3 percent drop to date. The drop below $108k in the past 24 hours has created a palpable fear of further short-term correction. Here are Major Factors to kickstart FOMO and Bullish Sentiment for Bitcoin Soon Technical Aspect BTC price has traded above a crucial weekly support level around $104,354 in the past five weeks. In the past three weeks, BTC price has been retesting the bullish breakout, signaling a parabolic rally soon. In the 1-hour timeframe, BTC price has been retesting a bullish breakout from a falling logarithmic trend. Although a solid base for the ongoing market correction has not been established, a major rebound is on the horizon. Weakening U.S.Dollar Amid Crypto Regulatory Clarity Despite the historical attempts by the Donald Trump administration to strengthen the U.S. dollar, the DXY, which measures the value of the U.S dollar against other major currencies, has been declining. The Chinese Yuan and other currencies have been strengthening against the U.S. dollar. With Bitcoin mostly traded against the U.S. dollar, the underlying value will skyrocket in the near future. Meanwhile, U.S. regulators have been making strategic moves to help the U.S. dollar remain dominant globally. For instance, the country intends to use stablecoins by enacting clear regulations. Consequently, crypto liquidity will increase significantly in tandem with the global money supply (M2). Heightened Demand from Institutional Investors According to aggregate data from BitcoinTreasuries , the entities holding Bitcoin in their treasuries has surged by 21 firms in the past 30 days, thus increasing the BTC holdings by 3.28 percent to 3.41 million. More institutional investors, led by GameStop , have been following in the footsteps of Strategy to leverage the global equity markets to strengthen their Bitcoin holdings. The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, led by BlackRock’s IBIT, have continued to relentlessly accumulate more BTCs in the past year. As a result, the balance of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges has exponentially declined to a multi-year low of about 2.09 million coins, thus confirming a major supply vs demand shock.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/top-reasons-why-bitcoin-price-will-rebound-and-explode-to-new-ath-before-end-of-june/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T19:18:28,"Lead Developer Accuses Ethereum Foundation of Phasing out Geth Project","Peter Szilagyi , lead developer of Ethereum’s Go implementation Geth, voiced concerns that the Ethereum Foundation pressured developers to discontinue the Geth project. Szilagyi voiced his concerns on X, suggesting that the Ethereum Foundation (EF) had offered $5 million to detach the Geth project from Ethereum. Szilagyi also suggested that EF was funding a secret fork of Geth to replace the development team. Tomasz Stanczak, co-executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, denied the accusations and reiterated the importance of Geth for the Ethereum ecosystem. Szilagyi, however, maintains that the EF put pressure on developers to discontinue the Geth project. Szilagyi said he made an internal complaint but was fired within 24 hours of voicing his concerns. Szilagyi maintains that the $5 million offer was made multiple times and was a form of pressure to remove the Geth developers. The exchange of X posts online has created a tense situation that has strained relations between the EF and Geth developers. Geth is a Go Ethereum implementation of the Ethereum Client, and is the most popular one online, allowing nodes to verify blockchain transactions. The EF was created to support the Ethereum ecosystem. Szilagyi, who has much experience leading the Geth project, alleged that the EF was offloading core projects while changing its stance towards ongoing research and development. Szilagyi is convinced that the EF has funded a parallel Geth project within the Nethermind project to transition slowly away from his team. Szilagyi claims that the EF recently dismissed four development teams and plans to discontinue Geth within one year. Ethereum investors may be concerned about this news because Geth is a core technology used within the Ethereum ecosystem. Stanczak, EF co-executive director, has rejected the claims that the EF is phasing out Geth. Aya Miyaguchi, newly appointed EF President, held the position of Executive Director, which Tomasz Stanczak and Hsiao-Wei Wang took over. Stanczak has been embroiled in an online controversy involving Geth lead developer Szilagyi. Miyaguchi, moreover, was blamed for the underperformance of Ethereum during her time before receiving a promotion. Some members of the Ethereum community even blame the team members who worked under her for the sluggish performance of Ethereum. The online feud between Szilagyi and Stanczak further extends the controversies surrounding the firing of R&D staff, which started at the beginning of June. Some staff members, such as Szilagyi, may feel threatened by the firings. The EF began reorganising its staff and funding, as part of a broader strategy to make Ethereum leaner. Vitalik Buterin has made public comments praising the lean nature of Bitcoin and wishes to imitate its structure. Stanczak has defended the EF and stated that the foundation plans to keep Geth and wants to extend its capabilities as client software. The EF, however, has not responded to the claims of $5 million in funds. Due to the public exposure of the X debate, the EF may be forced to release a statement explaining key issues, such as the $5 million offers. Ethereum traders may be interested in how these events unfold because the conflict may indicate further troubles for the foundation. The debate may include issues regarding delineating development teams and foundation activities. There may also be a possibility that a third-party individual may come forward to corroborate Szilagyi’s story. Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade occurred in early May, marking a critical milestone for the blockchain project. The upgrade addressed scalability issues to increase Ethereum’s competitiveness amongst other cryptocurrencies. The upgrade was a success in terms of public responsiveness. The derivatives markets saw an uptick in terms of Ethereum trading. Investors saw the upgrade as a clear indicator of the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum project. The current demand is for Ethereum ETFs with staking abilities so that traders can benefit from the financial innovations of blockchain technology. Despite criticism of the EF leadership, the Ethereum ecosystem has benefited from recent organizational changes.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/lead-developer-accuses-ethereum-foundation-of-phasing-out-geth-project/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TECHNOLOGY","Ethereum|News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T18:52:00,"Best altcoins to buy if Bitcoin hits $1m as Michael Saylor predicts","Michael Saylor, Strategy’s founder, delivered a bold Bitcoin price prediction this week, saying the cryptocurrency could surge to $1 million within the next few years. Saylor cited rising demand from institutions and governments, dwindling exchange balances, and the limited supply, just 450 new Bitcoin ( BTC ) coins mined per day, as key drivers behind his forecast. Best altcoins to buy if Bitcoin price hits $1M A surge in Bitcoin to $1 million would likely trigger broad gains across the crypto market, as altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s momentum. Some of the best-positioned altcoins in that scenario are AAVE ( AAVE ), Solana ( SOL ), and Tron ( TRX ). AAVE AAVE is one of the top altcoins to buy if Bitcoin surged to $1 million. It is the biggest player in decentralized finance, an industry that Paul Atkins, the head of the SEC supports . The platform’s growth has accelerated in 2025, with total value locked (TVL) rising to over $27 billion. AAVE is also generating more than $1.5 million in daily fees, while its native stablecoin, GHO, now has a market cap of $218 million. Importantly, AAVE has weathered some of crypto’s worst periods, including the FTX, Celsius, and Terra collapses in 2022. AAVE also has strong technicals as this crypto.news article noted. It has formed a golden cross pattern, while the Average Directional Index is pointing upwards, signaling that the momentum is growing. The token will likely continue rising as bulls target last year’s high of $400, up by 33% from the current level. AAVE price chart | Source: crypto.news Tron Tron is another top altcoin to buy because of its strong fundamentals. Data shows that it is the second most profitable player in the crypto industry after Tether. It has made over $1 billion in fees this year, much higher than chains like Solana and Ethereum. Tron is also one of the most deflationary tokens in the crypto industry because of its token burns. This deflation will continue as the community votes on reducing block time and voting rewards. Tron is also forming a rounded bottom, which may push it to last year’s high of $0.4493, up by 63% from the current level. Tron price chart | Source: crypto.news Solana Solana is another top cryptocurrency to buy because of its strong fundamentals. It has the most active transactions, with the 30-day figure jumping by 56% to 1.92 billion. These transactions are more than those of other chains, combined. Solana also has the most active addresses. It had over 135 million active addresses in the last 30 days, also higher than the other top chains. Solana has a vibrant ecosystem with hundreds of dApps in all areas like decentralized finance, real-world asset tokenization and decentralized public infrastructure. Solana stats | Source: Nansen The Securities and Exchange Commission will also likely approve spot SOL ETFs, making it available to Wall Street investors. It also has a staking reward of 8.5%, higher than many chains. Some of the other blue-chip altcoins to buy if Bitcoin hits $1 million are Aptos, Sui, Stellar, and XRP.

2025-06-12T18:51:27,"Ethereum Price Prediction: “You Haven’t Seen What ETH Can Do Yet” – Analyst Warns of Massive Incoming Bull Market","Crypto analyst Kev is sounding the alarm—in a good way. He believes the Ethereum price is about to remind everyone why it leads altcoin seasons , warning that “we haven’t seen what Ethereum is capable of in this cycle” yet. In a Jun 9 Podcast , the analyst likened the monthly trend reversal observed since the mid-April market bottom to those that preceded historic rallies in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020. Calling the current setup the “most textbook example yet,” Kev suggests ETH could be entering a 4–12 month window of sustained upside, placing it among the best cryptos to buy now . ETH / USD 1-month chart, historic bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, BITSTAMP. Monthly Indicators Reach Levels “Never Seen Before” The bullish case for ETH extends beyond historical patterns into technical momentum, with indicators flashing signals “never seen before” in what could be a precursor to a bottom. Kevin highlights that buyers have yet to reach a point of exhaustion this cycle. The RSI remains well below the overbought 70 threshold, currently at 52. A sign he believes indicates untapped upside, with the 2017 and 2020 bull cycles topping in the 80-90 range. “The real party starts when we break 70, and we’re not even close yet,” he said. The analyst also points to the whale money flow indicator, which is rebounding from one of its most oversold points in history—a pattern that previously aligned with long-term trend reversals. More so, Ethereum’s monthly stochastic RSI is in the midst of a sharp V-shaped recovery, signaling what Kevin called “aggressive, aggressive strength.” The analyst claims an Ethereum breakout as the key needed to push the next altcoin season, pointing to the impending breakout of an ascending triangle targeting a $6 trillion market cap on the altcoin chart. Ethereum Price Analysis: Is an ETH Breakout Near? Looking at the Ethereum price chart, momentum does appear to be building towards a breakout with a huge symmetrical triangle forming since the 2020 bull market high now coming into focus. The Weekly RSI has adopted a sharp uptrend after battling to hold the neutral line, currently at 56—an early indicator of a longer-term uptrend taking root as buy pressure returns. Supporting this, the MACD line continues to widen above the signal line following a recent golden cross, reinforcing the shift toward bullish market control. The 20EMA has formed reliable short-term support, acting as a launchpad for higher price action over the past month—adding weight to the idea of a new uptrend. If momentum holds, Ethereum could climb 40% to retest the triangle’s upper boundary around $3,880. A confirmed breakout above this level could set the stage for a powerful continuation toward the 1.618 Fibonacci extension target at $7,335—a potential 165% gain from current prices. In the near term, traders should monitor the immediate stubborn resistance zone around $2280. A rejection here could delay the breakout and bring a temporary cooling period. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to Ethereum over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.1 million in its second presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 648% APY on staking that rewards early investors. You can keep up with Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Bitcoin Hyper website .

Yesterday, GameStop announced a proposed private offering of $1.75 billion worth of senior convertible notes. “GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (‘GameStop’) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (the ‘notes’) in a private offering (the ‘offering’) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘Securities Act’). GameStop also intends to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of notes.” In the announcement, GameStop says it plans to use the funds for general purposes, including potential investments “in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions.” According to a CNBC report , that could potentially mean purchasing more BTC. Buying more Bitcoin is in line with recent GameStop investments. Late last month, the meme stock became a BTC Treasury by purchasing 4,710 BTC, worth $505 million at time of writing. However, since yesterday’s announced proposal, GME has crashed 21% and is currently trading for $22.49.

2025-06-12T18:30:50,"Crypto Expert Puts Ethereum Price At $19,500 With Head And Shoulders Emergence","Ethereum reclaimed a significant technical level in the latest 24-hour trading session, with its price crossing above the $2,800 mark and briefly touching $2,870. This interesting cross makes it the first time since February 2025 that Ethereum has traded above the $2,800 threshold. The move comes amid rising bullish momentum flowing out from Bitcoin, and according to recent analysis from a crypto expert, this could be just the beginning of a much larger rally for Ethereum. Technical Pattern Says Ethereum Could Be Close To $20,000 An interesting technical formation on Ethereum has now caught the attention of some traders: a classic inverse Head and Shoulders bottom. According to crypto expert Gert van Lagen, who shared his analysis on the social media platform X, this inverse head and shoulders is setting up on a long-term timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Specifically, Ethereum’s two-week candlestick chart, shared by the analyst, reveals a fully formed structure with a left shoulder in mid-2021, a pronounced head that took shape during the bear market in late 2022 to early 2023, and a right shoulder forming throughout the 2024 correction into early 2025. The left shoulder emerged in mid-2021, when Ethereum’s price peaked around $4,870, then retraced into the year-end. The head was formed at the lows around $1,350 in 2022 and 2023. The right shoulder is currently in formation after the Ethereum price rebounded from roughly $1,600 in 2025. Finally, this pattern is also highlighted by a symmetry around the neckline drawn near the $4,200 price region. Keeping this in mind, the neckline of the pattern, which is anchored just below the $4,200 resistance level, is now the most important level to break above. A confirmed breakout above this zone could activate the full bullish target projected by the technical formation. ETH Price Close To $20,000 According to Gert van Lagen, the two-week head-and-shoulders pattern suggests Ethereum may be “closer to $20K than most anticipate.” His price target calculation follows a classic technical methodology. By measuring the vertical distance from the head’s lowest point to the neckline resistance and then projecting that same distance upward from the neckline, he arrives at a target of approximately $19,500, which is more than a 600% gain from today’s price levels. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric In the same analysis, van Lagen also highlighted a descending broadening wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-2023. This secondary structure reinforces the notion that Ethereum may embark on a significantly larger breakout once $4,200 is cleared. However, this projection of $19,500 is based on the technical symmetry of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, rather than fundamental shifts in Ethereum. Additionally, there is no clear timeline for this target; however, based on the multi-year nature of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the price target may also take up to four years to materialize. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,772, having retraced slightly from $2,870.

2025-06-12T18:30:28,"Trump boast of ending Biden’s Operation Choke Point 2.0","President Trump spoke at the Coinbase Crypto Summit today, taking credit for ending Operation Choke Point 2.0. He also pledged to implement clear-cut regulations to help the US lead the future of crypto and Bitcoin. He commented , “We will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin.” Trump spoke on his crypto achievements at the summit Speaking at the summit, Trump claimed he ended Biden’s administration’s war on crypto, the so-called Operation Choke Point 2.0. The name came about after industry analysts drew parallels to a 2013 federal campaign that sought to exclude high-risk businesses—such as firearms dealers and sellers of drug paraphernalia—from the banking system. During Biden’s tenure, crypto experts complained that the country’s financial regulators and banks had it in for them. They argued that banks especially imposed lengthy onboarding processes , rejected smaller companies’ applications, or disengaged from the crypto industry entirely. Trump stated that he ended the unfair war on crypto and empowered American innovators to push boundaries and lead the world into the future. He also appreciated that some acknowledge him as the first crypto president, calling it a “big honor.” Additionally, he asserted that he created the first presidential working group to discuss digital assets and named a new pro-innovation Securities and Exchange chair, Paul Atkins. He also said that he helped to establish the first Bitcoin strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile Moving forward, he claimed he wanted to create more dollar-backed stablecoins and set up more regulations to allow the country to lead the future of crypto and Bitcoin. After his remarks, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire discussed their firms’ evolution and the broader crypto space, agreeing that digital currencies are on track to serve a more significant role on a global scale. Trump’s BTC reserve decision invited criticism from some crypto analysts In March, Trump signed an executive order to establish a Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks compared them to a digital Fort Knox for cryptocurrency, referencing the Kentucky military facility that stores much of America’s gold. However, some crypto enthusiasts did not take too kindly to the news, bashing Trump’s administration for playing it safe. Some even raised concerns about the process’s transparency, despite Sacks calling for a full accounting of the federal government’s existing crypto reserves, which were estimated at around 200,000 Bitcoin. Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, even argued that with no active crypto purchases, the reserve is just a “fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government.” Around the same time, Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, shared his view, seemingly supporting the BTC reserve but taking issue with the broader asset mix, claiming the plan was illogical and set a terrible precedent. He also hinted that without clear regulations, the administration could disrupt crypto markets and fuel investors’ loss of confidence. Per Trump’s executive order, the Treasury and Commerce secretary should develop budget-neutral ways to acquire BTC. Sacks even added that they could only purchase more Bitcoin if it did not contribute to a deficit or debt. Meanwhile, the stablecoin bill, GENIUS Act , is set to go through a procedural vote on Thursday after lawmakers approved the bill in a 68-30 vote on Wednesday. Moreover, after two key House committees advanced the market structure bill, the CLARITY Act may soon be up for a full floor vote.

2025-06-12T18:30:00,"Top Undervalued DeFi Tokens To Buy Before They Explode in June 2025","As the month of June enters the second week, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rising above $107,000, the crypto sector is once again buzzing with excitement. Altcoins are on fire, and smart investors are pouring into undervalued projects that have potential for 1,000%+ returns. Here are some of the best undervalued DeFi tokens that you should consider adding to your portfolio this month. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK) is an important player in the DeFi industry through its price oracle services. This is an important service that allows smart contracts to access data outside their ecosystems. In short, without this service, smart contracts could not take action based on real-world market events. The Chainlink oracles make it possible to deliver real-world data that is reliable. The project arrives at a price consensus through data aggregation from multiple sources. When these sources provide reliable data, they are paid in LINK. The global use of Chainlink is limitless. For instance, when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes live, it plans to integrate Chainlink data oracles. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is expected to become one of the biggest DeFi protocols in the world, which could increase the utility of Chainlink tenfold. Chainlink also plans to expand into other industries, such as insurance, where reliable data is needed to make payments on claims. One possible use case is flight insurance, where customers get paid if a flight is canceled. Chainlink could provide a reliable source of flight cancellation data, making payments to customers instantly. However, while Chainlink could experience a massive surge in utility, that is years away. The world has yet to accept the Chainlink oracles at the scale needed for massive growth soon. As such, investors looking for massive growth would be better served by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has already been quite successful in the ongoing presale. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The Shiba Inu (SHIB) project was launched anonymously in 2020 by a creator using the pseudonym Ryoshi. However, many have suggested that Ryoshi is a group of people, and not a single person. SHIB was created in response to DOGE, with the SHIB creators critical of the Dogecoin (DOGE) inflationary mode. Like the DOGE, it has a dog-theme mascot. One of the main downsides to SHIB is that it is prone to massive price fluctuations. This stems from the fact that it is a meme coin with limited utility and acceptance. As such, most online stores do not allow users to purchase items with SHIB, like they would with Bitcoin (BTC), for instance. While its low price makes it seem like an attractive prospect, it is worth noting that it could even lower. As such, a better alternative is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has a protocol designed for utility, and long-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A New Gamechanger Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built from the ground up to be a disruptive force in the crypto industry. The project offers lenders and borrowers the opportunity to participate in a well-balanced ecosystem that aims to find a balance between protocol security, liquidity, and profitability. When lenders deposit their assets in a pool, they begin to earn interest. The interest they receive is based on a pool’s utilization rate. Borrowers determine the utilization rate; as more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises. That causes the interest rate to rise, encouraging them to pay back their loans. At the same time, it incentivizes more lenders to deposit assets in a pool. This cycle creates maximum capital efficiency while also boosting the total liquidity of the protocol. Unlocking Liquidity With mtTokens Lenders receive mtToken in exchange for depositing assets in the lending pools. For instance, if a user deposits $2,300 worth of USDT in a pool, they receive mtUSDT tokens in return. These mtTokens are a tokenized representation of the deposit plus the interest the deposit accumulates. The mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, and they unlock instant liquidity for their holders. With the tokens, users can engage in trading on secondary exchanges where the ERC20 token standard is supported. Holders of mtTokens can redeem their tokens at any time to get back their deposit plus any interest accrued. To avoid placing too much pressure on the internal liquidity pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs). The DEXs and AMMs will provide an external avenue where users can easily redeem their tokens, even when the internal pools are under pressure. As such, those external pools boost the result of the internal reserves. MUTM Presale Details Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale. So far, over $10.4 million has been raised from the ongoing presale. There are over 11,900 buyers in the presale, with over 30% of the tokens preserved for this phase already sold. Tokens in the current phase are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price is set to rise by 16.67% to $0.035. If you are looking for one of the best presales of 2025 for massive gain as the altcoin season heats, you cannot go wrong with Mutuum Finance (MUTM. With analysts predicting over 1,000% in returns, this could be a true game-changer for your crypto portfolio.

2025-06-12T18:05:30,"Crypto Analyst Says New Bitcoin All-Time Highs Incoming, Updates Outlook on Ethereum","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of a massive breakout to fresh all-time highs. In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 704,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will likely enter an uptrend and hit $116,000 by early next week after a pullback from the $110,000 level. “Bitcoin: new all-time highs [Thursday].” Source: Kaleo/X The analyst also says that Bitcoin may no longer adhere to its four-year cycle, an idea that the flagship crypto asset has a predictable pattern connected to its halving events, when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. “I believe this is where we finally break out of the traditional four-year cycle revolving around the Bitcoin halving. Higher for longer. Supercycle.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,354 at time of writing, down 2.2% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may repeat a similar 2020 pattern and soon enter an explosive uptrend. “A lot of similarities on the chart to where we are now versus where we were in 2020. Spring of 2020 there was a major selloff from the COVID crash that sent ETH beneath HTF (high timeframe) support. Once that line was reclaimed, ETH was up only for the next 20 months. The recent selloff that led to the break beneath HTF support was caused by the Trump Tariff scare in the market. ETH is currently on the verge of reclaiming that line. Will history repeat itself with this leading to another great ETH bull run and accompanying alt season?” Source: Kaleo/X ETH is trading for $2,754 at time of writing, down 3.6% on the day.

2025-06-12T18:01:26,"Will Other States Copy Connecticut’s Bitcoin Ban?","Connecticut’s Crypto Ban: A Break from the National Trend Connecticut has signed onto the first of its kind in the U.S. to fully prohibit government engagement with digital assets, creating a sweeping law that prohibits state and local governments from owning, investing in, or accepting cryptocurrencies for any purpose. The move, signed into law as Public Act No. 25-66 on June 10, 2025, is done at a time when the majority of states — and the federal government — actively examine the place of Bitcoin and other digital assets in public fiscal policy. The new bill, endorsed by the Senate and House unanimously, expressly forbids state treasury, pension funds, and other state-operated institutions from investing any funds in Bitcoin or any other digital currencies. It also forbids state and local governments to receive payments in crypto for taxes, fees, or any other use, and prevents establishing a state-backed crypto reserve. Notably, the ban only holds for state services and public funds — Connecticut businesspeople and residents are otherwise free to buy, sell, and use crypto as governed by existing laws. Connecticut's action is also the reverse of a growing trend among other states. Arizona and New Hampshire already have legislation enacted to create state Bitcoin reserves, and Texas and North Carolina are presently deliberating the same. This is all the more surprising in the context of President Donald Trump issuing an executive order in March 2025 to request that federal agencies develop a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve from seized digital assets, demonstrating pro-crypto attitudes at the federal level. Lawmakers Cite Risks, Critics Warn of Missed Opportunity The supporters of Connecticut's prohibition claim that it is an informed choice to protect public money from the extreme volatility, security risks, and accounting intricacies of virtual assets. Lawmakers utilized the volatility of virtual currencies, the susceptibility to cyberattacks, and the intricacy of valuing such assets as key reasons for the prohibition. The bill also creates new standards for crypto businesses operating in the state, such as stricter licensing, compliance, and notification of customers, and stronger protections for minors who use digital wallets or crypto kiosks. Others warn that the ban will cut Connecticut taxpayers off from possible Bitcoin profits and stifle innovation. ”Connecticut has chosen to miss this opportunity—at least for now.”. But whereas other states are luckier in enjoying the fruits of Bitcoin reserves, we expect Connecticut to reconsider,” said Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter. Certain lawyers term the action symbolic rather than real, a political move and not one in reaction to truly existing threats, and cite the Democratic Party's firm grip on the state as being a key force in the bill's passage. Will Other States Follow Connecticut’s Lead — or Rebel? The state's move also hints at the piecemeal nature of U.S. cryptocurrency policy. While 27 states have introduced bills allowing public funds to invest in Bitcoin or other high-market-cap tokens, an ever-growing list — Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona included — have spurned or stymied such legislation in 2025 alone. This patchwork approach has created confusion for crypto business and investors, who must navigate a maze of incompatible state regimes and solutions to digital assets. While the controversy smolders, though, the issue is whether Connecticut's strong stance will prompt other states to emulate it with bans of their own, or whether it will provoke a backlash and fresh attempts at bringing digital assets into state coffers elsewhere. With the federal government's own plan for a Bitcoin reserve still in its infancy, the fate of state crypto policy far from determined.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9552/will-other-states-copy-connecticut-s-bitcoin-ban,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T17:55:14,"Mercurity Fintech to Raise $800M for Strategic Bitcoin Treasury Reserve","Mercurity Fintech Holding announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a Bitcoin treasury reserve. The New York-based digital fintech firm aims to use the funds to acquire and hold BTC as part of a broader strategy to reshape its treasury operations through tokenized finance. Mercurity Fintech Bets Big on Bitcoin According to the official press release , MFH plans to store the assets using institutional-grade blockchain custody infrastructure while integrating staking services and tokenized treasury tools to unlock yield and capital efficiency. The initiative represents a transition from traditional treasury models to a blockchain-aligned reserve structure designed to boost long-term asset exposure and bolster financial resilience. In parallel, MFH is set to move from the Russell Microcap Index to the Russell 2000 and 3000, a development that could enhance visibility among institutional investors and signal market validation for its blockchain-centric approach. In an official statement, Shi Qiu, CEO of the company, said, “We’re building this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the future financial infrastructure. We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem.” Bitcoin on the Books A growing number of public companies are integrating digital assets into their treasuries, with 117 firms now holding over 800,000 BTC, as per Binance Research’s latest stats . Recent adopters include GameStop, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., and Nakamoto, all following a model first implemented by Strategy and Michael Saylor. Trump Media & Technology Group joined the wave with a $2.5 billion Bitcoin initiative backed by 50 institutions. Ethereum is also gaining traction, as evidenced by SharpLink recently launching a $425 million ETH strategy advised by Consensys’ Joseph Lubin. Japan-based Metaplanet also continued its aggressive BTC acquisition. More recently, the Oslo-based cryptocurrency brokerage company, K33, also started holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet after raising $6.22 million via interest-free loans and new share and warrant issues.

2025-06-12T17:49:27,"Pi Coin Price Prediction: MACD Indicator Finally Flashing Green – $10 Incoming?","The persistent downtrend that has weighed on PI since mid-May may have finally run its course, with a golden cross on the daily MACD bolstering the near-term Pi Coin price outlook . While most altcoins staged recoveries through June, PI continued to slide, signaling a disconnect from broader market tailwinds. That prolonged sell-off has left PI down 43% over the past month, making it the worst performer among the top 100. But recent bullish momentum may have finally caught up to the token. Shaky Fundamentals Cloud Bullish Technical Outlook Despite the bullish technical outlook, Pi Coin’s future may hinge on ecosystem fundamentals as it stands at a crossroads, according to an X post by well-known PI commentator Pi Barter Mall. In their pessimistic outlook, Pi Barter Mall noted slow ecosystem development as the central obstacle to long-term growth. The fact of the matter is that the Pi ecosystem continues to struggle with adoption. Its price action remains largely speculative, lacking a meaningful use case to sustain long-term growth. This has also opened the door to liquidity issues, with short-term speculative trading amplifying deflationary pressure as unlocks continue at an average rate of $7 million PI tokens per day. PI token unlock schedule. Source: Piscan . The market struggles to absorb the excess supply without a rise in demand to stabilise Pi Coin price moves. Still, there is an optimistic case. Pi Barter Mall notes that mainstream exchange listings, such as a potential debut on Binance, could serve as major catalysts. If large-scale applications can be achieved, Pi Barter Mall suggests Pi could reclaim its $1–$3 range with real utility to encourage HODLing over flipping. Pi Price Analysis: Could a Golden Cross Push a Reversal? Given the underlying fundamental challenges, a $10 valuation for Pi Coin remains unrealistic—at least until Pi Barter Mall’s optimistic scenario materialises. That said, Pi coin could make a start on technical momentum alone as the recent breakout of a May-born falling wedge pattern pushes a potential golden cross on the daily. PI / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge. Source: TradingView, OKX. The MACD line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line, poised to flash green for the first time since Consensus 2025 unfolded as a sell-the-news event. Selling pressure appears exhausted, with the RSI rebounding from deep bearish territory at 40—an early signal that buy pressure is returning, opening the door for the next leg up. If momentum continues, the pattern suggests a potential 40% Pi Coin price rally to $0.8725, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level. Should bulls push further toward $1, Pi Coin would face a key accumulation zone at the 0.5 Fibonnaci level—a potential catalyst to fuel growth. However, if the golden cross is delayed or falters, strong support at $0.60 remains the critical downside level to watch for signs of a reversal. The Bull Market Could Be Back – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially as altcoins continue to lag behind the leading cryptocurrency. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $7 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 57% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

(MFH), a financial services and crypto company, has announced its intention to raise $800 million. The funds will be used to build a large Bitcoin (BTC) treasury and create a blockchain-based financial system. This move is part of the company’s broader strategy to become a major player in the fast-growing world of digital finance. No Mercurity To Build A New Kind of Bitcoin Treasury Unlike traditional companies that hold Bitcoin as a passive asset, Mercurity plans to use it actively. The Bitcoin acquired will be integrated into a yield-generating treasury model. This means the flagship crypto will not just sit in storage; instead, it will be used to earn returns through tokenized tools and staking services. In a recent statement, Mercurity’s CEO, Shi Qiu, said that Bitcoin will be a key financial tool in the future. With this in mind, the company wants to be a leader in the world of digital finance by using cryptocurrency, blockchain, and new financial tools. Mercurity is following a new trend in which companies use Bitcoin as more than just a reserve. Today, many businesses, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, are finding ways to make money with their crypto holdings instead of letting them sit idle. Companies like Blockstream and MARA Digital are already doing this. They use their Bitcoin reserve for services like lending , staking, and other activities that help them earn extra income. Mercurity’s Bitcoin Funding Strategy Remains a Mystery While the company has revealed how it plans to use the $800 million, it has not disclosed how it intends to raise the capital. The New York-based firm is yet to explain whether the money will come from selling company shares, taking on debt, or using other financing methods. Following the news, Mercurity’s stock price rose 1.9% during regular trading but dropped 2.84% after hours. The dip may reflect investor concerns about the unknowns in the company’s funding plan. Mercurity Focus Beyond Crypto This news comes at a key time for Mercurity. The company is expected to be added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indexes, which are important stock lists that many big investors follow. If the company is included in these indexes, it could help more people notice Mercurity and make it easier to trade its shares. Besides working with cryptocurrency, Mercurity also makes cooling systems for data centers that run Artificial Intelligence (AI). These systems help save energy, which is vital because AI needs a lot of power. Mercurity also offers services to large companies and wealthy clients.

2025-06-12T17:30:45,"Shiba Inu Burn Rate Soars 1,869% In One Day, But Doesn’t Make A Dent In Supply","Shiba Inu has witnessed a dramatic spike in its burn rate over the past 24 hours, according to data from Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn.com. The total number of tokens sent to burn addresses surged by over 1,800% during this period, marking one of the most n otable increases in recent weeks. The spike in SHIB burns is coming as the Shiba Inu price is attempting to stabilize above the $0.000013 price level. However, despite the short-term surge in token burning, the scale of the burn is insignificant when placed beside the meme coin’s massive total supply. Shiba Inu Burn Activity Spikes Suddenly Data from Shiba Inu burn tracker Shibburn shows that 4,578,466 SHIB tokens were sent to burn addresses in the past 24 hours, which represents a 1869% increase from the previous 24-hour timeframe. Interestingly, the majority of the tokens burned in the latest cycle came from just two large transactions. The first involved the movement of 3,295,542 SHIB tokens to a designated burn wallet known as CA. Two hours later, a second transaction saw another 1,173,708 tokens sent into a separate address labeled BA-2. On-chain data links both transactions to a wallet identified as “0xa9d1,” which is tied to the Coinbase10 label. This means that the burns may have been executed by a user on the Coinbase crypto exchange. Combined, the two burns amounted to 4,469,520 SHIB tokens and were primarily responsible for the 1,869% jump in the daily burn rate. Shiba Inu’s Large Supply Still Far Ahead Although the number of SHIB burned in the past 24 hours is a lot, it is actually small compared to the amount of SHIB burned during periods of high activity surrounding Shiba Inu . Also, it barely makes a dent in the circulating supply of Shiba Inu. The numbers show a 1,800% spike in 24 hours, but the impact of the burn is somewhat negligible in the grand scheme of SHIB’s supply structure. Shiba Inu was created with a total supply of 999.9 trillion SHIB tokens. Of this total supply, 410.7 trillion SHIB has been burned and removed from circulation, meaning there are still 589.9 trillion SHIB in total supply. Out of this total supply, only 4.7 trillion SHIB tokens are currently staked, meaning that there are presently about 584.5 trillion SHIB tokens in circulation. When placed next to such a massive figure, the 4.58 million burned in the past 24 hours is barely noticeable both numerically and in terms of price effect. For SHIB’s supply to reduce meaningfully enough to influence price over time, far larger and more sustained burns would need to occur. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001272, down by 4.9% in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-soars-1869/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Shiba Inu|coinbase|Coinbase10 Label|meme coin|shib|SHIB burn|SHIB news|SHIB price Shiba Inu burn|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibburn|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT",cryptocompare

The company’s average cost per Bitcoin is now $78,582, following this latest purchase, which delivered a 22% yield increase compared to its prior acquisition in late May. This latest move is in line with DDC’s long-term strategy to integrate Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. In a statement about the purchase, Founder, Chairwoman, and CEO Norma Chu reaffirmed the company’s unwavering Bitcoin strategy. “Today’s 38 BTC acquisition proves our focused execution. We continue to aim for higher BTC yield return for our shareholders,” she said. Chu also noted the symbolic value of each acquisition: “With every Bitcoin added, we strengthen shareholder exposure to digital scarcity—now at 0.029679 BTC per 1,000 shares. We remain uncompromising in our pursuit of being a top global corporate holder status.” Positioning Bitcoin as a Core Asset While most companies remain cautious in their approach to digital assets, DDC Enterprise said it has aggressively positioned Bitcoin as a long-term financial hedge and store of value. The company said it has structured its treasury strategy around this conviction, acquiring BTC at what it considers optimal market entry points. Its BTC-per-share metric—now sitting at 0.029679 per 1,000 shares—is touted as a novel value proposition for shareholders interested in digital asset exposure through traditional equity markets. The acquisition is also reflective of a growing trend among listed companies that use Bitcoin not merely as an investment, but as a strategic balance sheet tool. DDC’s move indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upside, despite market volatility and regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. DDC Enterprise said it is using BitGo as its official custodian. The firm said that by using BitGo’s custody solutions, DDC seeks to support its growing digital asset strategy with scalable and secure infrastructure designed to meet the demands of institutional investors.

Declining dollar dominance and inflation protection use-cases may also boost bitcoin’s BTC appeal, even if long-dated U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, the report said. Altcoins may lag unless they benefit from specific catalysts, such as ETF approvals or protocol developments. Meanwhile, public companies are increasingly adding crypto to their balance sheets, aided by a 2024 rule change allowing ""mark-to-market"" accounting for digital assets. While this trend is expanding demand, it’s also introducing new systemic risks. Firms that fund crypto buys with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing options dry up or prices fall sharply. Regulatory clarity Regulatory developments are also expected to reshape the market, the report said. The Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill now heading to the House. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing digital assets. If passed, it could clarify rules for both issuers and investors. Separately, the SEC is considering more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds and proposals involving staking and altcoins. Some rulings could be made as early as July, and the rest are likely to be finalized by October. Overall, bitcoin appears poised to benefit from both macro and structural tailwinds in the second half of the year, while the outlook for altcoins will depend on navigating a more complex and still-evolving regulatory and liquidity environment, according to the report.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/12/bitcoin-will-rally-as-us-growth-improves-crypto-bills-progress-coinbase-research,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH","Markets|Bitcoin|Macro|Regulation|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T17:14:37,"Crypto market drops 4% as ETH ETFs outperform BTC, altcoins fall sharply","The global crypto market has taken a sharp turn in the past 24 hours. Total market capitalisation has dropped nearly 4% to around $3.51 trillion. Almost every asset in the top 100 list is now showing losses. Bitcoin trades near $107,688, while Ethereum is around $2,736. Altcoins are feeling the squeeze as well, with Dogecoin at $0.1877 , Solana at $158 , and Cardano at $0.6827 . Source: CoinMarketCap Amid these declines, spot Ethereum ETFs in the US continue to attract larger inflows than Bitcoin ETFs—a shift that hints at deeper changes in investor behaviour. Spot Ethereum ETFs attract more flows US-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds continue to outperform their Bitcoin equivalents. On 11 June, BlackRock’s ETH ETF brought in a one-day inflow of $160 million. Ethereum ETFs in total pulled $240 million in net inflows. Overall, Ethereum ETFs have seen cumulative inflows of $3.74 billion over 18 straight days. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs totalled $45.22 billion, but inflows for 11 June were a more modest $133 million. The continuing strength of ETH ETF flows has coincided with Ethereum’s rebound from recent lows. On-chain analysts interpret this as a sign of shifting sentiment, fuelled by the Pectra upgrade, increasing DeFi activity, and more favourable regulatory commentary from figures such as SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. Bitcoin and altcoins slide as volatility concerns rise The broader downturn in crypto assets has been led by Bitcoin’s decline of around 1.68%, dragging it down from earlier highs near $110,350 to current levels near $107,688. Ethereum lost about 4.29%, dipping from intraday highs of $2,868 to today’s $2,736. Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins suffered deeper losses. Dogecoin fell roughly 7.5% to $0.1876, Solana dropped about 5–6% to $158, and Cardano slipped nearly 5.4% to $0.6827. These declines reflect a market-wide pullback following softer US inflation data and renewed uncertainty stemming from US-China trade discussions. On-chain data points to underpriced volatility risk On-chain data highlights several warning signs. Much of the supply of Bitcoin is clustered close to current price levels. When coins accumulate around a spot, even small flips in sentiment can trigger outsized moves. Meanwhile, options markets appear complacent—implied volatility remains low, even as on-chain activity suggests increasing volatility risk. Similarly, Ethereum options show subdued volatility pricing, despite its rebound and growing ETF interest. Analysts suggest both chains may be underestimating potential spikes during events like regulatory developments or protocol changes. Macro triggers and future direction Crypto markets are reacting in step with macroeconomic trends. The increasing tensions in the Middle East and US President Donald Trump saying he would impose unilateral tariffs on trading partners within two weeks have fed into asset-price uncertainty. Equities followed suit, with the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 falling 0.37% and 0.27% respectively, adding to crypto’s downward pressure. However, Institutions continued with activities despite the market volatility. The Ant Group is advancing plans to launch stablecoins in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg. The US Senate also voted to proceed with a substitute amendment to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act. These developments show that regulatory momentum in digital assets continues even amid price volatility. Ethereum’s progress is further underpinned by the recently activated Pectra upgrade and influential endorsements from regulatory figures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maintains key technical levels. On-chain analysts highlight support at $97,600 and resistance near $115,400. Investor sentiment has cooled somewhat, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index easing from 65 into more neutral territory. Yet on-chain data suggests selling remains limited. Only around $200 million of realised losses have been recorded, indicating present declines have been absorbed by long-term holders.

2025-06-12T17:10:23,"Move over James Wynn, Hyperliquid may have found its next big influencer","Since Hyperliquid burst onto the scene, it has minted new millionaires and made many new paupers, and Andrew Tate appears to be the latest to be joining the fun. One of the biggest influencers generating traffic for Hyperliquid has been James Wynn, a self-proclaimed “high-risk leverage trader and memecoin maxi” who claims to have risen from humble beginnings in a crime-ridden UK town and entered the crypto space in 2022. Despite his considerable recent losses, Wynn is optimistic he will make it all back, a mentality he shares with Andrew Tate, another influencer making big moves on the perpetual futures DEX. Andrew Tate( @Cobratate ) doesn’t seem to be good at perps trading. He has made 76 trades on Hyperliquid, with only 27 wins — a 35.53% win rate and a total loss of $583K. He's currently long $ETH with 25x leverage. https://t.co/09Rmkt6BIb pic.twitter.com/8LleWvjVXv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 12, 2025 Tate’s tumultuous journey on Hyperliquid Tate seems to have started his trading journey on Hyperliquid at the end of 2024. However, his activity on the platform did not blow up until early June 2025 when Tate shared a post on X showcasing a 138.5% profit on a 25x leveraged Ethereum (ETH) long position. The trade initially appeared successful, earning him $22,000 in unrealized profits at the time. However, he used high leverage, which made it vulnerable to price fluctuations. It did not take long for blockchain transparency to reveal a less favorable outcome as crypto sleuths were able to trace Tate’s Hyperliquid wallet using his referral code (“TOPGTOPSTRIKER”). They found that his cumulative profit and loss (PnL) showed a net loss of approximately $597,000–$600,000 across all trades on the platform since he began trading there. His 25x leveraged ETH position was liquidated after a slight price dip, costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars and forcing him to delete the initial post of him bragging about the 138% gain. Fast forward to June 8, and Tate shared a post about a potential $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position on Hyperliquid, with the caption, “100M BTC long. My turn?” Many thought the statement was made in reference to James Wynn’s billion-dollar BTC bets on the platform, but there is no direct evidence suggesting this. It is also not yet known if he has executed the trade, and some speculate it was a promotional stunt to drive referral sign-ups. He later took down the post as well. Tate insists he plans to make it all back Tate’s trading losses were revealed when he attempted to earn fees from new user sign-ups by sharing his referral code. Unlike centralized exchanges, Hyperliquid’s on-chain nature makes all trades publicly traceable, and crypto traders were quick to identify Tate’s wallet and expose his $600,000 loss, triggering widespread mockery on X. Andrew Tate’s trades on Hyperliquid have run up to $597,000–$600,000 in losses. Source: LookOnChain As usual, Tate was defiant in the face of the critics, stating, “I’ll make it all back with one trade,” but this did little to quell criticism. So far, LookOnChain claims Tate has made 76 trades on Hyperliquid and has only had 27 wins — a 35.53% win rate. He’s currently long $ETH with 25x leverage; however, his overall account is still down by nearly $600,000. Thanks to the volatile markets, it is unclear if his ETH long can end his streak of losses. While Tate’s posts about Hyperliquid have drawn more attention to the platform, his deleted posts and public exposure have made him a cautionary tale about the risks of leveraged trading and the transparency of DEXs like Hyperliquid. Now, many on X are waiting to see which runs out first, his ego or his ETH.
