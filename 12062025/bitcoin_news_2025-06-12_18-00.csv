2025-06-12T15:52:36,"DeFi Adding $5B of Solana Buying Power With New Line of Credit","DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV), the Nasdaq-listed firm pursuing a solana SOL treasury strategy, is planning to get some more dry powder to boost its SOL stack. According to a Thursday press release , the company has secured a $5 billion equity line of credit with RK Capital Management. The agreement allows DeFi Dev to sell shares at its discretion, so long as it meets conditions like filing a resale registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it plans to file the necessary paperwork soon. ""We now have the flexibility and structure we need to scale,"" said Joseph Onorati, Chief Executive Officer. ""This is a clean, strategic path to continue growing SOL per share and compounding validator yield."" DFDV shares rebounded from early losses and were up 12% during the Thursday session. The company, formerly known as real estate tech platform Janover, is part of a growing trend of publicly-traded firms raising funds by selling shares and debt to add cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet, following Strategy's playbook with bitcoin BTC. The firm focuses on Solana, accumulating the network's native token and operating validators. It held over 609,00 SOL tokens as of May 16, worth $96 million at current prices. The latest move comes shortly after the firm withdrew a previous filing for a $1 billion share sale, with plans to refile again.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/12/defi-adding-5b-of-solana-buying-power-with-new-line-of-credit,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|SPONSORED","Finance|Solana|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T15:37:02,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP: A Technical Look at Whether to Buy, Sell, or Hold This Week","Analyzing the current market trends and chart patterns, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP present intriguing cases for traders this week. This piece delves into whether these leading cryptocurrencies signal a time to invest, offload, or maintain current holdings. Discover which of these digital assets may be poised for a breakout or further downturn. Bitcoin Market: Steady Growth with Bullish Focus at Critical Levels Bitcoin saw a steady price climb over the past month with a 5.70% gain, reflecting a calm yet positive performance. Over the last six months, a 9.85% rise demonstrated continued investor interest and an overall upward trend. Weekly price behavior, marked by a 4.08% increase, confirms resilience in the market during this period with gradual recovery evident in the price progression. Bitcoin currently trades within a price range of $94,832 to $113,326.8. Nearest resistance is located at $121,869.42, while the nearest support stands at $84,880.08. The Awesome Oscillator at 1,723.82 indicates positive energy, while the Momentum Indicator at 3,965.46 also suggests upward movement. The Relative Strength Index near 61.98 points to a moderately strong market. Bulls appear dominant, but caution exists as no clear long-term trend emerges. Tactical trades may be effective, with buying near support and selling near resistance for balanced risk and reward. Close monitoring of key signals is essential. Ethereum: Short-Term Rally Amid Mixed Half-Year Trends Past month ETH data shows a clear short-term gain, with a one-week increase of 7.61% and a monthly rise of 10.99%. Over the past six months, Ethereum experienced a decline of 28.12%, reflecting a challenging longer-term trend despite recent upward momentum. This mix of short-term recovery against a longer-term downturn highlights a market that can catch sudden lifts but remains influenced by broader bearish pressures over time. Current price action finds Ethereum trading in a range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. The nearest support is marked at $1318.72 while resistance looms near $3395.40. Bulls appear to be gaining ground in the short term, as reflected by recent gains and positive momentum indicators. However, the relative strength index shows upward pressure could soon face pushback if overbought conditions emerge. Traders might consider positions around the current range with stop-loss orders near the lower support, while monitoring for potential breakouts above $3395.40. XRP Price Snapshot: Week Gains Amid Minor Long-Term Decline XRP experienced a slight weekly increase of 2.08% with a monthly drop of 3.14% and a six-month decline of 1.98%. The coin’s performance has shown limited volatility, as modest gains balanced out larger period declines. Price activity over the past month and half-year has been mixed, featuring small upward moves offset by gradual fading values over time. Indicators reflected a neutral mood, with the market quietly adjusting without dramatic swings. The recent behavior indicates a consolidation phase where neither bulls nor bears have taken full control of the market. XRP currently trades in a price range of $1.95 to $2.53, sitting above clear support at $1.73 and below resistance at $2.88. A second resistance is seen at $3.45 while a lower support is marked at $1.15. The market’s momentum is positive with an indicator reading of 0.1126, though the Awesome Oscillator stands slightly negative. Moving averages suggest moderate buying interest. The overall price lies within well-defined boundaries, indicating a lack of a decisive trend. Traders may consider long entries near support levels, with profit targets around resistance zones while remaining cautious. Conclusion BTC shows potential for growth with current trends. ETH appears stable but needs close watching for market shifts. XRP remains volatile, requiring cautious consideration. Each offers unique opportunities depending on market interest and individual risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T15:30:32,"Will Dogecoin Moon Or Crash? This Indicator Holds The Answer","According to market technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) a single metric—the 20-month simple moving average—could be the line that could separate another vertical rally from a gut-wrenching breakdown for Dogecoin. Currently, DOGE sits comfortable above that moving average, now plotted at $0.1751. The black curve on Cat’s chart shows only three clean retests of the 20-month SMA since 2014. All Eyes On Dogecoin’s 20-Month SMA The first came in March 2017, when price tapped the average near $0.00020 and then ripped more than 9,000% into the January 2018 peak. The second occurred in the winter of 2020, with price kissing the average at roughly one-fourth of one cent before the parabolic 34,500% run to $0.73 the following May. The third and current encounter began in August last year when DOGE rallied by more than 480%. As of today, two successive monthly candles dipped into the zone just below twenty-cents, but both were bought aggressively, leaving higher wicks and preserving the upward slope of the average. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as that moving average remains intact, “we’re going higher.” A decisive monthly close beneath $0.175 would, by this read, place the entire structure at risk and could usher in the sort of multi-month down-trend that followed the 2018 and 2021 climaxes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Moment This Month, Predicts Analyst TOTAL2 Needs To Break Out Analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) overlays that micro view on a much broader canvas. His chart tracks the total crypto market capitalization ex-Bitcoin (TradingView ticker “TOTAL2”) in monthly candles back to 2017. Two bold yellow trend-lines define a seven-year rising channel whose upper rail repelled price at the January 2018 and November 2021 alt-season tops. Since the June 2022 low, the market has carved out an ascending triangle: a rising series of higher lows presses against a flat-topped supply zone between roughly $1.43 trillion and $1.7 trillion. The apex of the triangle now looms; aggregate alt-cap is already worth about $1.2 trillion — all that stands between the current print and a confirmed breakout is a monthly close above the upper edge of that yellow rectangle. Kevin’s projection measures the height of the pattern and adds it to the breakout level, dropping a vertical marker that intersects the mid-channel near $5.89 trillion. Kevin’s first Fibonacci extensions target is the 1.618 at $4.06 trillion. Higher extensions at 1.886, 2.0 and 2.618 cluster around $4.57 trillion, 5.89 trillion and $6.9 trillion respectively, the last of which coincides almost exactly with the channel’s ceiling and is circled as the analyst’s ultimate upside objective. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Why does that matter for Dogecoin? The meme-coin’s two explosive cycles began only after TOTAL2 had broken its own prior-cycle high and money poured into non-Bitcoin assets. Kevin states that “altcoins are just scratching the surface of what is possible in the coming months,” provided that macro-liquidity and regulatory factors permit capital rotation out of Bitcoin into the wider market. In that scenario the 20-month SMA on DOGE would likely continue to slope higher, setting the stage for an explosive move higher. Conversely, failure of the alt-cap triangle would make a sustained loss of the SMA far more probable, robbing DOGE of its historical launch-pad. For now, the indicator holds—and with it the prospect that Dogecoin could be primed for yet another bout of furious upside. But as both analysts caution, the monthly close will tell the story: above the 20-month SMA and an alt-cap breakout, or below it and back into hibernation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

2025-06-12T15:28:20,"An Unfazed Tim Draper is Standing by his $250,000 Bitcoin Prediction, Here’s Why","As chaos ensues over the increasing U.S. deficit amidst the continued trade wars that followed Trump’s increased tariff rates, cryptocurrency personalities are speaking up about the possible impact of the ongoing development on Bitcoin . Billionaire investor Tim Draper is one such figure, convinced that Bitcoin could benefit positively from the persistent volatility recorded in the traditional finance market. In a recent post shared to X, Draper doubled down on his previous forecast for Bitcoin, with a price target of $250,000. The billionaire investor told his 268,000 followers that Bitcoin could kick off a bullish marathon this year, despite hitting a new all-time high 15 days ago. “Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows.” He wrote. Outlining the main factors responsible for “pushing Bitcoin forward” at this time, Draper pointed to renewed optimism from market participants, as President Trump works out trade deals, the incoming regulatory frameworks essential for the provision of market clarity, and the increase in Web3 applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain. He observed that traditional banks are adding to their offerings, noting that JP Morgan plans to join the race, while businesses pile in— a development he believes could bring about mainstream adoption. He went on to make the following observations; “Bitcoin is extremely low risk compared to some other cryptocurrencies and stocks because people believe in it. It’s earning the title of a store of value. Meanwhile, Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum while keeping a solid foundation. The smart money sees what comes next.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin kicked off June with an opening price of $104,637 and traded at an intraday high of $105,884. On Thursday, Bitcoin sharply declined as selling pressure intensified, resulting in a revisit to the $100,000 price mark. Down 8.12% from its all-time high of $111,970, with a 2.04% decline in market cap value, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $107,598.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/an-unfazed-tim-draper-is-standing-by-his-250000-bitcoin-prediction-heres-why/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Tim Draper",cryptocompare

Here Is The Last BTC Amount It Purchased","Tokyo-based fashion company ANAP Holdings has significantly increased its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing an additional 50.56 BTC over the past two days. According to the company’s latest corporate statement, this latest purchase brings its total Bitcoin reserves to 153.4627 BTC. Japanese Fashion Brand ANAP Holdings Increases Bitcoin Reserves with New Acquisition The move reflects ANAP Holdings’ commitment to integrating digital assets into its treasury strategy and adds to the growing number of publicly traded companies in Japan and around the world turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. While ANAP is known for its trend-driven fashion collections, it has recently increased its focus on Web3 technologies and blockchain-based finance. This latest BTC purchase reflects a deepening belief in the long-term value and role of cryptocurrencies in the modern economy. The company did not disclose the purchase price or the timing of the transactions, but this addition brings ANAP’s total Bitcoin value into the millions of dollars based on current market prices.

2025-06-12T15:19:04,"Donald Trump: Administration Will Work Toward 'Clear and Simple' Crypto Frameworks","MANHATTAN — U.S. President Donald Trump again touted his crypto bona fides at a conference Thursday, telling an audience it was an ""honor"" to be considered a crypto president. Speaking in a 90-second recorded video at Coinbase's (COIN) State of Crypto Summit (no relation to the CoinDesk newsletter with the same name), Trump reiterated comments he's made at other events about ending his predecessor's so-called war on crypto and forming a working group to examine digital assets. Trump also referenced legislation working its way through Congress. ""My administration is working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act supporting the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins, and we also will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin,"" he told a filled room to scattered applause. The Senate's GENIUS Act will go through a procedural vote on Thursday, following a successful effort on Wednesday . Meanwhile, two key House committees advanced a market structure bill on Tuesday. Trump also noted his executive order on establishing a national bitcoin BTC reserve, saying, ""we created the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the United States Digital Asset stockpile,"" though neither has actually been created yet. Coinbase donated a million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund, and was a major backer of the Fairshake super PAC in the 2024 election. It's already committed tens of millions of dollars to Fairshake for the 2026 election. Following his remarks, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle (CRCL) CEO Jeremy Allaire reflected on crypto and their respective company's evolutions, arguing that crypto could become a bigger part of the global financial system. Allaire, whose company went public on the New York Stock Exchange last week, said it was difficult for Circle to meet with backers or other entities a decade ago. ""It was amazing to me that, like, I'd literally walk in a room with an insurance company, [and] they were literally, like, we were not sure we're allowed to have this meeting,"" Allaire said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/12/donald-trump-administration-will-work-toward-clear-and-simple-crypto-frameworks,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Policy|Donald Trump|Coinbase|Circle|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T15:15:09,"Tether bought a 32% stake in Canadian gold company","Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has significantly expanded its Bitcoin-and-gold investment strategy by acquiring a 31.9% stake in Canadian-listed gold royalty firm Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. The stablecoin company has been accumulating Bitcoin and Gold aggressively over recent months. This is likely a part of the firm’s strategy to bolster its holdings and support for the USDT stablecoin. Paolo Ardoino acknowledged that gold remains a demonstrated store of value On June 10, 2025, Tether Investments obtained 78,421,780 Common Shares of Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This amounts to roughly 31.9% of Elemental’s issued and outstanding common shares. According to credible sources, a private agreement allegedly made this deal offshore. The stablecoin firm also entered into an option agreement with AlphaStream Limited to acquire an additional 34,444,580 shares after October 29, 2025, provided Elemental approves it. If the deal is successful, the stablecoin firm will be able to diversify its investment in gold further . Commenting on the developments, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that Tether is investing in gold and Bitcoin as a part of its long-term strategy to build a stronger and clearer financial system for the future. Ardoino acknowledged that Bitcoin is the best hedge against inflation, but gold has remained a solid investment to preserve value throughout history. The announcement came after Tether Group had gone public on its holdings of more than 100,000 Bitcoins, an estimated total of physical gold worth nearly 80 tons, and its very own Tether Gold, a token linked to physical gold. Ardoino emphasized that they support financial systems supported by actual assets rather than promises. For him, their bet on Elemental is consistent with their continuing belief that tangible assets like Bitcoin and gold will act as backing for the most sustainable forms of digital value. Following Tether’s move, analysts anticipate that institutional investors are accumulating both Bitcoin and Gold , the only 2 assets with over 40% returns in the last 12 months in investments. However, the first time this has happened, Bitcoin recently overtook Gold in US ownership. Therefore, it appears to be a good idea for the USDT issuer to spread funds within these two classes of assets. Tether’s investment in Elemental Altus to enhance digital financial products Elemental Altus Royalties provides Tether exposure to global gold production using a royalty and streaming model without the direct operational risk of mining. This fits with Tether’s desire for strategic, low-risk exposure to real-world assets that improve the transparency and stability of digital financial products. Tether Investments could potentially take a more active role in engagement with the management of Elemental and its board, searching for the ways Elemental can work together, take part in governance, and develop long-term capital strategy, subject to regulations framework as well as market conditions. The transaction was conducted by Canadian securities laws, including National Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids, and was exempt from the formal takeover bid legislation. It is worth noting that Tether Investments invests capital from Tether’s profits and extra reserves in many different areas where technology, infrastructure, and practical use intersect. Its portfolio invests in artificial intelligence, financial services, energy, biotech, education, and digital media. They also hold important shares in commodities, remittances, and sports and entertainment industries. Tether Investments puts funds in companies with long-term potential to increase access, efficiency, and resilience in emerging and developed markets. It complements Tether Group’s larger goal of supporting decentralized systems in general, stimulating infrastructure resilience, and increasing the real-world availability of open and transparent technologies.

2025-06-12T15:13:47,"GameStop lacks a strategy but GME shares continue to survive due to ‘greater fools’","GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) opened more than 15% down on Thursday after announcing plans of raising $1.75 billion through a convertible notes offering to potentially expand its BTC holdings. According to the gaming merchandise retailer, net proceeds from the said offering will be used for general corporate purposes, “including making investments in a manner consistent with GME’s investment policy.” And adding cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, to the balance sheet has been a key component of the company’s investment policy this year. In May, it spent around half a billion dollars to load up on 4,710 BTC. Despite today’s decline, GME shares are up more than 10% versus their year-to-date low in April. Why isn’t the Bitcoin strategy helping GameStop stock? A significant pullback in GameStop stock this morning suggests the company’s Bitcoin strategy is failing to excite investors the way it does those invested in MicroStrategy. Part of the reason could be that MSTR started buying BTC when it was trading at less than $12,000. In comparison, GME is loading up on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap when it already sits near all-time highs of $111,000. For investors, this may be concerning since buying Bitcoin at an already elevated price could mean a significantly muted return than what MicroStrategy has been able to generate for its shareholders in recent years. Note that GameStop shares do not currently pay a dividend to incentivize ownership, either. Wedbush says GME’s crypto strategy makes no sense According to Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, the company that’s often referred to as the original meme stock lacks a clear strategy to revitalise its core video game business. Still, GME shares continue to thrive due to “the existence of greater fools willing to pay more than twice its asset value for its shares.” In his research note to clients, Pachter went on to argue that GameStop’s crypto strategy doesn’t make sense in the first place, given it’s “already trading at 2.4x cash, making it unlikely that converting more cash to crypto will drive an even greater premium.” Considering fundamentals and valuation metrics tied to GME stock, investors are better off parking their capital directly in Bitcoin or a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), he concluded. Should you invest in GME shares today? GameStop stock remains unattractive also because it recently reported a year-over-year decline in net sales for its first quarter. The gaming merchandise retailer generated about $732 million in net sales, down significantly from $882 million in the same quarter last year. Investors should also note that not a lot of Wall Street analysts cover GME shares anymore. Those who do, on average, have a sell rating on the NYSE-listed firm and find it fairly valued at about $13.50 in 2025.

2025-06-12T15:06:43,"Why South Africa May Leapfrog the World in Bitcoin Adoption: Interview With VALR CMO Ben Caselin","As the global crypto landscape matures, Africa is undoubtedly emerging as one of the hottest regions to watch – where regulatory clarity, grasroots adoption, and institutional interest are starting to covnerge. Positioning itself at the centr of this transformation, VALR is a Johannesburg-based exchange that’s now leading the continent in terms of trading volumes. In the following interview, Ben Caselin, the Chief Marketing Officer at VALR, as well as a veteran of crypto hubs such as Hong Kong and Dubai, shares his perspective on the state of Bitcoin adoption in underserved communities, the evolving role of decentralized finance, and why integrity as opposed to hype may be crypto’s biggest asset. How would you characterize the current state of the cryptocurrency market in South Africa, and what unique challenges or opportunities does it present? The South African market for crypto has come a long way and is well-positioned to see more growth in the coming years. Crypto adoption, particularly around stablecoins and Bitcoin, is taking place at all levels of society. There are numerous projects driving the uptake of Bitcoin in townships and among communities who have for too long been excluded from the traditional financial system. At the same time, we have seen pronounced institutional interest in crypto assets, from companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries and remittance companies looking to leverage stablecoin infrastructure, to banks looking into expanding their services to accommodate for crypto. With regulatory frameworks evolving globally, how is VALR navigating the changing regulatory landscape in South Africa and other markets where you’re expanding? In South Africa, already for years, VALR has closely worked with the country’s regulator, the FSCA, and we maintain healthy communication channels. In my view, South Africa’s regulatory regime is among the world’s foremost, perhaps even better than those in places like Singapore or Hong Kong. We do also have approval, through Poland, to offer crypto services in the European Union, but regulatory developments in Europe have been somewhat constrained. We continue to follow such developments closely. At the same time, we are exploring other licenses that can make it easier for VALR to pursue global expansion. What trends are you observing around institutional adoption of crypto in South Africa and across the African continent? In South Africa, especially since the FSCA’s licensing regime has come into effect, we have seen interest from a range of financial services providers looking to expand their offerings to their customers. We are partnering with several remittance companies, where VALR provides the necessary infrastructure and liquidity and, similarly, we are closely working with some of the largest banks in Africa to assist them in expanding their services to include crypto as well. We are not yet in a position to give any more information, but we do expect to make announcements around these developments in the next few months. I believe that within the next two to three years, we will see most major banks in Africa offer access to bitcoin and USD-pegged stablecoins to their customers, and all major remittance companies leverage crypto infrastructure to optimise for cross-border payments. How does VALR approach the integration or support of decentralized finance (DeFi) within its ecosystem, and what role do you see DeFi playing in Africa’s financial future? We hold the view that DeFi is here to stay, but also that from a user experience perspective, DeFi is not for everyone. On VALR, we have recently launched ‘DeFi Lending’, making it very easy for customers to earn a yield on their stablecoins and tokens by lending out their assets on platforms like Aave, without actually having to leave the VALR platform at all. This is one of the ways in which we are working to make crypto accessible to more and more people from all walks of life. What specific measures does VALR take to ensure the security of customer assets and data, particularly given the rise in cyber threats targeting exchanges? VALR takes security very seriously. We have a strong and pro-active security team who monitors activities at all levels of operation. We also work with external security firms for regular penetration testing, and constantly tighten security based on evolving threats. Other than that, we don’t share details about the specific measures we take. How do you balance innovation and compliance in a space that is constantly evolving and often ahead of regulation? We strive to balance innovation and compliance through communication. We are law-abiding, we don’t go where we are not welcome, and we believe that being compliant is the surest way to protect customers over the long term. We are also relatively conservative when it comes to token listings and leveraged trading and even our marketing spend is measured. We aim to establish VALR as a trusted financial institution that can be around for decades. Perhaps most importantly, VALR is a values-driven organisation, which means that we never compromise on our values for the sake of profit. Instead, we believe that principles like truthfulness, integrity and service set us up for long-term growth and will guide us well into the future. As VALR expands internationally, how do you plan to maintain trust, transparency, and alignment with local financial and legal standards across jurisdictions? From day one, which is now over 7 years ago, VALR has upheld the highest standards of integrity – this makes it easier for us to obtain licenses as they become available around the world, since we are compliant by default. In other words, unlike some of our competitors, we don’t go around breaking rules and then proceed to get our act together as regulation takes shape. Instead, forfeiting superficial growth we take a gradual approach to global expansion and prioritise doing so in a safe and sustainable manner. This has worked well for VALR and continues to be our approach into the future.

2025-06-12T15:05:54,"Crypto approaching systemic risk territory, FSB's Knot fires warning","Risk from crypto assets may soon threaten the global financial system, the outgoing Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot warned. Speaking in Madrid on Thursday, Knot said that until now, crypto did not pose a systemic risk . However, recent developments are changing that. “At the FSB, we have long maintained that crypto does not yet pose a systemic risk, but recent developments suggest we may be approaching a tipping point,” he said. He pointed out that stablecoin issuers now hold large sums of US Treasuries, a development he called “a segment we must monitor closely.” Stablecoins, unlike Bitcoin or other crypto tokens whose prices swing wildly, are meant to stay pegged at one dollar each. They are now under the microscope in the US Congress, where lawmakers are preparing the first major rules for digital assets. At the same time, several European Central Bank officials have voiced worries about the risks these tokens could create. ECB says that crypto can cause financial instability In its May Financial Stability Review, the ECB highlighted growing dangers from crypto assets such as stablecoins. It noted that the rising values of these digital tokens and their deeper ties to traditional banks and markets could add to financial instability. Knot, who also heads the Dutch central bank, stressed that making it easier for everyday investors to buy crypto has increased links with the financial system. “Barriers for retail users have dropped significantly, particularly with the introduction of crypto ETFs; the interlinkages with the traditional financial system continue to grow,” he said. He added that as the crypto world changes, “so must our regulatory frameworks.” Knot’s terms at both the FSB and the Dutch central bank end on June 30. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will succeed him at the FSB, but the Dutch government has yet to name someone to lead its central bank. Knot’s remarks came a day after the US Senate voted to move forward with a bill that would set up official rules for stablecoins. The motion to end debate on an updated version of the GENIUS Act passed with overwhelming support: eighteen Democrats joined almost all Republicans in voting to advance the bill. Before the GENIUS Act can become law, it needs a few more votes in the Senate and then approval in the House. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told The Hill on Tuesday that she expects the Senate to hold a final vote on the bill next week. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bitcoin’s price posted a minor recovery after Trump’s statement started to circulate online, going from its intraday bottom of under $107,000 to almost $108,000. BREAKING: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THEY ARE WORKING TO PASS MORE PRO #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO POLICIES VERY BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/UqHdV7t789 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 12, 2025 Trump outlined in his statement that his administration ended Biden’s war on crypto on Day 1, which included replacing the former SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, with Paul Atkins. Recall that the US securities watchdog dropped countless lawsuits against numerous crypto companies in the past few months, including Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, and many others. Consequently, Trump’s administration “unleashed” American innovators to do what they do best – lead the technology world. The POTUS also outlined all positive developments that the industry experienced in the past few months, including the national Bitcoin reserve , the digital asset stockpile, and the upcoming GENIUS stablecoin bill. Additionally, Trump noted that they will continue working to create “clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin.” BTC’s price jumped by around a grand in the past several minutes, perhaps driven by the renewed hype from the US President. Nevertheless, the asset remains around 4% away from its all-time high, registered on May 22, and is slightly down on the day as well. BTCUSD.

Then, Kevin Tam looks at crypto trends, 13-F filings and institutional adoption in Ask an Expert. – Sarah Morton Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Bitcoin's Breakout — Is the Altcoin Rally Next? On May 22, bitcoin (BTC) marked a historic moment, reaching a new all-time high, briefly surpassing the levels seen earlier this year. While prices have since consolidated, BTC remains within striking distance of its all-time high — a feat achieved despite lingering macro uncertainties, low trading volumes, and general market skepticism. Meanwhile, most altcoins remain far from their respective all-time highs. As of early June, Ethereum (ETH) is still about 20% below its November 2021 peak, and Solana (SOL) sits more than 30% below its former highs. This divergence highlights what some market observers are calling the ""most hated rally""—a quiet, low-participation surge in bitcoin that caught many off guard. What Drove the BTC Rally? Three key factors contributed to the recent BTC breakout: Central Bank Optimism: Futures markets suggest that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are likely in the second half of 2025, with the eurozone even further ahead—now on its seventh consecutive rate cut. This easing backdrop has revived risk appetite across assets, particularly among institutional allocators. With tariff fears in the rearview mirror, the overall inflationary outlook has significantly improved in recent weeks. Institutional Inflows : Spot bitcoin ETFs, approved earlier this year, continue to absorb flows. While daily volumes have tapered from launch-week highs, net inflows have remained consistently positive, particularly from fee-sensitive RIA and private wealth channels. Year to date, cumulative inflows exceed $16 billion, with May recording the largest inflow this year. At the same time, MicroStrategy and other companies have continued to pile corporate treasury assets into bitcoin. Easing Political Risks: Fading tariff tensions and improving global trade sentiment helped stabilize broader markets, allowing risk assets like bitcoin to resume their upward trend. Despite these tailwinds, the rally occurred on relatively thin volumes. BTC Dominance Rising — But History Rhymes Bitcoin dominance — the percentage of total crypto market cap made up by BTC — has now climbed above 54%, up from about 38% in late 2022. Historically, BTC dominance peaks before altcoins begin to outperform. During the 2017 and 2021 cycles, altcoin rallies lagged the BTC all-time highs by two to six months. Source: TradingView If history holds, the rotation from bitcoin into altcoins may already be underway. ether's recent outperformance — posting an 81% rally since its April lows — is a sign that sentiment is starting to spill over from bitcoin to the altcoin market. Altcoin Season Ahead? While the term ""altseason"" is often thrown around carelessly, there are some real indicators worth watching: Institutional Broadening: Allocators who entered BTC via ETFs are now evaluating broader exposure. Equal-weight or smart beta indexes that offer diversified exposure to Layer 1s, DeFi, and infrastructure tokens are gaining traction. L1 Innovation and Narrative Cycles: Layer 1 ecosystems like Solana, Avalanche, and Near continue to develop real throughput improvements, which are increasingly relevant as user demand for on-chain activity returns. DeFi Resurgence: As of early June 2025, the total value locked in DeFi protocols has surpassed $117 billion, marking a significant recovery from the April slump. According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked across all DeFi pools has increased by 31% since its April lows. Risk Rotation: In traditional markets, as the bull market matures, investors rotate from large caps to small/mid caps. Crypto is no different. Bitcoin may be the starting point, but not the end. A Word of Caution Although there are significant diversification benefits associated with crypto investing, it is also fair to say that crypto is still behaving largely as a risk-on asset class. As highlighted by the latest OECD report, the global economic landscape is becoming increasingly fragile. Heightened trade restrictions, tighter credit conditions, declining business and consumer confidence, and persistent policy uncertainty are all weighing on growth prospects and increasing the risks of a sell-off of speculative assets that includes crypto. Key Takeaways for Advisors Expect Rotation: If prior cycles are a guide, altcoins may lag BTC but tend to rally with a delay. Advisors should consider this when rebalancing portfolios. Diversification Matters: Equal-weight crypto baskets or thematic exposures (e.g., Layer 1s, DeFi) may help capture upside without betting on a single asset. Stay Objective: While price action often drives client interest, fundamentals — from network activity to developer momentum — should remain the north star for allocation decisions. Bitcoin's new all-time high is certainly a milestone. However, it may also be a signal: the next phase of the cycle could belong to the broader crypto asset class. Advisors who understand the timing and mechanics of market rotations are best positioned to guide clients through the next leg.

A: This recent quarters 13F filing reveal that Montreal based Trans-Canada Capital has made notable investments in digital assets. They manage the pension assets for Air Canada, as one of the largest corporate pensions plans Canada. The pension fund added $55 million in spot bitcoin ETF. Institutional adoption of bitcoin has accelerated over the past year, driven by clearer regulatory guidance, the launch of spot ETFs and increasing recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset. Schedule 1 banks in Canada are holding more than $137 million in bitcoin exchange traded funds, underscoring growing institutional demand and long-term positioning. Q: How might institutional accumulation affect bitcoin’s market dynamic? A: Last year ETFs bought approximately 500,000 bitcoin, while the network produced 164,250 new bitcoins through its proof of work consensus. This means ETF demand alone was three times higher than the newly minted supply. Additionally, public and private corporations purchased 250,000 bitcoin. As governments consider including bitcoin in their strategic reserve, other entities are exploring adding bitcoin to their corporate treasury . Q: How will the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) greenlighting retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the UK accelerate the retail & institutional adoption? A: This marks an important moment for in crypto products in the retail market as asset class that reflects a broader shift in the UK’s regulatory stance toward digital assets. It is a complete reversal from a 2020 decision when the FCA banned crypto exchange trades notes. ETNs will need to be traded on an FCA-approved investment exchanges. The UK is shifting its approach to crypto as the government seeks to grow the economy and support a digital assets industry. They are sending a strong signal to institutional investors that the UK is positioning itself as a competitor player in the global crypto market. - Kevin Tam Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading The Digital Asset Month in Review for May provides highlights and insights on global crypto ETFs/ETPs.

The stock fell over 15% as doubts linger over the company’s pivot from retailer to crypto whale. GameStop (GME) shares took a nosedive on June 12, barely a day after the brick-and-mortar retailer announced a $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, potentially to add more Bitcoin ( BTC ) to its balance sheet. The company’s stock was already trending downward following a lackluster quarterly performance. On June 11, GameStop reported a 17% revenue dip in the first quarter of 2025, despite ongoing demand for online gaming. Shares fell over 5% that day and slid further on Thursday, as Wall Street remains uncertain whether the company can reverse its financial trajectory through a crypto accumulation strategy. Why GameStop is investing in Bitcoin GameStop did not confirm or deny speculation that it would use the $1.75 billion to buy Bitcoin. However, the June 11 announcement stated that proceeds from the convertible notes offering would be used for “investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions.” You might also like: Crypto is near a ‘tipping point,’ FSB chair warns Part of that policy includes strengthening its corporate balance sheet with digital assets, signaling a strategic pivot driven by both survival and ambition. Facing shrinking revenues and the waning relevance of its core retail business, GameStop appears to be borrowing from Strategy’s playbook, leveraging Bitcoin as both an economic hedge and a growth catalyst. Strategy’s aggressive move into Bitcoin has reshaped its market narrative. Since first investing in BTC in August 2020, its stock has surged 256%, climbing from $110 to $392 per share as of early June and far outperforming both the S&P 500 and broader tech sector benchmarks. Meanwhile, core software revenue remained mostly flat, dipping from $481 million in 2020 to $463 million in 2024, cementing Bitcoin as the primary driver of shareholder value. Bitcoin’s long-term upside and growing institutional adoption present a speculative but potentially high-reward strategy that could help GameStop reinvent itself. By acquiring 4,710 BTC in May and signaling plans for more through the new convertible notes offering, the company is making a clear bet that Bitcoin’s potential could reinvigorate investor confidence and address its operational challenges. GameStop’s recent Bitcoin purchase positioned it as the 13 th largest corporate holder of the original cryptocurrency, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET data.

2025-06-12T14:50:16,"GameStop plummeted by 19% on Bitcoin buy plan","GameStop shares got destroyed Thursday after the company said it wants to raise $1.75 billion through a convertible note sale, triggering a massive selloff. The money, according to GameStop, will be used for “general corporate purposes,” but also for crypto buys—more specifically, Bitcoin. Right after the news dropped , GameStop plunged over 15% in premarket trading and then 4% more after the Bell, making it a 19% drop at press time. This came just a day after the stock already dropped 5% due to falling sales. Investors didn’t like the idea of a meme stock that just lost revenue throwing itself even deeper into Bitcoin. GameStop follows MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy with debt sale The company wants to copy the MicroStrategy playbook. That’s the software firm now called Strategy, which bought billions of dollars in Bitcoin and used different securities, including convertible debt, to pay for it. The result? Strategy became the biggest corporate Bitcoin holder and its stock went wild—sometimes up, sometimes down. Now GameStop wants the same kind of “magic,” except it’s already sinking. In April, GameStop added 4,710 bitcoins to its books. That haul was worth more than $500 million at the time. This week’s bond deal could send that number way higher. CEO Ryan Cohen said the decision came from macro concerns. He said Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature makes it a hedge against “certain risks.” Sounds a lot like what Michael Saylor once said, but this time the market didn’t bite. Analysts aren’t buying the vision either. Michael Pachter from Wedbush doubled down on his “underperform” rating. He said the stock already trades at 2.4 times its cash, and that the Bitcoin pivot doesn’t make sense. In his words, GameStop is still leaning on “greater fools” who think the price will just keep going up. He said, “they’re converting more cash to crypto, expecting to get an even bigger premium—it won’t happen.” GameStop is already under pressure from dropping revenue. Its Q1 2024 sales fell 17% year-over-year, coming in at $732.4 million. Online gaming is gaining momentum, and that’s killing traffic at the company’s physical stores. This weakness in the core business makes the risky crypto bet look even worse. NFT failure, regulatory exits, and herd behavior drive skepticism GameStop already tried playing in the crypto world once, and it didn’t end well. Back in May 2021, it announced plans to build a NFT marketplace tied to Ethereum. Business Insider called it an “ambitious plan to become the Amazon of gaming.” That didn’t happen. The beta version of the NFT platform went live in July 2022, with a curated marketplace that vetted creators. But things went sideways fast. One artist minted an NFT based on “The Falling Man” photo from 9/11, and GameStop banned the account. Another user uploaded hundreds of HTML5 game NFTs without owning the rights. GameStop took them down, killed the minting ability, and cleaned the listings—but the NFTs still live on the blockchain. By December 2022, the company laid off most of the NFT team. In August 2023, it said it would shut down its crypto and NFT wallet, blaming “regulatory uncertainty.” Then in January 2024, GameStop announced its NFT marketplace would close for good on February 2, 2024. So not only is the company diving deeper into Bitcoin, it’s doing so right after completely exiting the NFT space it hyped up just two years ago. Crypto veterans watching this play know the cycle. First there’s hype, then FOMO kicks in, and then retail investors get wrecked. Economics professor Burton Malkiel described it perfectly in his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street : people get drawn into rising assets—even if they make no sense—because they hear stories of early winners. And then they don’t want to miss out. Herd mentality kicks in, and boom—bubble. Even with the $1.75 billion in new convertible debt coming in, investors have doubts. The idea of issuing debt just to buy more volatile assets like Bitcoin, when your own business is already bleeding, isn’t getting much love from Wall Street. They’ve already seen this play out with other firms, and it didn’t always end well. This entire week was a gut-punch for GameStop. On Tuesday, revenue miss. On Wednesday, 5% drop. And by Thursday morning, another 15% wiped off after announcing the bond sale and Bitcoin plans. The market has clearly voted, and the vote is a big fat no.

Nakamoto’s untouched fortune has made them into the ranks of the world’s richest. As Bitcoin soars past $107,000, the mystery of Nakamoto’s wealth and identity continues to fascinate the crypto universe. Nakamoto’s net worth depends on Bitcoin’s value. With rising crypto adoption demand, institutional interests, and a pro-crypto US president in the office, Will Nakamoto tops the list? From Pennies to Billions: The Rise of Nakamoto’s Empire Nakamoto is believed to have mined nearly 1.1 million Bitcoins between 2009 and 2010, when the digital currency was virtually worthless. Fast forward 16 years, and Arkham’s blockchain data reveals that this dormant stock, untouched for over a decade, is now estimated at a whopping $118 billion. With Bitcoin trading at $106,840 ( check live ), Nakamoto’s wealth places them among global elites, rivaling tech titans and oil barons, yet their identity remains unknown. What is Making Bitcoin Go Up? Bitcoin’s recent rally has amplified Nakamoto’s fortune. After peaking at a record $111,980 on May 22, 2025, the cryptocurrency hit $110,651 on Monday and tested $110,435 on Wednesday before dipping 1.69% in the last 24 hours. A U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report that was milder than anticipated indicated a 0.1% increase in prices for April and a 2.4% annual inflation rate. This enabled Federal Reserve rate reductions, moving crypto market activity, and elevating Nakamoto’s portfolio to over $120 billion at its highest point this week. Will Nakamoto Surpass Elon Musk To Become the World’s Richest? So far, Elon Musk is sitting on top with a net worth of $411.4 B. Nakamoto’s net worth is directly dependent on the market value of Bitcoin. With 1.096 million BTC in his kitty, Bitcoin value must cross $381,928 to beat Elon Musk. However, these numbers are out of reach, but we can expect wonders in this highly volatile crypto market. Nakamoto’s Legacy in Crypto As Bitcoin makes its foundation strong in the financial world, Nakamoto’s untouched $118 billion fortune represents the transformative power of cryptocurrency.

PlanB’s Power-Law Model Points to a 5-10x BTC Rally PlanB, the analyst known for the stock-to-flow (S2F) model, argues that Bitcoin continues to follow its long-term powerlaw trend. This model historically signaled major bull cycles, with price jumps of 100x, 10x, and 4x in previous cycles. As per PlanB’s framework, Bitcoin may be primed for a 5–10x increase from current levels, aligning with the S2F target range. If the model holds, this could point to a c… The post Bitcoin Eyes Next Surge: Bullish Structure Holds Above $106K Amid Geopolitical Tensions and Historical Cycles appeared first on Coin Edition .",coinquora,https://coinedition.com/bitcoin-bull-run-analysis-planb-s2f-mode/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Top Crypto News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

Officials at the American Bankers Association, the Bank Policy Institute, the Managed Funds Association and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association recently penned a letter to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent outlining their concerns, specifically highlighting the recently disclosed cybersecurity breach of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) email system. “To address similar challenges across all financial regulatory agencies, we encourage the Administration to implement the following recommendations: (1) ensure agencies are held to the same or substantively similar security and data protection standards expected of financial institutions to include transparency and accountability for upholding these standards; (2) enable firms to retain and house their own sensitive data needed for regulatory engagement; (3) improve regulatory agencies’ incident response processes to include notification and communication with regulated institutions; and (4) consolidate and streamline examinations conducted by the financial regulatory agencies to reduce the amount of data being shared.” The trade associations note that “nation-state cyber adversaries” are increasingly targeting federal agencies, including financial regulators. In regard to the OCC, hackers accessed nearly 150,000 emails after first compromising the regulator’s system back in May 2023, Bloomberg reports .

2025-06-12T14:26:37,"Bitcoin (BTC) Rebounds from Routine Correction: Price Recovery Insights","A routine correction for Bitcoin (BTC) has resulted in a 3% dip for the king of the cryptocurrencies. Horizontal support at $107,000 is holding so far. Will there be a bounce from here, or could there be further to fall? Source: Alternative.me A $BTC dip waiting to be bought back up The last big 10% surge for Bitcoin finally ran out of steam at over $110,000, went sideways for a couple of days, and then fell back down on Wednesday and into Thursday. It now remains to be seen whether the bears can take a tighter grip and force the price down further, or whether the current very positive market sentiment will see this dip bought back up again. Is a bounce about to occur? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC reveals that the support at $107,000 is quite a good one and will be key to hold for the bulls. It can be seen that a bounce did occur at this horizontal level, but it can also be observed that the bears are trying their best to make this level fail. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are at the bottom, and with the 8-hour and 12-hour Stochastic RSIs on their way down it may not be too much longer before a positive price impulse takes $BTC back up again. Daily chart points of concern Source: TradingView The daily time frame is showing some potential points of concern. While the price is currently holding nicely above the $107,000 support, the Stochastic RSI is showing a cross down of the indicator lines, and at the same time the RSI, at the bottom of the chart, has the indicator posturing to cross down below the moving average line (yellow). Bull market following parabolic curve on 2-month time frame Source: TradingView The 2-month time frame for $BTC makes for interesting viewing. Firstly it must be noted how since the beginning of this bull market the price has kept to a parabolic curve, with the last touch of this line at around $75,000. With this curve so closely respected, the moment the price starts falling through is the moment to sit up and take notice that the beginning of a bear market could be nigh. Near the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has the indicators near the top of their limits, but should the fast (blue) indicator line cross back above the slow (orange) indicator line this would signal a continuation of upside price momentum. The RSI at the bottom of the chart has its indicator rising above the 80.00 level. This will need to keep rising and eventually get above 91.50 in order to cancel out bearish divergence.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt is warning of a 75% correction to $27,290 from recent highs of $112,000. He notes that the breakdown below the ascending channel and series of lower highs is similar to the 2022 bear market when Bitcoin dropped from $69,000 in late 2021. NEW: Peter Brandt hints at a 75% #Bitcoin crash repeat — but crypto analysts aren’t buying it. pic.twitter.com/h8cAB5IQXE — Coinpaper (@coinpapercom) June 12, 2025 Brandt’s warning isn’t just technical. He points to deteriorating market structure and sentiment as key supports fail. This has amplified investor anxiety, especially with the broader macro and geopolitical backdrop. Geopolitical Tensions Intensify Market Risks; Bitcoin Under Pressure Global conflicts are fueling the fire. Reports of Israel preparing to strike Iran have caused risk-off sentiment. The Russia-Ukraine war has escalated with drone strikes on Kharkiv, deepening investor caution. While uncertainty usually boosts safe-haven assets, Bitcoin is not capturing traditional safe-haven flows. It’s weakening along with broader risk assets. BREAKING: Israel is fully prepared to launch an operation against Iran, and the US anticipates Iran could respond by striking American assets in Iraq – CBS news Israel has warned Lebanon that if Hezbollah responds to Israeli strikes on Iran, Israel will retaliate. pic.twitter.com/e318qBmDnM — Current Report (@Currentreport1) June 12, 2025 Despite the risk-off tone, US Bitcoin ETFs saw $164.57 million in net inflows on Wednesday. GameStop added 4,700 BTC since May, and Mercurity Fintech plans to raise $800 million for a BTC treasury reserve. But institutional demand hasn’t yet offset broader market pressure. Bitcoin Technical Breakdown Weighs on Bears Technically, the Bitcoin price prediction appears bearish amid BTC’s breakdown below the trendline and the 50-period EMA ($107,985), which is clear. MACD confirms with a bearish crossover and widening gap, indicating downward momentum. Rejection candles from $110,376 and lower highs have formed a near-term bearish pattern. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview BTC is testing immediate support at $106,401. If that fails, further declines to $105,180 or $104,026 are more likely. The market is at a crossroads, either a breakdown to Brandt’s $27,000 target or a short-lived bounce on institutional accumulation. Trade Setup for Short Sellers: Entry: Short on rejection near $108,000 Stop-loss: Above $108,800 (above EMA) Target 1: $106,400 Target 2: $105,180 Risk Level: 6/10 Summary Bitcoin’s price action is weakening its technical structure and poses high bear risk. With macro headwinds, geopolitical tensions, and a veteran trader’s warning, BTC may be starting a bigger correction. Watch levels closely and be prepared for more volatility. The market is fragile; a break below $106,000 could be the start of a bigger move. BTC Bull Token Nears $8.1M Cap as 58% APY Staking Attracts Last-Minute Buyers With Bitcoin trading near $107K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $7,103,849.89 out of its $8,153,354 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.00256 is expected to increase once the cap is hit. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority.

2025-06-12T14:21:32,"Analyst: 31% CAGR Could Push Bitcoin to $168K by Fall 2025","Prominent analyst Axel Adler Jr. is forecasting a potential surge to $168,000 for Bitcoin (BTC) by October 2025, even as the number one cryptocurrency’s march towards a new all-time high faces a critical test at the $110,000 resistance level. His bullish projection is predicated on a 31% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), up from just 7% in April, which he believes signals a strong uptrend zone. $168K by October Adler shared the insight via a June 12 post on X, in which he pointed out that even though the current CAGR remained “well below historical peaks of 50–80%,” favorable fundamentals and continued futures market momentum could propel BTC to $168,000 by the start of Q4 2025. However, hours later, he issued a cautionary note for the near term, citing a “soft reversal point” marked by decreasing open interest (OI) and positive funding rates. “As long as funding remains positive but open interest is declining, you should expect a short-term correction or consolidation below $108K,” the market watcher warned. Fellow analyst Michaël van de Poppe echoed the sentiment, pointing to BTC’s inability to break past $110,000: “Couldn’t break through the $110,000 area and therefore, we should have some correction,” the crypto enthusiast posted. Still, he suggested that traders did not need to worry as long as BTC stayed above $106,000. Despite significant tailwinds, including positive progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations and favorable May CPI data reported on June 12, the asset got rejected near its May 22 all-time high of $111,814. It tumbled by more than $3,00 from yesterday’s peak, trading around $107,000 at press time, reflecting a 2% 24-hour dip. While showing some resilience with a 2.4% weekly gain and a 4.5% monthly increase, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap is currently underperforming the broader digital asset market, which grew 6.7% over the past seven days. Holder Dynamics and Retail Resurgence Shaping Market Meanwhile, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley forecasted a shift in holder behavior once BTC clears $130,000, suggesting investors will choose to borrow against their holdings rather than sell. Additionally, retail sentiment is on the rise. As of June 11, market intelligence platform Santiment reported a 2-to-1 ratio of positive to negative BTC-related posts on social media, the highest since U.S. President Donald Trump’s election over seven months ago. However, the current Fear and Greed Index reads 71, firmly putting it in “greed” territory, and raising concerns about a potential local top. Still, recent data from Glassnode and CryptoQuant highlighted an unusual market duality: while long-term holders are pocketing up to $930 million in daily profits, they are simultaneously increasing their net positions, suggesting that institutional conviction remains strong.

2025-06-12T14:21:31,"The crypto bull run has 5 catalysts to support continued momentum","Bitcoin and most altcoins wavered on Thursday, June 12, as the recent rally took a breather. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped below $107,000, down from this week’s high of $110,200. Other altcoins like Ethereum ( ETH ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Chainlink ( LINK ) also retreated. This article explores the top five reasons why a crypto bull run may happen soon. 1. Bitcoin has strong technicals and fundamentals The first key reason for a potential crypto bull run is Bitcoin’s strong fundamentals. Demand continues to rise, with spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds seeing significant inflows this year. Cumulative inflows since their launch in January last year have reached $45.2 billion, with BlackRock’s IBIT holding over $72 billion in assets. More companies, including GameStop, Semler Scientific, Trump Media, and MetaPlanet, have continued to accumulate Bitcoin. This wave of accumulation has pushed the total Bitcoin supply on exchanges down to 1.1 million, compared to 3.2 million in 2020. Bitcoin supply on exchanges | Source: Santiment From a technical perspective, Bitcoin has formed a cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart. The initial phase is complete, and price action is now developing the handle section. A break above the all-time high of $111,900 would signal further gains. This would likely spark a broader crypto bull run, lifting other altcoins along with it. Bitcoin price chart | Source: crypto.news You might also like: The crypto bull run is here: best altcoins to buy now 2. Ethereum ETFs are surging Another potential catalyst for a crypto bull run is the rising demand for Ethereum ETFs. According to SoSoValue data, spot Ethereum ETFs have recorded inflows for five consecutive weeks, adding over $1.2 billion in assets and bringing the cumulative total to $3.7 billion. This trend may reflect growing investor confidence that Ethereum will continue to climb. This crypto.news article noted that ETH price has formed a bullish flag and a golden cross pattern, pointing to more gains. 3. Altcoin ETFs are coming The odds of spot altcoin ETFs are also rising, which could further fuel the market. Polymarket data shows that approval odds for an XRP ETF have jumped to 88%, while Solana’s ( SOL ) have risen to 90%. Other potential approvals will be Litecoin ( LTC ), Hedera Hashgraph, and Sui ( SUI ). These approvals will likely lead to more inflows from Wall Street investors, pushing prices higher. 4. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts Crypto prices will be boosted by the Federal Reserve, which will likely start cutting interest rates this year. Polymarket traders anticipate between 2 and three cuts this year, and more in 2026. Odds of Fed cuts rose after the US published a muted consumer inflation report on Wednesday. That report showed that the headline CPI rose to 2.4% in May, lower than the expected 2.5%. At the same time, Trump is said to be considering Scott Bessent to be the next Fed Chair in 2026. Bessent, the current Treasury Secretary, is expected to be more dovish than Powell. He is also more supportive of the crypto industry. 5. Trade tensions could ease Finally, there are signs that trade tensions between the US and China will cool now that the latter is using rare earth materials effectively, giving it an upper hand in negotiations. China will likely block these rare earth materials again if the US imposes new tariffs, a move that would disrupt the manufacturing sector. There are additional reasons to expect a renewed bull run in 2025. The U.S. Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, which introduces regulatory clarity for the stablecoin industry. Meanwhile, some companies are beginning to add altcoins like XRP and Solana to their treasuries, and the global M2 money supply is soaring.

Key Takeaways: Mercurity plans to raise $800M to build a long-term Bitcoin treasury reserve. The initiative includes tokenized treasury tools to enhance yield and asset durability. Over 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, signaling accelerating institutional adoption. The move aligns with a broader trend of corporations incorporating Bitcoin into their balance sheets as a strategic asset. According to the company’s Wednesday statement , the funds will be used to transition part of Mercurity’s reserves into Bitcoin, integrated within a blockchain-native custody and staking framework. Tokenized Treasury Tools to Boost Yield The initiative includes tokenized treasury management tools designed to boost yield and strengthen asset duration. CEO Shi Qiu said the reserve reflects the company’s belief that Bitcoin will become a core pillar of future financial infrastructure. “We’re building this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the future financial infrastructure,” Qiu said. If completed, the raise would allow Mercurity to acquire roughly 7,433 BTC at current market prices, making it the 11th largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, surpassing GameStop’s 4,710 BTC , based on figures from Bitbo.

Recent data shows 223 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from 124 just days earlier. In total, more than 819,000 BTC, approximately 3.9% of the total supply, is currently held by public firms, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 580,250 BTC worth approximately $60.9 billion. Other major holders include Marathon Digital Holdings and Tesla, both with over $1 billion in Bitcoin. As reported, digital asset companies are flooding capital markets to raise funds for large-scale Bitcoin acquisitions , spurred by the cryptocurrency’s rally to a record $111,965 last week. The surge, up more than 50% from early April, has ignited a wave of listings and mergers as firms race to secure funding while investor appetite remains strong. Metaplanet Announces $5.4B Capital Raise to Buy Bitcoin Last week, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet unveiled an ambitious new target to amass 210,000 Bitcoin by the end of 2027. The firm announced to raise $5.4 billion to accelerate its Bitcoin purchase by issuing 555 million shares of Moving-Strike Warrants, a first of its kind raise in Japan’s market of this size. The move, outlined in its updated “555 Million Plan,” would give the company ownership of roughly 1% of Bitcoin’s maximum supply. The announcement marks a major acceleration from Metaplanet’s prior “21 Million Plan,” under which it aimed for 21,000 BTC by 2026. After surpassing interim goals and climbing to 8,888 BTC, placing it tenth globally in corporate Bitcoin holdings, the company is now setting its sights far higher. To fund this aggressive acquisition drive, Metaplanet will issue 555 million new shares through moving strike warrants, an innovative financing mechanism designed to optimize capital raising with minimal dilution.
