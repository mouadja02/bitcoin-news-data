The timing, just after a shaky U.S.-China trade deal, has raised fresh concerns about a new round of global trade tensions. Markets are already feeling the pressure and crypto is no exception. Global Sell-Off Begins as Tariff Clock Ticks Trump’s tariff plans have sparked a pullback across global markets. European and U.S. equity futures have dropped as investors brace for what could be another hit to international trade. The dollar has weakened, gold prices have surged, and Treasury yields are falling – all signs that investors are moving to safer assets. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes is sounding the alarm. Taking to X, he warned, “Don’t get shook,” as he predicted rising volatility across crypto markets in the days ahead. Don’t get shook. pic.twitter.com/GJbdZb73X4 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 12, 2025 Bitcoin Drops Below $110K, Altcoins Follow Bitcoin started the week strong, riding the wave of global liquidity. But the rally didn’t last. After being rejected at the $110,000 resistance level, BTC is now down 1.66%, trading near $107,750. Altcoins are in the red too. Dogecoin is seeing the steepest drop among the top ten, down 7% in just 24 hours. Even a lower-than-expected U.S. CPI reading wasn’t enough to boost market sentiment. Traders are growing increasingly cautious as macro uncertainty piles up. More Trade Moves Coming At the same time, the Trump administration is also pushing for bilateral trade deals with major economies like India, South Korea, and Japan. The goal is to strengthen America’s economic position but these moves could also raise tensions in global trade even further. Hayes: Volatility Is Just Getting Started Arthur Hayes has repeatedly called for the Fed to switch from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE). But with inflation still a concern and interest rate cuts now unlikely, that shift seems far off. With Trump’s tariff strategy shaking up traditional markets, crypto is entering another phase of heightened volatility. Hayes’ warning comes at a critical time for traders trying to navigate this evolving landscape. The Bottom Line Trump’s new tariff plan is already sending shockwaves across global markets. From equities to the dolla, and now crypto, volatility is back in a big way. As the July 9 deadline approaches, investors should prepare for more turbulence ahead.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/arthur-hayes-predicts-crypto-trouble-ahead-of-trumps-tariffs-dont-get-shook/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T09:47:10,"Atomic Wallet Review 2025: Why This All-in-One Crypto Wallet App Still Sets the Standard","The post Atomic Wallet Review 2025: Why This All-in-One Crypto Wallet App Still Sets the Standard appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When newcomers ask, “What’s the best cryptocurrency wallet for everyday use?” industry veterans increasingly point to Atomic Wallet . After five years on the market, this non-custodial platform has matured from a clever desktop client into a 360° crypto wallet ecosystem: buy, swap, stake, and store 1,000-plus assets in one interface—no KYC for core functions, no middlemen holding your keys. Below is an deep dive into the features that keep Atomic a contender in every “ best crypto wallet ” roundup, plus practical tips on how to withdraw from Atomic Wallet , use the built-in atomic charge wallet to fund purchases, and unleash passive income through atomic wallet staking . 1. True Self-Custody: Your Keys, Your Crypto Atomic’s architecture is simple but powerful. The 12-word backup phrase and every private key are generated locally and encrypted on-device. They never touch company servers. In practice that means: No custodian risk: even if Atomic’s website goes offline, your funds remain on-chain. No forced verification: you can hold, receive, and send without uploading an ID. No data harvest: the wallet doesn’t store personal details; you remain pseudonymous. If you keep that seed phrase offline in two secure spots, you own a bullet-proof gateway to any supported network—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Monero, even NFTs on multiple chains. 2. Buy, Exchange, Stake—All Under One Roof BUY – Through integrated partners (currently MoonPay, Simplex, and Guardarian) you can purchase BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, and dozens more with Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, or local bank rails in over 180 countries. The new “ atomic charge wallet ” flow pre-loads fiat so repeat buys happen in two taps. EXCHANGE – The atomic wallet swap engine links several DEX and instant-swap APIs. Roughly 60 pairs can be exchanged anonymously; each trade may return 0.3–1 % cashback paid in AW utility tokens. Spreads are competitive with major exchanges—minus the sign-up friction. STAKE – Yield hunters will appreciate the in-app staking dashboard: ETH (≈5 % APR), ADA (≈3 %), SOL (≈7 %), ATOM (≈16 %), HBAR, XTZ, and more. Every validator set is pre-audited; rewards land directly in your address with no extra fees—an underrated perk that puts Atomic among the best crypto wallet choices for passive income. 3. Seamless Asset Management on Any Device Whether you prefer desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) or mobile (iOS, Android, Huawei App Gallery), the UX stays consistent: clean portfolio charts, dark/light themes, biometric unlock, and instant balance sync across devices. Sorting by value, name, or gains makes it painless to track a long-tail portfolio. Need to deposit something obscure? Tap “Add Assets” and paste any valid address for ERC-20, BEP-20, TRC-20, or native layer-1 coins; Atomic auto-detects the network and tags it to your list. That flexibility—combined with 10 M+ global installs—cements Atomic’s role as a crypto wallet app for power users and beginners alike. 4. Security Posture & Withdrawal Process Critics will ask, “Great features, but how to withdraw from Atomic Wallet safely?” The answer: as easily as sending a normal blockchain transaction. Open the asset page (e.g., BTC). Paste the destination address. Set a fee or pick “fast”/“standard.” Confirm with your password or biometrics. Because keys stay local—and because Atomic connects directly to full-node servers—your withdrawal is signed client-side, broadcast instantly, and visible on-chain within seconds. No ticket, no approval queue. For extra peace of mind, you can export raw private keys or your 12-word seed into any hardware wallet later on. 5. Transparent Team & Roadmap Unlike many anonymous wallet projects, Atomic lists its leadership publicly: Konstantin Gladych, PhD – CEO and former co-founder of Changelly (the instant-exchange giant processing $0.5 B monthly). Charlie Shrem – Strategic adviser, Bitcoin Foundation co-founder, and early BTC evangelist. The roadmap for 2025 focuses on: Layer-2 support (Arbitrum, Base) for cheaper swaps. In-app DEX charting and limit orders. Multi-sig vaults for teams and small businesses. Such transparency is a hallmark of a best cryptocurrency wallet contender; users see exactly who steers the ship. 6. Independent Feedback On Trustpilot Atomic hovers around 4.5/5 across 25 k reviews; major praise targets the 24/7 live chat that actually responds in under 10 minutes. Forbes, CoinTelegraph, and PCMag have each run an atomic wallet review labeling it “a Swiss-army knife for mainstream crypto usage.” 7. Pros & Cons Snapshot Pros Cons ✓ Full non-custodial control ✕ No native hardware-wallet integration (planned) ✓ 1,000+ assets supported ✕ Buy fees depend on third-party provider ✓ Built-in staking up to 20 % APR ✕ Some swap pairs can have thin liquidity ✓ Anonymous swaps + cashback ✓ Available on every major OS/mobile store 8. Final Verdict: Why Atomic Still Ranks Top-Tier If your priority is a single interface to buy crypto with a debit card , swap cross-chain, stake for passive rewards, and manage exotic tokens—all while keeping custody—Atomic ticks every box. The wallet’s commitment to decentralization, its battle-tested security model, and a relentless roadmap give it a durable edge over many custodial “super apps.” Add a responsive support team and transparent leadership, and it is easy to see why Atomic remains a staple recommendation in any 2025 list of best cryptocurrency wallet solutions. For anyone seeking a future-proof, privacy-first, feature-rich gateway to digital assets, Atomic Wallet deserves a spot on your home screen—and maybe even on your hardware-backup card.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/atomic-wallet-review-2025-all-in-one-crypto-wallet-app/,"ADA|BTC|ETH|FIAT|SOL","Information",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T09:40:25,"Ethereum NFT Traders Witness Remarkable Recovery to 2022 Levels","BitcoinWorld Ethereum NFT Traders Witness Remarkable Recovery to 2022 Levels The world of digital collectibles is buzzing with exciting news! Recent data reveals a significant resurgence in activity, particularly among Ethereum NFT traders . After a period of correction and lower engagement, the number of active traders on the Ethereum network has climbed back to levels not seen since 2022. This recovery is a hopeful sign for the broader NFT market recovery and indicates renewed interest and confidence in the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Surge in Ethereum NFT Traders ? Several factors appear to be contributing to this positive trend. While the market is complex and influenced by many variables, two key drivers have been highlighted: OpenSea’s New Rewards Program: As a leading NFT marketplace, OpenSea’s initiatives can significantly impact trader behavior. Their introduction of a rewards program seems to have incentivized activity, encouraging both new and returning users to engage with the platform and the wider Ethereum NFT ecosystem. Such programs often reward users for trading volume or participation, directly boosting the number of active traders. Increased Focus on NFT Utility : Early in the NFT boom, many projects focused primarily on digital art and collectibles without much practical use. However, developers have increasingly shifted towards building utility into NFTs. This includes integrating them into gaming ecosystems, using them for access to exclusive communities or events, providing staking opportunities, or linking them to real-world assets and services. NFTs with tangible benefits are proving more attractive and sustainable for users beyond mere speculation. This combination of platform-driven incentives and fundamental value creation through utility appears to be a powerful catalyst for the current rebound in trader numbers. How Many Ethereum NFT Traders Are We Talking About? The data paints a clear picture of the scale of this recovery. The total number of active Ethereum NFT traders has reportedly surged to approximately 40,000. This figure represents a substantial increase from lower points experienced during the market downturns and brings the activity level back in line with figures observed during parts of 2022. While not reaching the peak frenzy of late 2021 or early 2022, returning to the 40,000 mark is a meaningful indicator of market health and participation. Is This a Sign of a Full NFT Market Recovery ? While the increase in trader numbers is undoubtedly positive, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of the NFT market recovery . Trader count is one metric among many. Other factors like total sales volume, floor prices of major collections, and the influx of new capital also contribute to the overall market health assessment. However, a growing number of active participants is a foundational element for a sustainable recovery. It suggests liquidity, interest, and a base of users willing to engage with NFT assets. This trend aligns with broader positive sentiment observed in the crypto market trends , where renewed interest and capital flow into digital assets can often spill over into related sectors like NFTs. Exploring the Impact of OpenSea Rewards and NFT Utility Let’s delve a little deeper into the specific impact of the mentioned drivers: The Role of OpenSea Rewards Marketplace incentives are a classic strategy to boost activity. By rewarding users for trading, OpenSea directly encourages the behavior that drives volume and participation. This can create a positive feedback loop, attracting more users and potentially leading to more listings and sales. It also helps OpenSea maintain its position as a dominant player in the space by fostering loyalty and activity on its platform. The Growing Importance of NFT Utility The shift towards utility marks a maturation of the NFT space. Projects that offer real-world benefits or integrate NFTs into functional ecosystems are building more sustainable models. Examples include: Gaming: NFTs representing in-game assets, characters, or land. Membership: NFTs acting as digital keys for exclusive online or offline communities. DeFi Integration: Using NFTs as collateral or for yield farming. Intellectual Property: NFTs granting specific rights or royalties. This focus on utility moves NFTs beyond speculative art and towards valuable digital assets with tangible use cases, attracting a different kind of buyer and fostering longer-term holding rather than just flipping. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum NFT Traders and the Market? The return of Ethereum NFT traders to 2022 levels is a promising indicator, but the market remains dynamic. Continued growth will likely depend on: Sustained Utility Development: Projects need to continue innovating and delivering real value through NFT utility. Marketplace Innovation: Platforms like OpenSea must keep evolving their offerings and incentives. Broader Crypto Market Health: The NFT market is still heavily correlated with overall crypto market trends . Continued positive momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum typically benefits NFTs. Regulatory Clarity: As the space grows, regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping its future. For existing and potential Ethereum NFT traders , this recovery suggests renewed opportunities but also highlights the importance of doing thorough research and understanding the specific utility and community behind any NFT project. In Conclusion: A Remarkable Step Forward for Ethereum NFTs The recovery of Ethereum NFT traders to 2022 levels is a significant milestone for the digital collectibles space. Fueled by strategic moves like OpenSea rewards and a fundamental shift towards NFT utility , this surge in activity demonstrates resilience and growing maturity in the market. While challenges remain, the return of tens of thousands of traders signals renewed confidence and sets a positive tone for the ongoing NFT market recovery . It’s a clear indication that despite past volatility, the core appeal and potential of NFTs, particularly on the robust Ethereum network, continue to attract a dedicated and growing community of participants.

2025-06-12T09:33:41,"Crypto vs Conflict: Bitcoin Price Dips as US–Iran Rumors Escalate","Bitcoin fell 1.7% to $107.6K as investors reacted to rising geopolitical uncertainty. Crude oil prices spiked over 4% following Trump’s warnings and Iran’s threats. Tensions over Iran’s nuclear program and missile tests are driving market volatility. Bitcoin took a bearish turn on Wednesday, retreating from its recent highs as escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran pushed crude oil up more than 4% while BTC dropped from a daily high of $110K to trade at $107,657.61 at press time. The market shift reflects a classic risk-off reaction, as investors sought refuge in traditional hedges like oil while trimming exposure to volatile digital assets. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin experienced a sharp pullback to the daily low of $107,407.29, as per CoinMarketCap data . With the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) around $106.3K acting as the immediate support zone, and a deeper floor forming near the 50-day EMA at $102K, traders should brace for further downward pressure. Should Bitcoin break below the $106.3K support level, eyes will turn to the 50-day EMA at $102K as a potential rebound point.

2025-06-12T09:30:43,"Ethereum Breaks Above Month-Long Range – 1.3M ETH Held At $2.70K–$2.74K May Anchor Price","Ethereum is holding firm above the $2,750 level after retracing slightly from a local high of $2,830 set just a few hours ago. The move marks a strong show of resilience from bulls, as ETH continues to push higher despite broader market uncertainty. Momentum appears to be building, and many analysts are calling for the beginning of an altseason, led by Ethereum’s breakout from a prolonged period of range-bound trading. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, Ethereum has just broken out of a month-long consolidation range. The Cost Basis Distribution reveals a significant amount of ETH accumulated during this phase, with 1.3 million ETH held between $2,700 and $2,740, and another 800,000 ETH around $2,760. These levels now represent a strong on-chain support base, suggesting that many investors are sitting in profit and are likely to hold rather than sell into strength. With ETH now pressing against local resistance and solid support below, the structure is favorable for a continuation to the upside. A confirmed breakout above $2,830 could open the door to $3,000 and beyond, potentially triggering capital rotation into altcoins and fueling a full-scale altseason. All eyes are now on Ethereum’s next move. Ethereum Pushes Into Resistance As Market Eyes Breakout And Altseason As the U.S. and China continue trade deal negotiations, financial markets are bracing for a decisive move, and Ethereum is right at the center of attention. With major headlines shifting global risk sentiment, ETH’s price action has become a leading indicator for the broader crypto market. Ethereum is now pressing into a key resistance zone near $2,800, and analysts agree: if ETH can reclaim higher levels, it could confirm the start of a long-awaited altseason. Despite macro uncertainty, positive sentiment continues to build. Ethereum recently broke out of a month-long consolidation range, a signal of growing strength. According to data from Glassnode , the Cost Basis Distribution reveals that 1.3 million ETH were accumulated between $2,700 and $2,740, while another 800,000 ETH were bought around $2,760. These levels now serve as a strong on-chain support base, reinforcing the bullish structure and suggesting that buyers from the consolidation phase are likely to hold rather than sell. This backdrop puts Ethereum in a decisive position. A confirmed breakout above $2,830 could open the door to a swift rally toward $3,000 and beyond. With solid support underneath and the entire altcoin market watching, ETH is poised to lead the next phase of crypto expansion—if bulls can maintain control. ETH Holds Gains Above $2,750 After Breakout From Range Ethereum is trading at $2,766 on the 4-hour chart after breaking out of a month-long range and briefly hitting a high of $2,794. Price has now pulled back slightly, but the structure remains bullish as ETH continues to hold above the previous resistance zone, now flipped into support around $2,700–$2,740. This consolidation above the breakout zone is a healthy sign, suggesting bulls are in control and preparing for a continuation move. The 50, 100, and 200 simple moving averages (SMAs) — currently at $2,587, $2,588, and $2,557, respectively — have all turned upward and are stacked beneath price, further supporting the trend. Volume surged during the breakout but has cooled slightly during the pullback, signaling no immediate signs of heavy distribution. As long as ETH holds this reclaimed range and doesn’t fall back below the 200 SMA, the bias remains bullish. A successful retest of the breakout zone could lead to another push toward the $2,850–$2,900 range.

2025-06-12T09:30:14,"Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000","Bitcoin has faced a lot of resistance above $110,000, suggesting the bears are trying to keep the digital asset from reclaiming its all-time high levels. This has been obvious with multiple rejections above $110,000 over the last few days, while the bulls have held support above $108,000. This trend plays into an analysis published by crypto analyst TehThomas, who had forecasted the rejection from $110,000. But what’s more interesting is where Thomas sees the price going from here. Bitcoin Could Drop For Shallow Pullback In the analysis, Thomas explained what is happening with the Bitcoin price and why the pullback could happen. This begins with the breakout after falling toward $100,000 and then bouncing back again. The digital asset was able to quickly clear multiple fair value gaps on the 4-hour timeframes to claim its spot above $110,000. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises The crypto analyst explains that this move has triggered a shift in the sentiment toward the positive, and this has been followed by rising volumes, as well as impulsive candles. In all, this is quite bullish for the cryptocurrency. However, there is still a risk of a price decline from here. After filling multiple fair value gaps with strength, the crypto analyst believes this has set a precedent for the Bitcoin price. He expects the same pattern to play out for the cryptocurrency, which includes a rapid rise before a shallow pullback, and then a continuation from there. BTC Pullback Into $104,000 Territory The Bitcoin price recovery above $110,000 seems to have created a fair value gap below $107,000, which the crypto analyst believes will need to be filled. If this is the case, then it is possible that the price rally will not continue until this condition is fulfilled. Nevertheless, a pullback to the level would not be bearish, but rather provide a bounce-off point for the price recovery. Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash – Here Are The Targets Thomas referred to this trend as “a classic breakout-fill-continue sequence”, and the next thing in line is to fill the fair value gap. According to the shared chart, the crypto analyst sees the pullback taking the price back down below $105,000 and into the $104,000 territory before its next bounce. This would mean a 5% pullback, and going by the trends from this year so far, something that would be bad for altcoins. However, the conclusion remains that Bitcoin is still bullish from here. Once the fair value gap is filled, a strong push upward is expected, possibly toward new all-time highs. “I’m expecting a controlled retracement to fill the new 4H imbalance, after which price could continue pushing toward the major resistance area,” the analyst said. “The momentum is clean and structured—until that changes, continuation remains the more likely path.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-risks-pullback-105000/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T09:29:30,"Ripple CTO On Why XRP Is Different and Better","Ripple CTO David Schwartz has explained how XRP Ledger stands apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum by doing what matters to financial systems. Blockchain technology has taken many forms since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009. Some networks are designed to be simple and unchanging. Others embrace open-ended complexity, mostly existing without proper direction or utility. However, not every blockchain project follows those extremes. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is an example of a network with a clear purpose, as it was designed to serve real-world financial needs with speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. In a video shared by XRPL validator and crypto figure Vet (@Vet_X0), Schwartz outlined the differences between these networks, emphasizing how design choices made over a decade ago continue to define XRP’s unique position today. I really liked this slide by David on how the XRP Ledger is differentiated. pic.twitter.com/6kkrkxkjVC — Vet (@Vet_X0) June 11, 2025 A Different Philosophy from the Start Schwartz began by contrasting XRP’s goals with those of its predecessors. Bitcoin, he said, was created as a way to store and transfer value. “That’s useful,” he added, “but that’s about all it does.” Its strength lies in its simplicity and security, but that also limits its flexibility when compared to XRP . Ethereum took the opposite approach by enabling smart contracts and decentralized application development. It allowed anyone to build and deploy apps directly on the blockchain, creating a highly programmable but complex system. This turned Ethereum into a general-purpose platform, but one that comes with unpredictable transaction fees and performance bottlenecks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP was designed to operate between those two extremes, being less rigid than Bitcoin, but more focused than Ethereum. It wasn’t trying to build an open app ecosystem. It was built specifically to optimize payments and related financial functions. As a result, many market participants believe Bitcoin and Ethereum can’t compete with XRP in the payment space. Choosing Purpose Over Scope From its launch, XRP prioritized fast transaction finality, low and predictable fees, and enterprise-level integration capabilities. Schwartz emphasized that these were not afterthoughts or side benefits, but were central to the network’s architecture. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously stated that XRP was designed by engineers who recognized Bitcoin’s flaws , and this focus allows the digital asset to meet the needs of financial institutions, payment processors, and developers building financial tools. Its performance characteristics have made it attractive to institutions for cross-border payments, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and many other services, especially in environments where reliability and cost control are non-negotiable. Rather than chasing general-purpose blockchain use cases, XRP maintains a tight focus on financial applications. The digital asset was not designed to do everything, but that’s precisely why it does its job well. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a new Bloomberg interview, Saylor says Bitcoin could explode by around 815% from the current level. According to Saylor, the boom-and-bust cycles associated with Bitcoin will no longer be experienced. “Winter’s not coming back. We’re past that phase. Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” The Strategy founder says his bullish thesis for Bitcoin is informed by the fact that Bitcoin has now been embraced by the US government and banks, as well as increasing demand. “…the President of the United States has determined he supports Bitcoin. The cabinet supports Bitcoin, [U.S. Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin, [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair] Paul Atkins has shown himself to be an enthusiastic believer of Bitcoin and digital assets, [Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair nominee Brian] Quintenz at CFTC feels the same way. The banks are going to custody Bitcoin. Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period, the accounting has been corrected. There’s now only 450 Bitcoin a day available for sale by natural sellers, that’s the miners. At this level, that works out to about $50 million of Bitcoin available for sale every day. If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up to find any seller that’s price sensitive.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,260 at time of writing. ?

2025-06-12T09:13:04,"Ethereum ETFs Smoke Bitcoin ETFs with Massive $240M Inflows – $3K Breakout Next?","Ethereum exchange-traded funds have outpaced Bitcoin ETFs, recording a massive $240.29 million in daily net inflows on Wednesday that eclipsed Bitcoin ETFs’ $164.57 million, marking the 18th consecutive day of positive flows into spot ETH ETFs. Total Ethereum Spot ETF Net Inflow Source: SoSoValue This surge represents the highest single-day inflows for Ethereum ETFs in four months. It coincides with ETH’s climb above $2,800 for the first time since February, pushing the asset to a 12-day high. The remarkable momentum began building in early June when Ethereum staking reached an all-time high of 34.65 million ETH locked on the Beacon Chain. This represents nearly 29% of the total circulating supply and shows a long-term conviction among holders who chose to stake rather than sell. Institutional Capital Rotation Drives Ethereum Momentum According to the data from SoSoValue , BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has emerged as the top gainer, leading Wednesday’s inflows with $163.6 million, maintaining a 23-day streak without outflows, and managing over 1.55 million ETH valued at $4.23 billion. Market Data Source: SoSoValue The fund’s stock price has surged over 50% since the start of the year, and cumulative Ethereum ETF inflows have totaled $3.74 billion since their July 2024 debut. Notably, the new administration’s recent regulatory shifts were among the key factors of this renewed confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem, particularly as the network’s Pectra upgrade has addressed long-standing scalability and cost-efficiency challenges that previously hindered developer adoption. In fact, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, speaking at ETHGlobal, recently predicted that the network’s transaction processing capacity will improve tenfold over the next year through layer-1 scaling solutions. The dramatic surge in Ethereum ETF inflows has made investors increasingly view ETH as undervalued relative to Bitcoin’s recent all-time highs and the broader altcoin rally that peaked last year. Technical Breakout Patterns Point Toward $3,000 Target Ethereum’s price action reveals an interesting technical pattern across multiple timeframes. The weekly Elliott Wave analysis displays a comprehensive five-wave impulse pattern from the 2022 lows. The most critical development was Ethereum’s recent breakout above the massive descending trendline, which contained price action since the 2021 all-time highs. This structural break confirms the end of a multi-year accumulation phase marked by a High-Volume Flag pattern throughout 2023, during which smart money built positions while retail sentiment remained bearish. The daily chart reveals a completed inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, with the current price at $2,772 showing strong upward momentum after decisively breaking the red descending trendline that previously acted as resistance. The pattern projects near-term targets around $3,300 with a more ambitious second target approaching $4,000. At the same time, the step-like structure suggests the advance may involve consolidation periods at key resistance levels before continuing higher. Perhaps most compelling is the comparative analysis showing Ethereum repeating Bitcoin’s 2018-2021 cycle almost exactly. Both assets exhibit nearly identical patterns of prolonged bear markets followed by base formation around their respective 1-week MA50 levels. The current Ethereum pattern mirrors Bitcoin’s sequence from the COVID crash through explosive recovery to new all-time highs, positioning ETH similarly to where Bitcoin was in early 2020. If this historical precedent holds, Elliott Wave projections extend to $5,917 and potentially $13,822, representing a dramatic expansion from current levels. Short-term technical indicators present a mixed but ultimately constructive picture as Ethereum trades at $2,771 after briefly breaking above the critical $2,800 resistance zone that has capped price action since early May. However, recent rejection from a high of $2,834 suggests ETH may enter a short-term retest phase, with the $2,750-$2,800 zone now acting as immediate resistance. The MACD remains bullish but is flattening, hinting at potential near-term consolidation. Critical support levels to monitor include the $2,680 zone representing the 50% Fibonacci retracement level, with deeper support at $2,620 and $2,550. For the bullish scenario to play out, Ethereum must decisively break above $2,880 resistance to trigger the next major leg toward $3,000 and beyond. If the Bitcoin comparison proves accurate, ultimate cycle targets will reach well into five-figure territory.

2025-06-12T09:05:57,"Analysts Reject Claims That BTC Will Repeat 2022 Collapse","Most analysts disagree, and pointed to the vastly different macroeconomic conditions today and a lack of the fear-driven catalysts like FTX’s collapse. Michael Saylor dismissed the idea of another crypto winter entirely, as he believes that Bitcoin is now on a long-term upward path. Saylor also revealed that his Bitcoin conviction was born out of the post-COVID monetary policies, which he described as a “war on currency.” Meanwhile, Swedish health tech firm H100 Group AB saw its stock surge 45% after raising $10.6 million to expand its Bitcoin treasury. Peter Brandt Questions Bitcoin Rally Veteran trader Peter Brandt started a fresh debate among crypto analysts with a speculative post on X , which suggested that Bitcoin could be mirroring its 2022 trajectory and potentially face a 75% correction. Recalling the previous market cycle, Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $69,000 in November of 2021 before plunging roughly 76% over the next year to around $16,195. Brandt asked whether a similar pattern could play out from today’s price close to $107,810, which would mean a drop to around $26,000. This level was last seen in September of 2023. Despite the historical reference, market experts are still unconvinced that such a drastic correction is on the horizon. Pav Hundal , lead analyst at Swyftx, explained that macroeconomic conditions are fundamentally different now compared to the post-COVID stimulus era of 2022. He pointed out that the current market does not share the same monetary excesses that fueled risk-on behavior back then. Bitcoin analyst Andy Edstrom acknowledged some similarities in chart structure but argued that the magnitude of a correction will likely be far less severe this time. He attributed the previous bear market’s intensity to major events like the collapse of FTX and the US Federal Reserve’s abrupt shift to a hawkish monetary policy, factors that are not present today. (Source: X ) Collective Shift analyst Simon Amery also pointed out that the Fed’s current direction is toward easing rather than tightening, and added to the argument that conditions are more favorable for Bitcoin now than they were in late 2021. Similarly, crypto analyst Colin Talks Crypto dismissed the idea of a peak due to the lack of euphoria that typically characterizes market tops. Michael Saylor, executive chairman of Strategy and a prominent Bitcoin advocate, outright rejected any forecasts of a downturn. Speaking to Bloomberg, he said that the era of crypto winters is over. “If Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million,” he said. Michael Saylor’s Bloomberg interview While Brandt’s cautionary outlook stirred a lot of conversation, but most analysts see little evidence supporting the idea of another 75% correction. Covid Policies Pushed Saylor to Bitcoin Michael Saylor also recently revealed that the driving force behind his massive Bitcoin investment was the global economic response to COVID-19, which he described as a “war on currency.” Speaking with Dr. Jordan B. Peterson in a June 9 interview , Saylor explained that it was not the pandemic itself, but the monetary policies and lockdowns that followed, which pushed him to seek an alternative store of value. In an email to employees at the time, Saylor decried the restrictions as “soul-stealing” and pointed out the stark contrast between the suffering on Main Street and the prosperity on Wall Street. While small businesses were being devastated by lockdowns, financial markets rebounded quickly, which was largely due to central banks slashing interest rates and injecting liquidity into the economy. With $500 million in cash reserves and no yield in sight due to near-zero interest rates, Saylor felt backed into a corner. He called the situation a choice between “a fast death or a slow death,” as inflation in asset prices erased the value of holding cash. Saylor described the Federal Reserve’s aggressive money printing as causing “hyperinflation in financial assets,” enriching Wall Street while leaving traditional cash holders like him at a disadvantage. He ruled out sovereign debt and real estate due to overvaluation, and joked about the impossibility of finding $500 million in fairly priced Picassos and Monets. What he needed, he concluded, was a liquid and durable store of value. He was initially skeptical of crypto, which he once dismissed as a “scam coin,” but Saylor reached out to longtime friend Eric Weiss, founder of the Blockchain Investment Group. After consuming large amounts of educational content, he realized that Bitcoin offered a unique solution—a decentralized, non-sovereign store of value similar to gold but better suited for the digital age. Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: SaylorTracker ) MicroStrategy made its first purchase of 21,454 BTC for $250 million in August of 2020. Since then, the firm has grown to become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin after amassing 582,000 BTC valued at approximately $63 billion. H100 Stock Soars After Bitcoin Bet Swedish health tech firm H100 Group AB and its shareholders also seem confident in Bitcoin’s trajectory. The firm’s stock price surged by 45% on Wednesday after the announcement of a successful capital raise to boost its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company raised 101 million Swedish krona, or approximately $10.6 million, which was much higher than its earlier raise of $2.2 million led by Bitcoin advocate Adam Back on May 25. So far, it seems like this new funding reinforced investor confidence, pushing H100’s share price to 4.64 krona ($0.49) on the Nordic Growth Market. This is a staggering 280% increase since the company first announced its Bitcoin strategy on May 22, according to data from MarketWatch . H100 Group’s share price over the past 5 days (Source: MarketWatch ) The capital raise was structured into two segments: 69.65 million krona from share issues and an additional 31.35 million krona from convertible loans. H100 stated that the net proceeds will be used explicitly to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury efforts. Based on current prices, this will allow the company to purchase around 67.1 BTC, which would bring its total holdings to 81.85 BTC when added to its existing reserve of 13.95 BTC. The firm explained that this is part of a shift toward incorporating Bitcoin into its balance sheet, to align with the growing global trend where publicly traded companies are increasingly adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. About 126 firms worldwide have added Bitcoin to their treasuries, with 14 new companies doing so in the past three weeks alone, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . Bitcoin holders (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) The recent funding round drew support from a mix of investors including UTXO Management, Adam Back, and Nordic-based investment firms like Race Ventures Scandinavia and Crafoord Capital Partners. Notably, the convertible loans carry no interest and are set to mature in five years, with an option for investors to convert into equity at 1.75 krona per share.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9541/analysts-reject-claims-that-btc-will-repeat-2022-collapse,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Novogratz Warns Against Strategy “Copycats” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News GameStop is back in headlines but this time, it’s not about meme stock mania. The retailer is raising $1.75 billion, and one possible use of those funds? Buying Bitcoin. That’s the kind of move that might’ve thrilled the market a year ago. But according to Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, the strategy is losing its shine. “You see a whole new range of… balance sheet company plays. I think that’s probably getting a little overhyped,” Novogratz said in a recent Fox Business interview , referencing companies copying Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-heavy approach. It’s a pointed take from someone who’s long championed Bitcoin and it lands at a moment when institutional interest is clearly rising again. Let’s understand his view. Debt + Bitcoin = Risk? Novogratz’s concern is the growing number of public companies chasing Bitcoin exposure without considering the risk profile. Several of these firms, including GameStop, are funding their strategies through massive debt raises. That’s raising eyebrows among market watchers, especially those who remember what overleveraged bets look like in a downturn. The concern isn’t about Bitcoin itself but about how it’s being acquired. In short: just because Saylor made it work doesn’t mean everyone else will. Bitcoin Thrives When Trust Fails If you’re wondering whether Novogratz has turned bearish, the answer is no – not even close. His recent tweet cuts straight to the core of why he still sees Bitcoin as essential. “We are in a bear market in trust across the country and the world!” he posted on June 10 . “That is the underpinning of the crypto rally.” He pointed back to 2008, when Bitcoin first emerged from the wreckage of the global financial crisis. According to Novogratz, not much has changed, except the stakes are higher. “Sadly the world hasn’t gotten [trust] back,” he added. His advice to investors was “Stay long crypto.” BTC Price Outlook: It’s All About Washington Novogratz also weighed in on what could drive Bitcoin higher from here and it’s got everything to do with U.S. fiscal policy. “We had a populist government on the left, and now we have a populist government on the right. They love spending money,” he said. In his view, that’s setting Bitcoin up for “a really nice” price trajectory. He didn’t give a specific target for the Bitcoin price this time and left it open-ended. “Once it goes, you don’t know where it’s gonna stop.” But beyond price action, Novogratz is bullish on something even bigger – the structural shift in the U.S. regulatory climate. He believes the next 24 months will look nothing like the last, with trends like tokenized equities and fixed income poised to reshape how institutions interact with the space. Still Bullish, But Not Blind To be clear, Novogratz isn’t calling for companies to avoid Bitcoin. What he’s saying is more nuanced; that buying BTC should be part of a thoughtful strategy, not a bandwagon move. The irony is hard to miss: as traditional institutions grow more interested in crypto, some newer players are adopting the kind of herd behavior the industry was built to move past. Still, Novogratz remains one of the loudest voices pushing for responsible growth.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/imitating-saylor-is-dangerous-novogratz-warns-against-strategy-copycats/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T09:01:47,"Bitcoin Sell Pressure to Vanish Above $130K, Says Bitwise CEO","Bitcoin is showing signs of strong resilience as it trades just below its all-time high, and according to Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley, the ongoing sell pressure may soon disappear entirely. Horsley believes that once BTC crosses the $130,000 to $150,000 range, investors will stop selling altogether, ushering in a new phase of price discovery. “I think once Bitcoin breaks through, e.g., $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin,” Horsley said in a recent X post. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $107,750. While the market appears to be consolidating at these levels, analysts point out that most of the selling comes from early adopters locking in profits after years of holding. Bitcoin Old Holders Are Selling, But Not for Long Horsley explained that the current wave of sell pressure is largely driven by long-term holders who acquired Bitcoin at extremely low prices years ago. These early investors are now taking advantage of the psychological milestone of $100,000 to cash out. Onchain data supports this, with firms like Glassnode previously warning of a surge in selling behavior from older wallets once Bitcoin hit six figures. However, Horsley emphasized that this phase is temporary. “Once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this will peter off,” he noted, predicting that sell pressure will fade as the asset continues to climb. Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz also sees a price range of $130K–$150K as realistic for 2025, citing increasing institutional inflows and broader adoption of digital assets. Lending Over Selling As Bitcoin matures and prices climb, investors are exploring new ways to access liquidity without selling their coins. Horsley highlighted this shift, explaining that long-term holders are increasingly turning to crypto lending platforms. “When people need liquidity, they are going to borrow from an ever-growing set of lenders,” he said, pointing out that such behavior will further restrict supply and push prices higher. This supply squeeze is already visible. OTC desks are reporting a tightening of available Bitcoin, and Strategy’s Michael Saylor recently noted that only around 450 new BTC are mined daily — roughly $50 million worth. “It only takes $50 million to turn the entire driveshaft of the crypto economy,” Saylor remarked, stressing how minimal buying pressure can now create outsized price movements.

Profitability concerns despite revenue growth as Q2 2025 revenue rose 62.5% YoY to $181.7 million, but the company reported a net loss of $138.8 million. CleanSpark is now funding its operation by selling a portion of its production. This marks a shift from its earlier strategy and is less equity dilutive. CleanSpark has a strong balance sheet and could be a leverage play on Bitcoin, but high mining costs and declining rewards make the business model risky. Upgrading to “Hold” but. I’ve written about CleanSpark ( CLSK ) in the past, as I had turned bearish on the company last year. This article serves as an update to my previous one . There have been a few key developments in the company as it has grown and expanded its Bitcoin operations. The Goal to Reach 60 EH/s In a recent update for the month of May 2025, CleanSpark reported that its hashrate has increased by 7.5% to 45.6 EH/s compared to the previous month. This puts the company on track to reach 50 EH/s by June, being the only publicly listed miner to reach this threshold. As a miner, the company is operating at quite an efficient scale with a deployed fleet of over 230,000 miners and an average efficiency of 16.71 J/Th. Part of the company’s selling point to investors is that it is a pure-play, vertically integrated Bitcoin miner with an infrastructure-first growth strategy. What this means is that CleanSpark has made it a priority to own its infrastructure and not rely on third parties. This includes the power infrastructure that allows its miners to operate at high uptime and efficiency . As mentioned in the company’s investor presentation , CleanSpark is an energy professional who saw the future in Bitcoin and not Bitcoin miners who figured out power. CleanSpark Investor Relations In connection with that stated strategy, the company has also secured an additional 72 megawatts of contracted power, bringing the entire total to 987 megawatts. According to CEO Zac Bradford, the company’s vertically integrated model gives it an efficiency edge over peers. As stated in the press release; This milestone reflects the strength of our vertically integrated model, allowing us to scale efficiently, retain operational control, and protect margins. Importantly, reaching 50 EH/s is not our endpoint. We intend to continue building, and with much infrastructure already in place, we are well-positioned to achieve over 60 EH/s. We believe this execution-focused strategy will continue to drive long-term value for shareholders. Year-to-date, CleanSpark has produced a total of 3,283 BTC, of which 694 BTC were mined in May. For the month, it sold 293.5 BTC at an average price of $102,254. This represents 42% of all BTC mined during the month, with the rest being added into the company’s treasury. It is part of CleanSpark’s strategy to build up a massive Bitcoin chest and eventually book that capital gain should the price of BTC continue to rise. Currently, the company is holding 12,502 BTC, which has doubled from the same time last year. At the current price of $109,718, CleanSpark’s Bitcoin holdings are worth $1.37 billion. While it is good that the company is increasing its efficiency in terms of its hashrate, profitability remains a concern. Because of the last halving event and the way Bitcoin rewards decrease over time, this may not necessarily result in profit for CleanSpark as I will discuss further below. Quarter Results Looking at the company’s Q2 2025 quarter results shows an improvement compared to the previous year. CleanSpark reported $181.7 million this quarter, which was a large improvement of 62.5% compared to the $111.8 million reported at the same time last year. Unfortunately, this did not fall to the bottom line, as the results were worse than they were a year ago. Net loss for the quarter was $-138.8 million. This is in contrast to the Net Income of $126.7 million reported in Q2 2024. Even on an adjusted EBITDA basis, the company still showed worse performance this year compared to last, with a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $57.8 million compared to $181.8 million the same time last year. I looked through the company’s 10-Q to try to find the source of the poor quarter-over-quarter income comparables. What really stood out the most was the sharp increase in cost of revenues, which was $85.4 million for the quarter. This was more than double the $51.1 million reported at the same time last year. Management attributed these higher costs to the energy costs due to the increase in the volume of miners. This aligns with the disclosures stating that on a per kWh basis, costs moved from $0.060 and $0.043 or 39.5%, in its owned facilities where it mined the majority of its Bitcoin. The cost of mining Bitcoin has increased Management has brought up the issue of costs in the earnings call , stating its marginal cost per coin. However, as I detailed last year in my previous article, this does not include the other mining costs, most notably the depreciation of the miners. Mining rigs typically don’t last for more than 3 years; therefore, it cannot be viewed as a long-term asset in the traditional way. Taking this into account, CleanSpark’s mining cost per Bitcoin, including non-cash depreciation, is $77,783. Compared to the mining cost and depreciation of $27,007 this is close to 3x as much cost to mine and was larger than I feared. In other words, on a Gross Profit basis, Bitcoin would need to trade around $78,000 just for the company to break even based on this quarter’s results. As mentioned on the earnings call; Notably, our marginal cost per coin was approximately $42,600, a 26% increase over the first quarter. The increase in our marginal cost per coin can be attributed both to an increase in mining difficulty as well as rising power prices. Our average cost per kilowatt-hour increased during the quarter to $0.06. And as Zach mentioned, this was a result of intentionally managing to a margin rather than to a specific cost per kilowatt-hour. CleanSpark Investor Relations This circles back to a fundamental business problem with Bitcoin mining in general, that over time, you get less Bitcoin mined even as computational capacity increases. This is even worse when taking into account the every-four-year halving event, which happened last year. As shown here clearly in the quarter-over-quarter results of CleanSpark, management has greatly expanded its operations, as evidenced by its higher costs. However, since you get less Bitcoin mined over time for the same amount of power, revenue goes up more slowly than the increase in costs. CleanSpark Investor Relations CleanSpark Shifts Its Capital Strategy In a recent press release , CleanSpark has announced that it is “expanding” its capital strategy by increasing its credit facility with Coinbase ( COIN ) through its Bitcoin-collateralized lending program. In conjunction with this, the company has an institutional-grade Bitcoin treasury desk. Apart from the usual functions of managing the custodial process of its Bitcoin reserves, running a treasury desk implies certain optimization tasks. Thinking of how a normal treasury department works, these tasks and strategies include liquidity management, borrowing and lending, and portfolio/risk management. Therefore, it makes sense that it can borrow against its Bitcoin reserves to service any liquidity it may need via this credit line of $200 million. According to management, CleanSpark has now reached a sufficient scale to self-fund operations and build upon its Bitcoin holdings via the cash flow it has generated from its operations. In other words, rather than simply “holding” all the Bitcoin it has mined, a portion of the monthly production will be sold to support operations. Therefore, its treasury desk has the responsibility to strategically manage this process by deciding if it's best to sell or borrow and hold this Bitcoin. Moving back to using production to fund operations marks a shift in the company’s philosophy. In the past few years, starting mid-2023, CleanSpark has relied on equity dilution to fund its growth. The company was on a “100% hold strategy” where it would keep its Bitcoin mined and rely on fundraising for its operational expenses. In June 2023, the company had 114.8 million diluted shares outstanding. This had ballooned by 144% to 280.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Moving away from dilutive capital is a positive sign for company shareholders. Data by YCharts Using production for operations has signaled that CleanSpark has both reached the economic scale necessary to be self-sufficient and has amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin that it can utilize via its new treasury department. Currently, the company has a decent balance sheet as well, with Total Assets of $2.65 billion, of which roughly $100 million is in cash and the aforementioned $1.37 billion in Bitcoin. This is sufficient to cover its total liabilities of $766 million, of which $641.7 million is in long-term debt. The strength of CleanSpark’s balance sheet puts it in a position where it has a lot of wiggle room with its treasury department on how to properly utilize its capital. Since “mining” itself isn’t insanely profitable, a lot of the value of CleanSpark actually comes from its reserved Bitcoin portfolio. Being able to manage this portfolio to take advantage of future Bitcoin capital gains while making sure the company has enough liquidity to run will be crucial. Conclusion It is commendable that CleanSpark has stopped relying on dilutive capital raises and is now deciding to fund the business with a portion of its Bitcoin production. The company’s strong balance sheet and new treasury department will give it the nimbleness to manage and utilize its Bitcoin reserves and production. However, I still have concerns with the company and the overall business model of Bitcoin miners in general. Despite CleanSpark being an expert in energy management and efficiency, the overall production costs of Bitcoin remain quite high. I have always believed that the better play for crypto exposure would be to simply buy Bitcoin itself through one of the many now available ETFs. As seen in the chart below, CleanSpark has underperformed the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. Data by YCharts There are certain key risks to my bearish thesis. The main one is that the company continues to become more efficient, such that it is able to further lower its energy costs. If Bitcoin prices rally sharply, then CleanSpark could end up being a decent leverage play on Bitcoin. The company currently has a “B+” valuation grade on Seeking Alpha’s quant metric due to its low forward P/E of 10.4x and low forward EV/ EBITDA of 7.45x. This is a pretty decent valuation and reflects the expectations of improved profitability in the future. Seeking Alpha However, the unknown factor that is out of the company’s hands is the hashrate, determining how many rewards miners earn. CleanSpark may be super-efficient, but if the rewards earned from mining keep decreasing at such a rate, it cancels Bitcoin price increases, then a Bitcoin ETF may still be the better play. I am upgrading my company rating, though, from a “Sell” to a “Hold.”",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794285-cleanspark-sparking-an-upgrade-from-sell-to-hold?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","CLSK",cryptocompare

Ant International will apply for a stablecoin issuer's license once the regulatory regime comes into effect in August, according to the report, citing people familiar with the matter. The firm is also planning to apply for a similar license in its native Singapore, as well as Luxembourg. Hong Kong has been establishing a stablecoin regime since 2023 , with the legislation expected to go into effect in August. Stablecoins are tokens pegged to the value of a traditional financial asset, such as a fiat currency, providing a counterweight to the volatility of BTC, ETH and other cryptos. As such they may represent an entry point to the digital asset market for major financial or technological companies. Progress toward stablecoin regulation in the world's most prominent markets, particularly the U.S. , should help accelerate this trend. Alipay is referred to as the largest mobile payment platform in the world with over a billion users, thanks to being the most dominant provider in China, where it holds a share of 55% in the third-party payment market.

2025-06-12T08:51:53,"SEC blocks DeFi Development’s $1B Solana plan, company withdraws S-3 filing","DeFi Development Corp. has withdrawn its planned $1 billion securities offering after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deemed the company ineligible to file under Form S-3. The company confirmed the withdrawal in a June 11 letter to the SEC, citing the absence of a required internal controls report in its most recent 10-K filing. The Nasdaq-listed firm had filed the S-3 registration in April with the aim of raising funds for general corporate use, including the purchase of additional Solana ( SOL ) tokens. The plan echoed Strategy’s well-known Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy, with DeFi Development aiming to become a public market vehicle for Solana exposure. While no securities were issued or sold under the now-withdrawn registration, the SEC’s move is a major regulatory setback for the company’s treasury-focused crypto strategy. The SEC’s rejection highlights ongoing challenges for firms trying to navigate U.S. securities rules while building corporate crypto reserves. You might also like: Moody’s tests first on-chain credit rating system on Solana Despite the withdrawal, DeFi Development has stated that it intends to refile a resale registration at a later date, once compliance issues are addressed. The company noted that the withdrawal was “consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.” DeFi Development has already invested significantly in Solana, with reported holdings of over 600,000 SOL, valued at more than $100 million. In May, it also became the first publicly traded firm to adopt liquid staking tokens on Solana, converting part of its holdings into dfdvSOL through Sanctum’s staking infrastructure. That move was intended to allow the company to retain liquidity while earning staking rewards. Earlier this month, DeFi Development announced a strategic partnership with Amber International to expand access to Solana markets and building yield-focused treasury products. The firm has also been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and now trades options on CBOE and Nasdaq, increasing its visibility among institutional investors. Originally focused on real estate finance, the company rebranded in April after a new team, reportedly including former Kraken executives, took over with a crypto-first strategy centered on Solana. While its billion-dollar shelf offering is on hold for now, DeFi Development appears committed to building a public-facing Solana treasury model. Its next steps will likely depend on how it addresses SEC concerns and whether regulators warm to similar strategies involving altcoins.

2025-06-12T08:44:22,"Bitcoin whale activity spikes as US CPI hints at cooling inflation","Bitcoin (BTC) is again capturing headlines as it edges closer to its all-time high, driven by bullish whale behaviour and encouraging macroeconomic indicators. Currently trading at around $107,865, the cryptocurrency briefly crossed the $110,000 mark following the release of softer-than-expected US inflation data, reigniting investor optimism and hinting at a potential breakout in the coming weeks. At the heart of this momentum is the behaviour of large BTC holders, whose recent actions suggest growing confidence in further upside rather than an imminent market top. Whales holding tight as prices approach record highs Despite sitting just 2.82% below its record high of over $111,000, Bitcoin on-chain data reveals that major holders, referred to as whales, are not rushing to cash out. According to on-chain analytics from CryptoQuant, these entities are showing restraint, with little evidence of the typical profit-taking activity that often accompanies peak market phases. Analyst Crypto Dan emphasised that whales appear to be waiting for a more euphoric market environment before initiating large-scale sell-offs, a behaviour consistent with previous bull market tops.

Exchange inflows remain muted despite Bitcoin approaching its ATH Further reinforcing the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost highlighted subdued exchange inflows from whales, particularly on Binance, even as Bitcoin flirts with historic highs. CryptoQuant.com @cryptoquant_com · Follow A strong bullish signal from Binance whales!“Today, however, inflows are just around $3 billion and are continuing to decline, suggesting that these whales prefer to keep holding.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full analysis ⤵️ cryptoquant.com/insights/quick… 4:23 PM · Jun 11, 2025 174 Reply Copy link Read 17 replies Historically, exchange inflows from large holders tend to spike when Bitcoin approaches or surpasses major resistance levels, often signalling a desire to take profits. However, current data tells a different story, with Binance inflows hovering around $3 billion, far below the $5.3 billion observed in early 2024 and even further from peaks of $8.45 billion in past cycles. This declining trend in whale inflows strongly indicates that big players are choosing to hold rather than sell, pointing to continued belief in further upside. Such behaviour has significant implications, as whale activity often influences market liquidity and can foreshadow broader sentiment shifts among institutional investors. Cooling US inflation bolsters the bullish BTC momentum Adding to Bitcoin’s tailwinds is the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which signalled a deceleration in US inflation for May 2025. According to the released CPI data, the headline CPI rose just 0.1%, falling below the anticipated 0.2%, while the core CPI — excluding food and energy — also climbed only 0.1%, against forecasts of 0.3%. These figures not only reinforce the narrative of easing inflation but also increase the probability of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this year. According to the CME FedWatch Tool , market participants are now expecting two cuts in 2025, with the first likely arriving in September and another in December. Lower interest rates tend to favour risk-on assets like Bitcoin, and the crypto market has already started pricing in this shift with renewed bullish enthusiasm. Recent golden cross formation adds to the bullish BTC optimism From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin (BTC) is also flashing strong bullish technical signals, with a golden cross forming on the weekly chart. This pattern, where the 50-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day moving average, is often viewed as a reliable indicator of sustained upward momentum.

Dogecoin fell nearly 4% to $0.1902, while Tron’s TRX dropped 5.5% to $0.275. Other large-cap tokens, including XRP ($2.24), BNB ($667.21), Solana ($158.86), and Cardano ($0.6897), posted losses of up to 3%.

Several tokens are now trading near local resistance levels, leading some traders to take profits. Despite the near-term pullback, the broader outlook remains constructive. Several experts have been making bullish predictions for the top coin and the crypto market in general. The enthusiasm is also seen in one of 2025’s most-watched crypto presales, Bitcoin Pepe .

In a post on X on Wednesday, Horsley said, “I think once Bitcoin breaks through, eg, $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin.” According to him, the current round of selling is largely driven by early holders who acquired Bitcoin at significantly lower prices and are now taking profits as the asset hovers near the psychologically significant $100,000 mark. Hunter Horsley @HHorsley · Follow I think once Bitcoin breaks through eg $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin.Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices, are selling some.

His comments align with earlier warnings from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, which flagged a “notable increase” in selling by long-term holders as Bitcoin approached and crossed the $100,000 milestone on May 8. Bitcoin Pepe’s momentum continues Bitcoin’s continued rally has bolstered sentiment across the crypto market, creating conditions that have historically paved the way for broader upswings. In this risk-on backdrop, investors are once again rotating into speculative assets, with meme coins emerging as early beneficiaries. Among the names gaining traction is Bitcoin Pepe, a project that aims to combine viral internet culture with a Layer 2 blockchain framework. Bitcoin Pepe has distinguished itself with a technical vision to “build Solana on Bitcoin”—an attempt to combine Bitcoin’s security with Solana-like scalability. Unlike many meme tokens that rely solely on momentum and community buzz, Bitcoin Pepe is anchored by a defined technical roadmap and infrastructure-oriented narrative. The project has already raised over $14 million through its ongoing presale ahead of a listing announcement on June 17. As capital continues to flow into early-stage tokens, Bitcoin Pepe appears to be capitalising on renewed speculative interest in the final phase of its token sale.

With the 2024 Bitcoin halving now behind us and a renewed bullish sentiment in the air, 2025 presents a prime opportunity to explore promising altcoins. Below mentioned are the altcoins in each sector that could attract significant profits. AI & Infrastructure Tokens Render (RNDR) : The demand for the decetralised GPU rendering and AI-generated content surges, RNDR stands out. It’s already making waves in the digital art and metaverse sectors. RNDR price is defending the ascending support, which suggests the token is about to undergo a 40% recovery followed by a 40% upswing towards local highs. Fetch.ai (FET) : It is a key player in AI agents and decentralized machine learning, especially with its integration into the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The FET price has triggered a strong recovery, forming consecutive higher highs and lows. Once the token surges above the threshold at $1, the bulls may elevate the levels to new highs. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) : It enables secure and private data sharing for AI training, which is becoming increasingly valuable. After reaching the lowest point, the OCEAN price has triggered a strong recovery. Therefore, the token is expected to rise by more than 150% in the rest of 2025 and print new highs. Layer 1 (L1) Blockchain Tokens Ethereum (ETH) : Ethereum is the most dominant smart contract platform, which is the home for most of the DeFi, NFTs, and many more tokens. Besides the upgrades like Dencun and potential shrading improvements make it a long-term hold. The ETH price is holding strong above $2700, paving the way to reach $3000. Solana (SOL) : Known for its speed and scalability, Solana has attracted major meme coins and DeFi platforms. Besides, the SOL price has also displayed immense strength in recent times and hence is believed to reclaim $180 and later $200 which could further push the price to new highs. Avalanche (AVAX) : Its subnet technology and enterprise partnerships with Deloitte and AWS make it more attractive. The AVAX price is facing some upward pressure in the short term but remains under bullish influence in the long term, with a potential rise of over 40% in the next couple of weeks. Interoperability and Oracles-Based Tokens Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink is a leading decentralized oracle network, essential for DeFi. The LINK price volatility has increased for over a year and by raising the support levels, the bulls have displayed a huge rise in their dominance. Hence, the price in the long term is expected to rebound and validate a 50% upswing soon. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot is focused on cross-chain compatibility through parachains. The token has lost traders’ interest over time as the price has failed to rise above $10 since the 2022 bear market. Therefore, an excessive compression is expected to trigger a strong breakout and breach above the levels. Cosmos (ATOM) : It popularizes the app-chain and modular blockchain. The ATOM price has been experiencing a massive drain for the past few years and might have reached the local bottom. Therefore, a strong rebound could follow hereafter that could elevate the price to new highs. Altcoins offer immense opportunities in 2025 especially as blockchain adoption spreads into AI, DeFi, Gaming, and beyond.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-just-3-away-from-highs-top-altcoins-to-buy-ahead-of-btc-price-marking-a-new-ath/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T08:21:07,"Is the Big Altcoin Season Starting in June? Here’s What Analysts Think","Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal has published a remarkable assessment that the altcoin season could begin in 2025. The analysis claimed that despite the disappointing altcoin performances for many investors in the last market cycle, a new turning point may have been reached. Alphractal analyzed the relationship between Bitcoin (BTC) price and the Altcoin Season Index on a weekly timeframe. This indicator measures the performance of altcoins against BTC over the past 3 months. According to the company’s assessment, two different scenarios could herald the altcoin season: Weakness After Bitcoin Rise: When BTC shows the first signs of weakness after a long period of rise, investors turn to alternative cryptocurrencies and the altcoin season begins. Related News: List of the 20 Altcoins That Crypto Developers Have Focused On the Most in the Last Year Has Been Revealed - There's a Big Surprise at the Top When Bitcoin is Declining or Bottoming: When BTC is at historical lows, some altcoins are gaining relative advantage by showing less decline. One of the striking findings in the analysis is that the altcoin season has started in June every year since 2022. According to these data, June 2025 may also be a part of this cycle. When the timeframe is reduced to the daily level, it is found that 23% of altcoins are outperforming BTC. The Altcoin Season Index is currently in the uncertainty zone, which suggests that the Bitcoin season may be over. According to the analytics firm, this signals that altcoins may exhibit stronger movements in the coming days. Total Web3 investments in the first quarter of 2025 reached $3.8 billion, the highest level since mid-2022, while second-quarter investments fell to the lowest level since 2019. Alphractal notes that these investment trends can show strong correlations with altcoin seasons. According to Alphractal’s analysis, the altcoin market is on the verge of a major transformation. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is the Big Altcoin Season Starting in June?

2025-06-12T08:20:48,"Here’s When Investors Will Stop Selling Bitcoin: Bitwise CEO","With Bitcoin pushing toward new highs, market participants are speculating on what comes next. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently weighed in, offering a bold take on potential shifts in holder behavior. The exec believes Bitcoin could enter a new phase of market behavior once it surpasses the $130,000 to $150,000 range. Bitcoin Holders to Change Tactics? In a tweet posted this week, Horsley noted that while the cryptocurrency is currently hovering around $100,000, long-term holders who accumulated BTC at much lower prices are still selling portions of their holdings. However, he argued that this trend will diminish once Bitcoin breaks into new all-time high territory. According to Horsley, at that point, rather than selling, holders will increasingly opt to borrow against their Bitcoin through a growing number of lenders in the space. This shift, he said, will tighten supply and push prices even higher. “There’s simply not going to be enough Bitcoin,” Horsley added, suggesting a future scenario where rising demand and limited sell-side pressure drive the upward momentum. His comments reflect growing market anticipation that the next major breakout could mark a transition from distribution to accumulation. Retail Crowd Turns Bullish Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recovery triggered a surge in bullish sentiment among retail investors who have been mostly absent during this cycle. This was indicative in Santiment’s recent update , which found that positive Bitcoin-related commentary across social media now outpaces negative mentions by more than two-to-one, a level of optimism not seen since Donald Trump’s election over seven months ago. However, analysts caution that rising greed and retail enthusiasm may signal a market top. The Fear and Greed Index supports this with a score of 71. Long-term holders continue accumulating while also taking daily profits nearing $930 million. Whales, for one, have remained patient and are expecting higher prices. Analysts argue Bitcoin’s fixed supply could benefit from monetary instability as US debt ceiling tensions rise.
