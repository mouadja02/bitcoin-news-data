2025-06-12T18:52:00,"Best altcoins to buy if Bitcoin hits $1m as Michael Saylor predicts","Michael Saylor, Strategy’s founder, delivered a bold Bitcoin price prediction this week, saying the cryptocurrency could surge to $1 million within the next few years. Saylor cited rising demand from institutions and governments, dwindling exchange balances, and the limited supply, just 450 new Bitcoin ( BTC ) coins mined per day, as key drivers behind his forecast. Best altcoins to buy if Bitcoin price hits $1M A surge in Bitcoin to $1 million would likely trigger broad gains across the crypto market, as altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s momentum. Some of the best-positioned altcoins in that scenario are AAVE ( AAVE ), Solana ( SOL ), and Tron ( TRX ). AAVE AAVE is one of the top altcoins to buy if Bitcoin surged to $1 million. It is the biggest player in decentralized finance, an industry that Paul Atkins, the head of the SEC supports . The platform’s growth has accelerated in 2025, with total value locked (TVL) rising to over $27 billion. AAVE is also generating more than $1.5 million in daily fees, while its native stablecoin, GHO, now has a market cap of $218 million. Importantly, AAVE has weathered some of crypto’s worst periods, including the FTX, Celsius, and Terra collapses in 2022. AAVE also has strong technicals as this crypto.news article noted. It has formed a golden cross pattern, while the Average Directional Index is pointing upwards, signaling that the momentum is growing. The token will likely continue rising as bulls target last year’s high of $400, up by 33% from the current level. AAVE price chart | Source: crypto.news Tron Tron is another top altcoin to buy because of its strong fundamentals. Data shows that it is the second most profitable player in the crypto industry after Tether. It has made over $1 billion in fees this year, much higher than chains like Solana and Ethereum. Tron is also one of the most deflationary tokens in the crypto industry because of its token burns. This deflation will continue as the community votes on reducing block time and voting rewards. Tron is also forming a rounded bottom, which may push it to last year’s high of $0.4493, up by 63% from the current level. Tron price chart | Source: crypto.news Solana Solana is another top cryptocurrency to buy because of its strong fundamentals. It has the most active transactions, with the 30-day figure jumping by 56% to 1.92 billion. These transactions are more than those of other chains, combined. Solana also has the most active addresses. It had over 135 million active addresses in the last 30 days, also higher than the other top chains. Solana has a vibrant ecosystem with hundreds of dApps in all areas like decentralized finance, real-world asset tokenization and decentralized public infrastructure. Solana stats | Source: Nansen The Securities and Exchange Commission will also likely approve spot SOL ETFs, making it available to Wall Street investors. It also has a staking reward of 8.5%, higher than many chains. Some of the other blue-chip altcoins to buy if Bitcoin hits $1 million are Aptos, Sui, Stellar, and XRP.

2025-06-12T18:51:27,"Ethereum Price Prediction: “You Haven’t Seen What ETH Can Do Yet” – Analyst Warns of Massive Incoming Bull Market","Crypto analyst Kev is sounding the alarm—in a good way. He believes the Ethereum price is about to remind everyone why it leads altcoin seasons , warning that “we haven’t seen what Ethereum is capable of in this cycle” yet. In a Jun 9 Podcast , the analyst likened the monthly trend reversal observed since the mid-April market bottom to those that preceded historic rallies in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020. Calling the current setup the “most textbook example yet,” Kev suggests ETH could be entering a 4–12 month window of sustained upside, placing it among the best cryptos to buy now . ETH / USD 1-month chart, historic bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, BITSTAMP. Monthly Indicators Reach Levels “Never Seen Before” The bullish case for ETH extends beyond historical patterns into technical momentum, with indicators flashing signals “never seen before” in what could be a precursor to a bottom. Kevin highlights that buyers have yet to reach a point of exhaustion this cycle. The RSI remains well below the overbought 70 threshold, currently at 52. A sign he believes indicates untapped upside, with the 2017 and 2020 bull cycles topping in the 80-90 range. “The real party starts when we break 70, and we’re not even close yet,” he said. The analyst also points to the whale money flow indicator, which is rebounding from one of its most oversold points in history—a pattern that previously aligned with long-term trend reversals. More so, Ethereum’s monthly stochastic RSI is in the midst of a sharp V-shaped recovery, signaling what Kevin called “aggressive, aggressive strength.” The analyst claims an Ethereum breakout as the key needed to push the next altcoin season, pointing to the impending breakout of an ascending triangle targeting a $6 trillion market cap on the altcoin chart. Ethereum Price Analysis: Is an ETH Breakout Near? Looking at the Ethereum price chart, momentum does appear to be building towards a breakout with a huge symmetrical triangle forming since the 2020 bull market high now coming into focus. The Weekly RSI has adopted a sharp uptrend after battling to hold the neutral line, currently at 56—an early indicator of a longer-term uptrend taking root as buy pressure returns. Supporting this, the MACD line continues to widen above the signal line following a recent golden cross, reinforcing the shift toward bullish market control. The 20EMA has formed reliable short-term support, acting as a launchpad for higher price action over the past month—adding weight to the idea of a new uptrend. If momentum holds, Ethereum could climb 40% to retest the triangle’s upper boundary around $3,880. A confirmed breakout above this level could set the stage for a powerful continuation toward the 1.618 Fibonacci extension target at $7,335—a potential 165% gain from current prices. In the near term, traders should monitor the immediate stubborn resistance zone around $2280. A rejection here could delay the breakout and bring a temporary cooling period. Bitcoin Could Have the Edge, With Some Help Those who jumped to Ethereum over the leading crypto may be forced to reconsider as the Bitcoin ecosystem finally addresses its biggest limitation: scalability. Slow transactions, high fees, and limited programmability have held it back from competing with the Ethereum and Solana networks—until now. And this shift starts with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Bitcoin’s first real-time Layer 2 that brings Solana-level speed and smart contracts directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and anchored by a decentralized Canonical Bridge, it enables fast, cheap, and composable dApps—all while staying secured by Bitcoin. With over $1.1 million in its second presale week, investors are already rallying behind $HYPER , potentially credited to its huge 648% APY on staking that rewards early investors. You can keep up with Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram , or join the presale on the Bitcoin Hyper website .

2025-06-12T18:41:44,"GME Tumbles After GameStop Announces Proposed $1,750,000,000 Convertible Bond Offering To Possibly Buy More BTC: Report","GameStop (GME) stocks are falling following the announcement of a proposal to potentially purchase more Bitcoin ( BTC ). Yesterday, GameStop announced a proposed private offering of $1.75 billion worth of senior convertible notes. “GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (‘GameStop’) today announced that it intends to offer, subject to market conditions and other factors, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 (the ‘notes’) in a private offering (the ‘offering’) to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‘Securities Act’). GameStop also intends to grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase, within a 13-day period beginning on, and including, the date on which the notes are first issued, up to an additional $250 million aggregate principal amount of notes.” In the announcement, GameStop says it plans to use the funds for general purposes, including potential investments “in a manner consistent with GameStop’s Investment Policy and potential acquisitions.” According to a CNBC report , that could potentially mean purchasing more BTC. Buying more Bitcoin is in line with recent GameStop investments. Late last month, the meme stock became a BTC Treasury by purchasing 4,710 BTC, worth $505 million at time of writing. However, since yesterday’s announced proposal, GME has crashed 21% and is currently trading for $22.49.

2025-06-12T18:30:50,"Crypto Expert Puts Ethereum Price At $19,500 With Head And Shoulders Emergence","Ethereum reclaimed a significant technical level in the latest 24-hour trading session, with its price crossing above the $2,800 mark and briefly touching $2,870. This interesting cross makes it the first time since February 2025 that Ethereum has traded above the $2,800 threshold. The move comes amid rising bullish momentum flowing out from Bitcoin, and according to recent analysis from a crypto expert, this could be just the beginning of a much larger rally for Ethereum. Technical Pattern Says Ethereum Could Be Close To $20,000 An interesting technical formation on Ethereum has now caught the attention of some traders: a classic inverse Head and Shoulders bottom. According to crypto expert Gert van Lagen, who shared his analysis on the social media platform X, this inverse head and shoulders is setting up on a long-term timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Eyes 38% Jump To $3,500 As 50EMA Swims Into View Specifically, Ethereum’s two-week candlestick chart, shared by the analyst, reveals a fully formed structure with a left shoulder in mid-2021, a pronounced head that took shape during the bear market in late 2022 to early 2023, and a right shoulder forming throughout the 2024 correction into early 2025. The left shoulder emerged in mid-2021, when Ethereum’s price peaked around $4,870, then retraced into the year-end. The head was formed at the lows around $1,350 in 2022 and 2023. The right shoulder is currently in formation after the Ethereum price rebounded from roughly $1,600 in 2025. Finally, this pattern is also highlighted by a symmetry around the neckline drawn near the $4,200 price region. Keeping this in mind, the neckline of the pattern, which is anchored just below the $4,200 resistance level, is now the most important level to break above. A confirmed breakout above this zone could activate the full bullish target projected by the technical formation. ETH Price Close To $20,000 According to Gert van Lagen, the two-week head-and-shoulders pattern suggests Ethereum may be “closer to $20K than most anticipate.” His price target calculation follows a classic technical methodology. By measuring the vertical distance from the head’s lowest point to the neckline resistance and then projecting that same distance upward from the neckline, he arrives at a target of approximately $19,500, which is more than a 600% gain from today’s price levels. Related Reading: Pundit Says Do Not Ignore Ethereum Amid New All-Time Highs In Major Metric In the same analysis, van Lagen also highlighted a descending broadening wedge pattern that has been forming since mid-2023. This secondary structure reinforces the notion that Ethereum may embark on a significantly larger breakout once $4,200 is cleared. However, this projection of $19,500 is based on the technical symmetry of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, rather than fundamental shifts in Ethereum. Additionally, there is no clear timeline for this target; however, based on the multi-year nature of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the price target may also take up to four years to materialize. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,772, having retraced slightly from $2,870.

2025-06-12T18:30:28,"Trump boast of ending Biden’s Operation Choke Point 2.0","President Trump spoke at the Coinbase Crypto Summit today, taking credit for ending Operation Choke Point 2.0. He also pledged to implement clear-cut regulations to help the US lead the future of crypto and Bitcoin. He commented , “We will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin.” Trump spoke on his crypto achievements at the summit Speaking at the summit, Trump claimed he ended Biden’s administration’s war on crypto, the so-called Operation Choke Point 2.0. The name came about after industry analysts drew parallels to a 2013 federal campaign that sought to exclude high-risk businesses—such as firearms dealers and sellers of drug paraphernalia—from the banking system. During Biden’s tenure, crypto experts complained that the country’s financial regulators and banks had it in for them. They argued that banks especially imposed lengthy onboarding processes , rejected smaller companies’ applications, or disengaged from the crypto industry entirely. Trump stated that he ended the unfair war on crypto and empowered American innovators to push boundaries and lead the world into the future. He also appreciated that some acknowledge him as the first crypto president, calling it a “big honor.” Additionally, he asserted that he created the first presidential working group to discuss digital assets and named a new pro-innovation Securities and Exchange chair, Paul Atkins. He also said that he helped to establish the first Bitcoin strategic reserve and digital asset stockpile Moving forward, he claimed he wanted to create more dollar-backed stablecoins and set up more regulations to allow the country to lead the future of crypto and Bitcoin. After his remarks, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire discussed their firms’ evolution and the broader crypto space, agreeing that digital currencies are on track to serve a more significant role on a global scale. Trump’s BTC reserve decision invited criticism from some crypto analysts In March, Trump signed an executive order to establish a Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. White House AI and crypto tsar David Sacks compared them to a digital Fort Knox for cryptocurrency, referencing the Kentucky military facility that stores much of America’s gold. However, some crypto enthusiasts did not take too kindly to the news, bashing Trump’s administration for playing it safe. Some even raised concerns about the process’s transparency, despite Sacks calling for a full accounting of the federal government’s existing crypto reserves, which were estimated at around 200,000 Bitcoin. Charles Edwards of the Capriole Fund, a Bitcoin and digital assets hedge fund, even argued that with no active crypto purchases, the reserve is just a “fancy title for Bitcoin holdings that already existed with the government.” Around the same time, Jason Yanowitz, Co-Founder of crypto firm Blockworks, shared his view, seemingly supporting the BTC reserve but taking issue with the broader asset mix, claiming the plan was illogical and set a terrible precedent. He also hinted that without clear regulations, the administration could disrupt crypto markets and fuel investors’ loss of confidence. Per Trump’s executive order, the Treasury and Commerce secretary should develop budget-neutral ways to acquire BTC. Sacks even added that they could only purchase more Bitcoin if it did not contribute to a deficit or debt. Meanwhile, the stablecoin bill, GENIUS Act , is set to go through a procedural vote on Thursday after lawmakers approved the bill in a 68-30 vote on Wednesday. Moreover, after two key House committees advanced the market structure bill, the CLARITY Act may soon be up for a full floor vote.

2025-06-12T18:30:00,"Top Undervalued DeFi Tokens To Buy Before They Explode in June 2025","As the month of June enters the second week, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) rising above $107,000, the crypto sector is once again buzzing with excitement. Altcoins are on fire, and smart investors are pouring into undervalued projects that have potential for 1,000%+ returns. Here are some of the best undervalued DeFi tokens that you should consider adding to your portfolio this month. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink (LINK) is an important player in the DeFi industry through its price oracle services. This is an important service that allows smart contracts to access data outside their ecosystems. In short, without this service, smart contracts could not take action based on real-world market events. The Chainlink oracles make it possible to deliver real-world data that is reliable. The project arrives at a price consensus through data aggregation from multiple sources. When these sources provide reliable data, they are paid in LINK. The global use of Chainlink is limitless. For instance, when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) goes live, it plans to integrate Chainlink data oracles. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is expected to become one of the biggest DeFi protocols in the world, which could increase the utility of Chainlink tenfold. Chainlink also plans to expand into other industries, such as insurance, where reliable data is needed to make payments on claims. One possible use case is flight insurance, where customers get paid if a flight is canceled. Chainlink could provide a reliable source of flight cancellation data, making payments to customers instantly. However, while Chainlink could experience a massive surge in utility, that is years away. The world has yet to accept the Chainlink oracles at the scale needed for massive growth soon. As such, investors looking for massive growth would be better served by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has already been quite successful in the ongoing presale. Shiba Inu (SHIB) The Shiba Inu (SHIB) project was launched anonymously in 2020 by a creator using the pseudonym Ryoshi. However, many have suggested that Ryoshi is a group of people, and not a single person. SHIB was created in response to DOGE, with the SHIB creators critical of the Dogecoin (DOGE) inflationary mode. Like the DOGE, it has a dog-theme mascot. One of the main downsides to SHIB is that it is prone to massive price fluctuations. This stems from the fact that it is a meme coin with limited utility and acceptance. As such, most online stores do not allow users to purchase items with SHIB, like they would with Bitcoin (BTC), for instance. While its low price makes it seem like an attractive prospect, it is worth noting that it could even lower. As such, a better alternative is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has a protocol designed for utility, and long-term gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A New Gamechanger Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built from the ground up to be a disruptive force in the crypto industry. The project offers lenders and borrowers the opportunity to participate in a well-balanced ecosystem that aims to find a balance between protocol security, liquidity, and profitability. When lenders deposit their assets in a pool, they begin to earn interest. The interest they receive is based on a pool’s utilization rate. Borrowers determine the utilization rate; as more borrowers take loans from a pool, the utilization rate rises. That causes the interest rate to rise, encouraging them to pay back their loans. At the same time, it incentivizes more lenders to deposit assets in a pool. This cycle creates maximum capital efficiency while also boosting the total liquidity of the protocol. Unlocking Liquidity With mtTokens Lenders receive mtToken in exchange for depositing assets in the lending pools. For instance, if a user deposits $2,300 worth of USDT in a pool, they receive mtUSDT tokens in return. These mtTokens are a tokenized representation of the deposit plus the interest the deposit accumulates. The mtTokens are based on the ERC20 token standard, and they unlock instant liquidity for their holders. With the tokens, users can engage in trading on secondary exchanges where the ERC20 token standard is supported. Holders of mtTokens can redeem their tokens at any time to get back their deposit plus any interest accrued. To avoid placing too much pressure on the internal liquidity pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs). The DEXs and AMMs will provide an external avenue where users can easily redeem their tokens, even when the internal pools are under pressure. As such, those external pools boost the result of the internal reserves. MUTM Presale Details Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in phase 5 of the presale. So far, over $10.4 million has been raised from the ongoing presale. There are over 11,900 buyers in the presale, with over 30% of the tokens preserved for this phase already sold. Tokens in the current phase are going for $0.03, a 200% increase from the phase 1 price of $0.01. In the upcoming phase 6 of the presale, the token price is set to rise by 16.67% to $0.035. If you are looking for one of the best presales of 2025 for massive gain as the altcoin season heats, you cannot go wrong with Mutuum Finance (MUTM. With analysts predicting over 1,000% in returns, this could be a true game-changer for your crypto portfolio.

2025-06-12T18:05:30,"Crypto Analyst Says New Bitcoin All-Time Highs Incoming, Updates Outlook on Ethereum","A widely followed crypto analyst says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of a massive breakout to fresh all-time highs. In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Kaleo tells his 704,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin will likely enter an uptrend and hit $116,000 by early next week after a pullback from the $110,000 level. “Bitcoin: new all-time highs [Thursday].” Source: Kaleo/X The analyst also says that Bitcoin may no longer adhere to its four-year cycle, an idea that the flagship crypto asset has a predictable pattern connected to its halving events, when BTC miners’ rewards are cut in half, which happen roughly every four years and tend to precede upward price movements. “I believe this is where we finally break out of the traditional four-year cycle revolving around the Bitcoin halving. Higher for longer. Supercycle.” Bitcoin is trading for $107,354 at time of writing, down 2.2% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may repeat a similar 2020 pattern and soon enter an explosive uptrend. “A lot of similarities on the chart to where we are now versus where we were in 2020. Spring of 2020 there was a major selloff from the COVID crash that sent ETH beneath HTF (high timeframe) support. Once that line was reclaimed, ETH was up only for the next 20 months. The recent selloff that led to the break beneath HTF support was caused by the Trump Tariff scare in the market. ETH is currently on the verge of reclaiming that line. Will history repeat itself with this leading to another great ETH bull run and accompanying alt season?” Source: Kaleo/X ETH is trading for $2,754 at time of writing, down 3.6% on the day.

2025-06-12T18:01:26,"Will Other States Copy Connecticut’s Bitcoin Ban?","Connecticut’s Crypto Ban: A Break from the National Trend Connecticut has signed onto the first of its kind in the U.S. to fully prohibit government engagement with digital assets, creating a sweeping law that prohibits state and local governments from owning, investing in, or accepting cryptocurrencies for any purpose. The move, signed into law as Public Act No. 25-66 on June 10, 2025, is done at a time when the majority of states — and the federal government — actively examine the place of Bitcoin and other digital assets in public fiscal policy. The new bill, endorsed by the Senate and House unanimously, expressly forbids state treasury, pension funds, and other state-operated institutions from investing any funds in Bitcoin or any other digital currencies. It also forbids state and local governments to receive payments in crypto for taxes, fees, or any other use, and prevents establishing a state-backed crypto reserve. Notably, the ban only holds for state services and public funds — Connecticut businesspeople and residents are otherwise free to buy, sell, and use crypto as governed by existing laws. Connecticut's action is also the reverse of a growing trend among other states. Arizona and New Hampshire already have legislation enacted to create state Bitcoin reserves, and Texas and North Carolina are presently deliberating the same. This is all the more surprising in the context of President Donald Trump issuing an executive order in March 2025 to request that federal agencies develop a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve from seized digital assets, demonstrating pro-crypto attitudes at the federal level. Lawmakers Cite Risks, Critics Warn of Missed Opportunity The supporters of Connecticut's prohibition claim that it is an informed choice to protect public money from the extreme volatility, security risks, and accounting intricacies of virtual assets. Lawmakers utilized the volatility of virtual currencies, the susceptibility to cyberattacks, and the intricacy of valuing such assets as key reasons for the prohibition. The bill also creates new standards for crypto businesses operating in the state, such as stricter licensing, compliance, and notification of customers, and stronger protections for minors who use digital wallets or crypto kiosks. Others warn that the ban will cut Connecticut taxpayers off from possible Bitcoin profits and stifle innovation. ”Connecticut has chosen to miss this opportunity—at least for now.”. But whereas other states are luckier in enjoying the fruits of Bitcoin reserves, we expect Connecticut to reconsider,” said Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter. Certain lawyers term the action symbolic rather than real, a political move and not one in reaction to truly existing threats, and cite the Democratic Party's firm grip on the state as being a key force in the bill's passage. Will Other States Follow Connecticut’s Lead — or Rebel? The state's move also hints at the piecemeal nature of U.S. cryptocurrency policy. While 27 states have introduced bills allowing public funds to invest in Bitcoin or other high-market-cap tokens, an ever-growing list — Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona included — have spurned or stymied such legislation in 2025 alone. This patchwork approach has created confusion for crypto business and investors, who must navigate a maze of incompatible state regimes and solutions to digital assets. While the controversy smolders, though, the issue is whether Connecticut's strong stance will prompt other states to emulate it with bans of their own, or whether it will provoke a backlash and fresh attempts at bringing digital assets into state coffers elsewhere. With the federal government's own plan for a Bitcoin reserve still in its infancy, the fate of state crypto policy far from determined.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9552/will-other-states-copy-connecticut-s-bitcoin-ban,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

The New York-based digital fintech firm aims to use the funds to acquire and hold BTC as part of a broader strategy to reshape its treasury operations through tokenized finance. Mercurity Fintech Bets Big on Bitcoin According to the official press release , MFH plans to store the assets using institutional-grade blockchain custody infrastructure while integrating staking services and tokenized treasury tools to unlock yield and capital efficiency. The initiative represents a transition from traditional treasury models to a blockchain-aligned reserve structure designed to boost long-term asset exposure and bolster financial resilience. In parallel, MFH is set to move from the Russell Microcap Index to the Russell 2000 and 3000, a development that could enhance visibility among institutional investors and signal market validation for its blockchain-centric approach. In an official statement, Shi Qiu, CEO of the company, said, “We’re building this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the future financial infrastructure. We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem.” Bitcoin on the Books A growing number of public companies are integrating digital assets into their treasuries, with 117 firms now holding over 800,000 BTC, as per Binance Research’s latest stats . Recent adopters include GameStop, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., and Nakamoto, all following a model first implemented by Strategy and Michael Saylor. Trump Media & Technology Group joined the wave with a $2.5 billion Bitcoin initiative backed by 50 institutions. Ethereum is also gaining traction, as evidenced by SharpLink recently launching a $425 million ETH strategy advised by Consensys’ Joseph Lubin. Japan-based Metaplanet also continued its aggressive BTC acquisition. More recently, the Oslo-based cryptocurrency brokerage company, K33, also started holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet after raising $6.22 million via interest-free loans and new share and warrant issues.

2025-06-12T17:49:27,"Pi Coin Price Prediction: MACD Indicator Finally Flashing Green – $10 Incoming?","The persistent downtrend that has weighed on PI since mid-May may have finally run its course, with a golden cross on the daily MACD bolstering the near-term Pi Coin price outlook . While most altcoins staged recoveries through June, PI continued to slide, signaling a disconnect from broader market tailwinds. That prolonged sell-off has left PI down 43% over the past month, making it the worst performer among the top 100. But recent bullish momentum may have finally caught up to the token. Shaky Fundamentals Cloud Bullish Technical Outlook Despite the bullish technical outlook, Pi Coin’s future may hinge on ecosystem fundamentals as it stands at a crossroads, according to an X post by well-known PI commentator Pi Barter Mall. In their pessimistic outlook, Pi Barter Mall noted slow ecosystem development as the central obstacle to long-term growth. The fact of the matter is that the Pi ecosystem continues to struggle with adoption. Its price action remains largely speculative, lacking a meaningful use case to sustain long-term growth. This has also opened the door to liquidity issues, with short-term speculative trading amplifying deflationary pressure as unlocks continue at an average rate of $7 million PI tokens per day. PI token unlock schedule. Source: Piscan . The market struggles to absorb the excess supply without a rise in demand to stabilise Pi Coin price moves. Still, there is an optimistic case. Pi Barter Mall notes that mainstream exchange listings, such as a potential debut on Binance, could serve as major catalysts. If large-scale applications can be achieved, Pi Barter Mall suggests Pi could reclaim its $1–$3 range with real utility to encourage HODLing over flipping. Pi Price Analysis: Could a Golden Cross Push a Reversal? Given the underlying fundamental challenges, a $10 valuation for Pi Coin remains unrealistic—at least until Pi Barter Mall’s optimistic scenario materialises. That said, Pi coin could make a start on technical momentum alone as the recent breakout of a May-born falling wedge pattern pushes a potential golden cross on the daily. PI / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge. Source: TradingView, OKX. The MACD line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line, poised to flash green for the first time since Consensus 2025 unfolded as a sell-the-news event. Selling pressure appears exhausted, with the RSI rebounding from deep bearish territory at 40—an early signal that buy pressure is returning, opening the door for the next leg up. If momentum continues, the pattern suggests a potential 40% Pi Coin price rally to $0.8725, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level. Should bulls push further toward $1, Pi Coin would face a key accumulation zone at the 0.5 Fibonnaci level—a potential catalyst to fuel growth. However, if the golden cross is delayed or falters, strong support at $0.60 remains the critical downside level to watch for signs of a reversal. The Bull Market Could Be Back – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially as altcoins continue to lag behind the leading cryptocurrency. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $7 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 57% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

(MFH), a financial services and crypto company, has announced its intention to raise $800 million. The funds will be used to build a large Bitcoin (BTC) treasury and create a blockchain-based financial system. This move is part of the company’s broader strategy to become a major player in the fast-growing world of digital finance. No Mercurity To Build A New Kind of Bitcoin Treasury Unlike traditional companies that hold Bitcoin as a passive asset, Mercurity plans to use it actively. The Bitcoin acquired will be integrated into a yield-generating treasury model. This means the flagship crypto will not just sit in storage; instead, it will be used to earn returns through tokenized tools and staking services. In a recent statement, Mercurity’s CEO, Shi Qiu, said that Bitcoin will be a key financial tool in the future. With this in mind, the company wants to be a leader in the world of digital finance by using cryptocurrency, blockchain, and new financial tools. Mercurity is following a new trend in which companies use Bitcoin as more than just a reserve. Today, many businesses, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, are finding ways to make money with their crypto holdings instead of letting them sit idle. Companies like Blockstream and MARA Digital are already doing this. They use their Bitcoin reserve for services like lending , staking, and other activities that help them earn extra income. Mercurity’s Bitcoin Funding Strategy Remains a Mystery While the company has revealed how it plans to use the $800 million, it has not disclosed how it intends to raise the capital. The New York-based firm is yet to explain whether the money will come from selling company shares, taking on debt, or using other financing methods. Following the news, Mercurity’s stock price rose 1.9% during regular trading but dropped 2.84% after hours. The dip may reflect investor concerns about the unknowns in the company’s funding plan. Mercurity Focus Beyond Crypto This news comes at a key time for Mercurity. The company is expected to be added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indexes, which are important stock lists that many big investors follow. If the company is included in these indexes, it could help more people notice Mercurity and make it easier to trade its shares. Besides working with cryptocurrency, Mercurity also makes cooling systems for data centers that run Artificial Intelligence (AI). These systems help save energy, which is vital because AI needs a lot of power. Mercurity also offers services to large companies and wealthy clients. This includes helping them manage digital assets and giving advice about blockchain technology.

The company’s average cost per Bitcoin is now $78,582, following this latest purchase, which delivered a 22% yield increase compared to its prior acquisition in late May. This latest move is in line with DDC’s long-term strategy to integrate Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. In a statement about the purchase, Founder, Chairwoman, and CEO Norma Chu reaffirmed the company’s unwavering Bitcoin strategy. “Today’s 38 BTC acquisition proves our focused execution. We continue to aim for higher BTC yield return for our shareholders,” she said. Chu also noted the symbolic value of each acquisition: “With every Bitcoin added, we strengthen shareholder exposure to digital scarcity—now at 0.029679 BTC per 1,000 shares. We remain uncompromising in our pursuit of being a top global corporate holder status.” Positioning Bitcoin as a Core Asset While most companies remain cautious in their approach to digital assets, DDC Enterprise said it has aggressively positioned Bitcoin as a long-term financial hedge and store of value. The company said it has structured its treasury strategy around this conviction, acquiring BTC at what it considers optimal market entry points. Its BTC-per-share metric—now sitting at 0.029679 per 1,000 shares—is touted as a novel value proposition for shareholders interested in digital asset exposure through traditional equity markets. The acquisition is also reflective of a growing trend among listed companies that use Bitcoin not merely as an investment, but as a strategic balance sheet tool. DDC’s move indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upside, despite market volatility and regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. DDC Enterprise said it is using BitGo as its official custodian. The firm said that by using BitGo’s custody solutions, DDC seeks to support its growing digital asset strategy with scalable and secure infrastructure designed to meet the demands of institutional investors.

2025-06-12T17:16:46,"Bitcoin Will Rally as U.S. Growth Improves, Crypto Bills Progress: Coinbase Research","A more upbeat macroeconomic backdrop, growing corporate appetite for digital assets, and increased regulatory clarity will fuel a constructive outlook for crypto markets in the second half of 2025, according to a report by Coinbase Research . After a bumpy first quarter marked by a brief contraction in U.S. GDP and trade disruptions, data now point to stronger growth. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker has jumped to 3.8% QoQ as of early June, a sharp upgrade from earlier in the year. This shift, alongside expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a less aggressive trade policy, has eased recession fears and strengthened investor sentiment. Declining dollar dominance and inflation protection use-cases may also boost bitcoin’s BTC appeal, even if long-dated U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, the report said. Altcoins may lag unless they benefit from specific catalysts, such as ETF approvals or protocol developments. Meanwhile, public companies are increasingly adding crypto to their balance sheets, aided by a 2024 rule change allowing ""mark-to-market"" accounting for digital assets. While this trend is expanding demand, it’s also introducing new systemic risks. Firms that fund crypto buys with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing options dry up or prices fall sharply. Regulatory clarity Regulatory developments are also expected to reshape the market, the report said. The Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill now heading to the House. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing digital assets. If passed, it could clarify rules for both issuers and investors. Separately, the SEC is considering more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds and proposals involving staking and altcoins. Some rulings could be made as early as July, and the rest are likely to be finalized by October. Overall, bitcoin appears poised to benefit from both macro and structural tailwinds in the second half of the year, while the outlook for altcoins will depend on navigating a more complex and still-evolving regulatory and liquidity environment, according to the report.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/12/bitcoin-will-rally-as-us-growth-improves-crypto-bills-progress-coinbase-research,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH","Markets|Bitcoin|Macro|Regulation|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T17:14:37,"Crypto market drops 4% as ETH ETFs outperform BTC, altcoins fall sharply","The global crypto market has taken a sharp turn in the past 24 hours. Total market capitalisation has dropped nearly 4% to around $3.51 trillion. Almost every asset in the top 100 list is now showing losses. Bitcoin trades near $107,688, while Ethereum is around $2,736. Altcoins are feeling the squeeze as well, with Dogecoin at $0.1877 , Solana at $158 , and Cardano at $0.6827 . Source: CoinMarketCap Amid these declines, spot Ethereum ETFs in the US continue to attract larger inflows than Bitcoin ETFs—a shift that hints at deeper changes in investor behaviour. Spot Ethereum ETFs attract more flows US-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds continue to outperform their Bitcoin equivalents. On 11 June, BlackRock’s ETH ETF brought in a one-day inflow of $160 million. Ethereum ETFs in total pulled $240 million in net inflows. Overall, Ethereum ETFs have seen cumulative inflows of $3.74 billion over 18 straight days. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs totalled $45.22 billion, but inflows for 11 June were a more modest $133 million. The continuing strength of ETH ETF flows has coincided with Ethereum’s rebound from recent lows. On-chain analysts interpret this as a sign of shifting sentiment, fuelled by the Pectra upgrade, increasing DeFi activity, and more favourable regulatory commentary from figures such as SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. Bitcoin and altcoins slide as volatility concerns rise The broader downturn in crypto assets has been led by Bitcoin’s decline of around 1.68%, dragging it down from earlier highs near $110,350 to current levels near $107,688. Ethereum lost about 4.29%, dipping from intraday highs of $2,868 to today’s $2,736. Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins suffered deeper losses. Dogecoin fell roughly 7.5% to $0.1876, Solana dropped about 5–6% to $158, and Cardano slipped nearly 5.4% to $0.6827. These declines reflect a market-wide pullback following softer US inflation data and renewed uncertainty stemming from US-China trade discussions. On-chain data points to underpriced volatility risk On-chain data highlights several warning signs. Much of the supply of Bitcoin is clustered close to current price levels. When coins accumulate around a spot, even small flips in sentiment can trigger outsized moves. Meanwhile, options markets appear complacent—implied volatility remains low, even as on-chain activity suggests increasing volatility risk. Similarly, Ethereum options show subdued volatility pricing, despite its rebound and growing ETF interest. Analysts suggest both chains may be underestimating potential spikes during events like regulatory developments or protocol changes. Macro triggers and future direction Crypto markets are reacting in step with macroeconomic trends. The increasing tensions in the Middle East and US President Donald Trump saying he would impose unilateral tariffs on trading partners within two weeks have fed into asset-price uncertainty. Equities followed suit, with the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 falling 0.37% and 0.27% respectively, adding to crypto’s downward pressure. However, Institutions continued with activities despite the market volatility. The Ant Group is advancing plans to launch stablecoins in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg. The US Senate also voted to proceed with a substitute amendment to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act. These developments show that regulatory momentum in digital assets continues even amid price volatility. Ethereum’s progress is further underpinned by the recently activated Pectra upgrade and influential endorsements from regulatory figures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maintains key technical levels. On-chain analysts highlight support at $97,600 and resistance near $115,400. Investor sentiment has cooled somewhat, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index easing from 65 into more neutral territory. Yet on-chain data suggests selling remains limited. Only around $200 million of realised losses have been recorded, indicating present declines have been absorbed by long-term holders.

However, his activity on the platform did not blow up until early June 2025 when Tate shared a post on X showcasing a 138.5% profit on a 25x leveraged Ethereum (ETH) long position. The trade initially appeared successful, earning him $22,000 in unrealized profits at the time. However, he used high leverage, which made it vulnerable to price fluctuations. It did not take long for blockchain transparency to reveal a less favorable outcome as crypto sleuths were able to trace Tate’s Hyperliquid wallet using his referral code (“TOPGTOPSTRIKER”). They found that his cumulative profit and loss (PnL) showed a net loss of approximately $597,000–$600,000 across all trades on the platform since he began trading there. His 25x leveraged ETH position was liquidated after a slight price dip, costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars and forcing him to delete the initial post of him bragging about the 138% gain. Fast forward to June 8, and Tate shared a post about a potential $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position on Hyperliquid, with the caption, “100M BTC long. My turn?” Many thought the statement was made in reference to James Wynn’s billion-dollar BTC bets on the platform, but there is no direct evidence suggesting this. It is also not yet known if he has executed the trade, and some speculate it was a promotional stunt to drive referral sign-ups. He later took down the post as well. Tate insists he plans to make it all back Tate’s trading losses were revealed when he attempted to earn fees from new user sign-ups by sharing his referral code. Unlike centralized exchanges, Hyperliquid’s on-chain nature makes all trades publicly traceable, and crypto traders were quick to identify Tate’s wallet and expose his $600,000 loss, triggering widespread mockery on X. Andrew Tate’s trades on Hyperliquid have run up to $597,000–$600,000 in losses. Source: LookOnChain As usual, Tate was defiant in the face of the critics, stating, “I’ll make it all back with one trade,” but this did little to quell criticism. So far, LookOnChain claims Tate has made 76 trades on Hyperliquid and has only had 27 wins — a 35.53% win rate. He’s currently long $ETH with 25x leverage; however, his overall account is still down by nearly $600,000. Thanks to the volatile markets, it is unclear if his ETH long can end his streak of losses. While Tate’s posts about Hyperliquid have drawn more attention to the platform, his deleted posts and public exposure have made him a cautionary tale about the risks of leveraged trading and the transparency of DEXs like Hyperliquid. Now, many on X are waiting to see which runs out first, his ego or his ETH.

2025-06-12T17:01:03,"Buy MARA Holdings For Its Bitcoin And Get The Mining Business 'For Free'","Summary MARA’s market cap is nearly matched by its $5.42 billion Bitcoin holdings, meaning investors value the mining business at a discount. MARA’s mining operation, adds more value annually in Bitcoin to the balance sheet than what the market appears to be valuing it. Investors can capture upside through new BTC mined monthly, valuation expansion in the mining business, or a BTC rally boosting existing BTC holdings. I have lately been quite interested in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Treasury Companies, both in terms of how these companies can obtain fiat capital on favorable terms to generate shareholder value, and in the potential opportunities to buy many of them at a discount relative to their BTC holdings and underlying operations. Regarding the first category, I have recently covered Strategy ( MSTR ), and each of its preferreds STRF ( STRF ), STRK ( STRK ), and, most recently, STRD ( STRD ), here , here , here , and here , respectively. Regarding the second category, back in March, I wrote how one can buy Semler Scientific's ( SMLR ) operations at a great discount relative to its BTC holdings. By the way, I think that opportunity is even greater now, given BTC's rally against SMLR's underperformance. Today, I am writing about an opportunity like the latter, as MARA Holdings ( MARA ) appears to trade at levels that allow investors to essentially acquire its mining business ""for free."" The Bitcoin Holdings vs. MARA's Market Cap As of writing this article, MARA's market cap sits around $5.8 billion, based on a share price of roughly $16.52 and about 352 million shares outstanding. In the meantime, the company holds 49,375 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $5.42 billion, with BTC flirting with $110,000 per coin. MARA BTC Holdings (BitcoinTreasuries.NET) If we do the math, that's about $15.41 in Bitcoin per share. Compare that to the stock's $16.52 price, and you're basically buying MARA's entire operating business (data centers, proprietary tech, etc.) for just about $1.1 per share, or $387 million. But wait! MARA has $2.44 billion in net debt (including the zero-coupon convertible notes), and it also has $1.56 billion in property and equipment, so by adding the differences as a liability, the market is valuing the mining business at just about $850 million. I will explain why this implies a discount in a moment. The valuation discount has widened as MARA's stock hasn't kept pace with BTC's rally. While Bitcoin has gradually gained in recent months, MARA's share price has more or less moved sideways. BTC is up ~58% over the past year, all while MARA stock is down ~15% over the same period. BTC vs. MARA 1 Year Return (Koyfin) But why? The Management Discount: Why Investors Are Skeptical From following the stock regularly and reading the comments of other online investors, MARA's discount appears to stem from a doubt about management. Investors are essentially slapping a ""management discount"" on MARA, due to doubts about its track record, and it all goes back quite some time. You may remember, for instance, that in 2022, power outages at its Montana facility and delays in scaling mining capacity were a major source of frustration for shareholders. On top of that, the $2 billion stock offering in March wasn't exactly welcomed by investors due to earlier fears of dilution, while the company's pivot into AI infrastructure raised questions about management's focus. And these are valid arguments. If MARA is now a BTC treasury company and raising money MSTR-like, why are they suddenly saying they want to explore becoming a base layer infrastructure provider for AI and high-performance computing? Adding fuel to the fire, some investors have called out CEO Fred Thiel, pointing to his vague communication. For example, in the Q1 earnings call , he dodged specifics on AI strategy. This has led the market to undervalue MARA's mining operations, pricing the stock as if its Bitcoin stash is pretty much its only asset. The Mining Business Is Worth... The BTC However, I believe the mining business is not worthless, or at least the mere $850 million implied book value (for MARA to trade at NAV). This is because of all the BTC accumulation that the mining operations deliver, which is profitable for the company. Last quarter, MARA mined 2,286 Bitcoin, down 19% from 2,811 the year before due to the halving and increased network difficulty. At a direct energy cost of $35,728 as of Q1 (ex-depreciation), MARA can make roughly $74,300 per BTC at current BTC prices. This is about $170 million in value creation in a single quarter. Note that MARA is actually going to post a loss in this scenario, as it incurs the expenses but holds the BTC, but book value-wise, it has created actual value. Last month, MARA's mining produced 950 Bitcoin, a 35% jump from April , thanks to a record 282 blocks won and a 58.3 EH/s hashrate. At $110,000 per coin, those 950 Bitcoins are worth $104.5 million. With a $35,728 cost per Bitcoin, each coin adds $74,300 in book value, or $71 million for the month, or $852 million annualized. I believe the market doesn't understand this and merely sees MARA's GAAP losses. You can also see how the mining business seems extremely cheaply priced, given the value MARA can create via its BTC accumulation strategy from its mining business. Within a year, the mined BTC minus the expenses incurred can top what the market is currently valuing the mining business. Even if you believe the balance sheet assets do not reflect real values on the equipment side, and the market is actually valuing the mining business at $1 billion to $1.5 billion, you are still getting it about 1X to 2X earnings at current Bitcoin price levels. A Significant Risk To Consider The most notable risk to MARA's investment case hinges on the price of BTC, which has a wild history. BTC has tanked by over 80% from its highs more than once. So, despite growing institutional adoption that could prevent such a major drop today, another crash could make mining unprofitable if Bitcoin falls below MARA's cost per coin, slashing balance sheet value and making its core operations effectively worthless for as long as mining remains unprofitable. Along with MARA's $2.44 billion in net debt, this could hammer the stock. The Bottom Line Overall, I would say it's tough to be bearish on MARA stock these days. You're essentially buying $5.42 billion in Bitcoin for $5.8 billion and getting a mining business that added $852 million in annualized Bitcoin value to the balance sheet for just $850 million. Of course, the annualized figure can change from month to month, and the mining business could be worth anywhere between $0.50 and $1.5 billion at current share prices based on how much you think the balance sheet assets are actually worth. Still, the idea is the same, as we are talking about a low single-digit multiple on that business at current BTC prices. In the meantime, if you are actually long BTC, you have another reason to hold the stock, even if the mining discount doesn't close. Since the stock is not trading far from its BTC holdings, you are holding the BTC and essentially getting a call option that the market will value the mining business above today's valuation. Lastly, regarding the potential pivot toward AI, you have to trust that the management will indeed allocate power only if that is more accretive than actually mining BTC. It's all speculative to comment on that today, but if we assume that management doesn't mess up here, nothing fundamentally changes in my thesis.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794465-buy-mara-holdings-bitcoin-get-mining-business-free?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","BTC-USD|MARA",cryptocompare

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. BNB hits 275% transaction surge, Polkadot rallies 6%, and BlockDAG’s X1 Miner app brings global adoption, see why BDAG may lead the pack. Table of Contents BlockDAG: X1 Miner goes viral in 150+ countries Binance Coin: Transaction boom nearing $675 resistance Polkadot: Surging with Bitcoin, eyes $4.20 and beyond Summing up Crypto markets are heating up as major tokens flash bullish signals. Binance Coin saw a staggering 275% jump in daily transactions, driven by rising DeFi and network activity. Polkadot surged over 6% after Bitcoin broke $109k, with DOT reclaiming key support and setting sights on higher resistance levels. But the quiet giant in the room is BlockDAG (BDAG). Still in presale, BDAG is turning heads with its viral X1 Miner app, now used by 1.5 million people in over 150 countries. Unlike many tokens that launch without an ecosystem, BDAG already boasts real users, gamified tools, and massive engagement. With a potential NBA partnership looming and a June 13 “GO LIVE” reveal ahead, BDAG is more than a presale, it’s possibly the next breakout crypto brand of 2025. BlockDAG: X1 Miner goes viral in 150+ countries BlockDAG (BDAG) is no longer just a presale token, it’s rapidly evolving into one of the most compelling stories in crypto today. What started as an under-the-radar project is now capturing global attention, thanks to its viral X1 Miner app, which has already onboarded 1.5 million users across 150+ countries. That kind of pre-listing engagement is virtually unheard of and signals something bigger: BDAG isn’t just building tech, it’s building a user-driven movement. At its core, BlockDAG is powered by a CertiK-audited, EVM-compatible DAG architecture that allows for zero gas fees and near-instant transactions. But it’s the surrounding ecosystem that’s lighting up the crypto scene, gamified tools like mining streaks, referral bonuses, and Buyer Battles are keeping the community engaged daily. This isn’t idle hype; it’s active participation long before the coin hits exchanges. BDAG is priced at just $0.0018 until June 13, offering a rare opportunity to capture a 2,670% ROI before it launches at $0.05. The presale has raised more than $298 million so far. And with a rumored NBA franchise partnership expected to be unveiled soon, BDAG could become the first presale coin with real mainstream cultural visibility. Think courtside logos and NFT fan tokens, making it not just a token, but a brand people recognize. While BNB and DOT push through market cycles, BlockDAG is defining a new one, with global reach, real users, and a strategy that’s turning the crypto onboarding process into a household experience. Binance Coin: Transaction boom nearing $675 resistance Binance Coin ( BNB ) is showing exceptional strength as daily transaction volumes surge from approximately 4 million to over 15 million, a staggering 275% increase that reflects renewed interest across its ecosystem. This explosive growth is being driven by a combination of factors: expanding DeFi applications, increasing use in derivatives markets, and broader integration into real-world utility platforms. The heightened on-chain activity suggests sustained user engagement and a strong foundation for price momentum. From a technical standpoint, BNB is currently navigating a consolidation range between $659 and $675. This area has emerged as a key battleground, with bulls aiming to break above the resistance at $675. If this breakout materializes, it could pave the way for the next upward wave, particularly as institutional inflows and derivatives-based trades gain momentum. Despite some profit-taking during the rally, the overall health of the BNB ecosystem remains solid, supported by both retail and institutional participation. As BNB continues to play a critical role in Binance’s growing suite of products and services, its trajectory remains one of the most closely watched in the crypto space. A confirmed breakout could reaffirm BNB’s status as a top-tier digital asset. You might also like: BlockDAG scores big with NBA tease and $293M presale; SOL whales accumulate, PEPE slips Polkadot: Surging with Bitcoin, eyes $4.20 and beyond Polkadot ( DOT ) is gaining momentum, rising over 6% as Bitcoin crossed the $109,000 mark, boosting confidence across the altcoin space. DOT recently broke through a key resistance level at $4.10 and is now forming a bullish ascending channel, holding strong support above the $3.99 mark. This technical structure suggests strength and growing investor interest in the ecosystem. On-chain data backs the trend, with trading volume and user activity on the rise. Analysts are closely watching the $4.21 resistance zone, as a clean breakout could push DOT toward the $4.56 to $4.82 range in the short term. With favorable macro conditions, especially Bitcoin’s continued dominance, DOT has a clear upside path. Adding to its appeal is the broader narrative of Polkadot 2.0, which aims to enhance scalability, governance, and interoperability across parachains. This evolution makes the network more competitive and potentially more valuable as cross-chain activity expands. With a thriving developer community and multiple high-performing parachains already operational, DOT is regaining its status as a major player. In the current market cycle, it remains one of the top altcoins to watch. Summing up BNB showcases undeniable on-chain strength, and Polkadot is gaining from macro tailwinds and technical momentum. But when it comes to global buzz and accessibility, BlockDAG (BDAG) is clearly stealing the spotlight. Its viral X1 Miner app has already attracted 1.5 million users in 150+ countries, turning presale interest into active ecosystem participation. With features like gasless transactions, gamified engagement, and a rumored NBA franchise partnership, BDAG isn’t just building hype, it’s building visibility, infrastructure, and culture all at once. The presale price of $0.0018, ending June 13, is the last window before the jump to $0.05. That’s up to 2,670% in ROI baked in before listing. While other tokens chase momentum, BDAG is creating it from the ground up. For those hunting the highest trending crypto of 2025, BDAG might already be it.

That window is wide open right now, and Bitcoin Pepe is sitting in the middle of it. While most meme coins live or die on vibes, Bitcoin Pepe has been methodically laying track: infrastructure, token standards, bridges, and partnerships, and now, with tier 1 exchange listings locked and loaded for reveal, the setup is cleaner than most altcoin charts right now. With over $14m raised at only $0.0416, the presale is still active, but not for long. Check the official website for the latest updates. Solana on Bitcoin reveals what’s coming on launch At surface level, Bitcoin Pepe looks like what you’d expect: a meme token borrowing Bitcoin’s brand weight and pairing it with internet-native culture. But that’s just the hook. This is the first meme ICO built on Bitcoin, and it’s doing what Bitcoin hasn’t done in over a decade: evolving beyond store of value. The development team is constructing a layer 2 that facilitates staking, NFTs, meme trading, and DeFi, leveraging Bitcoin’s liquidity without the associated friction. The team has already revealed internal demos showing the bridge, the Bitcoin Pepe DEX, and a working block explorer. The bridge lets users move BTC into the L2 in real time, with wallet compatibility checks, safety prompts, and a clean, no-fuss UX that doesn’t assume technical knowledge. The DEX is functional and designed for speed with meme coin pairs, fast swaps, and no clunky onboarding. The explorer looks like something you’d expect from a major L2: it breaks down L1-to-L2 transactions clearly, supports mobile, and gives visibility into what’s actually happening on-chain. BPEP price prediction: What happens after T1 listings drop? The original launch was scheduled for the 31st of May, but the team made the call to hold and push for higher-tier coverage instead of a rushed debut. Markets noticed, and $500,000 came in on the 1st of June, the day after the announcement. If that kind of announcement pulled in half a million in 24 hours, what happens when the tier 1 listing details drop? Bitcoin Pepe’s listings are coming with volume, with top-tier visibility, and with a roadmap that doesn’t rely on hope. In fact, influencers on X and YouTube have already started weighing in. What’s more, Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 allows anyone to issue tokens natively on Bitcoin’s Layer 2, in the same way ERC-20 kicked off Ethereum’s altcoin boom. If that sounds like a stretch, look at what Solana’s SPL standard enabled or how Base gained traction by piggybacking ETH liquidity and rerouting it into meme-heavy DeFi. Bitcoin Pepe is doing that, but with a bigger base layer and Bitcoin’s $2 trillion liquidity to tap into. Eight partnerships have already been confirmed—across DeFi, gaming, and content—and they’re shaping the early footprint of BPEP’s ecosystem before listings go live. The structure is already in place. And between infrastructure, listings, timing, and Bitcoin’s flirt with its ATH, a 100x from presale levels is more than plausible. If the meme cycle accelerates the way it did for Solana’s ecosystem, a 1000x is on the table. Is Bitcoin Pepe the best crypto to buy now? Every cycle has a moment when a project transitions from a niche to a broader market, and those closely observing already recognize that Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is perilously approaching this threshold. Bitcoin Pepe is backed by working tech, smart partnerships, and nearly perfect macro factors that are impossible to ignore. It sits right at the intersection of liquidity and narrative with the tools to convert attention into volume and volume into price.If you’ve been waiting for the best crypto to buy before it goes vertical, this is it .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/bitcoin-pepe-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-before-tier-1-cex-listing-hits/,"BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX","Information",cryptocompare

SPX6900 Just Flipped Major Resistance—Traders Eye $2 Next The SPX6900/USDT chart shows strong bullish momentum that’s held steady since late April. Prices have been climbing steadily within a well-defined upward channel, with each rally supported by increasing trading volume—a classic sign of sustainable growth. Key price levels also tell an important story. After breaking through resistance at $0.60 and $0.80, the token successfully retested these levels, which have now become solid support zones. This transformation from resistance to support confirms the market’s strengthening confidence in SPX6900’s upward trajectory. Now, at a key juncture, the token faces its biggest test at the $1.64–$1.67 resistance zone—the same level that halted January’s rally. Current price action proves particularly compelling as the token trades slightly above this level, indicating buyers may finally have the strength to overcome this historic barrier. SPX6900 looks like it's near a local top for a pullback. Very much overbought. If you're in this token, I would look to scale out soon. Might get a quick pump and then a pullback. For those that are keen on buying the token, I would hold off and look at other ETH memes for now… pic.twitter.com/6wK3QUy8RS — Junny (@junnyBCap) June 11, 2025 Momentum indicators support the bullish case. The RSI’s surge to 81.44 typically suggests overbought conditions, but during powerful uptrends, such extended highs often reflect genuine buying pressure rather than impending reversal. With the $1.67 breakout within reach, traders are eyeing the next psychological target at $2.00. However, some consolidation would be healthy as the market absorbs these gains.

2025-06-12T16:52:07,"Bitcoin (BTC) Warning from Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone! ""At a Risky Turning Point!""","The Bitcoin-gold rivalry has been going on for years. At this point, one BTC is ahead of another gold, while Mike McGlone warned that Bitcoin is approaching a risky turning point. Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Mike McGlone said Bitcoin volatility has fallen to an all-time low. Accordingly, he noted that Bitcoin's historically low volatility compared to gold and the S&P 500 could indicate a major breakout potential for BTC. However, the analyst also stated that this situation also carries great risks for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the risky side and the correction trend are more significant for Bitcoin. Stating that Bitcoin is approaching a key test in terms of further earnings potential at this point, the analyst said that the annual volatility of BTC against gold reaching a record low at the beginning of June showed that the market was maturing. McGlone noted that Bitcoin’s maturation could reduce its chances for major upsides, and the current low volatility in the bull market could also increase systemic risks for the increasingly politicized BTC. “Bitcoin's 60-day volatility has hit a record low compared to gold and the S&P 500. This suggests that a correction trend may emerge for Bitcoin against gold, given the recovery in the balance between assets. It could also signal an impending correction for Bitcoin, given the balance between Bitcoin and traditional assets. In the past, periods of low volatility have often occurred in an environment of extreme pessimism, but this time, with market optimism prevailing, systemic risk may become more pronounced.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-12T16:32:52,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Is It Too Late To Buy Bitcoin As Price Puts In Double Top","The past week has pushed crypto watchers into familiar confusion. After crossing 110,000 with what looked like serious momentum, Bitcoin has now pulled back to the 107,000 range. Traders are split, with some calling it a cooldown and others reading it as a warning. What’s shaping up on the charts seems to be the structure of a potential double top, a technical signal that’s notorious for shaking weak hands and rewarding those who know how to wait. While short-term uncertainty dominates sentiment, this setup could mark a golden zone for those building long-term positions before the next real breakout begins. Is It Too Late To Buy Bitcoin - Price Chart Bitcoin’s latest chart structure has caught plenty of eyes, and for good reason. The price formed two sharp peaks near $110,500, both rejected at nearly the same level. What is being seen now is a classic double top pattern, a setup traders often interpret as a warning sign. It reflects exhaustion at higher levels, where bullish momentum fails to push through resistance. Once the neckline was broken, BTC didn’t just ease down; it snapped through the ascending trendline that had been holding up since $105,319, confirming the shift in sentiment. Prices have now dipped to test support around $107,000. If buyers manage to defend this level, a return toward $110K is possible. But if it gives way, Bitcoin may seek a new floor closer to the $103,000 to $104,000 range, which are zones that saw heavy interest during the previous run-up. Still, what’s playing out technically may not be fully in sync with what’s unfolding outside the charts. In recent days, ETF chatter has escalated. Bloomberg’s analysts have boosted the approval odds of Solana and Litecoin spot ETFs to over 90 percent , thanks to filings that now include staking features. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s parliament is reviewing a bill that would allow the central bank to include crypto in its reserve assets. While not a directive, it signals that policymakers are increasingly seeing digital assets as part of future economic architecture. I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 11, 2025 Even Elon Musk's softening tone toward Trump, after months of public spats, may have helped cool sentiment just enough to let the market breathe. Taken together, these developments suggest the recent correction might not be a red light but a positive-yellow one. The window for long-term entries and strong accumulation may be open. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Trending Projects That Could Pump At BTC’s Reversal SUBBD Social platforms have always leaned in favor of the platform, not the creator. SUBBD flips that equation entirely. It presents itself as a decentralized creator economy designed to make creators the owners, not the product. Instead of depending on algorithmic luck or ad revenue trickles, SUBBD introduces a token-powered structure that lets creators monetize directly and immediately from their audience interactions. No middlemen, no fine print. The project embeds token utility into actual creator workflows. Fans don’t just passively consume content; they participate, unlock perks, vote on content directions, or access gated material, all powered by the $SUBBD token. The platform also allows cross-chain exposure, meaning creators aren’t limited by one ecosystem or audience pool. Why this matters now is tied to the kind of shift being seen across crypto. While Bitcoin’s chart shows short-term tension, the macro environment is leaning in favor of long-term builders. Social media is overdue for a model change, and SUBBD steps in with a fully decentralized proposition just when users are beginning to tire of Web2 ownership rules. Educational crypto YouTube channel 99Bitcoins dubbed it a 100x potential crypto, likely to see major growth post its launch. The project’s smart contract has been audited, and staking is part of its roadmap. But unlike projects that just throw buzzwords around, SUBBD’s value proposition is linked directly to creator engagement. As crypto projects become more utility-driven, this one stands out for actually offering a platform where the token isn’t just an incentive, but the infrastructure. That makes it worth watching now, before creator onboarding hits critical mass. Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 solutions built around Bitcoin often sound more ambitious than they are useful. Bitcoin Hyper doesn’t fall into that trap. Its proposition is simple but necessary: solve Bitcoin’s transactional limitations without compromising the security that makes it Bitcoin in the first place. Instead of creating a separate token economy that floats beside Bitcoin, it anchors itself to the original chain, enabling users to move BTC onto its faster layer using Solana’s architecture for scalability. Here’s how it works. When a user initiates a transaction, BTC is locked on-chain while an equivalent amount is minted on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. This synthetic BTC can then be transferred near-instantly and with dramatically lower fees. Once the user wants to exit, the synthetic tokens are burned and the original BTC is released. It’s a trust-minimized model designed for volume. The timing of Bitcoin Hyper’s rise has been almost suspiciously aligned with macro sentiment. ETF approvals, institutional capital creeping back in, and geopolitical moves hinting at state-level adoption are helping to create an environment where infrastructure actually matters. What makes this a worthwhile investment candidate right now is its simplicity. It’s not trying to be an all-in-one chain or a retail product suite. It’s focused on making Bitcoin more usable, more efficient, and more relevant. That alone makes it a strong contender for upside as attention swings back toward foundational tech in crypto. Solaxy Solaxy is built on a key blockchain need today, which is blockchain performance. While most Layer 2s crowd into Ethereum’s orbit, Solaxy opens the door for users who want to operate across both Ethereum and Solana without hopping between networks, interfaces, or standards. Solaxy is built as a bridge-layer protocol with the ambition to solve two long-standing problems at once. First, it enables fast, low-cost execution on transactions that originate from Ethereum while tapping into Solana’s speed. Second, it introduces native staking that is functional across both ecosystems. That means holders can stake SOLX tokens and earn rewards while still participating in cross-chain activity, a model that tends to lock liquidity without immobilizing it. Its utility shows in how the system works. Solaxy validators confirm transactions across chains using a consensus mechanism optimized for both finality and throughput. The protocol doesn't demand that users abandon familiar wallets or jump through token-swap loops just to complete basic actions. With Solaxy, it's always a hole-in-one. 🛸🪐48M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/n882gUs8yT — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 12, 2025 While short-term charts might be sparking worry across major tokens, Solaxy's use case grows more valuable during exactly this kind of market phase. When speculation cools, infrastructure that can actually process transactions quickly and at scale becomes the real differentiator. Solaxy is all about building a base layer that can carry serious transaction volume without turning into a toll booth. That’s the kind of utility that can quietly build value until the market catches up. Best Wallet There’s no shortage of crypto wallets. But there is a shortage of wallets that actually do more than just store tokens. Best Wallet Token with its key product- the Best Wallet approaches that gap like a toolkit rather than a vault. It offers custody, yes, but also integrates a full suite of tools built for people who don’t want to shuffle between ten different apps just to manage their assets. Here’s what sets it apart. Best Wallet operates across over sixty blockchains, syncing assets in real-time without creating sync delays or leaving users guessing about transaction finality. Within the same interface, you get access to a presale aggregator, a built-in decentralized exchange, and deep market analytics that aren’t just price feeds: they’re visual, responsive, and designed for decision-making. The goal is not just to hold tokens, but to know what to do with them. Staking is baked in. Not as yet another feature to boast about, but as a native feature that allows users to generate yield across assets directly within their portfolio dashboard. And then there’s the upcoming airdrop campaign, which ties user activity to real-time eligibility. Best Wallet’s concept seems to be focused on making DeFi easier to use. At a time when even seasoned investors are tired of hopping through interfaces to do simple tasks, that kind of streamlining becomes valuable. The next wave of users won’t want five apps. They’ll want one that works, and Best Wallet is aiming to be exactly that. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current dip may have technicals leaning bearish for now, but this pattern doesn’t cancel its larger trajectory. If support zones hold and momentum resets, a return to new highs remains firmly on the table. That kind of move rarely happens in isolation. When Bitcoin moves with conviction, it tends to pull altcoins into motion. If the macro signals align and the cycle continues building, the door opens for a true altcoin season. In that case, projects grounded in real utility, fresh ideas, and strong community mechanics are in a position to benefit the most. From here, the ones with substance could turn into the ones with serious upside. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T16:31:29,"Best Crypto Meme Presale Coins to Unlock Big Gains","The post Best Crypto Meme Presale Coins to Unlock Big Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Welcome to Part 1 of the Neo Pepe Revolution ! Imagine it’s June 11, 2025, a time when centralized financial giants hold the reins a little too tightly. Enter the hero we didn’t know we needed: Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP). Rising from the depths of the Memetrix , Neo Pepe isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a call to freedom , a rallying cry for decentralized financial unity. And you, my friend, have the opportunity to be part of this crypto rebellion before it takes off. If you’ve been searching for the best crypto presale opportunities, especially ones with meme coin flair, this article dives deep into Neo Pepe Coin and its competitors. Spoiler alert: Neo Pepe stands far ahead of the pack. Here’s everything you need to know about this unique project and why joining early could be your best decision yet. Why Neo Pepe Coin Is Leading Meme Coin Presales Neo Pepe isn’t just about memes; it’s about a movement . It takes everything we love about meme coins (the humor! the hype!) and combines it with real utility, transparency, and community-driven governance . Here’s why Neo Pepe is dominating the meme coin presale scene. Genius of Presale Structure Neo Pepe has a 16-stage presale format, and every single stage increases the price as demand soars. Starting now in Stage 0 at just $0.05423 , early adopters snag the best price while setting the foundation for incredible growth. And if you’re the type to procrastinate? Well, prices climb steadily with every stage. Waiting may spark some serious FOMO as others cash in. But here’s the real kicker: tokens are released hourly after launch. This ensures smooth distribution while avoiding those dreaded launch-day dumps that have plagued so many other projects. Standout Features of Neo Pepe Neo Pepe outshines its competition with these game-changing features. 1. Governance for Everyone Neo Pepe isn’t run by some shadowy central entity. Instead, it operates via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) . Every token holder gets voting power, whether it’s for new exchange listings or future development decisions. It’s your investment, your rules. 2. Rug-Pull Resistant No one likes a scammy coin, and Neo Pepe takes security seriously. By partnering with Certik and Coinsult for contract audits, Neo Pepe ensures every detail of its smart contracts is bulletproof. 3. Meme Power Meets Purpose Neo Pepe isn’t just another funny meme token. It wields the power of humor and community to drive a social movement for financial inclusivity and freedom. Think of it as the blockchain’s Che Guevara—but with 100% less berets and 1000% more internet humor. 4. Tight and Transparent Tokenomics With 1 billion tokens in total, 45% are reserved for presale-only buyers . That means no sneaky allocations or sketchy hidden wallets. It’s all shown transparently in the smart contract. 5. Easy to Join Neo Pepe makes it effortless to join the presale . The starting price is low, the process is compatible with major crypto wallets like MetaMask, and you can buy using Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or USDT. No hassle, just freedom. Best Meme Coin Presale Competitors Neo Pepe dominates the stage, but while other meme coin projects aim high, they simply cannot compete with the overall package Neo Pepe offers. Here’s a breakdown of its would-be challengers. 1. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM targets decentralized finance enthusiasts. Its focus on lending and borrowing is promising, but its lack of a mass appeal meme culture restricts it to hardcore DeFi nerds. 2. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) Built for speed, Bitcoin Solaris tries to position itself as a blockchain solution. However, it fails to connect with the average investor looking for something simple and fun, like Neo Pepe. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) Great for developers who need scalable blockchain solutions, but boring and niche for meme coin enthusiasts. This project has a lot of brainpower, but not much personality. 4. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) A meme coin that rewards Bitcoin holders. Fun in concept, but zero utility or long-term value beyond its gimmick. 5. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) Loud, hyped, and promising short-term gains. Longer term? Probably not. Unlike Neo Pepe, APC prioritizes flash over substance. Why You Should Join Stage 0 of Neo Pepe Now Neo Pepe is not just about the memes; it’s a financial rebellion against centralization and outdated systems. Investors who get in at Stage 0 will enjoy the lowest entry price, maximum growth potential, and a front-row seat in crypto’s next big movement.

2025-06-12T16:30:12,"Tether Buys Big Stake in Gold Firm to Strengthen USDT Stablecoin","USDT stablecoin issuer Tether has announced that it has bought 32% of a Canadian gold mining company, Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. Tether revealed that this move is part of its broader strategy to invest in diverse assets like gold and Bitcoin (BTC). The goal is to support and strengthen the value of USDT, which is gaining traction in the LATAM region . A New Step in Tether’s Investment Plan Announced on June 12, Tether confirmed that it has acquired 78,421,780 shares in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This Canadian-based company specializes in gold royalty streams. It allows investors to earn from gold production without being directly involved in mining. With this purchase, Tether wants to build stronger reserves that will give USDT more trust and stability. This deal also shows that the company sees gold as a safe and lasting investment. This news comes shortly after Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the company had already bought 50 tons of gold and 100,000 BTC. These steps show Tether is serious about protecting its stablecoin with strong, real assets. Tether Plans to Buy More Gold To Strengthen USDT Tether is not done with just the deal with Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. The company has also signed an agreement with another firm, AlphaStream Limited. This agreement allows Tether to purchase 34,444,580 shares after October 29, 2025. Notably, the purchase is subject to approval from Elemental. If this happens, it would help Tether grow its gold investments even more. Ardoino said Tether sees gold and Bitcoin as smart long-term investments. Bitcoin helps hedge against inflation , while gold offers stability in uncertain times. By investing these assets, Tether aims to keep USDT strong and reliable. Over the past year, both real-world assets have made significant returns, with more than 40% growth. These are the only two major assets that can perform this well. Bitcoin is now more popular than gold among U.S. investors for the first time ever. In December 2024, Fed Chair Powell even called Bitcoin “digital gold.” Tether Bets on Gold and Bitcoin for Stability Tether also supports Bitcoin by open-sourcing its Mining Operating System (MOS). This makes it easier for smaller miners to join and grow the Bitcoin network. Tether’s investments now include Tether Gold (XAUT), which is backed by real gold. By putting money into gold, Bitcoin, and digital tokens, Tether wants to build a strong and steady base. This plan shows that Tether is thinking ahead and wants to create a safer and more stable financial system for everyone.

2025-06-12T16:28:55,"Brazil may allocate $18.5B into Bitcoin as G20 digital asset shift accelerates","Brazil is on track to become the first G20 country to legalise the use of Bitcoin as part of its sovereign reserves, potentially committing up to 5% of its $370 billion in international holdings—equivalent to $18.5 billion—into the digital asset. A legislative proposal , Bill PL 4501/2024, has already cleared its first hurdle in the Chamber of Deputies. If approved into law, the bill could redefine how global financial systems treat crypto assets, establishing a structured precedent for Bitcoin to be held alongside gold and foreign currencies in national reserves. Bitcoin legislation advances in Brazilian Congress The proposed bill, titled the Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve (RESBit), would authorise Brazil’s Ministry of Finance and Central Bank to purchase and hold Bitcoin as part of the country’s official international reserves. The bill highlights Bitcoin’s potential to act as a strategic hedge against macroeconomic volatility and to help diversify reserve portfolios traditionally reliant on fiat currencies and sovereign bonds. According to the draft text, the RESBit aims to integrate blockchain-based digital assets into state policy while mitigating risks associated with global financial instability. The bill’s advancement through its first committee represents the first time a top-tier economy has taken formal legislative steps to include Bitcoin in its state reserves. Up to 5% of $370B reserves may be held in BTC Under the current framework, the Central Bank would be empowered to hold as much as 5% of Brazil’s $370 billion in foreign reserves in Bitcoin, a move that would inject billions into the digital currency market. This would amount to a potential $18.5 billion investment in BTC, signalling a sharp pivot in how central banks might view digital assets, not merely as speculative tools but as long-term reserve instruments. The bill has attracted significant attention on social media, with industry observers pointing out the significance of such a move by a G20 economy. On 5 June, user pete_rizzo_ noted that “Latin America’s largest economy wants BTC”, underscoring the broader implications of such a development.

Financial institutions and policymakers in other G20 nations are watching the situation closely, recognising that a move of this scale by Brazil could set the tone for broader adoption. This would mark the first time a nation of Brazil’s size and influence openly treats Bitcoin as a reserve-grade asset. Brazil’s approach may also serve as a stress test for integrating crypto into regulated financial infrastructure. By adopting Bitcoin through legislative means and involving the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank, the initiative ensures alignment with macroeconomic policy and financial regulations. Such a move could legitimise Bitcoin in global monetary policy circles and potentially soften regulatory resistance in other regions.

2025-06-12T16:18:36,"Hong Kong developing new crypto tracing tool, here’s what you need to know","Hong Kong has confirmed that it is developing a cryptocurrency tracking tool to strengthen enforcement against cross-border money laundering. During a media briefing, Assistant Commissioner Mario Wong Ho-yin of Hong Kong Customs said the department is working with the University of Hong Kong to build the tool to counteract increasingly complex financial crimes involving virtual assets. While details of the tool’s operation remain confidential, officials said it is being designed to trace suspicious crypto transactions linked to money laundering schemes . According to Wong, the university has already supported the department with forensic technologies in other cases, including those involving illegal streaming, and that technical assistance is essential for meeting court evidence requirements. “These money laundering threats are characterised by a transnational and borderless nature, and no single agency can tackle this problem alone,” he added. Crypto’s role in money laundering Seven out of nearly 40 major laundering cases probed by Hong Kong Customs since 2021 have involved the use of cryptocurrencies. These seven cases accounted for more than HK$9 billion (US$1.1 billion) in suspected criminal proceeds, often disguised as routine trading activity. In one particular instance, officials uncovered over 1,000 suspicious transactions totalling HK$1.8 billion across five companies and 18 local bank accounts. Three suspects were arrested, with two accused of moving HK$760 million via a cryptocurrency platform. Plans for a digital crypto tracing tool were first revealed earlier this year when Hong Kong’s Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau introduced CryptoTrace, a system jointly developed with the University of Hong Kong. It was described as a platform providing “advanced intelligence and investigative support” for officers handling virtual asset cases. Announced during the Blockchain Security Summit in March, CryptoTrace is already in use by frontline police investigators and is designed to support intelligence gathering in virtual asset-related crimes. At the time, the bureau said CryptoTrace employed blockchain analytics, graphing, and visualization technologies to trace laundered funds and identify suspect activity. Reportedly, training sessions had already been held to equip frontline officers with the skills to use the system effectively. While the Customs Department did not confirm the name of the tool currently under development, its partnership with the same university and its stated objectives have raised speculation that the system may be an extension, or internal application, of the earlier CryptoTrace platform. Hong Kong takes a cautious approach Hong Kong’s approach to digital assets remains deliberately measured , as it plans to balance innovation and regulatory oversight. Nevertheless, locals appear undeterred by regulatory caution , with a November 2024 survey revealing that one in four adults plan to invest in cryptocurrencies. However, the findings also indicated a clear preference for regulated exchanges, with respondents expressing greater trust in licensed platforms compared to unregulated ones. This growing appetite among residents appears to be shaping how Hong Kong regulators calibrate policy. In April, the Securities and Futures Commission began allowing licensed virtual asset trading platforms to offer staking services, but only under strict conditions. Platforms must obtain written approval and comply with measures designed to protect users and disclose the risks associated with locking up assets for yield generation. By May, lawmakers had passed the Stablecoins Bill , mandating that all issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins tied to the Hong Kong dollar obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Last week, the government confirmed that the Stablecoin Ordinance will take effect on August 1, 2025. The law will also limit stablecoin-related advertisements to licensed issuers and grant certain exemptions for offerings made exclusively to qualified investors.

2025-06-12T16:05:11,"Will Hamster Kombat price recover after falling 90%?","Hamster Kombat token crashed to a record low on Thursday, capping the downfall of one of the most prominent players in the tap-to-earn industry. Hamster Kombat ( HMSTR ) plunged to $0.0010, down 89% over the past year. The token’s market capitalization has collapsed from over $437 million in September to just $67 million today. HMSTR’s crash came as many holders capitulated and sold their tokens. Nansen data shows exchange balances have increased by 13% over the past 30 days, rising to over 17.86 billion HMSTR. A rise in exchange balances typically indicates that investors are moving tokens from self-custody to centralized platforms to sell. Additional on-chain data shows that the number of HMSTR holders dropped from over 300 million at its peak to just 672,200 today. Most exited as the token collapsed and user activity on its mini app declined sharply following its token generation event.

HMSTR price technical analysis HMSTR price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows HMSTR peaked at $0.0029 in April and formed a double-top pattern, with a neckline at $0.002438, the swing low from May 6. The token has since broken below key support at $0.001460, its lowest level in February. Price has also moved below all major moving averages, while both the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have plunged. Additionally, HMSTR has formed an inverse cup-and-handle pattern. Given these signals, the token will likely continue falling as buying interest remains weak. If the decline accelerates, the next level to watch will be $0.00095.
