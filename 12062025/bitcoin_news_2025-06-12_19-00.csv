2025-06-12T16:56:31,"Bitcoin Pepe Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now Before Tier 1 CEX Listing Hits","The post Bitcoin Pepe Is the Best Crypto to Buy Now Before Tier 1 CEX Listing Hits appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News There’s a window in every market cycle—small, noisy, and easy to miss—where the smart money positions right before a listing hits the big leagues. That window is wide open right now, and Bitcoin Pepe is sitting in the middle of it. While most meme coins live or die on vibes, Bitcoin Pepe has been methodically laying track: infrastructure, token standards, bridges, and partnerships, and now, with tier 1 exchange listings locked and loaded for reveal, the setup is cleaner than most altcoin charts right now. With over $14m raised at only $0.0416, the presale is still active, but not for long. Check the official website for the latest updates. Solana on Bitcoin reveals what’s coming on launch At surface level, Bitcoin Pepe looks like what you’d expect: a meme token borrowing Bitcoin’s brand weight and pairing it with internet-native culture. But that’s just the hook. This is the first meme ICO built on Bitcoin, and it’s doing what Bitcoin hasn’t done in over a decade: evolving beyond store of value. The development team is constructing a layer 2 that facilitates staking, NFTs, meme trading, and DeFi, leveraging Bitcoin’s liquidity without the associated friction. The team has already revealed internal demos showing the bridge, the Bitcoin Pepe DEX, and a working block explorer. The bridge lets users move BTC into the L2 in real time, with wallet compatibility checks, safety prompts, and a clean, no-fuss UX that doesn’t assume technical knowledge. The DEX is functional and designed for speed with meme coin pairs, fast swaps, and no clunky onboarding. The explorer looks like something you’d expect from a major L2: it breaks down L1-to-L2 transactions clearly, supports mobile, and gives visibility into what’s actually happening on-chain. BPEP price prediction: What happens after T1 listings drop? The original launch was scheduled for the 31st of May, but the team made the call to hold and push for higher-tier coverage instead of a rushed debut. Markets noticed, and $500,000 came in on the 1st of June, the day after the announcement. If that kind of announcement pulled in half a million in 24 hours, what happens when the tier 1 listing details drop? Bitcoin Pepe’s listings are coming with volume, with top-tier visibility, and with a roadmap that doesn’t rely on hope. In fact, influencers on X and YouTube have already started weighing in. What’s more, Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 allows anyone to issue tokens natively on Bitcoin’s Layer 2, in the same way ERC-20 kicked off Ethereum’s altcoin boom. If that sounds like a stretch, look at what Solana’s SPL standard enabled or how Base gained traction by piggybacking ETH liquidity and rerouting it into meme-heavy DeFi. Bitcoin Pepe is doing that, but with a bigger base layer and Bitcoin’s $2 trillion liquidity to tap into. Eight partnerships have already been confirmed—across DeFi, gaming, and content—and they’re shaping the early footprint of BPEP’s ecosystem before listings go live. The structure is already in place. And between infrastructure, listings, timing, and Bitcoin’s flirt with its ATH, a 100x from presale levels is more than plausible. If the meme cycle accelerates the way it did for Solana’s ecosystem, a 1000x is on the table. Is Bitcoin Pepe the best crypto to buy now? Every cycle has a moment when a project transitions from a niche to a broader market, and those closely observing already recognize that Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is perilously approaching this threshold. Bitcoin Pepe is backed by working tech, smart partnerships, and nearly perfect macro factors that are impossible to ignore. It sits right at the intersection of liquidity and narrative with the tools to convert attention into volume and volume into price.If you’ve been waiting for the best crypto to buy before it goes vertical, this is it .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/bitcoin-pepe-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-before-tier-1-cex-listing-hits/,"BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX","Information",cryptocompare

This is the asset’s highest price in five months. The Ethereum-based memecoin now holds a $1.5 billion market cap, surpassing competitors like FARTCOIN, BONK, and WIF. The token’s steady climb contrasts with broader declines in memecoin prices, reinforcing its position among the top five in the category despite ongoing market volatility. Source: CoinMarketCap Is SPX6900 the Next $1 Trillion Crypto? Murad Mahmudov Thinks So SPX6900 is a token that bridges traditional finance and decentralized investing. By bringing the S&P 500 Index on-chain, it simplifies market exposure for everyday crypto investors, making it far less intimidating. Murad Mahmudov, a well-known crypto investor, is a vocal supporter of SPX6900. He even incorporated it into his “Memecoin Supercycle” thesis, which suggests that tokens like this, even without traditional utility, can deliver massive gains thanks to viral appeal and strong community backing. Contrary to what many claim, Memecoins *do* have Utility. In fact, they satisfy peoples’ thirsts far more pressing in the modern world than the problems solved by Tech projects. Equipped with this understanding – ask yourself – which Memecoins provide the *best* such service? pic.twitter.com/LHAK98SJfN — Murad (@MustStopMurad) June 11, 2025 The results speak for themselves. Since its launch in August 2023, SPX has skyrocketed by 62,337%. To put that in perspective, a $1 investment back then would now be worth over $62,000, dominating the market and outperforming even Bitcoin’s legendary rise from $200 in 2013. Murad’s confidence in SPX6900 only grew. In April, he released a 97-minute video laying out 150 reasons why its market cap could hit $1 trillion.

Following a 35% rally last week, a leaked screenshot of his portfolio revealed his position had rebounded from a $40 million loss to over $55 million in unrealized gains, just as the SPX neared its all-time high. $SPX Breaks Out With BlackRock Backing—Is a $50 Target Realistic? Adding to the coin’s credibility is the backing of major institutional players. On-chain data from Arkham reveals that BlackRock, the trillion-dollar asset manager, now holds SPX as its third-largest crypto asset, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock holds $SPX in its crypto portfolio / Source: Arkham This high-profile endorsement has energized the SPX6900 community. On Reddit and other forums, members are increasingly bullish, with many calling for a $50 price target as they believe the token still has substantial upside potential. SPX6900 Just Flipped Major Resistance—Traders Eye $2 Next The SPX6900/USDT chart shows strong bullish momentum that’s held steady since late April. Prices have been climbing steadily within a well-defined upward channel, with each rally supported by increasing trading volume—a classic sign of sustainable growth. Key price levels also tell an important story. After breaking through resistance at $0.60 and $0.80, the token successfully retested these levels, which have now become solid support zones. This transformation from resistance to support confirms the market’s strengthening confidence in SPX6900’s upward trajectory. Now, at a key juncture, the token faces its biggest test at the $1.64–$1.67 resistance zone—the same level that halted January’s rally. Current price action proves particularly compelling as the token trades slightly above this level, indicating buyers may finally have the strength to overcome this historic barrier. SPX6900 looks like it's near a local top for a pullback. Very much overbought. If you're in this token, I would look to scale out soon. Might get a quick pump and then a pullback. For those that are keen on buying the token, I would hold off and look at other ETH memes for now… pic.twitter.com/6wK3QUy8RS — Junny (@junnyBCap) June 11, 2025 Momentum indicators support the bullish case. The RSI’s surge to 81.44 typically suggests overbought conditions, but during powerful uptrends, such extended highs often reflect genuine buying pressure rather than impending reversal. With the $1.67 breakout within reach, traders are eyeing the next psychological target at $2.00. However, some consolidation would be healthy as the market absorbs these gains.

2025-06-12T16:55:01,"Billion-Dollar Bank Refuses To Resolve Failed Zelle Transfer for Over Six Months – Until the Media Starts Digging Deeper: Report","One billion-dollar US bank reportedly refused to resolve a Zelle transfer for more than half a year, until the bank faced questions from the media. Karen Weber, of Raleigh, North Carolina, says a $300 transfer via Zelle never made it into her friend’s account, but the money was taken from her First National Bank account, reports 5 On Your Side WRAL. Weber’s banking troubles began when she went to reimburse her friend for her share of the costs of a scenic trip they took to Canada. She used the money transfer service Zelle to send her friend $1,300. Says Weber, “The problem was that day I could only send $1,000.” She says her bank told her the remaining $300 would go through the next day. However, she says that while the $1,000 did go through, the $300 never showed up in her friend’s account. Weber says she reached out to First National and filed a dispute, but the bank continued to insist the funds had been sent, even though her friend’s account at Truist Bank continued to show the $300 was never received. After six months of contacting her bank to no avail, Weber reached out to 5 On Your Side for help and that’s when she finally got a resolution. With the two banks working together, the $300 finally appeared in her friend’s account. “It took about a month once I had [WRAL] on board.” Both banks declined to comment on the matter. Meanwhile, Zelle says, “We don’t hold onto a user’s money or manage their accounts.

2025-06-12T16:52:07,"Bitcoin (BTC) Warning from Bloomberg Analyst Mike McGlone! ""At a Risky Turning Point!""","The Bitcoin-gold rivalry has been going on for years. At this point, one BTC is ahead of another gold, while Mike McGlone warned that Bitcoin is approaching a risky turning point. Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Mike McGlone said Bitcoin volatility has fallen to an all-time low. Accordingly, he noted that Bitcoin's historically low volatility compared to gold and the S&P 500 could indicate a major breakout potential for BTC. However, the analyst also stated that this situation also carries great risks for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the risky side and the correction trend are more significant for Bitcoin. Stating that Bitcoin is approaching a key test in terms of further earnings potential at this point, the analyst said that the annual volatility of BTC against gold reaching a record low at the beginning of June showed that the market was maturing. McGlone noted that Bitcoin’s maturation could reduce its chances for major upsides, and the current low volatility in the bull market could also increase systemic risks for the increasingly politicized BTC. “Bitcoin's 60-day volatility has hit a record low compared to gold and the S&P 500. This suggests that a correction trend may emerge for Bitcoin against gold, given the recovery in the balance between assets. It could also signal an impending correction for Bitcoin, given the balance between Bitcoin and traditional assets. In the past, periods of low volatility have often occurred in an environment of extreme pessimism, but this time, with market optimism prevailing, systemic risk may become more pronounced.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-12T16:32:52,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Is It Too Late To Buy Bitcoin As Price Puts In Double Top","The past week has pushed crypto watchers into familiar confusion. After crossing 110,000 with what looked like serious momentum, Bitcoin has now pulled back to the 107,000 range. Traders are split, with some calling it a cooldown and others reading it as a warning. What’s shaping up on the charts seems to be the structure of a potential double top, a technical signal that’s notorious for shaking weak hands and rewarding those who know how to wait. While short-term uncertainty dominates sentiment, this setup could mark a golden zone for those building long-term positions before the next real breakout begins. Is It Too Late To Buy Bitcoin - Price Chart Bitcoin’s latest chart structure has caught plenty of eyes, and for good reason. The price formed two sharp peaks near $110,500, both rejected at nearly the same level. What is being seen now is a classic double top pattern, a setup traders often interpret as a warning sign. It reflects exhaustion at higher levels, where bullish momentum fails to push through resistance. Once the neckline was broken, BTC didn’t just ease down; it snapped through the ascending trendline that had been holding up since $105,319, confirming the shift in sentiment. Prices have now dipped to test support around $107,000. If buyers manage to defend this level, a return toward $110K is possible. But if it gives way, Bitcoin may seek a new floor closer to the $103,000 to $104,000 range, which are zones that saw heavy interest during the previous run-up. Still, what’s playing out technically may not be fully in sync with what’s unfolding outside the charts. In recent days, ETF chatter has escalated. Bloomberg’s analysts have boosted the approval odds of Solana and Litecoin spot ETFs to over 90 percent , thanks to filings that now include staking features. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s parliament is reviewing a bill that would allow the central bank to include crypto in its reserve assets. While not a directive, it signals that policymakers are increasingly seeing digital assets as part of future economic architecture. I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 11, 2025 Even Elon Musk's softening tone toward Trump, after months of public spats, may have helped cool sentiment just enough to let the market breathe. Taken together, these developments suggest the recent correction might not be a red light but a positive-yellow one. The window for long-term entries and strong accumulation may be open. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Trending Projects That Could Pump At BTC’s Reversal SUBBD Social platforms have always leaned in favor of the platform, not the creator. SUBBD flips that equation entirely. It presents itself as a decentralized creator economy designed to make creators the owners, not the product. Instead of depending on algorithmic luck or ad revenue trickles, SUBBD introduces a token-powered structure that lets creators monetize directly and immediately from their audience interactions. No middlemen, no fine print. The project embeds token utility into actual creator workflows. Fans don’t just passively consume content; they participate, unlock perks, vote on content directions, or access gated material, all powered by the $SUBBD token. The platform also allows cross-chain exposure, meaning creators aren’t limited by one ecosystem or audience pool. Why this matters now is tied to the kind of shift being seen across crypto. While Bitcoin’s chart shows short-term tension, the macro environment is leaning in favor of long-term builders. Social media is overdue for a model change, and SUBBD steps in with a fully decentralized proposition just when users are beginning to tire of Web2 ownership rules. Educational crypto YouTube channel 99Bitcoins dubbed it a 100x potential crypto, likely to see major growth post its launch. The project’s smart contract has been audited, and staking is part of its roadmap. But unlike projects that just throw buzzwords around, SUBBD’s value proposition is linked directly to creator engagement. As crypto projects become more utility-driven, this one stands out for actually offering a platform where the token isn’t just an incentive, but the infrastructure. That makes it worth watching now, before creator onboarding hits critical mass. Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 solutions built around Bitcoin often sound more ambitious than they are useful. Bitcoin Hyper doesn’t fall into that trap. Its proposition is simple but necessary: solve Bitcoin’s transactional limitations without compromising the security that makes it Bitcoin in the first place. Instead of creating a separate token economy that floats beside Bitcoin, it anchors itself to the original chain, enabling users to move BTC onto its faster layer using Solana’s architecture for scalability. Here’s how it works. When a user initiates a transaction, BTC is locked on-chain while an equivalent amount is minted on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. This synthetic BTC can then be transferred near-instantly and with dramatically lower fees. Once the user wants to exit, the synthetic tokens are burned and the original BTC is released. It’s a trust-minimized model designed for volume. The timing of Bitcoin Hyper’s rise has been almost suspiciously aligned with macro sentiment. ETF approvals, institutional capital creeping back in, and geopolitical moves hinting at state-level adoption are helping to create an environment where infrastructure actually matters. What makes this a worthwhile investment candidate right now is its simplicity. It’s not trying to be an all-in-one chain or a retail product suite. It’s focused on making Bitcoin more usable, more efficient, and more relevant. That alone makes it a strong contender for upside as attention swings back toward foundational tech in crypto. Solaxy Solaxy is built on a key blockchain need today, which is blockchain performance. While most Layer 2s crowd into Ethereum’s orbit, Solaxy opens the door for users who want to operate across both Ethereum and Solana without hopping between networks, interfaces, or standards. Solaxy is built as a bridge-layer protocol with the ambition to solve two long-standing problems at once. First, it enables fast, low-cost execution on transactions that originate from Ethereum while tapping into Solana’s speed. Second, it introduces native staking that is functional across both ecosystems. That means holders can stake SOLX tokens and earn rewards while still participating in cross-chain activity, a model that tends to lock liquidity without immobilizing it. Its utility shows in how the system works. Solaxy validators confirm transactions across chains using a consensus mechanism optimized for both finality and throughput. The protocol doesn't demand that users abandon familiar wallets or jump through token-swap loops just to complete basic actions. With Solaxy, it's always a hole-in-one. 🛸🪐48M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/n882gUs8yT — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 12, 2025 While short-term charts might be sparking worry across major tokens, Solaxy's use case grows more valuable during exactly this kind of market phase. When speculation cools, infrastructure that can actually process transactions quickly and at scale becomes the real differentiator. Solaxy is all about building a base layer that can carry serious transaction volume without turning into a toll booth. That’s the kind of utility that can quietly build value until the market catches up. Best Wallet There’s no shortage of crypto wallets. But there is a shortage of wallets that actually do more than just store tokens. Best Wallet Token with its key product- the Best Wallet approaches that gap like a toolkit rather than a vault. It offers custody, yes, but also integrates a full suite of tools built for people who don’t want to shuffle between ten different apps just to manage their assets. Here’s what sets it apart. Best Wallet operates across over sixty blockchains, syncing assets in real-time without creating sync delays or leaving users guessing about transaction finality. Within the same interface, you get access to a presale aggregator, a built-in decentralized exchange, and deep market analytics that aren’t just price feeds: they’re visual, responsive, and designed for decision-making. The goal is not just to hold tokens, but to know what to do with them. Staking is baked in. Not as yet another feature to boast about, but as a native feature that allows users to generate yield across assets directly within their portfolio dashboard. And then there’s the upcoming airdrop campaign, which ties user activity to real-time eligibility. Best Wallet’s concept seems to be focused on making DeFi easier to use. At a time when even seasoned investors are tired of hopping through interfaces to do simple tasks, that kind of streamlining becomes valuable. The next wave of users won’t want five apps. They’ll want one that works, and Best Wallet is aiming to be exactly that. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current dip may have technicals leaning bearish for now, but this pattern doesn’t cancel its larger trajectory. If support zones hold and momentum resets, a return to new highs remains firmly on the table. That kind of move rarely happens in isolation. When Bitcoin moves with conviction, it tends to pull altcoins into motion. If the macro signals align and the cycle continues building, the door opens for a true altcoin season. In that case, projects grounded in real utility, fresh ideas, and strong community mechanics are in a position to benefit the most. From here, the ones with substance could turn into the ones with serious upside. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T16:31:29,"Best Crypto Meme Presale Coins to Unlock Big Gains","The post Best Crypto Meme Presale Coins to Unlock Big Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Welcome to Part 1 of the Neo Pepe Revolution ! Imagine it’s June 11, 2025, a time when centralized financial giants hold the reins a little too tightly. Enter the hero we didn’t know we needed: Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP). Rising from the depths of the Memetrix , Neo Pepe isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a call to freedom , a rallying cry for decentralized financial unity. And you, my friend, have the opportunity to be part of this crypto rebellion before it takes off. If you’ve been searching for the best crypto presale opportunities, especially ones with meme coin flair, this article dives deep into Neo Pepe Coin and its competitors. Spoiler alert: Neo Pepe stands far ahead of the pack. Here’s everything you need to know about this unique project and why joining early could be your best decision yet. Why Neo Pepe Coin Is Leading Meme Coin Presales Neo Pepe isn’t just about memes; it’s about a movement . It takes everything we love about meme coins (the humor! the hype!) and combines it with real utility, transparency, and community-driven governance . Here’s why Neo Pepe is dominating the meme coin presale scene. Genius of Presale Structure Neo Pepe has a 16-stage presale format, and every single stage increases the price as demand soars. Starting now in Stage 0 at just $0.05423 , early adopters snag the best price while setting the foundation for incredible growth. And if you’re the type to procrastinate? Well, prices climb steadily with every stage. Waiting may spark some serious FOMO as others cash in. But here’s the real kicker: tokens are released hourly after launch. This ensures smooth distribution while avoiding those dreaded launch-day dumps that have plagued so many other projects. Standout Features of Neo Pepe Neo Pepe outshines its competition with these game-changing features. 1. Governance for Everyone Neo Pepe isn’t run by some shadowy central entity. Instead, it operates via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) . Every token holder gets voting power, whether it’s for new exchange listings or future development decisions. It’s your investment, your rules. 2. Rug-Pull Resistant No one likes a scammy coin, and Neo Pepe takes security seriously. By partnering with Certik and Coinsult for contract audits, Neo Pepe ensures every detail of its smart contracts is bulletproof. 3. Meme Power Meets Purpose Neo Pepe isn’t just another funny meme token. It wields the power of humor and community to drive a social movement for financial inclusivity and freedom.

Best Meme Coin Presale Competitors Neo Pepe dominates the stage, but while other meme coin projects aim high, they simply cannot compete with the overall package Neo Pepe offers. Here’s a breakdown of its would-be challengers. 1. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM targets decentralized finance enthusiasts. Its focus on lending and borrowing is promising, but its lack of a mass appeal meme culture restricts it to hardcore DeFi nerds. 2. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) Built for speed, Bitcoin Solaris tries to position itself as a blockchain solution. However, it fails to connect with the average investor looking for something simple and fun, like Neo Pepe. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) Great for developers who need scalable blockchain solutions, but boring and niche for meme coin enthusiasts. This project has a lot of brainpower, but not much personality. 4. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) A meme coin that rewards Bitcoin holders. Fun in concept, but zero utility or long-term value beyond its gimmick. 5. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) Loud, hyped, and promising short-term gains. Longer term? Probably not. Unlike Neo Pepe, APC prioritizes flash over substance. Why You Should Join Stage 0 of Neo Pepe Now Neo Pepe is not just about the memes; it’s a financial rebellion against centralization and outdated systems. Investors who get in at Stage 0 will enjoy the lowest entry price, maximum growth potential, and a front-row seat in crypto’s next big movement.

2025-06-12T16:30:12,"Tether Buys Big Stake in Gold Firm to Strengthen USDT Stablecoin","USDT stablecoin issuer Tether has announced that it has bought 32% of a Canadian gold mining company, Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. Tether revealed that this move is part of its broader strategy to invest in diverse assets like gold and Bitcoin (BTC). The goal is to support and strengthen the value of USDT, which is gaining traction in the LATAM region . A New Step in Tether’s Investment Plan Announced on June 12, Tether confirmed that it has acquired 78,421,780 shares in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This Canadian-based company specializes in gold royalty streams. It allows investors to earn from gold production without being directly involved in mining. With this purchase, Tether wants to build stronger reserves that will give USDT more trust and stability. This deal also shows that the company sees gold as a safe and lasting investment. This news comes shortly after Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the company had already bought 50 tons of gold and 100,000 BTC. These steps show Tether is serious about protecting its stablecoin with strong, real assets. Tether Plans to Buy More Gold To Strengthen USDT Tether is not done with just the deal with Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. The company has also signed an agreement with another firm, AlphaStream Limited. This agreement allows Tether to purchase 34,444,580 shares after October 29, 2025. Notably, the purchase is subject to approval from Elemental. If this happens, it would help Tether grow its gold investments even more. Ardoino said Tether sees gold and Bitcoin as smart long-term investments. Bitcoin helps hedge against inflation , while gold offers stability in uncertain times. By investing these assets, Tether aims to keep USDT strong and reliable. Over the past year, both real-world assets have made significant returns, with more than 40% growth. These are the only two major assets that can perform this well. Bitcoin is now more popular than gold among U.S. investors for the first time ever. In December 2024, Fed Chair Powell even called Bitcoin “digital gold.” Tether Bets on Gold and Bitcoin for Stability Tether also supports Bitcoin by open-sourcing its Mining Operating System (MOS). This makes it easier for smaller miners to join and grow the Bitcoin network. Tether’s investments now include Tether Gold (XAUT), which is backed by real gold. By putting money into gold, Bitcoin, and digital tokens, Tether wants to build a strong and steady base.

2025-06-12T16:28:55,"Brazil may allocate $18.5B into Bitcoin as G20 digital asset shift accelerates","Brazil is on track to become the first G20 country to legalise the use of Bitcoin as part of its sovereign reserves, potentially committing up to 5% of its $370 billion in international holdings—equivalent to $18.5 billion—into the digital asset. A legislative proposal , Bill PL 4501/2024, has already cleared its first hurdle in the Chamber of Deputies. If approved into law, the bill could redefine how global financial systems treat crypto assets, establishing a structured precedent for Bitcoin to be held alongside gold and foreign currencies in national reserves. Bitcoin legislation advances in Brazilian Congress The proposed bill, titled the Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve (RESBit), would authorise Brazil’s Ministry of Finance and Central Bank to purchase and hold Bitcoin as part of the country’s official international reserves. The bill highlights Bitcoin’s potential to act as a strategic hedge against macroeconomic volatility and to help diversify reserve portfolios traditionally reliant on fiat currencies and sovereign bonds. According to the draft text, the RESBit aims to integrate blockchain-based digital assets into state policy while mitigating risks associated with global financial instability. The bill’s advancement through its first committee represents the first time a top-tier economy has taken formal legislative steps to include Bitcoin in its state reserves. Up to 5% of $370B reserves may be held in BTC Under the current framework, the Central Bank would be empowered to hold as much as 5% of Brazil’s $370 billion in foreign reserves in Bitcoin, a move that would inject billions into the digital currency market. This would amount to a potential $18.5 billion investment in BTC, signalling a sharp pivot in how central banks might view digital assets, not merely as speculative tools but as long-term reserve instruments. The bill has attracted significant attention on social media, with industry observers pointing out the significance of such a move by a G20 economy. On 5 June, user pete_rizzo_ noted that “Latin America’s largest economy wants BTC”, underscoring the broader implications of such a development.

Financial institutions and policymakers in other G20 nations are watching the situation closely, recognising that a move of this scale by Brazil could set the tone for broader adoption. This would mark the first time a nation of Brazil’s size and influence openly treats Bitcoin as a reserve-grade asset. Brazil’s approach may also serve as a stress test for integrating crypto into regulated financial infrastructure. By adopting Bitcoin through legislative means and involving the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank, the initiative ensures alignment with macroeconomic policy and financial regulations. Such a move could legitimise Bitcoin in global monetary policy circles and potentially soften regulatory resistance in other regions.

2025-06-12T16:18:36,"Hong Kong developing new crypto tracing tool, here’s what you need to know","Hong Kong has confirmed that it is developing a cryptocurrency tracking tool to strengthen enforcement against cross-border money laundering. During a media briefing, Assistant Commissioner Mario Wong Ho-yin of Hong Kong Customs said the department is working with the University of Hong Kong to build the tool to counteract increasingly complex financial crimes involving virtual assets. While details of the tool’s operation remain confidential, officials said it is being designed to trace suspicious crypto transactions linked to money laundering schemes . According to Wong, the university has already supported the department with forensic technologies in other cases, including those involving illegal streaming, and that technical assistance is essential for meeting court evidence requirements. “These money laundering threats are characterised by a transnational and borderless nature, and no single agency can tackle this problem alone,” he added. Crypto’s role in money laundering Seven out of nearly 40 major laundering cases probed by Hong Kong Customs since 2021 have involved the use of cryptocurrencies. These seven cases accounted for more than HK$9 billion (US$1.1 billion) in suspected criminal proceeds, often disguised as routine trading activity. In one particular instance, officials uncovered over 1,000 suspicious transactions totalling HK$1.8 billion across five companies and 18 local bank accounts. Three suspects were arrested, with two accused of moving HK$760 million via a cryptocurrency platform. Plans for a digital crypto tracing tool were first revealed earlier this year when Hong Kong’s Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau introduced CryptoTrace, a system jointly developed with the University of Hong Kong. It was described as a platform providing “advanced intelligence and investigative support” for officers handling virtual asset cases. Announced during the Blockchain Security Summit in March, CryptoTrace is already in use by frontline police investigators and is designed to support intelligence gathering in virtual asset-related crimes. At the time, the bureau said CryptoTrace employed blockchain analytics, graphing, and visualization technologies to trace laundered funds and identify suspect activity. Reportedly, training sessions had already been held to equip frontline officers with the skills to use the system effectively. While the Customs Department did not confirm the name of the tool currently under development, its partnership with the same university and its stated objectives have raised speculation that the system may be an extension, or internal application, of the earlier CryptoTrace platform. Hong Kong takes a cautious approach Hong Kong’s approach to digital assets remains deliberately measured , as it plans to balance innovation and regulatory oversight. Nevertheless, locals appear undeterred by regulatory caution , with a November 2024 survey revealing that one in four adults plan to invest in cryptocurrencies. However, the findings also indicated a clear preference for regulated exchanges, with respondents expressing greater trust in licensed platforms compared to unregulated ones. This growing appetite among residents appears to be shaping how Hong Kong regulators calibrate policy. In April, the Securities and Futures Commission began allowing licensed virtual asset trading platforms to offer staking services, but only under strict conditions. Platforms must obtain written approval and comply with measures designed to protect users and disclose the risks associated with locking up assets for yield generation. By May, lawmakers had passed the Stablecoins Bill , mandating that all issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins tied to the Hong Kong dollar obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Last week, the government confirmed that the Stablecoin Ordinance will take effect on August 1, 2025. The law will also limit stablecoin-related advertisements to licensed issuers and grant certain exemptions for offerings made exclusively to qualified investors.

2025-06-12T16:05:11,"Will Hamster Kombat price recover after falling 90%?","Hamster Kombat token crashed to a record low on Thursday, capping the downfall of one of the most prominent players in the tap-to-earn industry. Hamster Kombat ( HMSTR ) plunged to $0.0010, down 89% over the past year. The token’s market capitalization has collapsed from over $437 million in September to just $67 million today. HMSTR’s crash came as many holders capitulated and sold their tokens. Nansen data shows exchange balances have increased by 13% over the past 30 days, rising to over 17.86 billion HMSTR. A rise in exchange balances typically indicates that investors are moving tokens from self-custody to centralized platforms to sell. Additional on-chain data shows that the number of HMSTR holders dropped from over 300 million at its peak to just 672,200 today. Most exited as the token collapsed and user activity on its mini app declined sharply following its token generation event.

Futures open interest for HMSTR dropped to $30 million on Thursday, down from this month’s high of $60 million. At the same time, Hamster Kombat’s funding rate sank to a record low of minus 0.06%. A negative funding rate indicates that traders are paying to maintain short positions, signaling expectations of further downside.

The token has since broken below key support at $0.001460, its lowest level in February. Price has also moved below all major moving averages, while both the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have plunged. Additionally, HMSTR has formed an inverse cup-and-handle pattern. Given these signals, the token will likely continue falling as buying interest remains weak. If the decline accelerates, the next level to watch will be $0.00095.

2025-06-12T16:00:06,"Trident Digital eyes $500 million XRP treasury in bold corporate crypto bet","Singapore-headquartered Trident Digital Holdings (TDTH), a Nasdaq-listed technology firm, has announced plans to raise up to $500 million to build one of the world’s first corporate treasuries based entirely on XRP. The company said in a statement that it intends to use the funds for long-term XRP holdings, staking strategies to generate yield, and to deepen its integration with Ripple’s broader ecosystem. The initiative marks a significant pivot in corporate digital asset management strategies, diverging from the Bitcoin-centric approach taken by most firms engaged in crypto treasuries. Trident aims to operationalise the XRP-based treasury in the second half of 2025, depending on regulatory approvals. Trident plans structured raise via equity and private capital The $500 million target will be raised through a mix of equity sales, private placements, and structured capital instruments, with the company tapping Chaince Securities, a United States-based advisory firm, to serve as strategic advisor on the fundraise. Trident did not disclose how much of the capital would be allocated directly to XRP acquisition versus staking and ecosystem development. However, it confirmed that a substantial portion of the funds would be committed to supporting infrastructure and application developers working within Ripple’s framework. According to CEO Soon Huat Lim, the initiative reflects Trident’s broader strategy to position itself as a long-term participant in blockchain-based finance. The company said the move also signals its belief in XRP as a stable, utility-driven digital asset suitable for treasury diversification beyond Bitcoin. XRP joins select group of treasury-held digital assets If completed, Trident’s treasury would place XRP in a rare class of corporate-held crypto assets. To date, Bitcoin remains the only digital asset widely held in corporate treasuries, with companies such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet holding over 226,000 and 141 Bitcoin, respectively. By contrast, very few public firms have included altcoins like XRP in their balance sheets due to regulatory uncertainties, volatility concerns, and a lack of long-term utility use cases. Trident’s decision could set a precedent for other firms looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin while staying compliant. The company’s effort also comes as XRP’s regulatory status remains a subject of debate in the United States, following Ripple’s ongoing legal case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trident acknowledged the importance of “regulatory clarity” in the timing of its deployment, suggesting the treasury will only launch once key jurisdictional issues are resolved. Ripple integration central to long-term strategy A key component of Trident’s XRP treasury plan includes forging deeper ties with Ripple’s ecosystem through collaborations with infrastructure providers and app developers. While specific partners were not named, the firm said it would prioritise projects that promote scalability, compliance, and institutional use cases for XRP. The move may also help Trident position itself strategically in Asia-Pacific and global markets where Ripple has expanded its footprint. By becoming a major institutional participant in the XRP ledger, Trident could also benefit from potential appreciation in the asset’s value or increased on-chain utility over time. The announcement follows similar moves in adjacent sectors where digital assets are increasingly being used for yield generation, cross-border settlements, and treasury diversification. However, this is one of the first large-scale attempts to build an XRP-specific corporate treasury at this scale, setting Trident apart from crypto-native funds or speculative altcoin investments.

2025-06-12T16:00:00,"The Ultimate Summer 2025 Crypto Portfolio: What to Hold Now","The crypto market is heating up again in June 2025, and altcoins are leading the next bull run. Amid the new wave of massive gains, you might be wondering what to hold. Smart investors know that when the market heats up, the best options are those that show massive potential but have yet to be uncovered by the rest of the market. One of the finest examples of this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Let us dive into which projects to consider this summer. Solana (SOL) Could Ride ETF Wave Analysts forecast that if the SEC approves a Solana (SOL) ETF, it could push Solana (SOL) past the $200 mark. The price of Solana (SOL) is currently at $150, after a massive slump of nearly 50% from the all-time high of $294 in January. Amid this falling enthusiasm for Solana (SOL), investors in the project are looking for options elsewhere, and so far, they have settled on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for bombastic returns. Even with an ETF approval, SOL would only rise by 25%, which is meager compared to the real gains that MUTM presale investors are expecting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) -Life-Changing Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the Defi sector that aims to give participants in its ecosystem some of the biggest returns of 2025. To achieve this, it has created a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders can deposit their assets for the chance to earn interest, while borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral to access those assets. The interest rate in the pools on Mutuum Finance is determined by a pool’s utilization rate. Security On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) completed an audit by the trust CertiK blockchain audit service. In the results, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received a Token Scan Score of 80. These results have inspired confidence in the project, with investors now rushing to secure their presale tokens in phase 5 of the presale. The results of the presale have also helped Mutuum Finance (MUTM) secure a listing on CoinMarketCap, the leading platform for price movements in the crypto sector. The platform receives over 350 million monthly visitors, which will ensure that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gets the visibility it deserves. It will also allow crypto investors to view the price movement for MUTM tokens to make smart investment decisions. To further bolster security, the platform will implement an address screening program, which will ensure nefarious actors are kept outside of its reach. The program will use an independent third party, where addresses will be screened before being allowed onto the platform. However, private details like IP addresses and metadata will not be shared with the third-party security service. The project is also sending out an open invitation to security experts, developers, and ethical hackers to examine the code and report vulnerabilities. To do this, the project will launch a bug bounty program, which will be open to anyone with blockchain security expertise. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) is the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Its main advantage is that it was the first, and has continued to grow a large community around it. Additionally, it has received a lot of institutional inflows in 2025. Based on these activities, analysts forecast that it could reach 200k by the end of 2025. However, while those gains seem massive, they are not as impressive as those in low-cap coins with massive potential. For instance, a rise to $200K would represent a 100% increase. On the other hand, conservative estimates on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) show that it could rise from the current price of $0.03 to $2. That would represent a 6,566.67% increase, eclipsing Bitcoin (BTC) gains on the highest end of the forecast. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in phase 5 of its presale, where it has raised over $10.4 million from investors so far. Over 11,900 unique buyers are taking part in the presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.03. In the first phase of the presale, the tokens were priced at $0.01. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. Ongoing $100,000 Giveaway To reward presale participants, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a $100,000 giveaway. This giveaway is open to all presale participants who purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the presale. They will then stand a chance to be one of the ten lucky winners who will receive $10,000 in MUMT tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that prioritizes security and intends to become the leading Defi project. By investing in the presale, you stand a chance to make huge gains that could propel your portfolio to new heights.

2025-06-12T15:37:02,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP: A Technical Look at Whether to Buy, Sell, or Hold This Week","Analyzing the current market trends and chart patterns, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP present intriguing cases for traders this week. This piece delves into whether these leading cryptocurrencies signal a time to invest, offload, or maintain current holdings. Discover which of these digital assets may be poised for a breakout or further downturn. Bitcoin Market: Steady Growth with Bullish Focus at Critical Levels Bitcoin saw a steady price climb over the past month with a 5.70% gain, reflecting a calm yet positive performance. Over the last six months, a 9.85% rise demonstrated continued investor interest and an overall upward trend. Weekly price behavior, marked by a 4.08% increase, confirms resilience in the market during this period with gradual recovery evident in the price progression. Bitcoin currently trades within a price range of $94,832 to $113,326.8. Nearest resistance is located at $121,869.42, while the nearest support stands at $84,880.08. The Awesome Oscillator at 1,723.82 indicates positive energy, while the Momentum Indicator at 3,965.46 also suggests upward movement. The Relative Strength Index near 61.98 points to a moderately strong market. Bulls appear dominant, but caution exists as no clear long-term trend emerges. Tactical trades may be effective, with buying near support and selling near resistance for balanced risk and reward. Close monitoring of key signals is essential. Ethereum: Short-Term Rally Amid Mixed Half-Year Trends Past month ETH data shows a clear short-term gain, with a one-week increase of 7.61% and a monthly rise of 10.99%. Over the past six months, Ethereum experienced a decline of 28.12%, reflecting a challenging longer-term trend despite recent upward momentum. This mix of short-term recovery against a longer-term downturn highlights a market that can catch sudden lifts but remains influenced by broader bearish pressures over time. Current price action finds Ethereum trading in a range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. The nearest support is marked at $1318.72 while resistance looms near $3395.40. Bulls appear to be gaining ground in the short term, as reflected by recent gains and positive momentum indicators. However, the relative strength index shows upward pressure could soon face pushback if overbought conditions emerge. Traders might consider positions around the current range with stop-loss orders near the lower support, while monitoring for potential breakouts above $3395.40. XRP Price Snapshot: Week Gains Amid Minor Long-Term Decline XRP experienced a slight weekly increase of 2.08% with a monthly drop of 3.14% and a six-month decline of 1.98%. The coin’s performance has shown limited volatility, as modest gains balanced out larger period declines. Price activity over the past month and half-year has been mixed, featuring small upward moves offset by gradual fading values over time. Indicators reflected a neutral mood, with the market quietly adjusting without dramatic swings. The recent behavior indicates a consolidation phase where neither bulls nor bears have taken full control of the market. XRP currently trades in a price range of $1.95 to $2.53, sitting above clear support at $1.73 and below resistance at $2.88. A second resistance is seen at $3.45 while a lower support is marked at $1.15. The market’s momentum is positive with an indicator reading of 0.1126, though the Awesome Oscillator stands slightly negative. Moving averages suggest moderate buying interest. The overall price lies within well-defined boundaries, indicating a lack of a decisive trend. Traders may consider long entries near support levels, with profit targets around resistance zones while remaining cautious. Conclusion BTC shows potential for growth with current trends. ETH appears stable but needs close watching for market shifts. XRP remains volatile, requiring cautious consideration. Each offers unique opportunities depending on market interest and individual risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T15:30:32,"Will Dogecoin Moon Or Crash? This Indicator Holds The Answer","According to market technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) a single metric—the 20-month simple moving average—could be the line that could separate another vertical rally from a gut-wrenching breakdown for Dogecoin. Currently, DOGE sits comfortable above that moving average, now plotted at $0.1751. The black curve on Cat’s chart shows only three clean retests of the 20-month SMA since 2014. All Eyes On Dogecoin’s 20-Month SMA The first came in March 2017, when price tapped the average near $0.00020 and then ripped more than 9,000% into the January 2018 peak. The second occurred in the winter of 2020, with price kissing the average at roughly one-fourth of one cent before the parabolic 34,500% run to $0.73 the following May. The third and current encounter began in August last year when DOGE rallied by more than 480%. As of today, two successive monthly candles dipped into the zone just below twenty-cents, but both were bought aggressively, leaving higher wicks and preserving the upward slope of the average. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as that moving average remains intact, “we’re going higher.” A decisive monthly close beneath $0.175 would, by this read, place the entire structure at risk and could usher in the sort of multi-month down-trend that followed the 2018 and 2021 climaxes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Moment This Month, Predicts Analyst TOTAL2 Needs To Break Out Analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) overlays that micro view on a much broader canvas. His chart tracks the total crypto market capitalization ex-Bitcoin (TradingView ticker “TOTAL2”) in monthly candles back to 2017. Two bold yellow trend-lines define a seven-year rising channel whose upper rail repelled price at the January 2018 and November 2021 alt-season tops. Since the June 2022 low, the market has carved out an ascending triangle: a rising series of higher lows presses against a flat-topped supply zone between roughly $1.43 trillion and $1.7 trillion. The apex of the triangle now looms; aggregate alt-cap is already worth about $1.2 trillion — all that stands between the current print and a confirmed breakout is a monthly close above the upper edge of that yellow rectangle. Kevin’s projection measures the height of the pattern and adds it to the breakout level, dropping a vertical marker that intersects the mid-channel near $5.89 trillion. Kevin’s first Fibonacci extensions target is the 1.618 at $4.06 trillion. Higher extensions at 1.886, 2.0 and 2.618 cluster around $4.57 trillion, 5.89 trillion and $6.9 trillion respectively, the last of which coincides almost exactly with the channel’s ceiling and is circled as the analyst’s ultimate upside objective. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Why does that matter for Dogecoin? The meme-coin’s two explosive cycles began only after TOTAL2 had broken its own prior-cycle high and money poured into non-Bitcoin assets. Kevin states that “altcoins are just scratching the surface of what is possible in the coming months,” provided that macro-liquidity and regulatory factors permit capital rotation out of Bitcoin into the wider market. In that scenario the 20-month SMA on DOGE would likely continue to slope higher, setting the stage for an explosive move higher. Conversely, failure of the alt-cap triangle would make a sustained loss of the SMA far more probable, robbing DOGE of its historical launch-pad. For now, the indicator holds—and with it the prospect that Dogecoin could be primed for yet another bout of furious upside. But as both analysts caution, the monthly close will tell the story: above the 20-month SMA and an alt-cap breakout, or below it and back into hibernation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

2025-06-12T15:28:20,"An Unfazed Tim Draper is Standing by his $250,000 Bitcoin Prediction, Here’s Why","As chaos ensues over the increasing U.S. deficit amidst the continued trade wars that followed Trump’s increased tariff rates, cryptocurrency personalities are speaking up about the possible impact of the ongoing development on Bitcoin . Billionaire investor Tim Draper is one such figure, convinced that Bitcoin could benefit positively from the persistent volatility recorded in the traditional finance market. In a recent post shared to X, Draper doubled down on his previous forecast for Bitcoin, with a price target of $250,000. The billionaire investor told his 268,000 followers that Bitcoin could kick off a bullish marathon this year, despite hitting a new all-time high 15 days ago. “Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows.” He wrote. Outlining the main factors responsible for “pushing Bitcoin forward” at this time, Draper pointed to renewed optimism from market participants, as President Trump works out trade deals, the incoming regulatory frameworks essential for the provision of market clarity, and the increase in Web3 applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain. He observed that traditional banks are adding to their offerings, noting that JP Morgan plans to join the race, while businesses pile in— a development he believes could bring about mainstream adoption. He went on to make the following observations; “Bitcoin is extremely low risk compared to some other cryptocurrencies and stocks because people believe in it. It’s earning the title of a store of value. Meanwhile, Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum while keeping a solid foundation. The smart money sees what comes next.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin kicked off June with an opening price of $104,637 and traded at an intraday high of $105,884. On Thursday, Bitcoin sharply declined as selling pressure intensified, resulting in a revisit to the $100,000 price mark. Down 8.12% from its all-time high of $111,970, with a 2.04% decline in market cap value, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $107,598.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/an-unfazed-tim-draper-is-standing-by-his-250000-bitcoin-prediction-heres-why/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Tim Draper",cryptocompare

According to the company’s latest corporate statement, this latest purchase brings its total Bitcoin reserves to 153.4627 BTC. Japanese Fashion Brand ANAP Holdings Increases Bitcoin Reserves with New Acquisition The move reflects ANAP Holdings’ commitment to integrating digital assets into its treasury strategy and adds to the growing number of publicly traded companies in Japan and around the world turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.

2025-06-12T15:22:15,"Husky Inu (HINU) On The Verge Of $800,000 Despite Market Downturn","Husky Inu (HINU) edged closer to the $800,000 milestone as interest in the project soared despite a market downturn that has seen Bitcoin (BTC) and other prominent altcoin and meme tokens trade in bearish territory. The HINU token recently registered its latest price increase, rising from $0.00017889 to $0.00017941. The project’s next price jump will see the token rise to $0.00017993. Husky Inu’s (HINU) Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) is set to register its latest price jump, which will see the token’s value rise from $0.00017941 to $0.00017993. The project had only recently registered an increase to $0.00017889. The project has seen a surge of interest as markets rebounded, with Bitcoin (BTC) rallying past $110,000, while Ethereum (ETH) crossed $2,800 before registering a marginal decline. Interest in Husky Inu remains strong despite a decline in the broader crypto market over the past two sessions. The price jump is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which aims to empower the project’s fledgling yet growing community and ensure they can benefit from favorable pricing. If you remember, the token price at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000 and has steadily increased since. The token price has risen every two days and will continue until the tokens sell out. Closing In On Another Milestone The project is also closing in on another major milestone, the $800,000 mark. The burgeoning interest in Husky Inu has seen the project raise $798,320 so far. The project could reach the $800,000 mark as early as next week and remains on track to achieve its stated goal of $1.2 million. Markets Stall After Burgeoning Rally Meanwhile, the crypto market’s rally stalled, with major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, trading in bearish territory. BTC surged past $110,000 on Monday but lost momentum as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers. As a result, it fell 1.42% on Wednesday and extended its losses during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%. ETH also started the week on a bullish note, surging past $2,600 on Monday and $2,800 on Tuesday to settle at $2,816. However, it slipped back below $2,800 and currently trades around $2,770. Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also registered notable declines.

2025-06-12T15:19:04,"Donald Trump: Administration Will Work Toward 'Clear and Simple' Crypto Frameworks","MANHATTAN — U.S. President Donald Trump again touted his crypto bona fides at a conference Thursday, telling an audience it was an ""honor"" to be considered a crypto president. Speaking in a 90-second recorded video at Coinbase's (COIN) State of Crypto Summit (no relation to the CoinDesk newsletter with the same name), Trump reiterated comments he's made at other events about ending his predecessor's so-called war on crypto and forming a working group to examine digital assets. Trump also referenced legislation working its way through Congress. ""My administration is working with governors to pass the GENIUS Act supporting the creation of dollar-backed stablecoins, and we also will be working to create clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and bitcoin,"" he told a filled room to scattered applause. The Senate's GENIUS Act will go through a procedural vote on Thursday, following a successful effort on Wednesday . Meanwhile, two key House committees advanced a market structure bill on Tuesday. Trump also noted his executive order on establishing a national bitcoin BTC reserve, saying, ""we created the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the United States Digital Asset stockpile,"" though neither has actually been created yet. Coinbase donated a million dollars to Trump's inaugural fund, and was a major backer of the Fairshake super PAC in the 2024 election. It's already committed tens of millions of dollars to Fairshake for the 2026 election. Following his remarks, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Circle (CRCL) CEO Jeremy Allaire reflected on crypto and their respective company's evolutions, arguing that crypto could become a bigger part of the global financial system. Allaire, whose company went public on the New York Stock Exchange last week, said it was difficult for Circle to meet with backers or other entities a decade ago. ""It was amazing to me that, like, I'd literally walk in a room with an insurance company, [and] they were literally, like, we were not sure we're allowed to have this meeting,"" Allaire said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/12/donald-trump-administration-will-work-toward-clear-and-simple-crypto-frameworks,"BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION","Policy|Donald Trump|Coinbase|Circle|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T15:15:09,"Tether bought a 32% stake in Canadian gold company","Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has significantly expanded its Bitcoin-and-gold investment strategy by acquiring a 31.9% stake in Canadian-listed gold royalty firm Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. The stablecoin company has been accumulating Bitcoin and Gold aggressively over recent months. This is likely a part of the firm’s strategy to bolster its holdings and support for the USDT stablecoin. Paolo Ardoino acknowledged that gold remains a demonstrated store of value On June 10, 2025, Tether Investments obtained 78,421,780 Common Shares of Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This amounts to roughly 31.9% of Elemental’s issued and outstanding common shares. According to credible sources, a private agreement allegedly made this deal offshore. The stablecoin firm also entered into an option agreement with AlphaStream Limited to acquire an additional 34,444,580 shares after October 29, 2025, provided Elemental approves it. If the deal is successful, the stablecoin firm will be able to diversify its investment in gold further . Commenting on the developments, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino stated that Tether is investing in gold and Bitcoin as a part of its long-term strategy to build a stronger and clearer financial system for the future. Ardoino acknowledged that Bitcoin is the best hedge against inflation, but gold has remained a solid investment to preserve value throughout history. The announcement came after Tether Group had gone public on its holdings of more than 100,000 Bitcoins, an estimated total of physical gold worth nearly 80 tons, and its very own Tether Gold, a token linked to physical gold. Ardoino emphasized that they support financial systems supported by actual assets rather than promises. For him, their bet on Elemental is consistent with their continuing belief that tangible assets like Bitcoin and gold will act as backing for the most sustainable forms of digital value. Following Tether’s move, analysts anticipate that institutional investors are accumulating both Bitcoin and Gold , the only 2 assets with over 40% returns in the last 12 months in investments. However, the first time this has happened, Bitcoin recently overtook Gold in US ownership. Therefore, it appears to be a good idea for the USDT issuer to spread funds within these two classes of assets. Tether’s investment in Elemental Altus to enhance digital financial products Elemental Altus Royalties provides Tether exposure to global gold production using a royalty and streaming model without the direct operational risk of mining. This fits with Tether’s desire for strategic, low-risk exposure to real-world assets that improve the transparency and stability of digital financial products. Tether Investments could potentially take a more active role in engagement with the management of Elemental and its board, searching for the ways Elemental can work together, take part in governance, and develop long-term capital strategy, subject to regulations framework as well as market conditions. The transaction was conducted by Canadian securities laws, including National Instrument 62-104 – Take-Over Bids and Issuer Bids, and was exempt from the formal takeover bid legislation. It is worth noting that Tether Investments invests capital from Tether’s profits and extra reserves in many different areas where technology, infrastructure, and practical use intersect. Its portfolio invests in artificial intelligence, financial services, energy, biotech, education, and digital media. They also hold important shares in commodities, remittances, and sports and entertainment industries. Tether Investments puts funds in companies with long-term potential to increase access, efficiency, and resilience in emerging and developed markets. It complements Tether Group’s larger goal of supporting decentralized systems in general, stimulating infrastructure resilience, and increasing the real-world availability of open and transparent technologies.

2025-06-12T15:13:47,"GameStop lacks a strategy but GME shares continue to survive due to ‘greater fools’","GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME) opened more than 15% down on Thursday after announcing plans of raising $1.75 billion through a convertible notes offering to potentially expand its BTC holdings. According to the gaming merchandise retailer, net proceeds from the said offering will be used for general corporate purposes, “including making investments in a manner consistent with GME’s investment policy.” And adding cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, to the balance sheet has been a key component of the company’s investment policy this year. In May, it spent around half a billion dollars to load up on 4,710 BTC. Despite today’s decline, GME shares are up more than 10% versus their year-to-date low in April. Why isn’t the Bitcoin strategy helping GameStop stock? A significant pullback in GameStop stock this morning suggests the company’s Bitcoin strategy is failing to excite investors the way it does those invested in MicroStrategy. Part of the reason could be that MSTR started buying BTC when it was trading at less than $12,000. In comparison, GME is loading up on the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap when it already sits near all-time highs of $111,000. For investors, this may be concerning since buying Bitcoin at an already elevated price could mean a significantly muted return than what MicroStrategy has been able to generate for its shareholders in recent years. Note that GameStop shares do not currently pay a dividend to incentivize ownership, either. Wedbush says GME’s crypto strategy makes no sense According to Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, the company that’s often referred to as the original meme stock lacks a clear strategy to revitalise its core video game business. Still, GME shares continue to thrive due to “the existence of greater fools willing to pay more than twice its asset value for its shares.” In his research note to clients, Pachter went on to argue that GameStop’s crypto strategy doesn’t make sense in the first place, given it’s “already trading at 2.4x cash, making it unlikely that converting more cash to crypto will drive an even greater premium.” Considering fundamentals and valuation metrics tied to GME stock, investors are better off parking their capital directly in Bitcoin or a BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), he concluded. Should you invest in GME shares today? GameStop stock remains unattractive also because it recently reported a year-over-year decline in net sales for its first quarter. The gaming merchandise retailer generated about $732 million in net sales, down significantly from $882 million in the same quarter last year. Investors should also note that not a lot of Wall Street analysts cover GME shares anymore. Those who do, on average, have a sell rating on the NYSE-listed firm and find it fairly valued at about $13.50 in 2025.

2025-06-12T15:06:43,"Why South Africa May Leapfrog the World in Bitcoin Adoption: Interview With VALR CMO Ben Caselin","As the global crypto landscape matures, Africa is undoubtedly emerging as one of the hottest regions to watch – where regulatory clarity, grasroots adoption, and institutional interest are starting to covnerge. Positioning itself at the centr of this transformation, VALR is a Johannesburg-based exchange that’s now leading the continent in terms of trading volumes. In the following interview, Ben Caselin, the Chief Marketing Officer at VALR, as well as a veteran of crypto hubs such as Hong Kong and Dubai, shares his perspective on the state of Bitcoin adoption in underserved communities, the evolving role of decentralized finance, and why integrity as opposed to hype may be crypto’s biggest asset. How would you characterize the current state of the cryptocurrency market in South Africa, and what unique challenges or opportunities does it present? The South African market for crypto has come a long way and is well-positioned to see more growth in the coming years. Crypto adoption, particularly around stablecoins and Bitcoin, is taking place at all levels of society. There are numerous projects driving the uptake of Bitcoin in townships and among communities who have for too long been excluded from the traditional financial system. At the same time, we have seen pronounced institutional interest in crypto assets, from companies adding Bitcoin to their treasuries and remittance companies looking to leverage stablecoin infrastructure, to banks looking into expanding their services to accommodate for crypto. With regulatory frameworks evolving globally, how is VALR navigating the changing regulatory landscape in South Africa and other markets where you’re expanding? In South Africa, already for years, VALR has closely worked with the country’s regulator, the FSCA, and we maintain healthy communication channels. In my view, South Africa’s regulatory regime is among the world’s foremost, perhaps even better than those in places like Singapore or Hong Kong. We do also have approval, through Poland, to offer crypto services in the European Union, but regulatory developments in Europe have been somewhat constrained. We continue to follow such developments closely. At the same time, we are exploring other licenses that can make it easier for VALR to pursue global expansion. What trends are you observing around institutional adoption of crypto in South Africa and across the African continent? In South Africa, especially since the FSCA’s licensing regime has come into effect, we have seen interest from a range of financial services providers looking to expand their offerings to their customers. We are partnering with several remittance companies, where VALR provides the necessary infrastructure and liquidity and, similarly, we are closely working with some of the largest banks in Africa to assist them in expanding their services to include crypto as well. We are not yet in a position to give any more information, but we do expect to make announcements around these developments in the next few months. I believe that within the next two to three years, we will see most major banks in Africa offer access to bitcoin and USD-pegged stablecoins to their customers, and all major remittance companies leverage crypto infrastructure to optimise for cross-border payments. How does VALR approach the integration or support of decentralized finance (DeFi) within its ecosystem, and what role do you see DeFi playing in Africa’s financial future? We hold the view that DeFi is here to stay, but also that from a user experience perspective, DeFi is not for everyone. On VALR, we have recently launched ‘DeFi Lending’, making it very easy for customers to earn a yield on their stablecoins and tokens by lending out their assets on platforms like Aave, without actually having to leave the VALR platform at all. This is one of the ways in which we are working to make crypto accessible to more and more people from all walks of life. What specific measures does VALR take to ensure the security of customer assets and data, particularly given the rise in cyber threats targeting exchanges? VALR takes security very seriously. We have a strong and pro-active security team who monitors activities at all levels of operation. We also work with external security firms for regular penetration testing, and constantly tighten security based on evolving threats. Other than that, we don’t share details about the specific measures we take. How do you balance innovation and compliance in a space that is constantly evolving and often ahead of regulation? We strive to balance innovation and compliance through communication. We are law-abiding, we don’t go where we are not welcome, and we believe that being compliant is the surest way to protect customers over the long term. We are also relatively conservative when it comes to token listings and leveraged trading and even our marketing spend is measured. We aim to establish VALR as a trusted financial institution that can be around for decades. Perhaps most importantly, VALR is a values-driven organisation, which means that we never compromise on our values for the sake of profit. Instead, we believe that principles like truthfulness, integrity and service set us up for long-term growth and will guide us well into the future. As VALR expands internationally, how do you plan to maintain trust, transparency, and alignment with local financial and legal standards across jurisdictions? From day one, which is now over 7 years ago, VALR has upheld the highest standards of integrity – this makes it easier for us to obtain licenses as they become available around the world, since we are compliant by default. In other words, unlike some of our competitors, we don’t go around breaking rules and then proceed to get our act together as regulation takes shape. Instead, forfeiting superficial growth we take a gradual approach to global expansion and prioritise doing so in a safe and sustainable manner. This has worked well for VALR and continues to be our approach into the future.

2025-06-12T15:05:54,"Crypto approaching systemic risk territory, FSB's Knot fires warning","Risk from crypto assets may soon threaten the global financial system, the outgoing Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot warned. Speaking in Madrid on Thursday, Knot said that until now, crypto did not pose a systemic risk . However, recent developments are changing that. “At the FSB, we have long maintained that crypto does not yet pose a systemic risk, but recent developments suggest we may be approaching a tipping point,” he said. He pointed out that stablecoin issuers now hold large sums of US Treasuries, a development he called “a segment we must monitor closely.” Stablecoins, unlike Bitcoin or other crypto tokens whose prices swing wildly, are meant to stay pegged at one dollar each. They are now under the microscope in the US Congress, where lawmakers are preparing the first major rules for digital assets. At the same time, several European Central Bank officials have voiced worries about the risks these tokens could create. ECB says that crypto can cause financial instability In its May Financial Stability Review, the ECB highlighted growing dangers from crypto assets such as stablecoins. It noted that the rising values of these digital tokens and their deeper ties to traditional banks and markets could add to financial instability. Knot, who also heads the Dutch central bank, stressed that making it easier for everyday investors to buy crypto has increased links with the financial system. “Barriers for retail users have dropped significantly, particularly with the introduction of crypto ETFs; the interlinkages with the traditional financial system continue to grow,” he said. He added that as the crypto world changes, “so must our regulatory frameworks.” Knot’s terms at both the FSB and the Dutch central bank end on June 30. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey will succeed him at the FSB, but the Dutch government has yet to name someone to lead its central bank. Knot’s remarks came a day after the US Senate voted to move forward with a bill that would set up official rules for stablecoins. The motion to end debate on an updated version of the GENIUS Act passed with overwhelming support: eighteen Democrats joined almost all Republicans in voting to advance the bill. Before the GENIUS Act can become law, it needs a few more votes in the Senate and then approval in the House. Senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming told The Hill on Tuesday that she expects the Senate to hold a final vote on the bill next week. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Bitcoin’s price posted a minor recovery after Trump’s statement started to circulate online, going from its intraday bottom of under $107,000 to almost $108,000. BREAKING: PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS THEY ARE WORKING TO PASS MORE PRO #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO POLICIES VERY BULLISH! pic.twitter.com/UqHdV7t789 — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) June 12, 2025 Trump outlined in his statement that his administration ended Biden’s war on crypto on Day 1, which included replacing the former SEC Chair, Gary Gensler, with Paul Atkins. Recall that the US securities watchdog dropped countless lawsuits against numerous crypto companies in the past few months, including Kraken, Binance, Coinbase, and many others. Consequently, Trump’s administration “unleashed” American innovators to do what they do best – lead the technology world. The POTUS also outlined all positive developments that the industry experienced in the past few months, including the national Bitcoin reserve , the digital asset stockpile, and the upcoming GENIUS stablecoin bill. Additionally, Trump noted that they will continue working to create “clear and simple market frameworks that will allow America to dominate the future of crypto and Bitcoin.” BTC’s price jumped by around a grand in the past several minutes, perhaps driven by the renewed hype from the US President. Nevertheless, the asset remains around 4% away from its all-time high, registered on May 22, and is slightly down on the day as well. BTCUSD.

2025-06-12T15:00:00,"Crypto for Advisors: The Relationship Between Bitcoin and Altcoins","In today’s Crypto for Advisors, Gregory Mall , chief investment officer from Lionsoul Global, writes about bitcoin’s current rally, and how it historically has and could potentially impact altcoins. Then, Kevin Tam looks at crypto trends, 13-F filings and institutional adoption in Ask an Expert. – Sarah Morton Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Bitcoin's Breakout — Is the Altcoin Rally Next? On May 22, bitcoin (BTC) marked a historic moment, reaching a new all-time high, briefly surpassing the levels seen earlier this year. While prices have since consolidated, BTC remains within striking distance of its all-time high — a feat achieved despite lingering macro uncertainties, low trading volumes, and general market skepticism. Meanwhile, most altcoins remain far from their respective all-time highs. As of early June, Ethereum (ETH) is still about 20% below its November 2021 peak, and Solana (SOL) sits more than 30% below its former highs. This divergence highlights what some market observers are calling the ""most hated rally""—a quiet, low-participation surge in bitcoin that caught many off guard. What Drove the BTC Rally? Three key factors contributed to the recent BTC breakout: Central Bank Optimism: Futures markets suggest that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve are likely in the second half of 2025, with the eurozone even further ahead—now on its seventh consecutive rate cut. This easing backdrop has revived risk appetite across assets, particularly among institutional allocators. With tariff fears in the rearview mirror, the overall inflationary outlook has significantly improved in recent weeks. Institutional Inflows : Spot bitcoin ETFs, approved earlier this year, continue to absorb flows. While daily volumes have tapered from launch-week highs, net inflows have remained consistently positive, particularly from fee-sensitive RIA and private wealth channels. Year to date, cumulative inflows exceed $16 billion, with May recording the largest inflow this year. At the same time, MicroStrategy and other companies have continued to pile corporate treasury assets into bitcoin. Easing Political Risks: Fading tariff tensions and improving global trade sentiment helped stabilize broader markets, allowing risk assets like bitcoin to resume their upward trend. Despite these tailwinds, the rally occurred on relatively thin volumes. BTC Dominance Rising — But History Rhymes Bitcoin dominance — the percentage of total crypto market cap made up by BTC — has now climbed above 54%, up from about 38% in late 2022. Historically, BTC dominance peaks before altcoins begin to outperform. During the 2017 and 2021 cycles, altcoin rallies lagged the BTC all-time highs by two to six months. Source: TradingView If history holds, the rotation from bitcoin into altcoins may already be underway. ether's recent outperformance — posting an 81% rally since its April lows — is a sign that sentiment is starting to spill over from bitcoin to the altcoin market. Altcoin Season Ahead? While the term ""altseason"" is often thrown around carelessly, there are some real indicators worth watching: Institutional Broadening: Allocators who entered BTC via ETFs are now evaluating broader exposure. Equal-weight or smart beta indexes that offer diversified exposure to Layer 1s, DeFi, and infrastructure tokens are gaining traction. L1 Innovation and Narrative Cycles: Layer 1 ecosystems like Solana, Avalanche, and Near continue to develop real throughput improvements, which are increasingly relevant as user demand for on-chain activity returns. DeFi Resurgence: As of early June 2025, the total value locked in DeFi protocols has surpassed $117 billion, marking a significant recovery from the April slump. According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked across all DeFi pools has increased by 31% since its April lows. Risk Rotation: In traditional markets, as the bull market matures, investors rotate from large caps to small/mid caps. Crypto is no different. Bitcoin may be the starting point, but not the end. A Word of Caution Although there are significant diversification benefits associated with crypto investing, it is also fair to say that crypto is still behaving largely as a risk-on asset class. As highlighted by the latest OECD report, the global economic landscape is becoming increasingly fragile. Heightened trade restrictions, tighter credit conditions, declining business and consumer confidence, and persistent policy uncertainty are all weighing on growth prospects and increasing the risks of a sell-off of speculative assets that includes crypto. Key Takeaways for Advisors Expect Rotation: If prior cycles are a guide, altcoins may lag BTC but tend to rally with a delay. Advisors should consider this when rebalancing portfolios. Diversification Matters: Equal-weight crypto baskets or thematic exposures (e.g., Layer 1s, DeFi) may help capture upside without betting on a single asset. Stay Objective: While price action often drives client interest, fundamentals — from network activity to developer momentum — should remain the north star for allocation decisions. Bitcoin's new all-time high is certainly a milestone. However, it may also be a signal: the next phase of the cycle could belong to the broader crypto asset class. Advisors who understand the timing and mechanics of market rotations are best positioned to guide clients through the next leg.

A: This recent quarters 13F filing reveal that Montreal based Trans-Canada Capital has made notable investments in digital assets. They manage the pension assets for Air Canada, as one of the largest corporate pensions plans Canada. The pension fund added $55 million in spot bitcoin ETF. Institutional adoption of bitcoin has accelerated over the past year, driven by clearer regulatory guidance, the launch of spot ETFs and increasing recognition of bitcoin as a strategic asset. Schedule 1 banks in Canada are holding more than $137 million in bitcoin exchange traded funds, underscoring growing institutional demand and long-term positioning. Q: How might institutional accumulation affect bitcoin’s market dynamic? A: Last year ETFs bought approximately 500,000 bitcoin, while the network produced 164,250 new bitcoins through its proof of work consensus. This means ETF demand alone was three times higher than the newly minted supply. Additionally, public and private corporations purchased 250,000 bitcoin. As governments consider including bitcoin in their strategic reserve, other entities are exploring adding bitcoin to their corporate treasury . Q: How will the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) greenlighting retail access to crypto exchange-traded notes (ETNs) in the UK accelerate the retail & institutional adoption? A: This marks an important moment for in crypto products in the retail market as asset class that reflects a broader shift in the UK’s regulatory stance toward digital assets. It is a complete reversal from a 2020 decision when the FCA banned crypto exchange trades notes. ETNs will need to be traded on an FCA-approved investment exchanges. The UK is shifting its approach to crypto as the government seeks to grow the economy and support a digital assets industry. They are sending a strong signal to institutional investors that the UK is positioning itself as a competitor player in the global crypto market. - Kevin Tam Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Keep Reading The Digital Asset Month in Review for May provides highlights and insights on global crypto ETFs/ETPs.
