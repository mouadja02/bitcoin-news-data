2025-06-12T10:54:08,"How Much Bitcoin (BTC) Are Institutional Investors Holding? Here Are the Latest Surprising Figures…","Bitcoin (BTC) purchases have increased, led by the largest institutional bull, MicroStrategy (Strategy). In recent months, many companies, including US giant GameStop, have purchased BTC for the first time. A study at this point revealed that approximately one-third of the Bitcoin supply is held in central institutions. According to recent research by Gemini and Glassnode, it was found that nearly a third (30.9%) of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, or approximately 6.1 million BTC, is held by institutions. These BTCs, worth $668 billion, are held in central treasuries, including governments, ETFs, and public companies. According to the report, these figures represent a 924% increase over the past decade, indicating that these organizations view Bitcoin as a strategic store of value. “As institutional adoption has increased, the price of Bitcoin has risen from below $1,000 to over $100,000 over the same period, reinforcing the thesis that institutions are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a strategic asset. “While Bitcoin remains a risky asset, its integration with traditional finance has made its price action more reliable and less susceptible to speculative excesses.” The Gemini and Glassnode research also found that sovereign treasury wallets move infrequently and show little correlation to Bitcoin’s price cycles. However, the report noted that there is enough BTC in government treasuries to influence its price, and that when Bitcoins are moved or sold, they can affect markets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-12T10:52:55,"Who controls Bitcoin? Just 216 entities now hold 30% of supply","Over 30% of Bitcoin ’s ( BTC ) circulating supply is now concentrated in the hands of just 216 centralized entities, according to the latest blockchain data from a Gemini and Glassnode report . The trend reflects both expanding institutional adoption and growing custodial centralization in the world’s largest cryptocurrency . The scale of this shift is striking. A decade ago, centralized exchanges collectively held just under 600,000 BTC for their users. Today the total amount of Bitcoin held across major institutional and custodial entities has surged to an estimated 6,145,207 BTC, a 924% increase over the past ten years. With this centralization comes as Bitcoin’s spot price continues to climb. Since early 2015, Bitcoin has risen from below $1,000 to now trading above $107,000, reinforcing its growing appeal as a strategic asset among large institutional players. The data spans 216 entities across six key categories: centralized exchanges, ETFs and funds, public companies, private companies, DeFi contracts, and governments. While the dataset is not exhaustive, it captures the most influential actors now collectively controlling nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s supply. The chart below shows this evolution visually. Exchanges (shown in orange) remain the dominant custodians of Bitcoin holdings, followed by ETFs and funds (yellow), with noticeable growth in holdings by private companies (blue) and governments (green) over the past two years. Public companies and DeFi contracts represent smaller but steadily growing segments of institutional Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin holdings by entity type. Source: Glassnode/Gemini What is driving this trend in centralized Bitcoin adoption? Several factors appear to be at play. First, the rise of regulated Bitcoin ETFs and funds in major markets like the US and Europe has enabled a broader class of institutional investors to gain exposure to BTC without managing private keys directly, which has contributed to the significant growth in custodial balances. Second, as Bitcoin matures as an asset class, public and private companies are increasingly adding BTC to their treasuries, both as a hedge against fiat debasement and as a long-term strategic reserve. Notable examples include MicroStrategy, Tesla , and a growing number of smaller firms. Third, government holdings, once negligible, have begun to climb. While still small in absolute terms, several governments now report seized BTC balances or have quietly added Bitcoin to their reserves. But this deepening institutional embrace comes with trade-offs. On one hand, greater participation by regulated entities enhances Bitcoin’s legitimacy and liquidity. On the other, it also increases custodial risk and undermines one of Bitcoin’s core principles: decentralized ownership. As exchanges and custodians aggregate ever larger portions of the total supply, systemic risks emerge. A significant security breach or regulatory action targeting a handful of these entities could trigger outsized impacts on the broader Bitcoin market. For now, the trajectory is clear. Institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, and the network’s original ideal of wide, sovereign individual ownership is giving way, at least in part, to a more centralized custody model.

2025-06-12T10:51:03,"Offering Free Rewards: 12 Best and Trustworthy Bitcoin Cloud Mining Platforms in 2025","Cloud mining has transformed cryptocurrency earning in 2025, letting users mine Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) without costly hardware or technical know-how. With platforms offering free bonuses, it’s easier than ever to dip into crypto mining and score daily passive income. But not all sites are created equal—some shine with security, transparency, and high returns, while others fall short. After digging into the market, here’s a detailed rundown of the top 12 cloud mining sites with free bonuses, starting with the standout QFSCOIN and covering HashFly, Richminer, Hartcoin, JU Miner, XYminers, Blockchain Cloud Mining, 35Global (Global Mining), BJ Mining, APT Miner, Winner Mining, and Cryptomining Firm. Let’s explore why these platforms are your best bet for daily BTC, LTC, and DOGE earnings. 1.QFSCOIN: The King of Cloud Mining Since its launch in 2019 in Minnesota, USA, QFSCOIN has set the bar for cloud mining, regulated by U.S. financial authorities. With data centers in the U.S., Canada, Norway, and Iceland, it uses AI-driven tech to mine BTC, LTC, and DOGE efficiently, tapping low-cost, eco-friendly energy in cold climates. QFSCOIN’s killer feature is its free $30 signup bonus, fueling a one-day contract with a 3% return—$0.90 in 24 hours. It’s a no-risk entry, ideal for beginners or cautious investors. QFSCOIN’s platform is slick and simple, with daily automated payouts, no electricity or maintenance fees, and top-notch security via SSL encryption and DDoS protection. Its affiliate program pays up to 3% commission, and 24/7 support keeps users covered. Top Features Commission of up to 3% via the affiliate program. Enhanced security with SSL and DDoS protection. Daily automated payouts. Free mining package available. A wide range of cryptocurrency contracts. 24/7 customer support. No additional costs for electricity. $30 registration bonus . Available Packages Contract Price Contract Term Fixed Return Daily Rate $30 (Free) 1 Day $30 + $0.90 3.00% $100 2 Days $100 + $5 2.50% $300 2 Days $300 + $19.2 3.20% $1,200 3 Days $1,200 + $144 4.00% $3,500 3 Days $3,500 + $630 6.00% $10,000 6 Days $10,000 + $5,400 9.00% Website: https://qfscoin.com Twitter: https://x.com/qfscoin YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@qfscoin 2.HashFly: Reliable but No Free Lunch HashFly boasts a global user base of over a million, offering cloud mining for BTC, LTC, and other coins without hardware hassles. Its interface is beginner-friendly, but unlike QFSCOIN, there’s no free $30 bonus—its “free” plan often requires a small deposit, starting at $50. Payouts are steady but not always daily, and maintenance fees can chip away at profits. Security includes encryption but lacks QFSCOIN’s SSL/DDoS duo. HashFly’s a solid mid-tier choice, but QFSCOIN’s free entry, higher ROI (up to 9% daily), and U.S. regulation steal the show. 3.Richminer: High Costs, Low Trust Richminer offers BTC and LTC mining but demands steep upfront investments, with contracts starting at $200 and no free bonus. Its platform claims daily payouts, but user reviews highlight delays and hidden fees. Security is murky, with no clear mention of SSL or DDoS protection, and there’s no regulatory oversight, raising red flags. Compared to QFSCOIN’s free $30 trial, transparent 6% daily return on $3,500, and U.S.-backed trust, Richminer feels like a gamble for serious miners. 4.Hartcoin: Green but Pricey Hartcoin stands out with its renewable energy-powered mining for BTC and ETH, appealing to eco-conscious users. Contracts start at $150, with no free bonus, but daily payouts and strong encryption keep it competitive. However, it lacks U.S. regulation and supports fewer coins than QFSCOIN’s BTC, LTC, and DOGE lineup. Hartcoin’s green focus is cool, but QFSCOIN’s free $30 deal, no-fee structure, and higher returns (like $5,400 in six days on $10,000) make it more accessible and profitable. 5.JU Miner: Small and Shaky JU Miner is a smaller platform focusing on BTC mining, with contracts starting at $100 and no free trial. Its interface is clunky, and payouts can take days, with returns around 1.8% daily—far below QFSCOIN’s 9% on high-tier plans. Security is basic, with no SSL or DDoS specifics, and there’s no regulation. JU Miner’s lack of scale and transparency can’t compete with QFSCOIN’s global data centers, AI tech, and free $30 entry for daily DOGE earnings. 6.XYminers: Limited and Risky XYminers supports BTC and DOGE mining but offers no free bonus, with plans starting at $120. Its platform is sleek but lacks regulatory backing, and security details are thin—think basic encryption, no DDoS protection. Payouts are weekly, not daily, and returns hover at 1.5% daily. QFSCOIN’s U.S. regulation, daily payouts, and free $30 contract delivering $0.90 in 24 hours make XYminers a tough sell for BTC or LTC miners. 7.Blockchain Cloud Mining: Opaque and Dodgy Blockchain Cloud Mining promises BTC and DOGE mining but falls flat on trust. Contracts start at $200, with no free bonus, and payouts are inconsistent, often delayed by days. Security is a weak link—no SSL, DDoS protection, or regulation, fueling scam concerns. QFSCOIN’s daily payouts, AI-driven efficiency, and U.S.-regulated platform with a free $30 trial outshine this risky option by miles. 8.35Global (Global Mining): Vague Value 35Global, or Global Mining, offers BTC and LTC mining but lacks a free bonus, with contracts starting at $100. Its ROI details are fuzzy, and there’s no regulatory oversight. Security is average, with basic encryption but no DDoS defenses. Payouts are weekly, and returns top out at 2% daily. QFSCOIN’s transparent plans—like $144 in three days on $1,200 at 4% daily—and free $30 bonus make 35Global a weaker contender. 9.BJ Mining: Generic and Underwhelming BJ Mining focuses on BTC mining with contracts starting at $150 and no free trial. Its platform is barebones, with slow payouts and modest returns—around 1.6% daily. Security is minimal, and there’s no regulation, making it less trustworthy. QFSCOIN’s free $30 deal, daily payouts, and high-yield options (like 9% daily on $10,000) leave BJ Mining in the dust for DOGE or LTC mining. 10.APT Miner: Barely Competitive APT Miner offers BTC mining with contracts starting at $100, but there’s no free bonus. Its interface is outdated, and payouts are weekly, with returns around 1.7% daily. Security details are scarce, with no SSL or DDoS protection mentioned. QFSCOIN’s U.S.-regulated platform, free $30 trial, and 3% to 9% daily returns make APT Miner a forgettable choice for daily crypto earnings. 11.Winner Mining: Inconsistent Returns Winner Mining supports BTC and LTC but struggles with reliability. Contracts start at $200, with no free bonus, and payouts can lag, with returns around 2% daily. Security is decent but lacks QFSCOIN’s SSL/DDoS firepower, and there’s no regulation. QFSCOIN’s free $30 contract, daily payouts, and up to $630 in three days on $3,500 make Winner Mining a less appealing option. 12.Cryptomining Firm: Generic and Risky Cryptomining Firm claims to mine BTC and LTC but offers no free bonus, with contracts starting at $250. Its platform lacks transparency, with delayed payouts and hidden fees. Security is questionable, with no regulatory backing or SSL/DDoS details. QFSCOIN’s free $30 trial, U.S. regulation, and clear ROI—like $19.2 in two days on $300 at 3.2% daily—make Cryptomining Firm a risky bet. Why QFSCOIN Takes the Crown QFSCOIN leads the pack with its free $30 bonus, letting users mine BTC, LTC, or DOGE without upfront costs—a feature missing from HashFly, Hartcoin, and others. Its U.S. regulation, SSL/DDoS protection, and AI-driven mining ensure trust and efficiency, unlike unregulated platforms like Blockchain Cloud Mining or XYminers. Daily payouts and no fees outpace Richminer’s delays and Winner Mining’s costs. QFSCOIN’s contracts, from $30 to $10,000 with up to 9% daily returns, crush JU Miner’s 1.8% or BJ Mining’s 1.6% rates. For newbies, QFSCOIN’s $30 bonus and easy setup make mining a breeze. For pros, its high-yield plans and 3% affiliate program unlock serious profits. Compared to 35Global’s vague terms or Cryptomining Firm’s risks, QFSCOIN’s transparency and track record since 2019 shine. To start, visit QFSCOIN’s site, sign up with your email, grab your $30 bonus, and pick a contract. Mine BTC for value, LTC for speed, or DOGE for buzz—QFSCOIN’s the trusted way to earn daily in 2025.

2025-06-12T10:48:44,"Fed Rate Cuts May Fuel Massive Crypto Rally—Altseason on the Horizon","The post Fed Rate Cuts May Fuel Massive Crypto Rally—Altseason on the Horizon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A popular crypto analyst predicts a massive surge in Bitcoin and altcoins as the U.S. Federal Reserve is now 99.9% likely to cut interest rates this month. Crypto trader and market analyst Cyclop believes the rate cut could push Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $130,000 , followed by a large-cap altcoin rally and the start of a full-blown altseason. However, he cautions that short-term volatility is likely during this period. Fed Rate Cut Almost Certain According to Cyclop, current market indicators show a 99.9% probability that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates in June 2025. Recent U.S. economic data supports this claim: May CPI rose to 321.465, up from 320.795 in April. Inflation rate increased slightly from 2.3% to 2.4%, still below the 3% mark in January. The unemployment rate has remained stable at 4.2% for the past three months. Why Rate Cuts Are Bullish for Crypto Historically, interest rate cuts have been bullish catalysts for crypto markets. Lower rates boost liquidity, reduce borrowing costs, and encourage risk-on investment behavior, leading to: Bitcoin price surges Capital flowing into large-cap altcoins The start of altseason “Cheaper borrowing and rising liquidity create a perfect storm for crypto rallies,” notes Cyclop. Past Rate Cuts and Bitcoin Price Trends In early 2023 , after a significant rate cut, Bitcoin surged by over 20% within weeks. But not all rate cuts guarantee bullish outcomes. In 2024, a minor 25 basis point cut led to a 6% drop in BTC shortly after, highlighting the importance of broader macro conditions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? DJT, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Slide Trigger Panic in Crypto , 3 Key Triggers for Bitcoin Bull Run According to Cyclop, the bullish impact of a Fed rate cut on Bitcoin and altcoins will depend on three key conditions: Inflation drops closer to 2% Unemployment rises above 4.3%-4.4% Clarity around Trump’s proposed tariffs Currently, inflation is at 2.4%, and unemployment sits at 4.2%. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs are still being reviewed by a U.S. appeals court. A final decision is expected after July 31, but reports hint at a potential deal with China on rare earths and new tariff agreements with other nations. Bitcoin and Altseason Price Forecast If these conditions align with the Fed rate cut, Cyclop sees Bitcoin climbing to $130,000 in 2025. He also predicts that altseason could peak in November or December. However, he warns that short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, even if long-term sentiment remains bullish. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Slightly rising inflation (2.4%) and stable unemployment (4.2%) below key thresholds suggest the Fed might proceed with rate cuts. This is generally bullish for crypto as it encourages risk-on investment behavior due to increased liquidity. What are the risks of short-term volatility during a potential rate cut rally? Despite bullish long-term predictions, rate cuts often induce short-term volatility. This is due to profit-taking, leveraged positions being wiped out, and uncertainty around market expectations, leading to rapid price swings. Could upcoming trade negotiations with China affect the crypto bullish trend? Yes, clarity around Trump’s proposed tariffs and any potential trade deals with China (especially on rare earths) could significantly influence the crypto market. Positive resolutions tend to support risk assets like crypto by reducing global economic uncertainty.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/fed-rate-cuts-may-fuel-massive-crypto-rally-altseason-on-the-horizon/,"ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Crypto news",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T10:48:40,"Market indices and crypto extend dip as traders ignore US inflation and trade relief","Stocks dropped again Thursday morning as traders ignored fresh inflation data and signs of trade relief between Washington and Beijing, choosing instead to exit risk across the board. S&P 500 futures slid 0.37%, Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.29%, and Dow futures fell by 257 points, or 0.6%. The losses came after a weak Wednesday session, where the S&P 500 broke a three-day streak and closed down 0.3%, with the Nasdaq Composite also shedding 0.5%. The Dow was basically flat. The index is now more than 2% below its all-time high from late February, stalling any momentum toward another record. Traders didn’t wait for Thursday’s Producer Price Index before selling. The monthly inflation read for May was expected at 8:30 a.m. ET, with forecasts from Dow Jones calling for a 0.2% rise in headline prices and a 0.3% bump in core PPI, which excludes food and energy. But the market didn’t care. Positioning was already defensive, with investors reacting to other developments and treating the PPI release like background noise. Dollar weakens as global tensions push traders to safe havens The dollar was already slipping when markets opened, hitting its lowest level since April—a point that also marked its lowest value in three years. According to Dow Jones, it has now lost 10% against a basket of currencies in 2025 alone. Middle East risks and doubts around the strength of the current U.S.–China trade truce pushed investors toward safer currencies. The Swiss franc and Japanese yen gained, each up 0.6% against the dollar. European stocks joined the slide. The STOXX 600 index dropped 0.8%, with airlines and automakers taking the biggest hits as rising oil prices weighed on the sector. Meanwhile, global equities eased after a relentless rally that started in early April. The MSCI All-Country World Index dipped 0.1%, just under its record high from the previous day. Inside the U.S., recent tariff policy from President Donald Trump continued rattling investors. His erratic approach to trade has caused widespread dumping of U.S. assets, especially the dollar, as people brace for higher prices and slower growth. The euro gained from the dollar’s slump, reaching a seven-week high and sitting at $1.1535 during the session. Gold holds near highs, crypto falls, treasuries rally Gold held strong as traders avoided risk. Spot gold climbed 0.2% to $3,367.33 an ounce, reaching its highest point since June 5. Investors looked for direction from the PPI report and weighed the chances of a Fed rate cut later this year. “Gold remains stuck… with a break above $3,400 needed to change that. Near term focus (is) on Middle East developments, the dollar and speculation about the timing of the next U.S. rate cut,” said Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank’s head of commodity strategy. Crypto moved lower in step with tech and growth names. Bitcoin gave up earlier gains to $109K and is now struggling to stay above $107k, and altcoins followed as rate expectations kept changing. Source: TradingView Other metals were mixed. Silver dropped 0.8% to $35.94 an ounce, while platinum rose 0.3% to $1,260.14, hovering near a four-year high. Palladium was down 1.9%, trading at $1,059.25. U.S. government bonds rallied as cash flowed into safer ground. 10-year Treasury yields fell 1.5 basis points, sinking below 4.4%, while 2-year yields, which react more quickly to inflation outlooks, slid 1.6 basis points to 3.93%. That rally confirmed what traders were showing with their feet: they weren’t convinced by low inflation, trade optimism, or any of the day’s usual signals. They were bracing for whatever comes next.

2025-06-12T10:40:31,"Altcoin Season Index at 29: Crucial Insights for Navigating Bitcoin Season","Are you tracking the ever-shifting landscape of the cryptocurrency market? One key metric many investors watch is the Altcoin Season Index . This index provides a snapshot of whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are generally outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. Understanding this can offer crucial insights into the current crypto market cycle and help inform your investing in altcoins strategy. Recently, the Altcoin Season Index, a metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 29 at 00:30 UTC on June 12. This marked a slight increase from the previous day but firmly places the market in what is commonly known as Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this number mean for your portfolio? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is designed to give investors a simple way to gauge market sentiment and performance trends between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. Here’s a quick breakdown of how it works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. It specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus on organic price movements. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days. The index ranges from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining the ‘season’ is quite specific: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically high (above 75). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically low (below 25). Scores between 25 and 75 suggest a transitional or undefined period, sometimes called ‘Neither Season’. With the index currently sitting at 29, it clearly signals that the market is experiencing Bitcoin Season . This means that, on average, Bitcoin has been the dominant performer compared to a vast majority of the top altcoins over the last three months. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market? When the market is in Bitcoin Season , it often indicates a few potential scenarios or trends: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors may be moving capital towards Bitcoin, perceived as a safer or more established asset within the crypto space, especially during periods of uncertainty or consolidation. Bitcoin Dominance Growth: Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization tends to increase. Slower Altcoin Growth: While some individual altcoins may still perform well, the broad altcoin market generally lags behind Bitcoin. Accumulation Phase for Altcoins: Some investors view Bitcoin Season as an opportunity to accumulate altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin before the next shift in the crypto market cycle . Understanding that we are currently in Bitcoin Season , as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index at 29, is fundamental for setting realistic expectations for your portfolio’s performance. Why Do We Have Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season? These distinct periods are part of the natural ebb and flow of the crypto market cycle . While there’s no single cause, several factors contribute to these shifts: Market Psychology: During bull markets, initial capital often flows into Bitcoin first. As confidence grows and profits are realized in Bitcoin, investors may rotate those profits into altcoins seeking higher, faster returns (leading to Altcoin Season ). Conversely, during downturns or sideways markets, investors might retreat to the perceived safety of Bitcoin (leading to Bitcoin Season ). Liquidity: Bitcoin is the most liquid cryptocurrency. Large institutional money often enters through Bitcoin. This dominance in liquidity and institutional interest can drive Bitcoin’s price performance ahead of altcoins. Technological Developments and Narratives: Specific upgrades (like Bitcoin halving events or major network updates) or compelling narratives can drive interest and investment into either Bitcoin or specific altcoin sectors, influencing the season. Global Macro Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rates, and regulatory news can impact investor risk appetite, influencing whether they favor the perceived stability of Bitcoin or the higher potential returns (and risks) of altcoins. Investing in Altcoins During Bitcoin Season: Challenges and Opportunities Being in Bitcoin Season presents a unique environment for those interested in investing in altcoins . It’s not necessarily a time to avoid altcoins entirely, but it requires a different approach. Challenges: Underperformance: The most obvious challenge is that, on average, your altcoin holdings are likely to underperform Bitcoin during this period. Higher Risk: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can be more volatile and susceptible to larger price drops when the overall market sentiment is weak or focused on Bitcoin. Longer Recovery: If the market experiences a downturn, altcoins often take longer than Bitcoin to recover their previous highs. Opportunities: Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be an excellent time to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. This allows you to build positions for the next potential Altcoin Season . Research and Due Diligence: With less hype, this period provides a calmer environment to research projects, understand their fundamentals, technology, and team without the distraction of parabolic price movements. Spotting Outliers: Even in Bitcoin Season, some altcoins might perform well due to specific news, developments, or sector trends. Diligent research can help identify these potential outliers. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Implementing a DCA strategy during Bitcoin Season can be effective, allowing you to buy into altcoins consistently regardless of short-term price fluctuations, potentially lowering your average entry price. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Season Given the Altcoin Season Index is at 29, indicating Bitcoin Season , here are some actionable steps you might consider for your investing in altcoins strategy: Prioritize Research: Deep dive into the fundamentals of altcoin projects you’re interested in. Look beyond price charts at their use case, technology, team, tokenomics, and community. Consider Your Allocation: Re-evaluate your portfolio allocation. You might choose to hold a larger percentage in Bitcoin during this phase, or maintain a specific altcoin allocation with the understanding they may lag BTC. Focus on Quality: During less speculative periods, focus on established altcoins with strong use cases, proven technology, and active development. Set Realistic Expectations: Understand that broad, explosive gains across the altcoin market are less likely during Bitcoin Season. Focus on long-term potential rather than short-term pumps. Use Limit Orders: If accumulating, consider using limit orders to buy altcoins at specific price points you’ve identified through analysis. Stay Informed: Keep tracking the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. Shifts can happen, and being aware allows you to adapt your strategy. Remember, the index is just one tool. It provides a broad overview but doesn’t predict the future or guarantee the performance of any single altcoin. Market conditions can change rapidly. The Crypto Market Cycle is Dynamic The shift between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is a natural part of the dynamic crypto market cycle . Periods of Bitcoin dominance often lay the groundwork for the next altcoin surge, and vice versa. By understanding the current phase, as indicated by metrics like the Altcoin Season Index , investors can approach the market more strategically. Being in Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean the end for altcoins; it simply means the current market dynamics favor Bitcoin’s performance. For those looking to build or strengthen their altcoin positions, this period could offer valuable opportunities for accumulation before the market potentially shifts again. Summary: Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 29, confirming that the market is in Bitcoin Season . This means that over the past 90 days, Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins. While this presents challenges for broad altcoin performance, it also offers opportunities for strategic investing in altcoins , particularly through careful research, accumulation, and managing expectations within the current crypto market cycle . Stay informed and adapt your strategy as the market evolves.

2025-06-12T10:35:53,"Spot Ethereum ETFs Outshine Bitcoin with $240M Daily Flow","Spot Ethereum ETFs have outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts, raking in $240 million in net daily inflows on Wednesday, June 11. This figure eclipsed the $164 million flowing into BTC ETFs, marking the first time Ethereum products have led daily inflows since the launch of U.S. spot crypto ETFs 18 months ago. Ethereum Breaks Through The shift, hailed by analysts and echoed across social media, is seen by some as a potential turning point in institutional crypto adoption, fueled by unique catalysts driving capital towards the second-largest digital asset. “As far as I can remember, this is the first time this has happened,” noted prominent crypto commentator CryptoMe in a post on X, highlighting the historic nature of the flows. Data compiled by SoSoValue shows a consistent trend building over recent weeks. Ethereum ETFs have now enjoyed 18 consecutive days of net inflows, culminating in the near-record $240.29 million haul. The crypto-linked investment products now boast $3.74 billion in cumulative net inflows, $830.98 million in total daily trading volume, and $11.05 billion in net assets, making up roughly 3.25% of Ethereum’s market cap. The top performer, BlackRock’s ETHA, contributed just over $163 million on June 11 alone and leads all Ethereum ETFs with $5.13 billion in cumulative inflows. In comparison, while still dominant in absolute terms, spot BTC ETFs appear to be facing diminishing momentum. Despite some $45 billion in cumulative inflows and almost $132 billion in assets under management (AUM), net inflows have softened over the past week. After a mid-week rally on June 10, where the ETFs brought in $431.12 million, flows tapered off, dropping to $164.57 million on June 11. Even BlackRock’s flagship IBIT, which recently shattered records by becoming the fastest ETF in history to surpass $70 billion in AUM, is now experiencing moderated daily volumes, down to $1.89 billion yesterday. Regulatory Clarity, DeFi Potential Spark Inflows Market watchers have pointed to a combination of factors to explain Ethereum’s sudden surge in the spot ETF space. These include optimism in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector following recent remarks by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins directing the agency to explore rule amendments to accommodate on-chain financial systems. Other key drivers include a perception of ETH as an undervalued asset as well as institutional spillover from Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory clarity, particularly regarding Ethereum’s classification, appears to be easing institutional hesitancy. Furthermore, ETH’s stronger recent price performance, up 5.4% over the past week compared to BTC’s 2.9% gain, and 12% over the last month versus the king cryptocurrency’s 4.9%, is reinforcing the undervaluation narrative, especially with Bitcoin trading just 3.8% below its recent all-time high while Ethereum remains 43.5% below its peak.

2025-06-12T10:32:19,"Sweden’s H100 Group Soars 45% After $10.6M Raise to Expand Bitcoin Holdings","Swedish health tech firm H100 Group AB surged 45% on Wednesday after revealing it raised 101 million Swedish krona (approximately $10.6 million) to expand its Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company’s share price closed at 4.64 krona ($0.49) on the Nordic Growth Market exchange, continuing a meteoric rise of over 280% since first announcing its Bitcoin initiative on May 22, according to MarketWatch. This recent capital raise, significantly larger than its previous $2.2 million round led by prominent Bitcoin advocate Adam Back on May 25, signals the growing confidence of both investors and the firm in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. H100’s embrace of Bitcoin is part of a broader global trend, with over 126 publicly traded companies — 14 of them joining in the past three weeks — now holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . $10.6M Raise to Add More Bitcoin to Treasury The funding round was structured into two parts: a 69.65 million krona ($7.31 million) share issuance and 31.35 million krona ($3.29 million) in convertible loans. H100 said that the proceeds would be directed entirely toward accelerating its Bitcoin treasury strategy . Based on current market prices, the firm could use the funds to purchase an estimated 67.1 Bitcoin, increasing its total holdings to 81.85 BTC. Prominent investors in this round included Adam Back, UTXO Management, and regional investment firms such as Race Ventures Scandinavia and Crafoord Capital Partners. The convertible loans, which carry no interest, mature in five years and can be converted into equity at a price of 1.75 krona per share. Initially set at 21 million krona, the tranche was expanded to 31.35 million due to strong investor demand. H100 Introducing Bitcoin to Health Sector H100, which sells health and longevity tools aimed at helping individuals avoid dependency on conventional healthcare systems, sees philosophical alignment between its mission and Bitcoin’s core principles. CEO Sander Andersen noted this synergy in a May 22 statement, emphasizing values such as individual sovereignty and decentralization. “The values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community aligns well with the customers and communities we are building the H100 platform for,” Andersen said. With this bold move, the company becomes one of the few health-focused firms integrating Bitcoin into its financial framework.

2025-06-12T10:30:23,"Unveiling Crypto Fear and Greed Index: What 71 Means for Market Sentiment","Ever wondered what the collective mood of the cryptocurrency market is? Are investors feeling bullish and ready to buy, or are they panicking and looking to sell? That’s where tools like the Crypto Fear and Greed Index come in handy. It attempts to gauge the prevailing emotion driving the market, providing a snapshot of crypto market sentiment . As of June 12th, this index, provided by Alternative, registered a value of 71. While this is a slight dip of one point from the previous day, it firmly keeps the market mood anchored in the ‘Greed’ zone. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index So, what exactly is this index and why does it matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a simple yet insightful tool designed to visualize the two primary emotions that often influence investor behavior: fear and greed. In volatile markets like crypto, these emotions can be amplified, leading to irrational decisions. Here’s a quick breakdown of the index scale: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This indicates significant panic in the market. Investors are likely selling off assets, often irrationally. This could potentially be a buying opportunity for brave contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is still cautious or negative. Many investors are hesitant to buy. 50: Neutral – The market is balanced, with no strong leaning towards fear or greed. 51-74: Greed – This suggests investors are becoming overly optimistic and potentially overpaying for assets. While prices may still rise, this zone can signal increasing risk. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is likely experiencing a bubble-like euphoria. Prices may be unsustainably high, and a correction could be imminent. This is often considered a dangerous time to buy and potentially a good time to consider selling. A reading of 71, as we see now, places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ category. This means that despite a slight pullback in sentiment from the day before, the overall mood is one of optimism and bullishness among market participants. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: What Factors Influence the Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s calculated using a weighted average of several different data points, aiming to capture various aspects of crypto market sentiment . Understanding these factors helps provide a more complete picture: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility in a positive direction can indicate bullishness, while sharp drops signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component looks at the current volume and market momentum compared to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong positive momentum suggest greed is increasing. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts on social media platforms (specifically Twitter, according to Alternative) to gauge how many different posts mention Bitcoin and how fast they are being posted. A high level of interaction and positive sentiment mentions can point towards growing greed. Surveys (15%): This factor is currently paused, but historically it involved weekly crypto polls to get a direct sense of investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks the market capitalization share of Bitcoin relative to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate that investors are moving funds out of altcoins and into the perceived safety of Bitcoin, which can sometimes signal caution or fear in the broader altcoin market, or simply strong confidence in Bitcoin itself, depending on the context. Google Trends (10%): This analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin on Google Trends. A sudden surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear, while increased searches for “buy Bitcoin” could suggest growing greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final index score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. While surveys are currently paused, the other five factors continue to feed into the calculation. Navigating the Greed Zone: What Does 71 Imply? A reading of 71 means the market is feeling optimistic. Prices have likely seen significant positive movement recently, attracting more buyers and generating positive buzz on crypto social media . The strong crypto market momentum contributes significantly to this score. However, it’s crucial to remember what the index represents. It’s a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball or a direct buy/sell signal. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have often preceded market corrections, as excessive optimism can lead to inflated asset prices. Conversely, times of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes marked market bottoms, offering potential buying opportunities. Being in the ‘Greed’ zone suggests caution might be warranted. While the rally could continue, the risk of a downturn increases as sentiment becomes overly positive. It implies that many market participants are expecting prices to keep rising, which can sometimes lead to speculative bubbles. Actionable Insights: Using the Index Wisely So, how should you use this information? Here are a few actionable insights: Use it as a Contra-Indicator (with caution): Some experienced traders use the index as a contra-indicator. When the index is showing ‘Extreme Greed’, they might consider reducing exposure or taking profits. When it shows ‘Extreme Fear’, they might look for potential buying opportunities. However, this strategy is risky and requires careful consideration and other analysis. Gauge Market Psychology: The index is excellent for understanding the general emotional climate. Are people euphoric or panicking? This context can help you evaluate news and price movements. Combine with Other Analysis: Never rely solely on the Fear & Greed Index. Use it alongside fundamental analysis (understanding the technology, use case, and team behind a project), technical analysis (studying price charts and patterns), and your own risk management strategy. Avoid Emotional Decisions: The index highlights how emotions drive the market. Seeing ‘Greed’ might make you want to jump in, or ‘Fear’ might make you want to sell everything. Use the index as a reminder to stick to your pre-defined investment plan rather than making impulsive decisions based on current sentiment. The fact that the index slightly decreased from 72 to 71 could suggest a minor cooling off or sideways movement in sentiment, but it’s not a significant shift out of the optimistic territory. The overall message remains: the market is currently operating with a high degree of positive sentiment. Conclusion: A Pulse Check on Crypto Emotions The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a valuable tool for taking the pulse of the market’s emotional state. Its current reading of 71 firmly places us in the ‘Greed’ zone, reflecting the strong crypto market momentum , positive chatter on crypto social media , and overall optimism driven by factors like volatility and Bitcoin dominance trends. While this indicates bullish sentiment, it also serves as a reminder that markets driven by high levels of greed can be susceptible to corrections. Use the index as one piece of your analysis puzzle, helping you understand the prevailing psychological winds, but always combine it with thorough research and a disciplined investment approach. It’s not a guarantee of future price movements, but a fascinating look into the collective mind of crypto investors right now.

2025-06-12T10:30:15,"Bitcoin’s High Euphoria Spurs UK Company’s $5 Million Buy","A handful of UK-listed companies have taken fresh steps to tie their balance sheets more closely to Bitcoin . Moves range from making new purchases to routing gold revenues and even opening retail crypto trading on the London Stock Exchange. The developments show growing corporate interest in holding and trading digital assets alongside more traditional operations. Smarter Web Boosts Bitcoin Stash According to company filings, The Smarter Web Company added 45.32 BTC this month, spending $4.73 million. Its total hoard now stands at 168 BTC. That marks an over 55% jump from its previous buy. The firm first rolled out its “10 Year Plan” in April as a way to build up a long-term treasury. Based on reports, it has invested nearly $18 million so far, buying Bitcoin at an average of $105,779 each. Buying when the market’s Greed index hit 72 shows they’re willing to hold through ups and downs. The Smarter Web Company ( #SWC ) RNS Announcement: Bitcoin Purchase. Purchase of additional Bitcoin as part of “The 10 Year Plan” which includes an ongoing treasury policy of acquiring Bitcoin. Please read the RNS on our website: https://t.co/z59Xf4oBRU pic.twitter.com/vmtFzjsQeY — The Smarter Web Company (@smarterwebuk) June 10, 2025 Mining Firm Converts Gold Sales Bluebird Mining Ventures Ltd, known for its gold operations, said it will funnel future revenue directly into Bitcoin. The miner aims to become the first UK-listed gold company with a fully BTC-focused treasury strategy. It made the decision after Bitcoin climbed to a record high of $111,965 in May. Management sees this as a store of value alongside its mining output. The plan calls for regular conversions as income grows, betting that Bitcoin gains will outpace traditional reserves. Trading Platform Opens Crypto Doors IG Group, a long-standing trading firm on the London Stock Exchange, rolled out a new service this week. Retail clients can now buy and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple straight through IG’s regulated platform. Previously, investors had to use ETFs or third-party wallets. The change means IG can tap into rising demand for direct crypto exposure. It also positions the firm to earn new fee revenue as more traders flock to its site. Treasury Trend Spreads Among Firms Based on market observers, several other British companies are weighing similar moves. Capital-heavy businesses are talking about setting aside funds for Bitcoin. Some view it as a buffer against inflation. Others simply don’t want to miss out if prices climb further. While corporate treasurers were once cautious, the steady drumbeat of high crypto returns has pushed more boards to at least discuss pilot programs. Taken together, these actions suggest that digital assets are no longer fringe experiments for big companies. They’re becoming part of mainstream treasury playbooks.

2025-06-12T10:20:20,"US Trade Policy: Trump’s Crucial Call for Global Trade Deal Decisions Sparks Economic Uncertainty","In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, it might seem like global political maneuvering and trade deals are distant concerns. However, understanding the broader macroeconomic landscape is absolutely crucial for any investor, including those focused on digital assets. Significant shifts in US Trade Policy and international relations can send ripples across traditional markets, influencing investor sentiment, liquidity, and ultimately, the crypto market itself. A recent announcement from former President Donald Trump highlights just such a potential shift, signaling a period of potential Economic Uncertainty that warrants attention. Understanding the Latest on US Trade Policy According to reports from jin10.com, former U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated a significant upcoming move regarding international trade agreements. The core of the announcement is a plan to send formal letters to countries within roughly a week and a half. These letters will reportedly ask each nation to make a clear decision: either accept or reject a specific trade agreement. This isn’t just bureaucratic procedure; it’s a direct challenge that could reshape existing trade relationships and alliances. Under previous administrations, US Trade Policy has often involved lengthy negotiations, multilateral discussions, and phased implementations of agreements. Trump’s approach, however, has frequently favored more direct, bilateral, and sometimes confrontational tactics, often using tariffs and deadlines as leverage. This latest move appears consistent with that approach, aiming for a swift resolution or, conversely, a clear delineation of who is ‘in’ and who is ‘out’ of a proposed framework. Why is this relevant? Global trade isn’t just about goods crossing borders; it underpins international finance, supply chains, and geopolitical stability. Major changes or disruptions in trade can lead to volatility in currency markets, shifts in commodity prices, and altered risk assessments by investors worldwide. These factors collectively contribute to the overall health and sentiment of the global economy, which inevitably impacts risk assets like cryptocurrencies. What is This Global Trade Deal? The report from jin10.com specifically mentions a “trade agreement” that countries will be asked to accept or reject. The exact details of this specific Global Trade Deal are not explicitly detailed in the brief announcement provided. However, given Trump’s past focus, it could potentially relate to renegotiated terms of existing agreements, a new proposed multilateral framework, or perhaps a set of principles the U.S. wishes other nations to adopt regarding trade practices, intellectual property, or market access. A Global Trade Deal , or even a significant proposed one, involves complex interconnected elements: Tariffs and Duties: Taxes on imported or exported goods, directly impacting costs for businesses and consumers. Non-Tariff Barriers: Regulations, quotas, subsidies, or standards that can restrict trade indirectly. Intellectual Property Rights: Rules protecting patents, trademarks, and copyrights across borders. Dispute Resolution Mechanisms: How countries settle disagreements arising from the agreement. Market Access: How easily companies from one country can sell goods or services in another. Asking countries for a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ within a tight timeframe on something potentially this complex is a bold strategy. It forces nations to quickly weigh the potential benefits of alignment with the U.S. against the costs or disadvantages of the specific terms presented, or the potential repercussions of rejection. Navigating Potential Economic Uncertainty This impending deadline for a Trade Agreement Decision introduces a layer of Economic Uncertainty into the global outlook. Financial markets dislike uncertainty because it makes it difficult to price assets and predict future earnings or growth. Here’s why this announcement could fuel that uncertainty: Lack of Detail: Without knowing the specifics of the proposed agreement, countries (and markets) are left guessing the full implications. Tight Deadline: A week and a half is a very short time for countries to conduct thorough internal reviews, consult stakeholders, and formulate a definitive response to a potentially far-reaching agreement. This rush increases the chance of hasty decisions or miscalculations. Potential for Conflict: Rejections could lead to retaliatory measures, trade disputes, or the imposition of new tariffs, disrupting supply chains and harming businesses. Impact on Global Growth Forecasts: Trade is a key driver of global economic growth. Uncertainty or disruption in trade flows can lead economists to revise growth forecasts downwards, impacting investor confidence. For crypto investors, understanding Economic Uncertainty is key. When traditional markets face headwinds due to geopolitical or trade tensions, investors may become more risk-averse. This can lead to sell-offs in stocks and other assets, and sometimes this risk-off sentiment extends to cryptocurrencies, which are still largely perceived as risk assets, despite narratives around digital gold. Analyzing the Potential Market Impact The announcement of this looming Trade Agreement Decision is likely to be closely watched by financial markets around the globe. The potential Market Impact could manifest in several ways: Stock Markets: Companies with significant international operations or reliance on global supply chains could see their stock prices react based on the perceived likelihood of acceptance or rejection and the potential trade environment that follows. Currency Markets: Currencies of countries heavily involved in trade with the U.S. could experience volatility as the deadline approaches and decisions are announced. Commodity Markets: Prices of commodities like oil, metals, and agricultural products, which are heavily traded globally, can be sensitive to changes in trade policy and demand expectations. Investor Sentiment: Overall market confidence can be boosted by positive trade developments or dampened by the prospect of trade wars or disagreements. How does this translate to crypto? While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate outside traditional financial systems, their prices are often correlated with broader market movements, particularly during periods of high volatility or significant macroeconomic news. Increased Market Impact from trade tensions could lead to a flight to safety (potentially benefiting assets seen as stores of value, though crypto’s role here is debated) or a general de-risking across all asset classes, including digital ones. Examples from the Past: We’ve seen in recent years how trade tensions between major economies (like the U.S. and China) have caused significant volatility in stock markets. While crypto’s reaction hasn’t always been perfectly correlated, these periods of macro uncertainty have often coincided with notable price swings in the crypto market as well. The Significance of the Trade Agreement Decision The fact that countries are being explicitly asked to make a clear Trade Agreement Decision within such a short timeframe elevates the importance of this event. It’s not merely an invitation to negotiate; it appears to be a demand for a position. This approach could be designed to force clarity, identify allies, and isolate those unwilling to agree to the proposed terms. The outcome of each country’s Trade Agreement Decision will likely shape the geopolitical and economic landscape for the foreseeable future. Acceptance by many key trading partners could signal a new era of trade relations aligned with the U.S.’s proposed framework. Widespread rejection, however, could lead to increased trade barriers, fragmentation of global markets, and heightened international tensions. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on international news sources, not just crypto-specific ones. Developments in global trade and geopolitics can have indirect but significant effects. Understand Correlations: Observe how Bitcoin and the broader crypto market react to major global economic news events. While not always perfectly correlated, patterns often emerge. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Periods of increased Economic Uncertainty might call for a review of your portfolio’s risk exposure, across all asset classes, including crypto. Diversification: Consider whether your overall investment strategy is sufficiently diversified to weather potential volatility stemming from macroeconomic factors. This upcoming period, driven by the need for a swift Trade Agreement Decision from numerous countries, underscores the interconnectedness of the global financial system. Even in the decentralized world of crypto, external economic forces play a significant role. Conclusion: Why Global Trade Matters to Crypto While the headline about Trump’s trade letters might initially seem unrelated to Bitcoin or Ethereum, it serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market does not exist in a vacuum. Major developments in US Trade Policy and the outcome of a pivotal Global Trade Deal decision can inject significant Economic Uncertainty into the world economy, triggering a notable Market Impact that ripples through traditional finance and into the digital asset space. The next week and a half will be critical as countries formulate their responses to this direct request for a Trade Agreement Decision . The reactions – acceptance, rejection, or attempts to negotiate – will likely set the tone for international trade relations and global market sentiment moving forward. For crypto investors, staying abreast of these macro developments isn’t just about being informed; it’s about understanding the potential external pressures and opportunities that could influence the value and volatility of their digital holdings. Being aware allows for more informed decision-making in an increasingly complex global financial environment.

After stepping back from its blockbuster IPO in 2020 and facing heavy regulatory pressure in China, the company has quietly reshaped its strategy. Now, it’s looking to secure stablecoin licenses in key Asian financial hubs, signaling a long-term commitment to digital currencies. China's Financial Behemoth @AntGroup Plans To Roll Out Stablecoins In Major Asian Financial Hubs An @AlibabaGroup subsidiary, Ant plans to file in Hong Kong when its Stablecoins Ordinance takes effect in August and then target Singapore and Luxembourg. The move… pic.twitter.com/Q13avDa7dT — UnoCrypto (@unocrypto_com) June 12, 2025 Targeting Hong Kong, Singapore & Beyond Ant Group’s international division, based in Singapore, is reportedly set to apply for a stablecoin license in Hong Kong as soon as the region’s new regulations take effect this August. It’s also eyeing similar permits in Singapore and Luxembourg, aiming to plant its flag in globally influential financial centers. These licenses, if granted, will allow the company to issue or work with stablecoins that are pegged to traditional currencies, giving users and businesses a faster, cheaper, and more efficient way to send money internationally. The move comes as Hong Kong positions itself as a regulated hub for digital assets, offering clearer rules than most markets. For Ant, this is more than just another business expansion; it’s a strategic shift to become a key player in the future of global payments. From IPO Setback to Global Blockchain Push Once the darling of China’s tech scene, Ant Group’s IPO was halted at the last minute in 2020 due to government intervention. Since then, the firm has pulled back from consumer lending and doubled down on blockchain-based enterprise services. Last year, its global platform handled over $1 trillion in payments, with a third of that processed through its proprietary blockchain network, Whale. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Institutional Bitcoin Holdings Soared 924% in a Decade: Gemini and Glassnode Report , Its overseas business is thriving, pulling in nearly $3 billion in 2024 and turning a profit for two consecutive years.

The goal is to support faster and cheaper cross-border payments, especially for businesses and online marketplaces. With stablecoins gaining global attention and regulators racing to catch up, Ant is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift. If it secures the licenses, Ant will be better equipped to challenge global players in digital finance, this time on its terms. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While one of the most important of these, the US giant GameStop, made its second Bitcoin purchase, another company started preparations to buy BTC. Mercurity Fintech (Nasdaq: MFH), a Nasdaq-listed digital fintech group, has announced plans to raise $800 million to create a long-term Bitcoin treasury reserve. Accordingly, the company stated that it will collect $800 million for the Bitcoin treasury reserve. Aside from purchasing Bitcoin, the funds raised will also be used to integrate blockchain-focused custody services, staking, and tokenized treasury management into the company’s digital reserve framework. The company also said that FTSE Russell is expected to be included in the broad market Russell 3000 and Russell 2000 Indexes under its 2025 annual restructuring preliminary list. The company’s CEO, Shi Qiu, said the following about the Bitcoin move: “We are creating this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will be a fundamental component of the future financial infrastructure. We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem.

2025-06-12T10:10:19,"Over a third of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is in instituitional hands: report","Over a third of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is now held by centralized treasuries, including centralized exchanges, exchange-traded funds, and governments. According to the recent Gemini and Glassnode’s Report , over 30% of Bitcoin ( BTC ) circulating supply is now held by just 216 centralized entities across six categories: centralized exchanges, ETFs and funds, public companies, private companies, DeFi protocols, and governments. This consolidation of Bitcoin into institutional hands coincides with its rapid price appreciation—from under $1,000 in 2015 to over $100,000 today, suggesting that major institutions now view Bitcoin as a strategic, long-term asset. Across nearly all categories, with the exception of private companies, the top three entities hold between 65% to 90% of the total assets, reflecting the outsized role of early movers, especially in the DeFi, public company, and ETF categories, in shaping the early trajectory of institutional Bitcoin adoption. Source: Bitcoin Adoption, Volatility, and Market Cap | Gemini and Glassnode’s Report You might also like: Why “there’s not going to be enough Bitcoin” according to Bitwise CEO The report also notes that over the past two years, Bitcoin balances on CEXs have declined, which has frequently been mistaken for an imminent supply shortage. However, the majority of that BTC has shifted to ETFs and funds, especially U.S. spot ETFs. Since June 2021, the total BTC held by this spot trading sector has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 3.9 million and 4.2 million BTC. This stability indicates that the decrease in exchange balances reflects a structural redistribution of custody rather than a reduction in overall supply. The increasing share held by ETFs signals greater adoption by TradFi , yet the total liquidity available to spot buyers has stayed largely consistent. You might also like: Bitcoin supply on exchanges drops to 8-year low. Will BTC set a new all-time high? The report also highlighted that the creation of the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has significantly boosted institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a sovereign-grade asset. Following the SBR announcement, public and private companies have significantly increased their Bitcoin purchases. The report concludes that with over 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply held by centralized entities, the market has undergone a structural shift catalyzed by long-term investments and strategic custody. While early adopters continue to dominate holdings, Bitcoin’s acceptance as a sovereign-grade asset—marked by the SBR—has boosted institutional confidence.

2025-06-12T10:10:17,"Bitcoin Treasury: F Street Commits $10M in Bold Corporate Strategy","In a move that underscores the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets, investment firm F Street has announced significant plans for its Bitcoin treasury . This decision highlights a notable shift in how companies are viewing and utilizing cryptocurrencies as part of their core financial planning. Why Are Companies Pursuing a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy ? F Street’s announcement to purchase $10 million worth of Bitcoin for its treasury reserves isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a larger, evolving trend where businesses are exploring alternatives to traditional cash reserves and low-yield assets. But what drives this interest? Inflation Hedge: Many companies see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in the current macroeconomic climate where fiat currencies may be losing purchasing power. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s limited supply (capped at 21 million coins) and decentralized nature are often cited as reasons it could serve as a reliable store of value over the long term. Potential Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant growth potential, offering the possibility of increasing the value of treasury assets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s balance sheet beyond traditional assets. Future-Proofing: Aligning with digital asset trends can position a company as forward-thinking and innovative. This strategic shift by firms like F Street signals increasing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, moving it beyond speculative trading into serious financial planning. Exploring F Street’s Specific Bitcoin Investment Plan According to reports, including one from Bitcoin Magazine on X, F Street intends to acquire $10 million in Bitcoin. What’s particularly interesting about their approach is the methodology: Instead of a single large purchase, F Street plans to make daily buys. This dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy aims to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s price volatility. By spreading purchases over time, they can potentially achieve a lower average cost per Bitcoin compared to a lump-sum purchase that might coincide with a price peak. The funds for these purchases will come directly from the firm’s business proceeds, indicating a deliberate allocation of operational capital towards building their digital asset reserves. This isn’t just passive investment; it’s an active decision to integrate Bitcoin into their financial framework. Is This Part of a Broader Institutional Bitcoin Trend? Absolutely. F Street is joining a growing list of publicly traded and private companies that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have been particularly vocal and aggressive in their Bitcoin investment strategy, accumulating substantial amounts over time. Other notable examples include Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and various investment funds. The increasing participation of investment firms like F Street in the institutional Bitcoin space is significant. It suggests that professional money managers and financial strategists are becoming more comfortable with the asset, developing frameworks for its custody, accounting, and risk management. This trend lends further credibility to Bitcoin and can pave the way for even larger players to consider similar moves in the future. Each new corporate adoption, regardless of size, adds another data point to the viability of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. What Does the F Street Bitcoin Decision Mean for the Market? While a $10 million purchase might seem modest compared to the multi-billion dollar acquisitions by some giants, F Street’s move is still impactful: Validation: It provides further validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class suitable for corporate treasuries. Demand: Consistent daily buying, even in smaller amounts, contributes to sustained demand in the market. Sentiment: Positive news of corporate adoption can boost overall market sentiment and encourage other firms to explore the option. Precedent: For other investment firms or businesses of similar size, F Street’s strategy could serve as a template or inspiration. The decision by F Street to allocate a portion of its reserves to Bitcoin reflects a calculated approach to navigating the current economic landscape and positioning the firm for potential future growth in the digital asset space. Their use of daily buys is a practical example of managing the volatility inherent in cryptocurrency markets when building a long-term position. Considering a Bitcoin Treasury for Your Business? Key Insights F Street’s strategy offers valuable insights for any business contemplating a similar move: Start Small: You don’t need to allocate a massive percentage of your reserves initially. A smaller allocation allows you to get comfortable with the process and volatility. Have a Clear Strategy: Define your objectives (e.g., inflation hedge, long-term growth) and your purchasing methodology (e.g., lump sum, DCA). Address Custody and Security: Securely storing Bitcoin is paramount. Explore reputable custodians or robust self-custody solutions. Understand the Accounting and Tax Implications: Bitcoin holdings have specific accounting treatments and tax obligations that need to be addressed. Be Prepared for Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly. Ensure your business can tolerate potential short-term drawdowns. The F Street Bitcoin purchase is more than just a headline; it’s a case study in how businesses are actively adapting to the evolving financial landscape and incorporating digital assets into their long-term financial health. Conclusion F Street’s plan to acquire $10 million in Bitcoin for its treasury reserves through daily buys is a clear signal of increasing confidence in cryptocurrency among institutional players. This move aligns with a broader trend of companies exploring corporate Bitcoin strategy as a means to diversify reserves, hedge against inflation, and potentially capture long-term growth. As more firms make the leap into institutional Bitcoin , it further solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a significant asset in the global financial system. The decision by F Street Bitcoin is another step in the ongoing integration of digital assets into traditional finance, demonstrating a practical approach to building a Bitcoin treasury in the modern era.

2025-06-12T10:10:05,"Japan to request G7 action against North Korea crypto theft","Shigeru Ishiba, the prime minister of Japan, will urge the G7 to confront North Korea’s crypto theft activities. The request comes amid concerns about illicit funds supporting weapons development programs. North Korea allegedly uses stolen virtual assets to finance weapons of mass destruction development. The summit will explore international cooperation to eliminate these financial channels. Japan pushes G7 cooperation against North Korea crypto funding Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba will denounce North Korea’s cybercrime cryptocurrency theft operations during the G7 summit in Canada this month, a Kyodo news report says. The three-day summit starting Sunday will discuss global cooperation to counter illicit virtual asset activities that are reportedly financing weapons development programs. Japanese government reports indicate that Ishiba’s proposal is in response to increasing fears over North Korea employing hacked cryptocurrency to fund weapons of mass destruction research. The call for enhanced global cooperation is intended to sever economic lifelines funding Pyongyang’s military programs. Japan’s move comes at the same time North Korea is heightening its military cooperation with Russia amid the war in Ukraine. Japan wishes to observe increased collaboration with Ukrainian allies in Europe and define security issues raised by North Korean behavior in the region. The G7 partnership framework would be directed towards the tracking and prevention of North Korean actors’ cryptocurrency theft activities. Current global efforts are not yet sufficiently harmonized to address sophisticated cyber activities against virtual asset exchanges and platforms. Japan’s proposal builds on existing concerns among G7 members about cryptocurrency security and the need for coordinated responses to state-sponsored cyber theft. The summit discussions will discuss mechanisms for information sharing and joint enforcement actions against illicit cryptocurrency activities. G7 plans task force for cross-border e-commerce tax reform As merchants flood member nation marketplaces with low-cost items, the G7 countries want to form a task group to evaluate tax exemptions on cross-border e-commerce involving tiny deliveries. Canada, serving as this year’s rotating president, has approached Japan about participating in the initiative addressing customs processing strain. The task force responds to growing concerns about parcel volume containing low-value goods that burden customs operations. G7 members also seek protection for domestic businesses subject to sales and consumption taxes while overseas retailers, particularly Chinese companies, remain exempt from these obligations. Japan does not collect import and consumption taxes on imported goods worth 10,000 yen ($69) or less under the “de minimis” rule, except for rice, sugar, and a few other items. During 2024, around 170 million boxes under the threshold were imported and accounted for around 90% of cleared customs imports. Chinese e-commerce companies like Shein and Temu have leveraged these tax breaks to expand their operations in Japan and other big markets. The United States eliminated its small parcel exemption on Chinese goods in May as illegal drug imports, and in particular fentanyl, were cited as the reason. North Korean cryptocurrency empire of thievery North Korean state actors have hacked more than $6 billion in cryptocurrency since 2017. Especially 2024 was a record year of $1.34 billion stolen in 47 attacks. That’s 61% of all cryptocurrency stolen globally and means North Korea is a cybercrime leader on digital assets. The attacks support the regime’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs and avoid international sanctions. North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau Lazarus Group have developed from basic malware attacks to sophisticated multi-stage financial attacks. They target the complete cryptocurrency ecosystem from the big exchanges all the way down to the individual wallets with sophisticated social engineering, customized malware, and sophisticated money laundering techniques. Coincheck remains the foundational victory for North Korean hackers, with $534 million stolen in January 2018 through a phishing attack that compromised employee credentials. Recent exchange attacks show escalating ambition. The February 2025 Bybit hack is the largest crypto heist ever at $1.5 billion, with the FBI confirming Lazarus Group attribution in a matter of days. Japan’s DMM Bitcoin lost $308 million in May 2024 through clever social engineering against employees through imposter LinkedIn recruiters. This eventually led to the exchange shutting down. KuCoin’s 2020 hack demonstrated contemporary laundering methods, with $275 million being stolen and then laundered on DeFi platform. Some other large exchange victims are Atomic Wallet ($100 million, June 2023), Stake.com ($41 million, September 2023), and CoinsPaid ($37 million, July 2023). All the attacks employed different tactics of social engineering, ranging from spoofed job placements to vulnerable third-party services. The Ronin Network hack is North Korea’s most brazen attack, which stole $625 million from Axie Infinity’s sidechain bridge in March 2022.

2025-06-12T10:09:22,"Three memecoins to watch this week: Fartcoin, SPX6900, aura","With market sentiment improving, memecoins are taking center stage in this week’s crypto rally, driven by cooling US–China trade tensions and softer US inflation data that has revived hopes of earlier Fed rate cuts. Following these developments, the global crypto market cap climbed to $3.59 trillion on June 11, with daily trading volume hitting $135.14 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly pushed past $110,000, Ethereum ( ETH ) reclaimed $2,800, and XRP ( XRP ) held steady around $2.30. Although the top three tokens saw modest pullbacks today, Bitcoin’s momentum has rippled across the broader market, driving renewed interest in altcoins, with memecoins leading the charge over the past week. Here are some of the best-performing memecoins this week worth keeping an eye on. Fartcoin Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), a Solana-based memecoin born out of Elon Musk’s love for farts, has surged 47.8% over the last 7 days, bringing its market cap to over $1.3 billion. It’s expected to stay in the spotlight this week with a Coinbase listing set for June 12 at 9 AM PT. Ahead of the spot listing, Coinbase will also launch Fartcoin perpetual futures on its Advanced and International platforms. On the daily chart, Fartcoin has broken out of a falling wedge pattern, a formation often associated with bullish reversals. It is currently trading above its 50-day moving average, while the MACD has flashed a bullish crossover, which is often a precursor for an extended rally. FARTCOIN 50-day SMA and MACD chart — June 12 | Source: crypto.news If this trend holds, the next target could be a retest of the $1.64 level. You might also like: Ethereum holds $2.7K as ETF inflows surge and ETH options flip sharply bullish SPX6900 SPX6900 ( SPX ), a memecoin with a tongue-in-cheek mission to flip traditional markets, has rallied for five consecutive days, hitting an all-time high of $1.73 on June 11. Its market capitalization has climbed from $275 million in March to nearly $1.6 billion at press time. The token is drawing attention this week for two key reasons. First, it has continued to gain despite its official X account being suspended, a development that would typically hurt sentiment. Instead, the sustained rally has highlighted the strength and engagement of its community, which could attract further interest. Second, whale activity has picked up. Large holders now control over 106 million SPX tokens, up from 105 million in mid-May. At the same time, the amount of SPX on exchanges has dropped noticeably, which is usually a sign that investors are holding, not selling, fueling even more hype and FOMO. From a technical perspective, the SPX6900 is forming a cup-and-handle pattern on the daily chart, a setup that often signals further upside. SPX price, CMF and Aroon chart — June 12 | Source: crypto.news The price looks poised to touch the upper boundary around $1.742. Once it hits the target, if it pulls back slightly to form the “handle” and holds support, it could set the stage for the next leg up. Furthermore, the Chaikin Money Flow is positive, indicating buying pressure, while the Aroon Up is at 92.86%, suggesting that a strong uptrend remains in effect. Hence, if bulls stay in control, the SPX could continue to push higher after a brief consolidation. aura aura (AURA) has surged by more than 9,700% in the past week, climbing from around $0.00090 to $0.090, with its market cap jumping from just $1 million to nearly $83 million. The memecoin had seen little to no activity for months, but suddenly spiked on June 10 following a wave of buying pressure. On-chain data suggests that a single whale accumulation , rumoured to be linked to the SPX community, played a key role in triggering the rally. More than $500,000 worth of AURA was reportedly deployed across decentralised exchanges within a few hours, causing a price cascade as retail traders rushed in. Over 215 wallets interacted with the token during the peak surge, driving daily volume up by over 100,000%. On the daily chart, the MACD lines and Relative Strength Index have moved well above overbought levels, indicating a potential pullback could be on the horizon. AURA price, RSI and MACD chart — June 12 | Source: crypto.news Despite this, if momentum continues and visibility grows across trading forums and social media, AURA could see further upside in the near term, especially given its low float and speculative appeal. However, the lack of fundamentals, project updates, or clear utility means the rally is driven largely by sentiment and volatility. As with most parabolic runs, profit-taking by early holders could trigger equally steep pullbacks, making AURA a high-risk, high-reward trade at current levels.

The downturn was largely attributed to renewed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which pressured broader risk assets. However, the move is being viewed as a temporary setback. Bitcoin slipped below $108,000 after briefly testing the $110,000 level, triggering a round of profit-taking. The pullback extended across the altcoin space, with many tokens surrendering a portion of their recent gains.

As capital rotates back into digital assets, speculative segments such as meme coins are drawing renewed investor interest, with Bitcoin Pepe emerging as a key beneficiary. Positioned as the first meme-centric Layer 2 built on the Bitcoin network, Bitcoin Pepe aims to merge Bitcoin’s robust security with Solana-like scalability — a technical proposition that sets it apart from typical meme tokens lacking infrastructure depth. To build out its Layer 2 ecosystem, the project has announced strategic partnerships with Super Meme, Catamoto, and Plena Finance. A collaboration with GETE Network is also in place to expand its footprint in the cross-chain Web3 gaming space. The effort to blend real-world utility with viral meme appeal appears to be resonating. Its ongoing presale has raised over $14 million, with BPEP tokens priced at $0.0416.

The timing, just after a shaky U.S.-China trade deal, has raised fresh concerns about a new round of global trade tensions. Markets are already feeling the pressure and crypto is no exception. Global Sell-Off Begins as Tariff Clock Ticks Trump’s tariff plans have sparked a pullback across global markets. European and U.S. equity futures have dropped as investors brace for what could be another hit to international trade. The dollar has weakened, gold prices have surged, and Treasury yields are falling – all signs that investors are moving to safer assets. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes is sounding the alarm.

Don’t get shook. pic.twitter.com/GJbdZb73X4 — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) June 12, 2025 Bitcoin Drops Below $110K, Altcoins Follow Bitcoin started the week strong, riding the wave of global liquidity. But the rally didn’t last. After being rejected at the $110,000 resistance level, BTC is now down 1.66%, trading near $107,750. Altcoins are in the red too. Dogecoin is seeing the steepest drop among the top ten, down 7% in just 24 hours. Even a lower-than-expected U.S. CPI reading wasn’t enough to boost market sentiment. Traders are growing increasingly cautious as macro uncertainty piles up. More Trade Moves Coming At the same time, the Trump administration is also pushing for bilateral trade deals with major economies like India, South Korea, and Japan. The goal is to strengthen America’s economic position but these moves could also raise tensions in global trade even further. Hayes: Volatility Is Just Getting Started Arthur Hayes has repeatedly called for the Fed to switch from quantitative tightening (QT) to quantitative easing (QE). But with inflation still a concern and interest rate cuts now unlikely, that shift seems far off. With Trump’s tariff strategy shaking up traditional markets, crypto is entering another phase of heightened volatility. Hayes’ warning comes at a critical time for traders trying to navigate this evolving landscape. The Bottom Line Trump’s new tariff plan is already sending shockwaves across global markets.

2025-06-12T09:48:11,"Swedish health tech firm H100 Group raises $10M to buy more Bitcoin","Health technology company H100 Group AB has raised over $10 million to accelerate its Bitcoin treasury strategy through a mix of share issues and convertible loans. According to a June 11 announcement from the Swedish firm, the raise consisted of two directed share issues totaling 69.65 million Swedish krona ($7.3 million) and a 31.35 million krona ($3.29 million) convertible loan tranche. Bitcoin plans draw broad participation The financing drew participation from key Bitcoin advocates and investment firms, including Blockstream CEO Adam Back, UTXO Management, and several Nordic investors such as Race Ventures Scandinavia and Crafoord Capital Partners. The convertible loan component, labeled Tranche 1, was increased from a previously announced 21 million krona. The loans are interest-free and will mature in five years, with shareholders having the option to convert them into equity at a price of 1.75 krona per share. Investors will also be required to convert their holdings if H100’s share price maintains a 33% premium above the conversion rate for 20 consecutive trading days. Net proceeds from the share issues and loan agreements will be used to purchase additional Bitcoin, with estimates suggesting H100 could acquire roughly 67.1 BTC at current market prices. This would bring the company’s total holdings to approximately 81.85 BTC, including the 13.95 BTC it has already acquired. H100’s Bitcoin treasury strategy H100 Group’s commitment to Bitcoin began on May 22 with a $490,000 purchase of 4.39 BTC, its first foray into crypto reserves and a landmark moment that made H100 the first listed Swedish firm to embrace Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Shortly after, on May 25, it raised an additional $2.2 million in a funding round led by Adam Back. The funds, secured through 0% interest convertible loans, allowed the company to purchase roughly 20.18 more Bitcoins. That tranche featured a conversion price of 1.3 krona per share and represented an estimated 12% dilution upon full conversion. H100 views its Bitcoin strategy as a means to strengthen its reserves without diverting from its core business in health and longevity technologies. According to CEO Sander Andersen, the “values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community align well with, and will appeal to, the customers and communities” that H100 plans to serve through its health and longevity-focused platform. Investor response has been noteworthy. Shares of H100 surged 39% after its initial Bitcoin acquisition and have since climbed 280%, closing at 4.64 krona on June 11. The company is listed on the Nordic Growth Market exchange. H100 joins a growing list of health and med-tech firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets.

After five years on the market, this non-custodial platform has matured from a clever desktop client into a 360° crypto wallet ecosystem: buy, swap, stake, and store 1,000-plus assets in one interface—no KYC for core functions, no middlemen holding your keys. Below is an deep dive into the features that keep Atomic a contender in every “ best crypto wallet ” roundup, plus practical tips on how to withdraw from Atomic Wallet , use the built-in atomic charge wallet to fund purchases, and unleash passive income through atomic wallet staking . 1. True Self-Custody: Your Keys, Your Crypto Atomic’s architecture is simple but powerful. The 12-word backup phrase and every private key are generated locally and encrypted on-device. They never touch company servers. In practice that means: No custodian risk: even if Atomic’s website goes offline, your funds remain on-chain. No forced verification: you can hold, receive, and send without uploading an ID. No data harvest: the wallet doesn’t store personal details; you remain pseudonymous. If you keep that seed phrase offline in two secure spots, you own a bullet-proof gateway to any supported network—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Monero, even NFTs on multiple chains. 2. Buy, Exchange, Stake—All Under One Roof BUY – Through integrated partners (currently MoonPay, Simplex, and Guardarian) you can purchase BTC, ETH, SOL, USDT, and dozens more with Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, or local bank rails in over 180 countries. The new “ atomic charge wallet ” flow pre-loads fiat so repeat buys happen in two taps. EXCHANGE – The atomic wallet swap engine links several DEX and instant-swap APIs. Roughly 60 pairs can be exchanged anonymously; each trade may return 0.3–1 % cashback paid in AW utility tokens. Spreads are competitive with major exchanges—minus the sign-up friction. STAKE – Yield hunters will appreciate the in-app staking dashboard: ETH (≈5 % APR), ADA (≈3 %), SOL (≈7 %), ATOM (≈16 %), HBAR, XTZ, and more. Every validator set is pre-audited; rewards land directly in your address with no extra fees—an underrated perk that puts Atomic among the best crypto wallet choices for passive income. 3. Seamless Asset Management on Any Device Whether you prefer desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) or mobile (iOS, Android, Huawei App Gallery), the UX stays consistent: clean portfolio charts, dark/light themes, biometric unlock, and instant balance sync across devices. Sorting by value, name, or gains makes it painless to track a long-tail portfolio. Need to deposit something obscure? Tap “Add Assets” and paste any valid address for ERC-20, BEP-20, TRC-20, or native layer-1 coins; Atomic auto-detects the network and tags it to your list. That flexibility—combined with 10 M+ global installs—cements Atomic’s role as a crypto wallet app for power users and beginners alike. 4. Security Posture & Withdrawal Process Critics will ask, “Great features, but how to withdraw from Atomic Wallet safely?” The answer: as easily as sending a normal blockchain transaction. Open the asset page (e.g., BTC). Paste the destination address. Set a fee or pick “fast”/“standard.” Confirm with your password or biometrics. Because keys stay local—and because Atomic connects directly to full-node servers—your withdrawal is signed client-side, broadcast instantly, and visible on-chain within seconds. No ticket, no approval queue. For extra peace of mind, you can export raw private keys or your 12-word seed into any hardware wallet later on. 5. Transparent Team & Roadmap Unlike many anonymous wallet projects, Atomic lists its leadership publicly: Konstantin Gladych, PhD – CEO and former co-founder of Changelly (the instant-exchange giant processing $0.5 B monthly). Charlie Shrem – Strategic adviser, Bitcoin Foundation co-founder, and early BTC evangelist. The roadmap for 2025 focuses on: Layer-2 support (Arbitrum, Base) for cheaper swaps. In-app DEX charting and limit orders. Multi-sig vaults for teams and small businesses. Such transparency is a hallmark of a best cryptocurrency wallet contender; users see exactly who steers the ship. 6. Independent Feedback On Trustpilot Atomic hovers around 4.5/5 across 25 k reviews; major praise targets the 24/7 live chat that actually responds in under 10 minutes. Forbes, CoinTelegraph, and PCMag have each run an atomic wallet review labeling it “a Swiss-army knife for mainstream crypto usage.” 7. Pros & Cons Snapshot Pros Cons ✓ Full non-custodial control ✕ No native hardware-wallet integration (planned) ✓ 1,000+ assets supported ✕ Buy fees depend on third-party provider ✓ Built-in staking up to 20 % APR ✕ Some swap pairs can have thin liquidity ✓ Anonymous swaps + cashback ✓ Available on every major OS/mobile store 8. Final Verdict: Why Atomic Still Ranks Top-Tier If your priority is a single interface to buy crypto with a debit card , swap cross-chain, stake for passive rewards, and manage exotic tokens—all while keeping custody—Atomic ticks every box. The wallet’s commitment to decentralization, its battle-tested security model, and a relentless roadmap give it a durable edge over many custodial “super apps.” Add a responsive support team and transparent leadership, and it is easy to see why Atomic remains a staple recommendation in any 2025 list of best cryptocurrency wallet solutions. For anyone seeking a future-proof, privacy-first, feature-rich gateway to digital assets, Atomic Wallet deserves a spot on your home screen—and maybe even on your hardware-backup card.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/atomic-wallet-review-2025-all-in-one-crypto-wallet-app/,"ADA|BTC|ETH|FIAT|SOL","Information",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T09:40:25,"Ethereum NFT Traders Witness Remarkable Recovery to 2022 Levels","The world of digital collectibles is buzzing with exciting news! Recent data reveals a significant resurgence in activity, particularly among Ethereum NFT traders . After a period of correction and lower engagement, the number of active traders on the Ethereum network has climbed back to levels not seen since 2022. This recovery is a hopeful sign for the broader NFT market recovery and indicates renewed interest and confidence in the digital asset space. What’s Driving the Surge in Ethereum NFT Traders ? Several factors appear to be contributing to this positive trend. While the market is complex and influenced by many variables, two key drivers have been highlighted: OpenSea’s New Rewards Program: As a leading NFT marketplace, OpenSea’s initiatives can significantly impact trader behavior. Their introduction of a rewards program seems to have incentivized activity, encouraging both new and returning users to engage with the platform and the wider Ethereum NFT ecosystem. Such programs often reward users for trading volume or participation, directly boosting the number of active traders. Increased Focus on NFT Utility : Early in the NFT boom, many projects focused primarily on digital art and collectibles without much practical use. However, developers have increasingly shifted towards building utility into NFTs. This includes integrating them into gaming ecosystems, using them for access to exclusive communities or events, providing staking opportunities, or linking them to real-world assets and services. NFTs with tangible benefits are proving more attractive and sustainable for users beyond mere speculation. This combination of platform-driven incentives and fundamental value creation through utility appears to be a powerful catalyst for the current rebound in trader numbers. How Many Ethereum NFT Traders Are We Talking About? The data paints a clear picture of the scale of this recovery. The total number of active Ethereum NFT traders has reportedly surged to approximately 40,000. This figure represents a substantial increase from lower points experienced during the market downturns and brings the activity level back in line with figures observed during parts of 2022. While not reaching the peak frenzy of late 2021 or early 2022, returning to the 40,000 mark is a meaningful indicator of market health and participation. Is This a Sign of a Full NFT Market Recovery ? While the increase in trader numbers is undoubtedly positive, it’s essential to view it within the broader context of the NFT market recovery . Trader count is one metric among many. Other factors like total sales volume, floor prices of major collections, and the influx of new capital also contribute to the overall market health assessment. However, a growing number of active participants is a foundational element for a sustainable recovery. It suggests liquidity, interest, and a base of users willing to engage with NFT assets. This trend aligns with broader positive sentiment observed in the crypto market trends , where renewed interest and capital flow into digital assets can often spill over into related sectors like NFTs. Exploring the Impact of OpenSea Rewards and NFT Utility Let’s delve a little deeper into the specific impact of the mentioned drivers: The Role of OpenSea Rewards Marketplace incentives are a classic strategy to boost activity. By rewarding users for trading, OpenSea directly encourages the behavior that drives volume and participation. This can create a positive feedback loop, attracting more users and potentially leading to more listings and sales. It also helps OpenSea maintain its position as a dominant player in the space by fostering loyalty and activity on its platform. The Growing Importance of NFT Utility The shift towards utility marks a maturation of the NFT space. Projects that offer real-world benefits or integrate NFTs into functional ecosystems are building more sustainable models. Examples include: Gaming: NFTs representing in-game assets, characters, or land. Membership: NFTs acting as digital keys for exclusive online or offline communities. DeFi Integration: Using NFTs as collateral or for yield farming. Intellectual Property: NFTs granting specific rights or royalties. This focus on utility moves NFTs beyond speculative art and towards valuable digital assets with tangible use cases, attracting a different kind of buyer and fostering longer-term holding rather than just flipping. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum NFT Traders and the Market? The return of Ethereum NFT traders to 2022 levels is a promising indicator, but the market remains dynamic. Continued growth will likely depend on: Sustained Utility Development: Projects need to continue innovating and delivering real value through NFT utility. Marketplace Innovation: Platforms like OpenSea must keep evolving their offerings and incentives. Broader Crypto Market Health: The NFT market is still heavily correlated with overall crypto market trends . Continued positive momentum in Bitcoin and Ethereum typically benefits NFTs. Regulatory Clarity: As the space grows, regulatory developments will play a crucial role in shaping its future. For existing and potential Ethereum NFT traders , this recovery suggests renewed opportunities but also highlights the importance of doing thorough research and understanding the specific utility and community behind any NFT project. In Conclusion: A Remarkable Step Forward for Ethereum NFTs The recovery of Ethereum NFT traders to 2022 levels is a significant milestone for the digital collectibles space. Fueled by strategic moves like OpenSea rewards and a fundamental shift towards NFT utility , this surge in activity demonstrates resilience and growing maturity in the market. While challenges remain, the return of tens of thousands of traders signals renewed confidence and sets a positive tone for the ongoing NFT market recovery . It’s a clear indication that despite past volatility, the core appeal and potential of NFTs, particularly on the robust Ethereum network, continue to attract a dedicated and growing community of participants.

2025-06-12T09:33:41,"Crypto vs Conflict: Bitcoin Price Dips as US–Iran Rumors Escalate","Bitcoin fell 1.7% to $107.6K as investors reacted to rising geopolitical uncertainty. Crude oil prices spiked over 4% following Trump’s warnings and Iran’s threats. Tensions over Iran’s nuclear program and missile tests are driving market volatility. Bitcoin took a bearish turn on Wednesday, retreating from its recent highs as escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran pushed crude oil up more than 4% while BTC dropped from a daily high of $110K to trade at $107,657.61 at press time. The market shift reflects a classic risk-off reaction, as investors sought refuge in traditional hedges like oil while trimming exposure to volatile digital assets. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin experienced a sharp pullback to the daily low of $107,407.29, as per CoinMarketCap data . With the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) around $106.3K acting as the immediate support zone, and a deeper floor forming near the 50-day EMA at $102K, traders should brace for further downward pressure.

2025-06-12T09:30:14,"Bitcoin Risks Pullback To $105,000 After Facing Rejection Above $110,000","Bitcoin has faced a lot of resistance above $110,000, suggesting the bears are trying to keep the digital asset from reclaiming its all-time high levels. This has been obvious with multiple rejections above $110,000 over the last few days, while the bulls have held support above $108,000. This trend plays into an analysis published by crypto analyst TehThomas, who had forecasted the rejection from $110,000. But what’s more interesting is where Thomas sees the price going from here. Bitcoin Could Drop For Shallow Pullback In the analysis, Thomas explained what is happening with the Bitcoin price and why the pullback could happen. This begins with the breakout after falling toward $100,000 and then bouncing back again. The digital asset was able to quickly clear multiple fair value gaps on the 4-hour timeframes to claim its spot above $110,000. Related Reading: Positioning For Altcoin Season: Analyst Reveals When To Buy As Bitcoin Dominance Rises The crypto analyst explains that this move has triggered a shift in the sentiment toward the positive, and this has been followed by rising volumes, as well as impulsive candles. In all, this is quite bullish for the cryptocurrency. However, there is still a risk of a price decline from here. After filling multiple fair value gaps with strength, the crypto analyst believes this has set a precedent for the Bitcoin price. He expects the same pattern to play out for the cryptocurrency, which includes a rapid rise before a shallow pullback, and then a continuation from there. BTC Pullback Into $104,000 Territory The Bitcoin price recovery above $110,000 seems to have created a fair value gap below $107,000, which the crypto analyst believes will need to be filled. If this is the case, then it is possible that the price rally will not continue until this condition is fulfilled. Nevertheless, a pullback to the level would not be bearish, but rather provide a bounce-off point for the price recovery. Related Reading: XRP Price: Analyst Says Expect Biblical Move Before Historic Crash – Here Are The Targets Thomas referred to this trend as “a classic breakout-fill-continue sequence”, and the next thing in line is to fill the fair value gap. According to the shared chart, the crypto analyst sees the pullback taking the price back down below $105,000 and into the $104,000 territory before its next bounce. This would mean a 5% pullback, and going by the trends from this year so far, something that would be bad for altcoins. However, the conclusion remains that Bitcoin is still bullish from here. Once the fair value gap is filled, a strong push upward is expected, possibly toward new all-time highs. “I’m expecting a controlled retracement to fill the new 4H imbalance, after which price could continue pushing toward the major resistance area,” the analyst said. “The momentum is clean and structured—until that changes, continuation remains the more likely path.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-risks-pullback-105000/,"ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T09:29:30,"Ripple CTO On Why XRP Is Different and Better","Ripple CTO David Schwartz has explained how XRP Ledger stands apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum by doing what matters to financial systems. Blockchain technology has taken many forms since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2009. Some networks are designed to be simple and unchanging. Others embrace open-ended complexity, mostly existing without proper direction or utility. However, not every blockchain project follows those extremes. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is an example of a network with a clear purpose, as it was designed to serve real-world financial needs with speed, cost-efficiency, and reliability. In a video shared by XRPL validator and crypto figure Vet (@Vet_X0), Schwartz outlined the differences between these networks, emphasizing how design choices made over a decade ago continue to define XRP’s unique position today. I really liked this slide by David on how the XRP Ledger is differentiated. pic.twitter.com/6kkrkxkjVC — Vet (@Vet_X0) June 11, 2025 A Different Philosophy from the Start Schwartz began by contrasting XRP’s goals with those of its predecessors. Bitcoin, he said, was created as a way to store and transfer value. “That’s useful,” he added, “but that’s about all it does.” Its strength lies in its simplicity and security, but that also limits its flexibility when compared to XRP . Ethereum took the opposite approach by enabling smart contracts and decentralized application development. It allowed anyone to build and deploy apps directly on the blockchain, creating a highly programmable but complex system. This turned Ethereum into a general-purpose platform, but one that comes with unpredictable transaction fees and performance bottlenecks. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP was designed to operate between those two extremes, being less rigid than Bitcoin, but more focused than Ethereum. It wasn’t trying to build an open app ecosystem. It was built specifically to optimize payments and related financial functions. As a result, many market participants believe Bitcoin and Ethereum can’t compete with XRP in the payment space. Choosing Purpose Over Scope From its launch, XRP prioritized fast transaction finality, low and predictable fees, and enterprise-level integration capabilities. Schwartz emphasized that these were not afterthoughts or side benefits, but were central to the network’s architecture. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously stated that XRP was designed by engineers who recognized Bitcoin’s flaws , and this focus allows the digital asset to meet the needs of financial institutions, payment processors, and developers building financial tools. Its performance characteristics have made it attractive to institutions for cross-border payments, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and many other services, especially in environments where reliability and cost control are non-negotiable. Rather than chasing general-purpose blockchain use cases, XRP maintains a tight focus on financial applications. The digital asset was not designed to do everything, but that’s precisely why it does its job well. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

2025-06-12T09:15:32,"‘Winter’s Not Coming Back’: Michael Saylor Says Bitcoin Primed To Skyrocket to $1,000,000 – Here’s Why","The founder and executive chairman of software firm Strategy, Michael Saylor, believes Bitcoin ( BTC ) could skyrocket to a seven-figure price. In a new Bloomberg interview, Saylor says Bitcoin could explode by around 815% from the current level. According to Saylor, the boom-and-bust cycles associated with Bitcoin will no longer be experienced. “Winter’s not coming back. We’re past that phase. Bitcoin’s not going to zero, it’s going to $1 million.” The Strategy founder says his bullish thesis for Bitcoin is informed by the fact that Bitcoin has now been embraced by the US government and banks, as well as increasing demand. “…the President of the United States has determined he supports Bitcoin. The cabinet supports Bitcoin, [U.S. Treasury Secretary] Scott Bessent supports Bitcoin, [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chair] Paul Atkins has shown himself to be an enthusiastic believer of Bitcoin and digital assets, [Commodity Futures Trading Commission chair nominee Brian] Quintenz at CFTC feels the same way. The banks are going to custody Bitcoin. Bitcoin has gotten through its riskiest period, the accounting has been corrected. There’s now only 450 Bitcoin a day available for sale by natural sellers, that’s the miners. At this level, that works out to about $50 million of Bitcoin available for sale every day. If that $50 million is bought, then the price has got to move up to find any seller that’s price sensitive.” Bitcoin is trading at $109,260 at time of writing. ?
