2025-06-12T13:50:35,"Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Presale at $7 Could Replicate Early Bitcoin’s 10,000% Gains","The post Bitcoin Price Prediction Experts Agree: Bitcoin Solaris Presale at $7 Could Replicate Early Bitcoin’s 10,000% Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Imagine stumbling upon Bitcoin in 2010. A $100 investment could have morphed into millions by today. That window may be closed, but crypto experts now whisper about a similar generational opportunity: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Currently in presale at just $7, analysts believe its unique fusion of Bitcoin’s security with next-gen scalability could ignite returns reminiscent of Bitcoin’s legendary 10,000% ascent. With its presale rocketing past $4.1 million and over 11,000 users seizing early positions, the momentum is undeniable. Could this be your second chance at crypto history? Beyond Bitcoin: The Foundation for Exponential Growth Bitcoin revolutionized finance, proving digital scarcity and decentralized value. Yet, its limitations – slow transactions, high energy costs, and limited programmability – created room for evolution. Enter Bitcoin Solaris. It doesn’t replace Bitcoin; it builds upon its legacy with a revolutionary dual-layer architecture designed for the modern world. This isn’t just another altcoin; it’s engineered to solve the bottlenecks holding back mass adoption and user wealth creation. The Engine Room: How BTC-S Outpaces the Past Bitcoin Solaris’s power lies under the hood. It’s a groundbreaking hybrid consensus mechanism that merges the ironclad security of Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) base layer with the blazing speed and efficiency of a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) Solaris Layer. Base Layer (PoW): Utilizes battle-tested SHA-256, compatible with existing Bitcoin mining hardware, ensuring robust security and decentralization. Blocks settle every 5 minutes, anchoring the network. Solaris Layer (DPoS): Where the magic happens. 21 elected validators process transactions with 2-second finality, enabling over 100,000 TPS – dwarfing traditional blockchains. Validators rotate daily, and malicious actors face slashing, maintaining integrity. Cross-Layer Synergy: Critical state updates and validator sets are immutably logged on the secure Base Layer, creating a trustless bridge between security and speed. This architecture delivers enterprise-grade scalability (100,000+ TPS) alongside Bitcoin-grade security, enabling complex applications previously impossible on legacy chains. Your Path to Wealth: Mining, Staking & The Presale Advantage Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just tech; it’s a wealth-generation platform accessible to everyone. Forget expensive mining rigs and soaring electricity bills: Democratized Mobile Mining: The upcoming Solaris Nova app promises to turn any smartphone into a potential mining device, leveraging the Solaris Layer’s efficiency. Earn BTC-S simply by participating. Powerful Staking Rewards: Holders earn substantial yields (20% of all block rewards) by staking BTC-S. Dynamic APY and compound rewards incentivize long-term participation, growing your holdings passively. The $7 Presale Opportunity With a current presale price of $7 and a planned launch at $20, early entry offers a potential 233% gain at launch. Add the 9% bonus and long-term growth potential, and the 10,000% analogy starts to make sense. Phase 7 is ending soon, with the price rising to $8, and only about seven weeks remain before the July 31, 2025, launch. Over $4.1 million has been raised and 11,000+ users have already secured their positions, recognizing this as one of the market’s fastest and most explosive presale opportunities. The Fastest-Growing Crypto of 2025? Explore BTC-S Now Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Solaris: Mining Evolution Feature Bitcoin Mining Bitcoin Solaris Mining Accessibility Specialized ASICs Only Smartphone (Solaris Nova) Energy Consumption Extremely High Highly Efficient Barrier to Entry Very High (Cost/Tech) Very Low Primary Reward Block Rewards Block Rewards + Staking Potential ROI Mature, Lower Growth Early Stage, High Growth Why Crypto Insiders Are Buzzing: Performance Meets Potential The hype isn’t baseless. Bitcoin Solaris tackles crypto’s trilemma – security, scalability, decentralization – head-on. Its Solana-inspired smart contracts (built in Rust) unlock a vast ecosystem: DeFi protocols handle lending, borrowing, and high-speed DEXs. Enterprise solutions for supply chains and digital identity. Thriving NFT markets and play-to-earn gaming with negligible fees. Real-world applications in IoT, healthcare, and governance (DAOs). Coupled with its staggering throughput and mobile-first approach, this positions Bitcoin Solaris for mass adoption. Influencers and deep-dive analysts are taking notice. Detailed reviews breaking down its unique value proposition are emerging from voices like 2Bit Crypto and Ben Crypto , further validating the project’s potential to reshape the landscape. Security You Can Trust: Audits and Transparency Building a foundation for massive growth requires unshakeable security. Bitcoin Solaris prioritizes this with: Resistance to 51% attacks via its robust PoW base layer. Byzantine Fault Tolerance on the Solaris Layer. Mitigations against long-range attacks. Optional Zero-Knowledge Proof privacy. Its commitment is proven: comprehensive audits by leading firms Cyberscope and Freshcoins provide independent verification of the protocol’s resilience. Transparency is further ensured through public dashboards and open-source tracking of rewards and network operations. The Final Verdict: A Unique Moment in Crypto Early Bitcoin investors saw life-changing gains by recognizing its potential early. Bitcoin Solaris presents a similar opportunity but with solutions to Bitcoin’s limitations. Its hybrid consensus ensures unmatched speed and efficiency, while mobile mining and staking create new ways for users to build wealth. With a presale price of $7 ahead of its July 31st launch at $20, it offers a structured entry point for early adopters. With over $4.1 million raised and 11,000+ users onboarded, Phase 7 is closing fast, making early access increasingly limited. While history never repeats exactly, the potential for extraordinary growth with Bitcoin Solaris is undeniable.

2025-06-12T13:40:48,"Bitcoin Price: How Subdued US Inflation Could Fuel an EXPLOSIVE Rally","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: How Subdued US Inflation Could Fuel an EXPLOSIVE Rally Are you watching the Bitcoin price with anticipation? Recent economic data out of the United States suggests that a key hurdle for further upward movement might be easing. According to a leading crypto strategist, cooling US inflation could be the catalyst the crypto market needs to ignite the next phase of its rally. The Inflation Factor: Why It Matters for the Crypto Market Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services are rising, plays a significant role in the broader financial landscape, and increasingly, in the crypto market . When inflation is high, central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve often raise interest rates to cool down the economy. Higher interest rates can make riskier assets like cryptocurrencies less attractive compared to safer investments like bonds or even cash. Conversely, when US inflation shows signs of cooling, it can signal to the market that the central bank might slow down or even reverse its rate hikes. This potential for ‘policy easing’ can increase liquidity in the system and make investors more willing to take on risk, often benefiting assets like Bitcoin. Matt Mena, a crypto research strategist at 21Shares, highlighted this connection in a recent communication. He pointed to the latest U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data for May, which registered a 2.4% year-over-year increase. This figure came in slightly below the forecasted 2.5%, a subtle but potentially significant signal that inflationary pressures might be moderating faster than expected. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Targets on the Horizon Based on this improving economic outlook, Mena offered some compelling price targets for Bitcoin. While acknowledging the inherent volatility of the market, he suggested that a sustained break above the resistance zone of $105,000–$110,000 could pave the way for rapid ascent. Initial Target: A move towards $120,000 following a decisive break of the $105k-$110k range. Mid-Term Target: Potentially reaching $138,500 by the end of summer. Long-Term Outlook: A bullish scenario where the Bitcoin price could even touch $200,000 by the end of the year is now considered a possibility, fueled by continued positive macro trends and increasing adoption. These predictions underscore the strategist’s view that the current environment is becoming increasingly favorable for significant upside movement. Beyond Inflation: Other Macro Factors at Play While US inflation is a critical piece of the puzzle, it’s not the only macro factor influencing the outlook for Bitcoin. Mena also cited broader improvements in macroeconomic clarity as contributing to a more positive sentiment. This clarity reduces uncertainty for investors and institutions, making them more comfortable allocating capital to the digital asset space. The potential for central banks globally to shift towards more accommodative monetary policies further supports this trend, suggesting an environment where risk assets could thrive. The Rise of Institutional Adoption A key driver Mena expects to accelerate capital inflows is the continued rise in institutional adoption . We’ve already seen significant steps in this area, particularly with the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. Mena anticipates this trend will only strengthen, with: Increased participation from traditional financial institutions. Growing interest from corporate treasuries looking to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Continued rollout of state-level Bitcoin reserve programs within the U.S. These developments represent substantial new sources of demand for Bitcoin, which Mena believes will significantly boost ETF inflows in the coming months. Higher ETF inflows directly translate to more BTC being bought and held, reducing supply on exchanges and potentially driving the Bitcoin price higher. Putting It All Together: A Bullish Case for Bitcoin The confluence of cooling US inflation , improving macroeconomic clarity, the potential for policy easing, and accelerating institutional adoption paints a decidedly bullish picture for the crypto market , specifically for Bitcoin. While volatility is always a factor, the foundational elements for a significant rally appear to be falling into place. Investors are keenly watching economic indicators and capital flows, as these macro factors are expected to play a crucial role in determining whether Bitcoin can reach the ambitious targets outlined by strategists like Matt Mena. Summary: Navigating the Path Ahead In summary, the recent dip in US inflation is viewed by strategists at 21Shares as a potential green light for a substantial Bitcoin price rally. Coupled with growing institutional adoption and a clearer macroeconomic picture, the conditions are becoming increasingly ripe for Bitcoin to test new highs. While the path may not be linear, the underlying macro factors appear to be aligning in favor of the digital asset, suggesting exciting times potentially lie ahead for the crypto market .

2025-06-12T13:39:19,"Spot Ethereum ETFs Mark Best Day In Four Months With $240 Million In Investments, Outpacing Bitcoin Funds","U.S.-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds pulled in $240.3 million in inflows on Wednesday, representing their best daily performance since early February, data compiled by SoSoValue shows. Ether ETFs Continue Hot Streak Data indicates that BlackRock’s ETHA led the pack, attracting $163.6 million in fresh funds. The massive inflow coincides with Ethereum’s jump above the $2,800 mark for the first time in almost four months. The last time the inflows into the nine ETH ETFs surpassed that threshold was on February 2, when investors added $276 million into BlackRock’s ETHA, and Ethereum’s price hovered at around $2,900. Fidelity’s FBTC had an inflow of $37.28 million, Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and Bitwise’s BITW also posted minor inflows. Wednesday was the 18th consecutive session with positive flows for the spot ETH ETFs, underscoring the improving sentiment towards the underlying asset. Notably, the Ether ETFs outpaced flows into their spot Bitcoin counterparts, which gathered $164.5 million inflows on Wednesday. Since they went live last July, the Ethereum products have recorded around $3.74 billion in net inflows. ETH Price Rally Imminent? According to CoinMarketCap data, Ethereum was trading at around $2,742, representing a 2.3% decline over the past day. While Bitcoin recently registered a new all-time high above $111,000, the second-biggest crypto by market cap remains over 43% below its 2021 peak of around $4,878. Despite falling out of investors’ favor and vastly underperforming BTC this year, the ETH ETFs are enjoying a resurgence as President Donald Trump’s family has, in recent months, revived interest in altcoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. That being said, the healthy flows reflect the market’s increasing optimism. The money flows could help Ether surpass its three-year-old price record in the coming months.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/spot-ethereum-etfs-mark-best-day-in-four-months-with-240-million-in-investments-outpacing-bitcoin-funds/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Ethereum|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T13:37:56,"Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee","The post Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes first committee appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News On June 12, Brazil’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill 4501/2023 passed first committee, pushing the country closer to holding $BTC as part of its national reserve. The significant move suggests the creation of a national reserve termed “RESBiT,” which allows up to 5% of the country’s foreign exchange to be allocated to Bitcoin. Key Highlights of Brazil’s Bitcoin Reserve Plan Bill Project No. 4,501 of 2024 “Provides for the formation of a Sovereign Strategic Reserve of Bitcoins by the Federal Government and other measures”, stated the proposal of the bill. The Brazil Bitcoin Reserve bill 4501/2023 was introduced by Brazilian Federal Deputy Eros Biondini and received favorable feedback of approval from the Economic Development Committee– two of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies. When the reserve was initially introduced, it aimed to back Brazil’s central bank currency using blockchain and AI for transactions. This legislation aims to create a national Bitcoin reserve that would hold up to 5% of the country’s reserve. The bill highlights that the Central Bank of Brazil and the Ministry of Finance will be the operating bodies managing reserves using stringent security protocols as cold wallets. It will be required to submit audited transparency reports to Congress every six months. The Bitcoin reserve bill also aims to diversify the Treasury’s assets by supporting a country’s central bank digital currency. What is the Brazilian Government Saying About the Bitcoin Bill? Luis Gastao, the rapporteur of the proposal and also a Brazilian Congressman, emphasised that if Brazil adopts this Bitcoin Reserve plan, it can help reduce reliance on fiat currency. He added that it could also assist in diversifying its assets. He added – “We are advocating for a cautious and gradual implementation strategy to balance the potential benefits and risks of adding Bitcoin to Brazil’s official reserves.” Final Note Additionally, this new Bitcoin reserve bill is seeking approval from the committee on technology, constitution, and finance for further consideration. If the bill is ultimately passed, Brazil will second Latin American Country, just behind El Salvador, to legally establish a bitcoin reserve. However, Brazil’s approach is considered more structured. Brazil’s initiative for a Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve can steer other nations’ tech policies. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-12T13:37:33,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Bulls Must Wait For New ATH As Rally Stalls","Bitcoin’s (BTC) push toward a new all-time high stalled after reaching $110,253. The decline comes despite encouraging US macroeconomic data. However, analysts are optimistic about a recovery and a rally to $115,000. BTC is down nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $106,943, with sellers in control. Centralized Treasuries Hold A Third Of The Bitcoin Supply A recent research report by Gemini and Glassnode has revealed that centralized Bitcoin treasuries hold around 31% of the total Bitcoin supply. Centralized treasuries, including those of governments, exchange-traded funds, and public companies, control 30.9% of the circulating supply of Bitcoin , signaling a shift towards institutional-grade infrastructure. The total Bitcoin with institutional and custodial entities stands at 6.1 million BTC , worth $668 billion at current prices. This represents a staggering 924% increase in the Bitcoin supply held by these entities over the past decade. According to Glassnode and Gemini, the jump in BTC holdings by institutional funds, governments, and treasuries shows that they view the asset as a strategic store of value. “During the same period, the spot price of Bitcoin has climbed from under $1,000 to over $100,000, reinforcing the thesis that institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a strategic asset.” Centralized exchanges hold around half of that figure and may be holding them for retail investors and individual customers. The report also stated that the top three entities across all institutional categories control between 65% and 90% of the total holdings. “In contrast, private company holdings appear more distributed, reflecting a broader base of engagement.” Bitwise CEO Believes Selling Pressure Will Vanish Once BTC Taps $130,000 Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes Bitcoin sell pressure will evaporate once the asset’s price crosses $130,000. Horsley stated in a post on X, “I think once Bitcoin breaks through $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin. Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices, are selling some. That said, once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this will peter off. And from there on, when people need liquidity, they are going to borrow from an ever-growing set of lenders. All of which will further propel the price. There's simply not going to be enough Bitcoin.” Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital founder Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could reach the $130,000-$150,000 price range this year thanks to growing demand and institutional adoption. According to Horsley, the current selling pressure is from early buyers of Bitcoin, who acquired the flagship cryptocurrency at low prices and have decided to sell some of their assets. “Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices are selling some. Once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this will peter off.” Horsley believes there will not be enough Bitcoin in the market, and holders must find alternative avenues of accessing liquidity. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a bullish note, surging past $110,000 on Monday. Sellers attempted to take control on Tuesday as the price fell to a low of $108,335 but were unsuccessful as BTC rebounded to reclaim $110,000 and settle at $110,253. However, selling pressure overwhelmed buyers on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42% to $108,687. The flagship cryptocurrency continues to trade in the red during the ongoing session, trading at around $107,400. BTC’s brief rally past $110,000 came as US Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers came in cooler-than-expected. The CPI rose 2.4% year-over-year against an expected 2.5%, while Core CPI also beat estimates, rising 2.8% against a forecasted 2.9%. Analysts expect risk assets like BTC to rally if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. However, the chances of a rate cut next week remain low as headline CPI is rising for the first time since January. Overall market sentiment around BTC remains bullish, and softer-than-expected CPI data could see BTC rebound and surge to new highs above $115,000. US Producer Price Index (PPI) data could be a BTC and crypto rally. PPI is expected to rise 0.2% month-over-month, while core PPI is expected to rise 0.3%. Lower-than-expected numbers could reinforce dovish expectations over the second half of the year. Bitfinex analysts believe BTC could reach $111,000 despite heightened volatility and a substantial decline to below $108,000 this week. Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, believes soft inflation numbers could increase the likelihood of a rate cut, giving assets like BTC a boost. The Bitfinex analyst believes this could drive the price to $111,000 even though its upside depends on the performance of the S&P 500. “ BTC’s tight correlation with the S&P 500 (30D r ~0.63) reveals its current role as a liquidity barometer rather than a volatility hedge. This correlation makes BTC highly sensitive to SPX range-bound conditions, and until the index breaks out, BTC’s upside remains constrained.” BTC started the previous week with a sharp drop to $103,768. It recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,902. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday and slipped below $105,000 on Wednesday after dropping almost 1% to $104,752. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Friday, rising nearly 3% to $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC continued to push higher over the weekend, rising 1.15% on Saturday and registering a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC rallied over 4%, surging past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settling at $110,251. The price fell to an intraday low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to register a marginal increase and settle at $110,253. Selling pressure returned on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42%. Slipping below $110,000 and settling at $108,687. The current session sees BTC down nearly 2%, trading around $107,054 as it struggles to stay above $107,000.

2025-06-12T13:34:00,"ETF With XRP, Cardano Exposure To Win SEC Approval Next Before Solana Funds, Expert Points Out","Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, has forecasted the next spot crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) to secure approval from the US. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In a recent post, Geraci suggested that an ETF directly tracking the price of Solana (SOL) may not be next in line for a green light. In his opinion, America’s top financial cop could approve a Grayscale multi-token fund containing XRP and Cardano before the spot SOL ETFs. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF To Be Approved Next? Nate Geraci believes the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund might be “first in line for approval before spot sol ETFs.” Asset manager Grayscale filed to convert the existing private fund into a publicly available exchange-traded fund last October. The SEC later acknowledged the application in late 2024. The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund, which was created in 2018, holds a crypto index portfolio comprising Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL). The fund heavily leans towards BTC with a 78.77% weighting at press time, according to the Grayscale site . The rest includes ETH with 12.40%, while XRP, SOL, and ADA take up 4.86%, 3.04%, and 0.93%, respectively. As of June 12, the fund has roughly $796 million in assets under management (AUM) and is only available to accredited investors. Observers are hopeful about its approval odds because it contains only a tiny portion of altcoins with lower liquidity. Crypto index ETFs became a focus for issuers after a hybrid Bitcoin-Ethereum fund debuted last year amid a softer stance on digital asset regulation in the US. In December, the SEC greenlighted the first batch of combo crypto ETFs sponsored by Hashdex and Fidelity. It remains to be seen whether the regulator will approve one consisting of other altcoins such as SOL and XRP. SOL ETF Approval Odds A slew of spot ETF filings from would-be issuers like VanEck, Grayscale, 21Shares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital suggest strong demand for regulated SOL investment vehicles. As ZyCrypto reported earlier, Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas thinks the SEC could “act early” on Solana and staking ETF filings, pegging the approval odds at 90%. “Get ready for a potential Alt Coin ETF Summer with Solana likely leading the way.” Approval of these funds could unlock institutional capital, boost demand for SOL, and potentially propel prices higher, with some strategists forecasting targets as high as $500 .",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/etf-with-xrp-cardano-exposure-to-win-sec-approval-next-before-solana-funds-expert-points-out/,"ADA|BTC|REGULATION|SOL|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Ripple|SOL|Solana|XRP News",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T13:28:44,"Crypto is near a ‘tipping point,’ FSB chair warns","Outgoing Financial Stability Board Chair Klaas Knot has warned that crypto may pose a threat to global financial stability, citing growing connections between crypto and traditional finance. The FSB has long maintained that “crypto does not yet pose a systemic risk, but recent developments suggest we may be approaching a tipping point,” Knot said while speaking in Madrid on Thursday. He pointed to the role of stablecoins in linking the two financial systems. “Stablecoin issuers, for example, now hold substantial amounts of U.S. Treasuries. This is a segment we must monitor closely.” You might also like: Bitcoin nears all-time highs, but Google search interest is near a 5-year low. Why? Retail traders access to crypto Knot also flagged the rapid growth in retail crypto access via exchange-traded funds. “Barriers for retail users have dropped significantly, particularly with the introduction of crypto ETFs . The interlinkages with the traditional financial system continue to grow,”Knot said. While noting that crypto’s rise has been driven in part by inefficiencies in cross-border payments, Knot emphasized the need for appropriate regulation. “The crypto ecosystem will continue to evolve — and so must our regulatory frameworks.” He said jurisdictions are actively developing rules, and that “the FSB’s recommendations offer a common foundation. This is especially important given the inherently cross-border nature of crypto.” Knot also discussed parallel concerns with climate change and the financial sector’s preparedness. But he ended by underscoring the importance of global coordination across all areas: “Financial stability is an international public good. Every single issue I have mentioned today — NBFI, banking, crypto, payments, climate — they all cross borders. And so must our response be.” Knot’s term at the FSB ends June 30.

GameStop Plans $1.75 Billion Raise GameStop is set to offer a $1.75 billion convertible senior note offering. The notes, which carry no interest, will mature in June 2032, the US video game and consumer electronics retailer said , adding that the offering’s conversion price will be determined later. The offering includes an option for initial purchasers to buy an additional $250 million in notes within two weeks of the initial issuance. Notably, the notes are only available to qualified institutional buyers The company didn’t explicitly say in the blog post that the proceeds would be used to fund additional Bitcoin purchases, but said it plans to make investments in a manner consistent with GameStop’s investment policy in addition to potential acquisitions. Gamestop announced in March that it had updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin’s use “as a Treasury Reserve Asset.” GameStop’s move to adopt the world’s oldest and largest crypto as a treasury reserve asset reflects a growing trend among public and private companies turning to Bitcoin to safeguard cash reserves or reposition themselves as Bitcoin acquisition vehicles. GameStop Recently Purchased $500 Million in BTC GameStop completed its initial offering of convertible senior notes in early April, a $1.5 billion offering that left GameStop with $1.48 billion in net proceeds. Part of the proceeds was used to scoop up 4,710 Bitcoin — worth $513 million at the time — on May 28. The company’s 4,710 Bitcoin stash currently positions it as the 13th largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data tracked by BitcoinTreasuries.NET. However, GameStop’s shares have tumbled over 9% from $28.36 since the company signaled that it plans to accumulate Bitcoin on March 26. The latest offering follows GameStop’s latest earnings report, which shows lackluster year-over-year sales. Moreover, its first-quarter revenue fell 17% to $732.4 million, down from $881.8 million a year ago. After falling more than 5% in Wednesday’s trading session, the company’s stock dropped another 10% in after-hours trading following the poor Q1 earnings.

Binance Now Offers Service in Syria: Years of Access Blockage Comes to an End This has given millions of Syrian users, who have been excluded from the digital asset economy for years, the opportunity to join Binance’s global network of over 270 million users. In the past, Binance was unable to provide services to users in Syria due to US sanctions.

2025-06-12T13:23:31,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is This BTC’s Last Pullback Before Another All-Time High?","Bitcoin faced slight rejection at the crucial $111K resistance range, heading south by several grand. Nevertheless, the price is likely experiencing a corrective stage, expecting to find support soon and initiate another impulsive surge toward the $111K ATH. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC encountered slight rejection at the key $111K resistance region, signaling profit-taking by market participants at this critical level. However, the price has now entered a daily Fair Value Gap (FVG) between $106K and $108K, an area typically associated with strong demand and buying interest. This zone may provide the necessary support to halt the current corrective phase and trigger a bullish reversal. If Bitcoin manages to hold above this FVG, the price could soon resume its upward momentum, potentially initiating a fresh impulsive rally toward the $111K all-time high. However, a breakdown below the $106K-$108K FVG would increase the likelihood of a deeper correction, with the $100K level emerging as the next major support. Broadly speaking, BTC remains range-bound between the $100K support and the $111K resistance. While a breakout from either boundary could lead to a significant directional move, current market structure suggests a higher probability of an eventual bullish move, possibly setting a new all-time high in the coming months. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Bitcoin faced rejection from a critical order block near the $110K level, reflecting renewed selling pressure. This rejection has initiated a short-term bearish retracement, pushing the price toward a key support zone. This zone includes a 4-hour order block between $106K and $105K, which coincides with a potential retest of a previously broken bullish flag pattern. A successful pullback to this region would validate the earlier breakout and set the stage for a renewed bullish surge. This move could mark the beginning of another upward impulse toward uncharted territory above $111K. Nonetheless, the price action around this support zone is critical. If Bitcoin fails to hold this level and breaks below the order block, the bullish scenario will be invalidated in the short term, increasing the risk of a correction down to the $100K support level. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets Recent on-chain activity indicates a strengthening case for Bitcoin’s continued uptrend, with key metrics showing reduced exchange supply and growing confidence from long-term investors. Data from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, reveals a notable trend: since June 6th, over 7,000 BTC have been steadily withdrawn from the platform. This consistent outflow, illustrated by a series of negative netflow days, suggests that investors are increasingly opting to move their holdings into cold storage rather than keeping them on exchanges for immediate trading. Such behavior typically signals a shift toward long-term holding and reduces the volume of Bitcoin readily available for sale, easing sell-side pressure on the market. This development coincides with increased accumulation from long-term holders. Together, the combination of significant BTC outflows from Binance and aggressive long-term accumulation paints a bullish picture. With fewer coins available for trading, reduced selling pressure, and signs of renewed investor confidence, the broader on-chain and technical landscape indicates a favorable setup for Bitcoin’s continued upward movement.

2025-06-12T13:20:39,"Russia floats fines and seizures as punishment for illegal miners and crypto payments","Authorities in Russia prepare to slap hefty fines on miners minting digital currencies outside the law, following the recent bust of large-scale illegal mining operations in Siberia. The penalties will be introduced through legislative changes, the authors of which have also taken the opportunity to target the use of cryptocurrencies for payments. In both cases, offenders may expect to have their coins seized by the state. ‘Gray’ miners to pay up to 2 million rubles for breaking the law The Russian government intends to go after illegal mining activities believed to be causing energy shortages and power grid breakdowns in a number of regions. Moscow wants to punish the so-called “gray” miners with serious fines and confiscation of the mined crypto. According to amendments to the country’s Code of Administrative Offenses drafted by the Ministry of Digital Development, companies involved in such operations will pay the state between 1 million and 2 million rubles ($25,000), the Russian-language edition of Forbes unveiled this week. Penalties for individual entrepreneurs and officials will range from 200,000 to 400,000 rubles ($5,000) while private citizens mining in their basements and garages will be fined between 100,000 and 200,000 rubles ($2,500), the article detailed. The existence of the bill, which is yet to hit the floor of the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, was confirmed by Anton Gorelkin, deputy chairman of the parliamentary Committee on Information Policy, IT and Communications. Speaking to the business news portal RBC on Wednesday, the lawmaker revealed that the legislation stipulates the seizure of the illegally minted cryptocurrency, insisting that the changes should be approved “as soon as possible.” Russia seeks to impose ‘painful penalties’ for crypto payments The authors of the draft law have also sneaked in a text imposing similar monetary punishments and coin confiscation for any citizen or business using cryptocurrencies for payments outside Russia’s special legal regime that allows limited crypto settlements in foreign trade. In this case, fines may reach 1 million rubles for companies, 400,000 rubles for officials trespassing the law, and 200,000 rubles for ordinary Russians using Bitcoin and the like to buy goods and services instead of spending the only legal tender in Russia, the ruble. This kind of liability is “quite tough” against the general background of the code, Director Bank of Russia ’s legal department, Andrey Medvedev, admitted in May, while emphasizing: “But the key thing is that the digital currency that will be illegally used as a means of payment will be confiscated. This will be the most painful phenomenon.” Large illegal mining farms busted in Siberia Crypto mining was legalized in Russia last year. Legal entities and entrepreneurs engaged in the business are required to register with the Federal Tax Service, while private persons can mine without registration as long as their monthly electricity consumption does not exceed 6,000 kWh. Russian miners are also obliged to report the mined cryptocurrency to the Federal Financial Monitoring Service ( Rosfinmonitoring ), and failure to do so will also result in financial fines in the future. Growth in the industry has caused energy deficits in parts of the country, and the government in Moscow has already imposed a blanket ban on mining in 11 Russian regions, from the Far East to the Caucasus and the occupied territories of Ukraine. However, Duma member Anton Gorelkin is convinced that illegal crypto farms are the ones to blame for the excessive load on Russia’s power grids. The current mining prohibition does little to combat them, he said, noting that the restrictions primarily affect “white” miners. His statements and the news of the heavier penalties for illegal mining come after the discovery of two of the largest “gray” mining farms to date in Irkutsk earlier in June. Law enforcement officials found and seized a total of more than 4,700 mining devices operating at two separate sites in the Siberian Oblast, which has banned mining in its southern half.

2025-06-12T13:17:38,"Bitcoin Bulls Defend $100K as US-China Trade Deal Adds Pressure","Bitcoin is under renewed pressure as markets respond to the latest developments in the US-China trade deal. The proposed tariffs—now reportedly at 55%—are raising concerns among traders and economists, putting Bitcoin’s stability under the microscope just as it consolidates below all-time highs. Keith Alan, co-founder of Material Indicators, suggests that these geopolitical tensions may be more influential on Bitcoin’s short-term price than recent macroeconomic data, such as the CPI inflation report. Tariffs Seen as Major Economic Headwind “Despite having a relatively positive economic report, and news that we almost have a trade deal with China, TradFi and Crypto Markets were slightly down on Wednesday,” Alan wrote on X. He pointed to the sudden jump in tariffs from 30% to 55% as a likely driver of uncertainty. “55% is going to be felt throughout every aspect of the U.S. economy and it isn’t going to feel good,” he added. Liquidity Data Offers Some Optimism Despite the pressure, Alan remains cautiously optimistic. He reviewed order book data from Material Indicators’ proprietary FireCharts tool and found significant ask liquidity from $111,000 to $120,000. This data, paired with less bid liquidity below the current price, suggests bullish market structure remains intact. “TLDR: When in doubt, zoom out,” he advised, indicating that broader patterns are still favorable. Yearly Open Emerges as Key Support Level Alan identified the 2025 yearly open as a critical technical level for Bitcoin to maintain. “Support at the 2025 Yearly Open is my line in the sand,” he stated, implying that any move below this level would challenge bullish sentiment. Despite the lack of strong bids, he does not expect the market to sharply decline in the near term. “Support tests are healthy,” Alan said, showing confidence that the price structure will hold. $100,000 Psychological Level Remains Crucial Analysts across the market are now closely watching the $100,000 price level. This threshold has become a key psychological support, with potential long-term implications if it fails to hold. Alan, who has previously highlighted this level, reiterated its importance. “As I stated back in December when Bitcoin first started flirting with $100k, it will be important to see some consolidation above $100k with no wicks below to validate the R/S Flip,” he noted. Preparing for the Bear Market Ahead Beyond the current rally, analysts are considering how these support levels might serve Bitcoin in the next downtrend. Alan emphasized the role of $100,000 as a foundational level that could help structure future price floors during less bullish periods. “More importantly, this will build some structural support that could come into focus during the next bear market,” he said. Bitcoin at a Crossroads With the market digesting both macroeconomic data and trade-related uncertainty, Bitcoin’s future in the short term may hinge on its ability to hold $100,000. For now, bulls are defending that ground, with eyes on key liquidity zones and technical levels as the next chapter unfolds.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-bulls-defend-100k-as-us-china-trade-deal-adds-pressure/,"ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T13:14:17,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-12: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, COSMOS: ATOM, CELESTIA: TIA","The crypto market is back in the red after Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies lost momentum despite lower-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures. BTC was trading around $110,000 and rose to a peak of $110,350 but lost momentum after reaching this level, dropping to a low of $107,521 before rising to its current price of $107,792. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% over the past 24 hours. Ethereum (ETH) also fell into bearish territory after crossing $2,800. Increased selling pressure saw the price slip to a low of $2,762 before moving to its current level. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 2%, while Solana (SOL) slipped below $160 and is currently trading at $159, down almost 4%. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 3.60%, while Cardano (ADA) is down nearly 4%, trading around $0.692. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable declines. US Markets Rise After Positive Trade Talks, Favorable Inflation Data US markets rose on Wednesday after President Donald Trump claimed the US-China trade deal was almost done following two days of intense negotiations in London. Talks produced a tentative “framework deal,” easing tensions between the two global economies. However, the agreement still requires approval from Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Tensions between the US and China escalated after talks in Geneva, with China cutting rare earth exports while the US targeted Chinese students linked to the Communist Party. While details of the deal are unclear, both sides claim good progress has been made. Economic data also hinted at a healthier economy, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 142 points while the Nasdaq Index rose 0.4%. Trump called the May Consumer Price Index numbers “great” and demanded a full percentage point rate cut, arguing it would reduce federal interest payments. “CPI just out. Great numbers! Fed should lower one full point. Would pay much less interest on debt coming due. So important!!!” The CPI rose 2.4% year-over-year in May, slightly below the predicted 2.5%. Meanwhile, Core CPI rose 2.8%. Monthly increases also registered marginal increases, with headline and core CP rising 0.1%, missing expectations. A rate cut weakens the US Dollar and lowers the yield on traditional assets, making risk assets like crypto more attractive. It also boosts market liquidity, driving more capital into digital assets. GENIUS Act Passes Crucial Test The GENIUS Act won a crucial vote 68-30 in the US Senate, paving the way for a final vote scheduled for next Monday. If passed, the bill will be the first national regulatory framework for stablecoins in the US. The act requires stablecoin issuers to maintain 100% reserves, submit to annual audits if their market cap exceeds $50 billion, and adhere to rules for foreign issuers. The act could serve as a benchmark for stablecoin regulation in the US. Senate Majority Leader John Thune spoke favorably about the bill, adding that it will help bring crypto into the mainstream. “We want to bring cryptocurrency into the mainstream, and the GENIUS Act will help us do that.” However, not all lawmakers supported the bill. Senator Elizabeth Warren was highly critical of the bill and stated that it failed to address bipartisan amendments. She also warned of political risks linked to President Trump’s crypto dealings. Warren stated, “By passing the GENIUS Act, the Senate is not only about to bless this corruption, but to actively facilitate its expansion.” Industry leaders believe the bill could unlock institutional participation, with Yuval Rooz, CEO of blockchain firm Digital Asset, calling it a pivotal moment in crypto regulation. “The passage of the GENIUS Act marks a long-awaited shift from regulation by enforcement to regulation by clarity. It provides banks with a clear framework to confidently engage with stablecoins, unlocking stalled strategies by ensuring full reserves, regular audits, and substantive consumer protections.” Nigeria Issues Fresh Warning Against CBEX Exchange Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a fresh warning against the Crypto Bridge (CBEX) exchange. The exchange, also known as ST Technologies International Ltd, Smart Treasure, or Super Technology, has reportedly resumed operations despite lacking regulatory approval. According to the authorities, CBEX is soliciting payments from users looking to withdraw funds from the platform. The exchange is reportedly demanding $200 from users with balances exceeding $1,000, and $100 from accounts with lower balances. The SEC confirmed that CBEX and its associated entities are not registered to operate in the country. It also revealed enforcement actions had been initiated against the company and its promoters due to previous unapproved investment schemes. “The Nigerian public is accordingly advised to refrain from patronizing or transacting with CBEX or ST Technologies International Ltd (Smart Treasure or Super Technology) as they risk losing their funds.” Ukraine Mulls Crypto Asset Reserve Bill Ukrainian lawmakers have introduced a draft bill allowing the National Bank of Ukraine to include Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in the country’s reserves. The bill proposed amendments to the law on the National Bank of Ukraine to include crypto assets alongside gold and foreign currencies. The bill authorizes the Central Bank to acquire cryptocurrencies like BTC for the country’s reserves. Additionally, the bank will have full discretion over allocating portions of its reserves to crypto, how much to allocate, and when to do so. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses despite favorable Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers, as the flagship cryptocurrency fell below $108,000. BTC is down nearly 1%, trading around $107,697. BTC started the week on a bullish note, surging past $110,000 on Monday. However, it lost momentum in subsequent sessions, slipping below $110,000 on Wednesday to settle at $108,687. While BTC is trading in the red, analysts believe the asset is entering a period of volatility before a short-term rally to $111,000, thanks to several macroeconomic factors. These factors include a potential breakthrough in US-China trade talks, and softer-than-expected inflation numbers, which could support a rally. Jag Kooner, Head of Derivatives at Bitfinex, believes a possible agreement between the global economies could reduce market uncertainty and boost investor sentiment. However, he pointed out that the market could have already priced in a potential breakthrough, indicating a limited price impact. Kooner believes the most likely short-term effect will be increased volatility. The same applies to CPI numbers. According to Kooner, these developments suggest BTC could be preparing for a significant rally. “Core CPI up 0.1% m/m firms up rate cut bets, compresses real yields, and creates a vacuum above $111K for bitcoin. That move would likely be spot-driven, with ETF demand accelerating as the macro regime shifts toward easing.” Bitfinex analysts believe BTC could reach $111,000 despite heightened volatility and a substantial decline to below $108,000 this week. According to Kooner, soft inflation numbers could increase the likelihood of a rate cut, giving assets like BTC a boost. The Bitfinex analyst believes this could drive the price to $111,000 even though its upside depends on the performance of the S&P 500. “BTC’s tight correlation with the S&P 500 (30D r ~0.63) reveals its current role as a liquidity barometer rather than a volatility hedge. This correlation makes BTC highly sensitive to SPX range-bound conditions, and until the index breaks out, BTC’s upside remains constrained.” BTC started the previous week with a drop to $103,768 as selling pressure took hold. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and move to $105,902. The price lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell almost 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,752. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 3%, dropping to a low of $100,424 before settling at $101,614. Bullish sentiment returned on Friday as the price rose almost 3% and settled at $104,378. Source: TradingView BTC remained positive over the weekend, rising .15% on Saturday and 0.20% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,784. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC rallied, rising over 4% to surge past the 20-day SMA and $110,000 and settle at $110,251. The price fell to a low of $108,335 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $110,000 and settle at 110,253. Price action turned bearish on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.42%, slipping below $110,000 and settling at 108,687. The current session sees BTC down over 1%, trading around $107,483. If bearish sentiment persists, BTC could drop to $105,000. A bearish MACD suggests buyers have the upper hand. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) teased a move past $2,900 on Wednesday but lost momentum after rising to an intraday high of $2,878 as its rally halted abruptly. ETH faces resistance at around $2,850 but briefly crossed this level after its futures open interest surged to an all-time high of 15.21 million ETH. Funding rates have also risen, indicating a growing risk appetite among ETH investors. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) accounted for most of the OI growth, with the Volatility Shares 2x Leveraged ETH ETF as the main catalyst behind the increase. The surge shows that institutional investors were behind the growing leverage demand. According to a K33 Research report, the ETH equivalent exposure of ETHU rose by 305,100 ETH, while the CME’s ETH OI rose by 295,250 ETH. The report concluded, “In other words, without VolatilityShares, CME's ETH OI would have declined by 9,850 ETH over the past two months. It is concerning to see one single entity cornering such a massive share of the market on CME, and it originates from a bunch of traders thirsting for leveraged long exposure in ETH.” ETH started the previous week positively, rising nearly 3% to cross the 20-day SMA and $2,600 to settle at $2,607. The price registered a marginal decline on Tuesday but recovered on Wednesday to reclaim $2,600 and move back to $2,607. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as ETH plunged over 7%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $2,500 and settling at $2,415. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, ETH recovered on Friday, rising almost 3% to $2,479. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Saturday as the price rose almost 2% to reclaim $2,500 and settle at $2,525. However, it was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 0.57% to end the weekend at $2,511. ETH started the current week on a bullish note, rising nearly 7% to cross the 20-day SMA and settle at $2,680. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as the price rose over 5% to cross $2,800 and settle at $2,816. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,878 on Wednesday but lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.56% to slip below $2,800 and settle at $2,772. The current session sees the price marginally down, trading around $2,752. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) fell short of $170, losing momentum after reaching a high of $168 on Wednesday as markets turned bearish. SOL registered a substantial increase over the past few sessions after reports that US regulators are moving forward for spot SOL ETFs. The altcoin reclaimed $165 as selling pressure dried up, but turned bearish as volatility returned to the markets. SOL started the previous week in the red, registering a marginal decline to $165. It rose to an intraday high of $164 on Tuesday but lost momentum after reaching this level, ultimately dropping over 1% to $155. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.29% to $153. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as SOL plunged nearly 6%, slipping below $150 and settling at $144. SOL recovered on Friday, rising 2.47% and settling at $147. Source: TradingView The price remained in positive territory over the weekend, rising 1.51% on Saturday and 1.56% on Sunday to reclaim $150 and settle at $152. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as SOL rose nearly 6%, crossing $160 and the 20 and 50-day SMAs and settling at $161. The price continued to push higher on Tuesday, rising 2.44% to $165. However, it was back in the red on Wednesday, falling 2.48% to $161. SOL is down over 1% during the current session, trading at $159 after losing the $160 level. Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis Dogecoin (DOGE) started the previous week positively, rising almost 1% to $0.196. It lost momentum on Tuesday after reaching an intraday high of $201 and fell 1.58% to $0.192. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell over 2% to $0.188. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as DOGE plunged nearly 9%, slipping below $0.180 and settling at $0.171.

The current session sees DOGE down over 2%, trading around $0.189. Cosmos (ATOM) Price Analysis Cosmos (ATOM) began a rally on Friday and surged past $4.50 on Tuesday as buyers attempted a move past key moving averages and resistance levels.

2025-06-12T13:03:19,"Japanese fashion retailer ANAP buys more Bitcoin, now holds 153.4 BTC","Japanese fashion retailer ANAP Holdings Co., Ltd. has continued its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, raising its total holdings to 153.4627 BTC following two major purchases within a span of just two days. Despite a recent 10% dip in ANAP’s share price, the Tokyo-based brand has proceeded with its crypto acquisition plan, reinforcing its confidence in Bitcoin (BTC) as a long-term reserve asset. According to notices issued by ANAP Holdings, ANAP Lightning Capital, a consolidated subsidiary of ANAP Holdings, on June 12 purchased 27.5031 BTC for approximately ¥432.7 million, or $2.79 million, marking a bold step in the company’s roadmap to securing over 1,000 BTC by August 2025. The June 12 purchase followed a transaction made the day before, when the company acquired 23.06 BTC for around ¥367.2 million ($2.5 million), bringing the two-day total to more than 50 BTC. While its core retail operations remain intact, ANAP’s management has made it clear that Bitcoin (BTC) now plays a central role in its financial strategy. ANAP’s Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader financial shift Earlier this month, President and CEO Yuta Sawaki announced a full-scale pivot toward digital assets, unveiling a strategy to hold over 1,000 BTC by August 2025. Rather than relying solely on market purchases, ANAP plans to reach its target through a combination of buying and internal capital contributions. A key element of this plan is a 584.9135 BTC in-kind contribution scheduled for July 2025 from Capital T Coin Co., Ltd., which, if approved by shareholders, will lift the group’s total holdings to nearly 688 BTC. This structured approach signals a disciplined and multi-layered investment framework, designed to leverage both organic growth and strategic partnerships. In addition, far from simply hoarding digital assets, ANAP is actively developing a Bitcoin-centred business ecosystem to support and expand its crypto initiative. This includes launching a Bitcoin trading desk aimed at both retail and institutional clients, and introducing premium fashion items themed around the cryptocurrency. The group is also entering the mining support space, offering consulting and technical services to companies interested in Bitcoin infrastructure. Additionally, ANAP will execute a ¥7.625 billion Debt-to-Equity Swap in July, with support from firms like Net Prize GK, Q.L. Land, and Tiger Japan Investment, to increase crypto reserves and streamline its capital structure. By targeting a low average acquisition cost of just 0.3%, including fees, the group is positioning itself for long-term profitability in a fluctuating market. ANAP has joined a growing corporate crypto trend in Japan With the recent BTC purchases, ANAP now stands alongside other Japanese firms like Metaplanet and Remixpoint, which are also turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. Metaplanet has laid out plans to acquire as much as 210,000 BTC by 2027, while Remixpoint recently approved a $7 million Bitcoin purchase, boosting its total investment to $84 million. As more Japanese corporations explore the role of Bitcoin in their treasury strategies, ANAP’s early and assertive moves may offer a blueprint for others in the country’s corporate sector. With macroeconomic uncertainty on the rise, ANAP’s blend of fashion and finance may mark the beginning of a new era for listed companies seeking both growth and resilience through digital assets.

The purchase involved the acquisition of 78.4 million shares from La Mancha Investments in a private deal completed on June 10. The transaction is a strategic real-world expansion move to solidify the backing of Tether’s gold-backed cryptocurrency, XAUT (Tether Gold), and increase exposure to low-risk, physical assets. Strategic Real-World Expansion Through Gold Royalties Elemental Altus Royalties follows a model of royalties and streaming that allows investors to obtain exposure to gold production without mining risks. Tether noted that the model aligns with its low-risk investment thesis for consolidating the ecosystem behind its stablecoins. “This model aligns with Tether’s strategic, low-risk preference for real-world asset exposure,” the company described via press release. Option Agreement Boosts Future Investment Flexibility Apart from the initial investment, Tether entered an option agreement with AlphaStream Limited and Alpha 1 SPV Limited, a private Abu Dhabi Global Market-registered entity. The option allows Tether to purchase an additional 34.4 million shares after October 29, subject to Elemental’s agreement for redemption prior to maturity. AlphaStream and Alpha 1 SPV are private Abu Dhabi Global Market-registered entities, reflecting the global reach of Tether’s growing asset portfolio. Strengthening the XAUT Ecosystem and Digital Commodities and furthering financial inclusion and investment in emerging industries Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino emphasized that the move forms a broader plan to support Tether’s tokens by hard assets like gold and Bitcoin. “By accessing a diversified portfolio of gold royalties via Elemental, we are strengthening the backing of our ecosystem while driving forward Tether Gold and future commodity-backed digital assets,” Ardoino said. Tether has over 100,000 BTC and 80 tons of physical gold in reserve, securing the value and validity of its tokens. Tether Sees Broader Effect on Virtual and Physical Commodities In addition to its Element investment , Tether recently announced that it would open-source its Bitcoin Mining Operating System. The new operating system enables businesses to run their mining independently without the use of third-party mining software. This move, complemented by its gold and Bitcoin-backed reserves, further solidifies Tether as a pioneer in merging legacy asset classes with blockchain.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/tether-acquires-31-9-stake-canadian-gold-elemental/,"BTC|FIAT|MINING|USDT|XAUT","Altcoins|Sticky|Regulation|Tether",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T13:01:28,"JPMorgan CEO Warns: U.S. Economy May Be Heading for Trouble Soon","The post JPMorgan CEO Warns: U.S. Economy May Be Heading for Trouble Soon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The U.S. economy has stayed strong for a while, but things might get worse soon. That’s the warning from JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who says the good times might not last much longer. While markets and many experts are hoping for a smooth economic path, Dimon believes we should be prepared for a downturn. Big Support Is Gone Now Speaking at a recent Morgan Stanley event, Dimon explained that the help the U.S. economy got during the pandemic, like government spending and easy money policies, is now fading away. That support kept things stable before, but now, without it, the economy might slow down. He said we might not get a “soft landing,” which means slowing inflation without losing jobs or going into a recession. Even if we do, he thinks it won’t feel very strong. “Jobs might go down a little. Prices might go up a bit. Hopefully, only a little.” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance CEO Richard Teng Declares: Institutions Are Going All-In on Crypto , People Might Miss the Signs Interestingly, Dimon also said that most people, both regular consumers and business owners, don’t usually notice when the economy is about to shift. So even if things seem okay now, that could change quickly. He also pointed out that lower immigration could hit the labor market and slow down the economy further. Be Careful With Loans Another thing Dimon is worried about is private credit, which is when companies borrow money from non-bank lenders. If a recession happens, he says this area could face trouble. That’s why he warned investors not to rush into credit markets right now, saying, “I wouldn’t buy credit at today’s prices.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Global markets are reacting to U.S. economic uncertainty, particularly regarding trade policies. Concerns over tariffs have led to shifts, with some markets seeing pullbacks, increased volatility, and investors seeking safer assets like gold. The World Bank recently downgraded global growth forecasts. How does the current U.S. economic climate affect the crypto market? The crypto market is experiencing heightened volatility influenced by U.S. macro uncertainty, including inflation figures and trade tensions.

2025-06-12T12:58:38,"Andrew Tate Lost Over $500K Trading Crypto: Now He’s Betting Big on Ethereum (ETH)","TL;DR Tate won only 27 out of 76 trades on Hyperliquid, which resulted in a substantial loss. A recently deleted post shows a painful streak of his. He is now long on Ethereum (ETH), which is currently yielding a paper profit of around $36,500. Not the Best Win Rate According to the analytics platform Lookonchain, Andrew Tate (a well-known social media figure and former professional kickboxer) has made a total of 76 trades, and 49 of those resulted in losses. In the aftermath, his win rate stands at around 35.5%, while his operations triggered financial damage of more than $580,000. Tate now has only one open position. He is long on Ethereum (ETH) with 25x leverage, and as of this writing, this brings him a profit of approximately $36,500 (at least on paper). The liquidation price of the position is set at $1,861, representing a 32% decline from ETH’s current price level of around $2,750. The popular X user Daniel revealed that Tate showed this exact trade (which has current profitability of 138%) “to promote his reflink.” However, the influencer apparently overlooked the fact that Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange where every wallet is traceable, which is how his other unsuccessful trades were exposed. Andrew Tate just showed his hyperliquid trade that was 138.5% profitable to promote his reflink. He apparently forgot that it was a DEX, so his wallet was quickly found and discovered that he was $600,000 in the red. Now he has deleted his post… No comments needed from me pic.twitter.com/yxkRyRypax — Daniel (@CCPool_Daniel) June 10, 2025 Daniel also unveiled that Tate later deleted that post. It is worth mentioning that the former kickboxer replied by saying: “I’ll make it all back with one trade. Watch this space.” Tate’s Previous Interaction With Crypto The popular influencer is no stranger to the world of crypto. Over the years, he has spoken out against the American dollar, instead backing bitcoin (BTC). In 2024, Tate also hopped on the meme coin bandwagon. He endorsed a token called DADDY, which, during its first days of trading, experienced a substantial price increase, with its market cap briefly exploding beyond $120 million. Currently, though, the asset is in a much worse condition. The valuation is down by around 90% since the all-time high registered in July 2024, whereas the capitalization now stands at a mere $22 million.

2025-06-12T12:56:53,"Is Meta Planning a Secret Stablecoin? Senators Warren and Blumenthal Demand Answers","The post Is Meta Planning a Secret Stablecoin? Senators Warren and Blumenthal Demand Answers appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Meta’s crypto ambitions are picking up again and U.S. lawmakers aren’t letting it slide. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal have sent a pointed letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding full disclosure about the company’s revived interest in stablecoins . The timing is no accident. Their move comes just days ahead of a key Senate vote on stablecoin regulations and Meta, once burned, now finds itself back under the limelight (and not in a good way). Zuckerberg has until June 17 to respond to eight specific questions about Meta’s crypto strategy, including whether the company is planning to develop its own stablecoin or partner with existing issuers like Circle or Tether. Here are the deets. Senators Demand Clarity from Meta The letter, dated June 12, reflects growing unease in Washington over Big Tech’s creeping involvement in the financial system. “Big Tech companies’ issuing or controlling their own private currencies, like a stablecoin, would threaten competition across the economy, erode financial privacy, and cede control of the U.S. money supply to monopolistic platforms that have a history of abusing their power,” the senators wrote . Well, they aren’t wrong. Meta’s influence is already vast. Giving it control over a private digital currency could shift the balance of economic power even further and lawmakers want to stop that before it starts. What Zuckerberg Is Being Asked to Reveal Warren and Blumenthal’s questions cover a wide range of concerns. They want to know which crypto companies Meta is speaking with, whether it’s planning to launch its own stablecoin, and what kind of lobbying the company is doing around digital asset regulation. They’re also seeking Meta’s position on legislation that would restrict Big Tech from controlling stablecoin infrastructure. This is about drawing a line on how far tech giants should be allowed to go in reshaping the future of money. When you look at it that way, it makes a lot of sense. Libra, Diem… and Now What? Meta’s history with stablecoins is already complicated. Back in 2019, it unveiled Libra – later renamed Diem – with plans to create a global digital currency. That effort collapsed under intense political and regulatory pressure. By 2022, the project was shelved and its assets were sold off. But recent reporting suggests Meta might not be done with crypto just yet. A May 8 investigation revealed that Meta has been quietly discussing stablecoin integrations across its platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram, with several crypto companies. That raised questions about whether Meta is considering another stablecoin push, either through partnerships or a new in-house product. The Trump Factor: Will the GENIUS Act Help Meta? One of the senators’ biggest concerns centers on the GENIUS Act , a proposed bill that could give the President power to grant regulatory waivers to certain tech companies. Warren and Blumenthal warn that Meta could use this route to bypass strict rules particularly if Trump decides to support the company’s crypto plans. If that happens, Meta could gain an advantage that other stablecoin issuers won’t have. “If Meta controlled its own stablecoin, the company could further pry into consumers’ transactions and commercial activity,” the senators warned, adding that the company could exploit financial data for targeted ads or sell it to third-party brokers. That does not sound good. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : JPMorgan CEO Warns: U.S. Economy May Be Heading for Trouble Soon , Meta Says “No Stablecoin” – But the Signs Say Otherwise Publicly, Meta insists it has no stablecoin plans. Communications director Andy Stone stated the Diem project is “dead” and said there’s “no Meta stablecoin.” But behind the scenes, signs suggest otherwise. According to Fortune, Meta has been in talks with multiple crypto firms to explore payment options powered by stablecoins. Two key players have emerged: Matt Cavin, a former Web3 gaming executive now at Circle, and Ginger Baker, Meta’s VP of Product with deep roots in crypto including past roles at Ripple and the Stellar Development Foundation. Both are reportedly involved in discussions focused on building cost-effective, cross-border payment systems. Hmm, interesting. Who Gets to Shape Digital Finance? What happens next could do a lot. The Senate is preparing to vote on stablecoin regulation, and the outcome will likely influence how companies like Meta move forward. For lawmakers like Warren and Blumenthal, keeping Big Tech in check is about preventing long-term dominance in a sector that touches every corner of the economy.

2025-06-12T12:51:35,"Bitcoin Touches $110K as Traders Eye $107K Pullback Before ATH Bid","As BTC traverses $107,686 , some analysts believe this pullback from the $110,000 zone is needed to shake off weak hands. Is the $107,000 Zone the Stepping Stone Towards New Historic Highs Given that Bitcoin recently came just a little shy of breaching its ATH after soaring past $110K, the apex cryptocurrency might be witnessing the calm before the storm as it seeks to scale new heights. Calling out this development , renowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe stated, “Bitcoin accelerated after the first breakout above $106,500 and we ran all the way towards $110,000. You can also see that the breakout above $108,900 accelerated price action (in this case to $110,500). The first period of consolidation typically lasts a few days.Then, we're going to have the next breakout above the ATH. Ideal zone to buy? I would estimate around $107,000-$ 108,000.” Therefore, the market analyst sees a buy-the-dip scenario playing out, which will be instrumental in enabling Bitcoin surpass its present ATH of $111, 814 set on May 22 this year. Market analyst Crypto King is also of a similar opinion that Bitcoin’s all-time high target is just a stone’s throw away because there are no signs of overheating. This is because on-chain data indicate no significant profit-taking from major holders since whales are most probably waiting for higher price levels. Crypto King added that with strong holder conviction, Bitcoin still had room to grow and soar to a new ATH this cycle. Therefore, time will tell whether the present BTC pullback will ignite the fire needed to set a fresh historic high price above $112K. How Institutional Capital, ETFs, and Corporate Treasuries Are Driving Sustained Bitcoin Buying Pressure In recent years, Bitcoin has evolved from a niche digital asset into a major financial instrument, increasingly influenced by institutional players. Three key forces—institutional capital, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and corporate treasuries—are now generating sustained buying pressure on Bitcoin, reshaping its market dynamics. Institutional Capital: From Skepticism to Strategic Allocation Institutional investors, including hedge funds, pension funds, and asset managers, have shifted from skepticism to strategic Bitcoin allocation. This shift is driven by inflation concerns, diversification needs, and the growing legitimacy of Bitcoin as “digital gold.” Institutions bring massive capital inflows and a long-term investment horizon. Unlike retail investors who may react to short-term volatility, institutions tend to hold their positions, reducing sell-side pressure and supporting steady price appreciation. ETFs: Making Bitcoin Accessible The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets like the U.S. has further boosted buying activity. ETFs allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without owning or managing the underlying asset. These financial products simplify access and align Bitcoin investment with traditional financial systems. Every dollar that flows into a spot ETF represents a direct purchase of Bitcoin, thereby creating constant upward demand. As ETF inflows grow, particularly from retirement accounts and institutional portfolios, this demand becomes a structurally persistent force in the market. Corporate Treasuries: Strategic Reserves in Bitcoin Corporations are increasingly turning to Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. High-profile examples like MicroStrategy and Tesla have paved the way, citing concerns over fiat devaluation and the search for yield in a low-interest environment. For instance, MicroStrategy recently increased its Bitcoin portfolio to 582,000 BTC . When corporations allocate a portion of their treasury into Bitcoin, they effectively remove that supply from circulation for the long term. This trend reduces the available float of Bitcoin, tightening supply and magnifying buying pressure, especially in a market with a fixed supply cap of 21 million coins. South Korean entertainment giant K Wave Media recently revealed plans to roll out a $500 million Bitcoin treasury investment. Conclusion The convergence of institutional capital, ETFs, and corporate treasury adoption is transforming Bitcoin’s demand profile. These players bring scale, credibility, and long-term commitment, making buying pressure more resilient and less speculative. As these trends deepen, Bitcoin's price dynamics are likely to become increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors and institutional strategies—marking a new era of maturity and sustained demand in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, as Bitcoin witnesses a pullback at the $107K level, the crypto community continues to wait with bated breath whether a fresh ATH is on the horizon.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9548/bitcoin-touches-110-k-as-traders-eye-107-k-pullback-before-ath-bid,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T12:50:17,"Bitcoin Institutional Adoption: Massive Shift Sees Nearly One-Third of Supply Centralized","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Institutional Adoption: Massive Shift Sees Nearly One-Third of Supply Centralized Are you tracking the big money moves in the crypto space? A recent deep dive into the world of Bitcoin holdings has revealed a truly significant trend that could redefine the market’s future. The data points to a massive shift: nearly one-third of the entire Bitcoin supply is now held by centralized institutions. Understanding the Shift in Bitcoin Supply Distribution Recent research by Gemini and Glassnode highlights a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s journey. Their findings indicate that approximately 30.9% of the circulating Bitcoin (BTC) supply is currently held in centralized treasuries. To put that into perspective, we’re talking about roughly 6.1 million BTC, valued at an astounding $668 billion at recent prices. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it represents a staggering 924% increase over the past decade alone. This dramatic growth in Centralized Bitcoin holdings signifies a fundamental structural shift in who owns and controls a substantial portion of the world’s most prominent cryptocurrency. While Bitcoin was born from a decentralized ethos, its increasing value and legitimacy are attracting major players from the traditional financial world. Who Are These Centralized Bitcoin Holders? When we talk about ‘centralized treasuries’ holding Bitcoin, who exactly are we referring to? The research points primarily to several key categories: Governments: Various nations have seized or acquired significant amounts of Bitcoin, often from criminal activities or through strategic purchases. Public Companies: A growing number of publicly traded companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset, following the lead of pioneers like MicroStrategy. Bitcoin ETFs and Investment Products: The launch and success of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, have created massive pools of institutionally managed Bitcoin. Centralized Exchanges: While exchanges hold Bitcoin on behalf of many users (including retail), the aggregate amount held on these platforms is often categorized as centralized holdings in such analyses, even if the beneficial owners are diverse. It’s crucial to note that while exchanges hold a large amount, a significant portion of this still belongs to individual retail investors. However, the trend of governments, public companies, and investment vehicles directly holding large, single-entity stashes is undeniable and forms the core of the increase in Centralized Bitcoin holdings. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Investors Entering the Market? The motivations behind this influx of Institutional Bitcoin investors are multifaceted. For many, Bitcoin is no longer viewed solely as a speculative digital curiosity but as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Here are some driving factors: Store of Value: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and decentralized nature appeal to institutions looking for assets outside the traditional fiat system. Digital Gold Narrative: It’s increasingly seen as a digital equivalent to gold, offering a potential safe haven asset in a digital age. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a portfolio can offer diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets (though this correlation can change). Growth Potential: Despite volatility, institutions recognize the long-term growth potential of a nascent asset class gaining global acceptance. Client Demand: For asset managers and financial advisors, there is increasing demand from their clients (both individual high-net-worth and institutional) for exposure to digital assets. This strategic shift by Institutional Bitcoin investors is a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s growing place in the global financial landscape. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Market Maturity? The significant increase in institutional holdings has profound implications for Bitcoin market maturity. As larger, more strategic players enter the space, several changes are likely to occur: Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Institutional holders often have longer time horizons and are less likely to panic sell based on short-term price swings compared to some retail traders. This can contribute to more stable market behavior over time. Increased Liquidity: While institutions holding long-term might reduce the *available* circulating supply for trading, their involvement often brings deeper liquidity pools and more robust trading infrastructure. Greater Legitimacy: Institutional adoption lends credibility to Bitcoin as an asset class, encouraging further regulatory clarity and mainstream acceptance. Development of Financial Products: The demand from institutions drives the creation of sophisticated financial products and services around Bitcoin, further integrating it into the traditional financial system. The report suggests that Bitcoin is indeed entering a new phase characterized by this enhanced Bitcoin market maturity, moving beyond being purely a speculative tool towards becoming a recognized strategic asset. Comparing Institutional vs. Retail Holdings While institutional holdings are surging, it’s important not to overlook the vast number of retail investors who still hold a significant portion of the remaining supply. However, the concentration of wealth differs dramatically. Consider this simplified comparison: Characteristic Institutional Holders Retail Holders Holding Size Very Large (often thousands or millions of BTC) Small to Moderate (typically fractions or a few BTC) Motivation Strategic Treasury Reserve, Long-Term Investment, Diversification, Client Funds Speculation, Store of Value, Personal Investment, Early Adoption Time Horizon Long-Term (years) Mixed (short-term trading to long-term holding) Market Impact Potential for significant price moves with large trades, adds stability with long-term holding Cumulative impact from many small trades, often more reactive to news/volatility This comparison highlights how the increasing influence of institutional players is fundamentally altering the market dynamics and contributing to the observed Bitcoin market maturity. Challenges and Considerations of Centralized Holdings While Bitcoin institutional adoption brings many positives, the concentration of a significant portion of the Bitcoin supply distribution in centralized entities also raises important questions and potential challenges: Centralization Risk: While Bitcoin itself is decentralized, having large amounts controlled by a few entities introduces points of potential centralization regarding market influence. Single Points of Failure: Large institutional custodians could become targets for hackers or regulatory actions. Market Manipulation Concerns: Large holders could potentially coordinate actions to influence market prices, although the size and liquidity of the Bitcoin market make this increasingly difficult. Regulatory Pressure: Governments and regulators may exert pressure on large, identifiable holders, potentially impacting market access or trading rules. Understanding these aspects of Centralized Bitcoin holdings is crucial for a balanced view of the market’s evolution. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption? The trend suggests that Bitcoin institutional adoption is likely to continue. As more traditional investors gain access through regulated products like ETFs, and as more corporations consider Bitcoin for their balance sheets, the percentage of supply held by centralized entities could grow further. This ongoing shift in Bitcoin supply distribution will likely continue to shape market behavior, potentially leading to lower volatility over the long term, greater integration with traditional finance, and increased scrutiny from regulators. Actionable Insights for Investors For individual investors, this trend offers several takeaways: Acknowledge the Shift: Understand that the market is evolving. Institutional players are now a significant force. Focus on Long-Term Trends: The increasing institutional presence reinforces the narrative of Bitcoin as a long-term store of value rather than just a short-term trading instrument. Stay Informed: Keep track of institutional announcements, ETF flows, and regulatory developments, as these will increasingly impact the market. Consider Your Strategy: Re-evaluate your own investment strategy in light of these changes. Are you aligned with the long-term trends driven by institutional interest? The rise of Institutional Bitcoin investors is not just a statistic; it’s a signal of a maturing market and changing dynamics. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin The research revealing that nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s supply is held by centralized institutions marks a monumental milestone. It underscores the rapid pace of Bitcoin institutional adoption over the past decade and signals a fundamental transformation in the asset’s ownership structure. This concentration of Centralized Bitcoin holdings by governments, corporations, and investment vehicles points towards a future where Bitcoin is increasingly integrated into the traditional financial system, potentially leading to greater Bitcoin market maturity and stability. While challenges related to centralization and regulatory oversight remain, the trend is clear: Bitcoin is no longer solely the domain of early adopters and retail enthusiasts. Institutional Bitcoin investors are here, and their growing presence is reshaping the landscape of digital assets, heralding a new era for Bitcoin.

2025-06-12T12:49:11,"Billions Are Headed for Bitcoin This Summer—Best Crypto to Buy Now","Bitcoin and XRP will attract billions in capital this summer as market sentiment turns bullish and institutional flows pick up. Yet, while these two giants prepare for their next wave, Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is emerging as the standout opportunity of the season. Built on Bitcoin’s blockchain with the revolutionary PEP-20 token standard, Bitcoin Pepe unlocks native asset creation and introduces meme coin utility to BTC for the first time. Bitcoin Pepe combines lightning-fast swaps, low fees, and instant finality with the unmatched security of the Bitcoin network. With over $14m already raised, strong ecosystem partnerships, and a rumored Tier 1 exchange listing, Bitcoin Pepe is the best crypto to buy now.. Unlike traditional altcoins facing consolidation, Bitcoin Pepe offers early access to a meme-powered economy backed by real infrastructure. Bitcoin breaks out of bull flag with $144K target in sight Bitcoin has reignited bullish sentiment after breaking out of a classic bull flag pattern, a technical setup often linked to major price rallies. This breakout has sparked a surge of optimism, with analysts now projecting a move toward $144,000. The formation aligns with a strong blend of technical momentum, past price behavior, and current market imbalances. Source The recent rally pushed Bitcoin beyond the upper resistance of a descending channel, where it had been consolidating between $98,000 and $102,000. This breakout followed a sharp upward move that formed the flagpole, kicking off when Bitcoin surged toward $105,000. Market analyst ‘Merlijn The Trader’ notes that if the height of this flagpole is applied to the breakout point, it points to a projected upside near $144,000. With momentum favoring the bulls, Bitcoin is no longer just consolidating—it’s charging forward. If historical patterns hold, this breakout could lead to the next major leg of the bull run. Bitcoin Pepe unlocks meme coin power on the world's oldest blockchain Bitcoin Pepe is flipping the script on what meme coins can achieve by introducing the PEP-20 token standard. This is a major leap, allowing native asset creation directly on Bitcoin. This move mirrors the turning points seen with Ethereum’s ERC-20 and Solana’s SPL standards.

2025-06-12T12:48:18,"XRP Price Prediction: Will June 16 XRP Lawsuit Update Trigger a Breakout or Breakdown?","The post XRP Price Prediction: Will June 16 XRP Lawsuit Update Trigger a Breakout or Breakdown? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP price which was rising till June 10th alongside other altcoins, has slipped once again. This happned as the crypto market turned red as trade fears made a comeback. This fall mainly arrived due to Donald Trump’s newly confirmed unilateral tariffs, which will be imposed within two weeks. In the due time, he plans to send final tariff offers to top trade partners. This bearish market mover news came right after the U.S. – China that handshaked in London which saw modest progress. Where the said, key agreements include access to rare earth minerals and Chinese student access to U.S. universities. Such developments reduce geopolitical stress and it is typically good news for risk assets like XRP and others like BTC and ETH. However, the optimis in short-term fell short, due to Trump’s pessiistic play for the crypto sector. Cooling Inflation, But XRP Price Drops Meanwhile, U.S. CPI for May cooled to 2.4% YoY, below the 2.5% forecast. This strengthens hopes the Fed might pause interest rate hikes. It is an long-term positive update for entire top crypto and altcoin’s like XRP. On the blockchain front, XRP Ledger now supports tokenized U.S. Treasuries via Ondo Finance . Similarly, the speculation about future ETF listings also adds long-term appeal to XRP price. Despite this positive developments, XRP price suffered 4% to $2.23. As the token mirrored broader crypto losses amid renewed market caution. Ripple vs. SEC: Eyes on June 16 Apart from these broader updates, the one that is most crucial is XRP’s internal lawsuit issues. On this issue, the XRP holders are focused keenly on date June 16, which is a key procedural date in Ripple’s ongoing legal case. Earlier, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claimed the case was nearly resolved. However, Judge Torres rejected a motion from both parties due to filing errors under Rule 60. 4 Days to Go: SEC vs Ripple The Ripple vs. SEC case could finally end on June 16. This case has been a cloud over $XRP for years but a resolution could unlock massive institutional interest, ETF momentum, and global regulatory clarity. The countdown is on. pic.twitter.com/IDYWzxEpZ0 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) June 12, 2025 Now, the SEC must submit a status update to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Though not a final verdict date, this update could reshape the legal timeline. Still, any settlement will need Judge Torres’s formal approval, which could take time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Could Quietly Enter ETF Market Before Solana, Says Top Expert , XRP Price: What Comes Next? Experts believe June 16 might not bring a major XRP price rally . Much of the legal optimism is already priced in by investors. But, a further delay could put downside pressure on the XRP price. On the other hand, positive signals from court might lift short-term sentiment. Moreover, currently, XRP price shows a 0.91 correlation with Bitcoin. This means XRP tends to track Bitcoin’s moves closely, and could wait for BTC to push beyond $112K, before XRP price makes an big leap. Recently, in short-term, it faced rejection at $2.33. If Bitcoin falls to $105K, XRP price may slip to $2.15 or even $2.10. 4 Days to Go: SEC vs Ripple The Ripple vs. SEC case could finally end on June 16.

2025-06-12T12:48:07,"Bitcoin nears all-time highs, but Google search interest is near a 5-year low. Why?","Bitcoin has dominated headlines for years, smashing price records and cementing itself as a leading global asset. Yet barely anyone seems to be Googling it anymore. According to recent Google Trends data, global search interest for “Bitcoin” ( BTC ) has dropped to its lowest point in five years, even as the asset trades at an impressive $107,000, just shy of its all-time high. Historically, big price surges in Bitcoin have gone hand-in-hand with public curiosity, especially during headline-making rallies. But this time around, the internet seems unusually quiet, and there may be several reasons for it. Google Trends chart showing declining search interest for Bitcoin | Google For one, the crypto market and broader industry have matured. Bitcoin is no longer a mystery or the hyped trend it was critiqued by the public to be years ago. After over a decade of making headlines, media coverage, and numerous bull runs, the crypto market giant has proven itself, and most people now know what it is. Additionally, unlike previous bull runs driven heavily by retail excitement, BTC’s rally today is shaped by stronger forces. Institutional interest is growing, alongside other factors including exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), corporate reserves, and government adoption across nations like the United States and El Salvador . This shows that investor base has broadened, making current rallies more grounded than frenzy-driven. You might also like: $30 to $1M: How this Bitcoin investor turned spare change into seven figures Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently noted on X that the low search interest may simply reflect this shift, adding that Bitcoin is now being quietly accumulated by institutions and corporates more than retail investors. Bitcoin at $94k, yet — Google searches for ""Bitcoin"" near long term lows. This hasn't been retail driven. Institutions, advisors, corporates, and nations have come into the space. The types of investors buying Bitcoin is expanding. pic.twitter.com/Gtdh5u0bm6 — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) April 27, 2025 However, retail attention may also be elsewhere. The crypto market is becoming increasingly saturated, and memecoins, AI tokens, and other fast trends may be dominating social feeds and soaking up the spotlight, even as Bitcoin maintains its dominance. Fewer searches do not necessarily mean less significance. In fact, the silent rally is likely a healthy sign suggesting that BTC is becoming a normalized, long-term asset class rather than just a trend. Meanwhile, institutional support for the crypto market giant is stronger than ever. Ark Invest founder Cathie Wood expects BTC’s value to multiply 15x in the next five years, and corporate heavyweights like Strategy and Metaplanet continue to accumulate the asset aggressively.

Here Are the Numbers","U.S.-traded spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw net inflows of over $240.3 million on Wednesday, outpacing the $164.5 million in Bitcoin ETF inflows. This was the 18th consecutive day of positive inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. $240 Million Inflow into Spot Ethereum ETFs: Outpacing Bitcoin BlackRock’s ETHA fund led the way with $163.6 million in inflows on Wednesday, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC fund with $37.28 million, according to data provider SoSoValue. Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust and ETHE funds also saw positive inflows, while Bitwise’s BITW fund also joined the list. Interest in ETH ETFs Increases on DeFi and Regulation Signals The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) greenlight of potential exemptions for DeFi has driven investor interest in Ethereum, according to Nick Ruck, Director of Research at LVRG. “While Bitcoin is breaking records and altcoins saw all-time highs last year, investors now believe Ethereum is still undervalued,” he said. SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, speaking at the agency’s recent Crypto Task Force meeting, emphasized the need to protect personal property in the digital environment and made statements in favor of DeFi. These statements, along with stablecoin regulations and private sector developments, have strengthened interest in Ethereum. Ethereum Derivatives Trading Surpasses Bitcoin Ethereum’s derivatives trading volume has surpassed $106 billion, surpassing Bitcoin’s $80.5 billion volume on the same day, according to Coinglass data, reflecting the growing interest of institutional investors in the ETH ecosystem. The ETH price rose above $2,800 on Wednesday, reaching its highest level since February, but is down 0.34% in the last 24 hours to trade at $2,769.

Tether Investments is aiming to diversify the assets that back its stablecoin USDT, the world's largest such token with a market capitalization of $155 billion, expanding into tangible assets and precious metals, according to an announcement on Tuesday . Tether acquired 78,421,780 common shares in Elemental from La Mancha Investments, a Luxembourg-based mining investment firm. Elemental's Toronto-listed shares spiked nearly 23% to 1.77 Canadian dollars ($1.30) following the announcement. They closed at 1.53 Canadian dollars on Wednesday, 6.25% higher than before Tether's investment. At press time, Tether's stake is worth nearly $88 million. CEO Paolo Ardoino said the investment, which saw Tether take a stake of around 33.7% stake in Elemental, reflects its ""confidence in the fundamentals of gold and its critical role in financial markets."" ""Elemental's royalty model provides diversified exposure to gold production around the world, aligning strategically with our vision for Tether Gold and future commodity-backed digital asset infrastructure,"" he added. Tether referred to increasing its exposure to gold as a ""dual pillar strategy"", alongside its holdings of over 100,000 BTC ($10.7 billion). With regulation of stablecoins on the horizon in the U.S., issuers such as Tether are preparing for requirements to be compliant when it comes to the assets that back their tokens. This could extend to diversification of assets.

Elemental is a gold mining firm listed in Canada. According to a recent press release , the investment arm of the stablecoin issuer acquired a substantial amount of Elemental Altus Royalties shares from La Mancha Investment. The agreement signed on June 10 revealed that the firm has acquired a total of 78.4 million shares belonging to the Canadian-based company. The investment is meant to expand on the firm’s real-world holdings, expanding on its gold-backed digital asset XAUT ( XAUT ). Elemental Altus Royalties offers Tether ( USDT ) exposure to global gold production through a royalty and streaming model that reduces the direct operational risk that comes with mining. “This model aligns with Tether’s preference for strategic, low-risk exposure to real-world assets,” wrote the company. In addition, the investment firm signed an option agreement on the same day with AlphaStream Limited and its subsidiary, Alpha 1 SPV Limited. The private agreement gives Tether the ability to purchase an additional 34,444,580 shares after October 29, unless Elemental grants permission to redeem them earlier. Both AlphaStream and Alpha 1 SPV are privately held companies incorporated under the laws of the Abu Dhabi Global Market.

According to the notice, the stablecoin issuer currently holds more than 100,000 Bitcoin in its reserve, along with ownership of 80 tons of physical gold to support its XAUT token.

2025-06-12T12:44:50,"Inflation is up but below expectations. Will the Fed cut rates, and what does this mean for the crypto market?","On June 11, 2025, the May Consumer Price Index was released. Inflation is 2.4% (up 0.1%), which is below the predicted rate of 2.5%. Again, the U.S. officials are calling for interstate rates to be cut. How realistic is that call, and will crypto charts respond to May’s CPI? Table of Contents New data Trump-Powell standoff and tariffs Meaning for the crypto market New data The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a May CPI rate of 2.4%, 0.1 percentage points down from April’s 0.2% inflation growth. It reveals that inflation continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace. It is the lowest yearly growth since February 2021. Economists had predicted a 0.2% increase, so the CPI news was generally met as a “no inflation” signal. 📈 It's CPI day! Here's how breakfast prices stack up 🍳🥓🥯☕: The Bacon, Egg & Cheese w/ Coffee index is now at $2.99, with bacon at $1.05 leading the cost, followed by eggs at $0.75 and coffee at $0.40. Inflation still sizzles in our morning favorites! ECAN US BEC pic.twitter.com/wsyeknMMjc — Michael McDonough (@M_McDonough) June 11, 2025 The core basis, which doesn’t factor in volatile prices for food and energy, is in line with April’s 2.8%. Trump-Powell standoff and tariffs Tariffs deployed and then frozen for 90 days by Donald Trump have been seen as a factor that would drive the inflation rate up. However, the inflation turned out to be mild. The Federal Reserve’s Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have repeatedly said that the Fed is not in a hurry to cut rates and will rather monitor the situation to decide if action is required. Trump is publicly pressuring Powell, calling him names and referencing the recent European Central Bank rate cuts as a sign of Powell’s supposed error. On social media, Trump supporters allege that Trump will fire Powell. However, it is unlikely to happen, as the Fed is an independent agency with its own agenda, and the President of the United States has no power to fire the Fed chair. The U.S. Treasury head, Scott Bessent, is named as a possible successor to Powell. While keeping inflation in check is the Fed’s job, Bessent stated that the inflation is low “due to Trump.” Read more: The quiet campaign to make Scott Bessent the next Fed Chair — why crypto markets should care The primary objectives of the Fed are to keep inflation and unemployment rates in check. The agency does not have much leverage to influence these processes: it may cut or increase interest rates or print money. Following the COVID-19-induced inflation spike, the Fed is working diligently to return the U.S. inflation rate to its pre-COVID level of 2% or below. Generally, the Fed has been doing its job well. It raised interest rates in 2023 and managed to bring inflation from over 7% rate to 2.3% in April of 2025. TRUMP: FED SHOULD LOWER ONE FULL POINT — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) June 11, 2025 Trump is repeating that decreasing inflation is a good reason to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy, as it would weaken the USD, encouraging foreign countries to buy U.S. goods even amid a tariff spike. From the Fed’s standpoint, inflation remains above the level the agency aims to achieve, while tariffs are a factor that makes the Fed even more cautious, as it doesn’t want to undo all the progress made in the last five years. It’s especially notable that calling the Fed for interest cuts now, when inflation is up, not down, contradicts what the Fed stands for. Therefore, had the Fed cut the rates now, it would have been inconsistent given the Fed’s previous actions. Thus, rate cuts are unlikely. Furthermore, some believe that tariffs will eventually lead to increased inflation. Inflation is showing a significant improvement due to the risk of recession. The only thing that has kept consumer demand high is the expectation of higher prices due to tariffs. People are buying goods in advance. Once the tariffs hit imported goods in August, prices will… — Simplified Engineer (@inqtelx) June 11, 2025 Meaning for the crypto market Bitcoin has established itself as a hedge against inflation. This time around, the CPI signal is ambiguous. If we look closely at how different people react to it, we may see the full spectrum. While some view the inflation spike and fear stronger spikes as the tariffs take effect (when the 90-day pause ends), others celebrate the “low” or even “no” inflation, as it turned out to be below expectations. Given the lack of unity in the reaction to the news and the overall uncertainty, the new CPI data will likely have a minimal impact on the crypto market. One possibility, however, is that the Fed may start printing money if it decides that interest rates are too high, even though it’s still early to cut them. If it happens, investors will flock to Bitcoin and gold. The money-printer-goes-brrr situation is not impossible. In April 2025, Fed official Neel Kashkari admitted that the agency has the tools to impact the state of the economy, and many believed he was referring to printing more fiat money.

A lot. Every day. Indeed, BlackRock has been buying Ethereum every single day for more than two weeks straight, and they don’t seem to be slowing down. According to fresh data from Arkham Intelligence (June 11), BlackRock has scooped up a total of $570 million worth of ETH over the past two weeks. The buying spree is notable not just for its size, but for its consistency: BlackRock has purchased Ethereum daily for over two weeks, a pattern rarely seen from a player of this size. BlackRock ETH buys. Source: Arkham At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $2,733, and BlackRock now holds around 1.487 million ETH, currently valued at $4.06 billion. While this is still smaller than its massive Bitcoin position — BlackRock holds 662,871 BTC, worth roughly $70.98 billion, the pace of its ETH accumulation is turning heads. BlackRock ETH and BTC holdings. Source: Arkham BlackRock is buying up ETH So why is BlackRock doubling down on Ethereum right now? The timing is key. Ethereum has been gaining institutional traction amid the push for an ETH ETF approval and growing interest in staking and tokenization use cases. Meanwhile, ETH’s role in powering the next wave of decentralized finance is strengthening. For some, this signals a broader shift in how large institutions view the crypto landscape. Bitcoin remains the flagship, but Ethereum’s versatility, powering smart contracts, DeFi, and tokenized assets is making it an increasingly attractive long-term bet. As the market watches for the next big catalyst, all eyes will be on whether BlackRock continues this aggressive ETH accumulation streak in the weeks ahead.

2025-06-12T12:34:41,"Michael Saylor Reflects on Pandemic-Era Decisions That Led to Bitcoin Pivot","Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy, has revealed that pandemic-era economic restrictions and monetary policy were the key catalysts behind his decision to invest heavily in Bitcoin in 2020. In a candid conversation with Dr. Jordan B. Peterson on June 9, Saylor described the financial climate during COVID-19 not as a health crisis alone but as a “war on currency” that threatened to wipe out decades of wealth preservation. “It wasn’t the war on Covid, it was the war on currency,” Saylor said, recalling the massive economic disruption caused by lockdowns and central bank money printing. He said he saw Main Street businesses collapsing while Wall Street rebounded on stimulus-fueled market rallies. “We had hyperinflation in financial assets,” he noted, highlighting the growing disparity between working-class Americans and financial elites. From Panic to Pivot: Cash Becomes a Liability By mid-2020, Saylor said he faced a stark financial reality. MicroStrategy held $500 million in cash reserves, but near-zero interest rates rendered that capital “non-performing.” With inflation eroding purchasing power, Saylor likened his situation to choosing between “a fast death or a slow death.” Determined to protect his company’s value, he began searching for a new form of capital preservation. Traditional options like real estate and stocks had already surged in price due to the low-rate environment, and art lacked the liquidity and scalability he sought. “I need a liquid fungible asset which will store my economic energy for an indefinite period of time,” he explained. It was at this point that he began considering Bitcoin, initially with skepticism. He reached out to long-time friend Eric Weiss of Blockchain Investment Group, and then immersed himself in educational content—videos, books, and podcasts. Eventually, he came to view Bitcoin as the digital age’s version of gold : a decentralized, non-sovereign store of value. Strategy Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In August 2020, Strategy made its first Bitcoin purchase, acquiring 21,454 BTC for $250 million. That move marked the beginning of a bold strategy that would eventually make the firm the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . As of now, the company holds 582,000 BTC—valued at approximately $63 billion—according to data from the Saylor Tracker. Reflecting on the decision, Saylor underscored the urgency of preserving value in uncertain times. “It took me 30 years to accumulate the money,” he said. “Why should I give up 30 years of my life?” The post Michael Saylor Reflects on Pandemic-Era Decisions That Led to Bitcoin Pivot appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/michael-saylor-reflects-on-pandemic-era-decisions-that-led-to-bitcoin-pivot/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin Michael Saylor|Bitcoin News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T12:30:51,"Evertz Pharma’s Bold Bitcoin Bet: German Firm Adds Another 100 BTC","BitcoinWorld Evertz Pharma’s Bold Bitcoin Bet: German Firm Adds Another 100 BTC In a move that underscores the growing trend of companies integrating digital assets into their financial strategies, German cosmetics firm Evertz Pharma has once again demonstrated its commitment to Bitcoin. This latest action highlights a broader shift towards corporate Bitcoin adoption, a topic gaining significant traction in the financial world. Why is Evertz Pharma Increasing its BTC Holdings? According to reports, Evertz Pharma GmbH recently added an additional 100 BTC to its balance sheet during May. This purchase amounted to approximately $10.8 million at the time, signaling continued confidence in the cryptocurrency as a reserve asset. This isn’t Evertz Pharma’s first foray into Bitcoin; the company initially invested €2 million in BTC back in December 2020. Since then, they have consistently allocated a portion of their corporate profits towards acquiring more Bitcoin, building what is effectively a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Several factors typically motivate companies to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy : Inflation Hedge: Concerns about inflation eroding the value of traditional fiat currencies are a primary driver. Bitcoin, with its capped supply, is seen by some as a potential store of value. Potential Appreciation: Companies may view Bitcoin as an asset with significant long-term growth potential, aiming to generate returns beyond their core business operations. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify corporate reserves away from traditional holdings like cash and bonds. Forward-Thinking Stance: Embracing Bitcoin can position a company as innovative and forward-thinking in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Understanding the Trend of Institutional Adoption Evertz Pharma’s repeated BTC purchase is not an isolated incident. It fits into a larger narrative of institutional adoption that has been unfolding over the past few years. While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example with its massive Bitcoin holdings, other public and private companies globally have also started allocating capital to Bitcoin. This trend signifies a maturing market where cryptocurrencies are increasingly being considered alongside traditional assets. This growing institutional adoption provides several potential benefits: Increased Legitimacy: Corporate holdings lend credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Greater Stability: Large, long-term holders can potentially reduce market volatility compared to short-term retail trading. Infrastructure Development: As more institutions get involved, the infrastructure around buying, selling, and securing Bitcoin improves. Comparing Evertz Pharma’s Approach to Others While companies like MicroStrategy have taken a highly aggressive stance, using debt to acquire vast amounts of BTC, Evertz Pharma appears to be taking a more measured approach, using corporate profits. This indicates different levels of risk appetite and strategic goals within the corporate Bitcoin movement. Tesla’s on-again, off-again relationship with Bitcoin also shows that the path to corporate adoption isn’t always linear and can be influenced by market conditions and strategic pivots. Evertz Pharma’s consistent allocation, starting modestly and adding over time, could be a model for other smaller or more conservative companies considering a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Their initial €2 million investment in late 2020 and subsequent purchases demonstrate a sustained belief in Bitcoin’s role within their long-term financial planning. What Does This Latest BTC Purchase Mean for the Market? Every significant BTC purchase by a known entity like Evertz Pharma adds to the demand side of the market. While 100 BTC may seem small compared to the holdings of giants like MicroStrategy, cumulative corporate buying represents a steady flow of capital into the ecosystem. This consistent demand, especially from entities with long-term holding intentions, can contribute to Bitcoin’s price stability and upward potential over time. Furthermore, such announcements serve as examples for other companies that might be on the fence. They demonstrate that it is possible for businesses, even outside the traditional tech or finance sectors (like a cosmetics firm), to successfully implement a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Challenges and Considerations for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits are compelling for companies pursuing institutional adoption of Bitcoin, there are also significant challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile, leading to potential short-term paper losses that could impact financial reporting and shareholder perception. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can pose risks. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting and Tax Treatment: The accounting and tax rules for holding cryptocurrencies can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Public Perception: Some stakeholders may be skeptical or critical of a company allocating funds to a volatile and relatively new asset class. Companies like Evertz Pharma must navigate these challenges by developing clear policies, ensuring strong security protocols, and potentially educating their stakeholders about their Bitcoin treasury strategy . Actionable Insights for Businesses and Investors For businesses considering their own corporate Bitcoin allocation, Evertz Pharma’s journey offers a case study. Starting with a manageable amount, using profits rather than debt, and consistently adding to the position over time appear to be key aspects of their approach. Due diligence on security, regulation, and accounting is paramount. For investors, Evertz Pharma’s continued BTC purchase is another signal of increasing demand from non-traditional players. It reinforces the idea that Bitcoin is gaining acceptance beyond individual investors and crypto-native companies, potentially broadening its long-term appeal. Conclusion: Evertz Pharma Leads the Way for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Evertz Pharma’s latest acquisition of 100 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a reaffirmation of a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy initiated years ago. This move by a German cosmetics firm highlights the expanding reach of institutional adoption across diverse industries. While challenges remain, the decision by companies like Evertz Pharma to allocate significant capital through repeated BTC purchase events underscores a growing conviction in Bitcoin as a viable component of corporate finance in the 21st century. Their measured, profit-driven approach provides a valuable example for others looking to navigate the exciting, yet complex, world of corporate Bitcoin .
