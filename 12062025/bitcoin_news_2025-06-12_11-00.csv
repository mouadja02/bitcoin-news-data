2025-06-12T08:55:23,"CleanSpark: Sparking An Upgrade From Sell To Hold","Summary CleanSpark has increased its hashrate to 45.6 EH/s with an eventual goal of 60 EH/s. It is accomplishing this via its efficient mining operations and continuously adding power capacity. Profitability concerns despite revenue growth as Q2 2025 revenue rose 62.5% YoY to $181.7 million, but the company reported a net loss of $138.8 million. CleanSpark is now funding its operation by selling a portion of its production. This marks a shift from its earlier strategy and is less equity dilutive. CleanSpark has a strong balance sheet and could be a leverage play on Bitcoin, but high mining costs and declining rewards make the business model risky. Upgrading to “Hold” but. I’ve written about CleanSpark ( CLSK ) in the past, as I had turned bearish on the company last year. This article serves as an update to my previous one . There have been a few key developments in the company as it has grown and expanded its Bitcoin operations. The Goal to Reach 60 EH/s In a recent update for the month of May 2025, CleanSpark reported that its hashrate has increased by 7.5% to 45.6 EH/s compared to the previous month. This puts the company on track to reach 50 EH/s by June, being the only publicly listed miner to reach this threshold. As a miner, the company is operating at quite an efficient scale with a deployed fleet of over 230,000 miners and an average efficiency of 16.71 J/Th. Part of the company’s selling point to investors is that it is a pure-play, vertically integrated Bitcoin miner with an infrastructure-first growth strategy. What this means is that CleanSpark has made it a priority to own its infrastructure and not rely on third parties. This includes the power infrastructure that allows its miners to operate at high uptime and efficiency . As mentioned in the company’s investor presentation , CleanSpark is an energy professional who saw the future in Bitcoin and not Bitcoin miners who figured out power. CleanSpark Investor Relations In connection with that stated strategy, the company has also secured an additional 72 megawatts of contracted power, bringing the entire total to 987 megawatts. According to CEO Zac Bradford, the company’s vertically integrated model gives it an efficiency edge over peers. As stated in the press release; This milestone reflects the strength of our vertically integrated model, allowing us to scale efficiently, retain operational control, and protect margins. Importantly, reaching 50 EH/s is not our endpoint. We intend to continue building, and with much infrastructure already in place, we are well-positioned to achieve over 60 EH/s. We believe this execution-focused strategy will continue to drive long-term value for shareholders. Year-to-date, CleanSpark has produced a total of 3,283 BTC, of which 694 BTC were mined in May. For the month, it sold 293.5 BTC at an average price of $102,254. This represents 42% of all BTC mined during the month, with the rest being added into the company’s treasury. It is part of CleanSpark’s strategy to build up a massive Bitcoin chest and eventually book that capital gain should the price of BTC continue to rise. Currently, the company is holding 12,502 BTC, which has doubled from the same time last year. At the current price of $109,718, CleanSpark’s Bitcoin holdings are worth $1.37 billion. While it is good that the company is increasing its efficiency in terms of its hashrate, profitability remains a concern. Because of the last halving event and the way Bitcoin rewards decrease over time, this may not necessarily result in profit for CleanSpark as I will discuss further below. Quarter Results Looking at the company’s Q2 2025 quarter results shows an improvement compared to the previous year. CleanSpark reported $181.7 million this quarter, which was a large improvement of 62.5% compared to the $111.8 million reported at the same time last year. Unfortunately, this did not fall to the bottom line, as the results were worse than they were a year ago. Net loss for the quarter was $-138.8 million. This is in contrast to the Net Income of $126.7 million reported in Q2 2024. Even on an adjusted EBITDA basis, the company still showed worse performance this year compared to last, with a negative Adjusted EBITDA of $57.8 million compared to $181.8 million the same time last year. I looked through the company’s 10-Q to try to find the source of the poor quarter-over-quarter income comparables. What really stood out the most was the sharp increase in cost of revenues, which was $85.4 million for the quarter. This was more than double the $51.1 million reported at the same time last year. Management attributed these higher costs to the energy costs due to the increase in the volume of miners. This aligns with the disclosures stating that on a per kWh basis, costs moved from $0.060 and $0.043 or 39.5%, in its owned facilities where it mined the majority of its Bitcoin. The cost of mining Bitcoin has increased Management has brought up the issue of costs in the earnings call , stating its marginal cost per coin. However, as I detailed last year in my previous article, this does not include the other mining costs, most notably the depreciation of the miners. Mining rigs typically don’t last for more than 3 years; therefore, it cannot be viewed as a long-term asset in the traditional way. Taking this into account, CleanSpark’s mining cost per Bitcoin, including non-cash depreciation, is $77,783. Compared to the mining cost and depreciation of $27,007 this is close to 3x as much cost to mine and was larger than I feared. In other words, on a Gross Profit basis, Bitcoin would need to trade around $78,000 just for the company to break even based on this quarter’s results. As mentioned on the earnings call; Notably, our marginal cost per coin was approximately $42,600, a 26% increase over the first quarter. The increase in our marginal cost per coin can be attributed both to an increase in mining difficulty as well as rising power prices. Our average cost per kilowatt-hour increased during the quarter to $0.06. And as Zach mentioned, this was a result of intentionally managing to a margin rather than to a specific cost per kilowatt-hour. CleanSpark Investor Relations This circles back to a fundamental business problem with Bitcoin mining in general, that over time, you get less Bitcoin mined even as computational capacity increases. This is even worse when taking into account the every-four-year halving event, which happened last year. As shown here clearly in the quarter-over-quarter results of CleanSpark, management has greatly expanded its operations, as evidenced by its higher costs. However, since you get less Bitcoin mined over time for the same amount of power, revenue goes up more slowly than the increase in costs. CleanSpark Investor Relations CleanSpark Shifts Its Capital Strategy In a recent press release , CleanSpark has announced that it is “expanding” its capital strategy by increasing its credit facility with Coinbase ( COIN ) through its Bitcoin-collateralized lending program. In conjunction with this, the company has an institutional-grade Bitcoin treasury desk. Apart from the usual functions of managing the custodial process of its Bitcoin reserves, running a treasury desk implies certain optimization tasks. Thinking of how a normal treasury department works, these tasks and strategies include liquidity management, borrowing and lending, and portfolio/risk management. Therefore, it makes sense that it can borrow against its Bitcoin reserves to service any liquidity it may need via this credit line of $200 million. According to management, CleanSpark has now reached a sufficient scale to self-fund operations and build upon its Bitcoin holdings via the cash flow it has generated from its operations. In other words, rather than simply “holding” all the Bitcoin it has mined, a portion of the monthly production will be sold to support operations. Therefore, its treasury desk has the responsibility to strategically manage this process by deciding if it's best to sell or borrow and hold this Bitcoin. Moving back to using production to fund operations marks a shift in the company’s philosophy. In the past few years, starting mid-2023, CleanSpark has relied on equity dilution to fund its growth. The company was on a “100% hold strategy” where it would keep its Bitcoin mined and rely on fundraising for its operational expenses. In June 2023, the company had 114.8 million diluted shares outstanding. This had ballooned by 144% to 280.9 million diluted shares outstanding. Moving away from dilutive capital is a positive sign for company shareholders. Data by YCharts Using production for operations has signaled that CleanSpark has both reached the economic scale necessary to be self-sufficient and has amassed a significant amount of Bitcoin that it can utilize via its new treasury department. Currently, the company has a decent balance sheet as well, with Total Assets of $2.65 billion, of which roughly $100 million is in cash and the aforementioned $1.37 billion in Bitcoin. This is sufficient to cover its total liabilities of $766 million, of which $641.7 million is in long-term debt. The strength of CleanSpark’s balance sheet puts it in a position where it has a lot of wiggle room with its treasury department on how to properly utilize its capital. Since “mining” itself isn’t insanely profitable, a lot of the value of CleanSpark actually comes from its reserved Bitcoin portfolio. Being able to manage this portfolio to take advantage of future Bitcoin capital gains while making sure the company has enough liquidity to run will be crucial. Conclusion It is commendable that CleanSpark has stopped relying on dilutive capital raises and is now deciding to fund the business with a portion of its Bitcoin production. The company’s strong balance sheet and new treasury department will give it the nimbleness to manage and utilize its Bitcoin reserves and production. However, I still have concerns with the company and the overall business model of Bitcoin miners in general. Despite CleanSpark being an expert in energy management and efficiency, the overall production costs of Bitcoin remain quite high. I have always believed that the better play for crypto exposure would be to simply buy Bitcoin itself through one of the many now available ETFs. As seen in the chart below, CleanSpark has underperformed the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF. Data by YCharts There are certain key risks to my bearish thesis. The main one is that the company continues to become more efficient, such that it is able to further lower its energy costs. If Bitcoin prices rally sharply, then CleanSpark could end up being a decent leverage play on Bitcoin. The company currently has a “B+” valuation grade on Seeking Alpha’s quant metric due to its low forward P/E of 10.4x and low forward EV/ EBITDA of 7.45x. This is a pretty decent valuation and reflects the expectations of improved profitability in the future. Seeking Alpha However, the unknown factor that is out of the company’s hands is the hashrate, determining how many rewards miners earn. CleanSpark may be super-efficient, but if the rewards earned from mining keep decreasing at such a rate, it cancels Bitcoin price increases, then a Bitcoin ETF may still be the better play. I am upgrading my company rating, though, from a “Sell” to a “Hold.”",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794285-cleanspark-sparking-an-upgrade-from-sell-to-hold?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING","CLSK",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T08:51:53,"SEC blocks DeFi Development’s $1B Solana plan, company withdraws S-3 filing","DeFi Development Corp. has withdrawn its planned $1 billion securities offering after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission deemed the company ineligible to file under Form S-3. The company confirmed the withdrawal in a June 11 letter to the SEC, citing the absence of a required internal controls report in its most recent 10-K filing. The Nasdaq-listed firm had filed the S-3 registration in April with the aim of raising funds for general corporate use, including the purchase of additional Solana ( SOL ) tokens. The plan echoed Strategy’s well-known Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategy, with DeFi Development aiming to become a public market vehicle for Solana exposure. While no securities were issued or sold under the now-withdrawn registration, the SEC’s move is a major regulatory setback for the company’s treasury-focused crypto strategy. The SEC’s rejection highlights ongoing challenges for firms trying to navigate U.S. securities rules while building corporate crypto reserves. You might also like: Moody’s tests first on-chain credit rating system on Solana Despite the withdrawal, DeFi Development has stated that it intends to refile a resale registration at a later date, once compliance issues are addressed. The company noted that the withdrawal was “consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.” DeFi Development has already invested significantly in Solana, with reported holdings of over 600,000 SOL, valued at more than $100 million. In May, it also became the first publicly traded firm to adopt liquid staking tokens on Solana, converting part of its holdings into dfdvSOL through Sanctum’s staking infrastructure. That move was intended to allow the company to retain liquidity while earning staking rewards. Earlier this month, DeFi Development announced a strategic partnership with Amber International to expand access to Solana markets and building yield-focused treasury products. The firm has also been listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and now trades options on CBOE and Nasdaq, increasing its visibility among institutional investors. Originally focused on real estate finance, the company rebranded in April after a new team, reportedly including former Kraken executives, took over with a crypto-first strategy centered on Solana. While its billion-dollar shelf offering is on hold for now, DeFi Development appears committed to building a public-facing Solana treasury model. Its next steps will likely depend on how it addresses SEC concerns and whether regulators warm to similar strategies involving altcoins.

Most altcoins are also in the red today, with DOGE, SUI, ADA, LINK, TRX, and AVAX posting big losses. BTC Stopped at $110K After last Friday’s violent correction amid the rising tension between US President Trump and former ally Musk, when BTC plunged below $100,500, the primary cryptocurrency was actually going strong for a while. It managed to recover all losses by the weekend and started to gain traction at the start of the current business week. Bitcoin spiked to $110,500 on a few occasions as the week progressed, and the latest example came yesterday when the asset came just over a grand away from tapping a new all-time high. The macroeconomic scene improved as the POTUS said Washington and Beijing are very close to a trade deal , while the US CPI data for May was more favorable than expected. However, BTC failed to keep climbing and was quickly stopped at the $110,000 mark and pushed south by over $2,500.

Even more painful declines come from the likes of DOGE, TRX, SOL, ADA, SUI, LINK, and AVAX, with daily drops of up to 6-7%. SPX is once again the top gainer today, having surged by almost 9%, while JUP, FET, and SEI lead in terms of value lost.

2025-06-12T08:46:16,"Fintech Giant Stripe to Buy Crypto Wallet Startup, Best Wallet Token to Rally","Stripe just announced its acquisition of Privy, a fast-growing startup that makes crypto wallets invisible. It does this by embedding them directly into websites and apps — no clunky browser extensions, seed phrases, or extra logins required. The acquisition marks a critical turning point for crypto adoption. And if you’re paying attention, it opens up a huge opportunity to get ahead of the curve with a native web3 wallet like Best Wallet app. Crypto, Simplified: Stripe’s Big Bet on Embedded Wallets Stripe is known for seeing the future of payments before most. They’ve helped thousands of online stores accept fiat payments. Now they’re doing it again with crypto. By acquiring Privy, Stripe is betting that the future of payments and crypto wallets is frictionless. No more MetaMask popups, no need to leave a site to complete a transaction. Just click, sign, and go. Privy already powers over 75M wallets for thousands of apps. It lets developers build apps that feel like Web2, but are powered by Web3 behind the scenes. Stripe knows that if crypto is going to go mainstream, it needs to stop feeling like rocket science. If something is easy, people will do it. Stripe itself is proof; their payment volume topped $1.4T in 2024, and their payment system is used by over half of the Fortune 800. That’s the power of a frictionless payment system, and Stipe is betting that adding Privy could drive that adoption even further. Conversion Is King: Making Wallets and Payments Easier The problem with most crypto wallets is that they kill conversions. Right now, there are simply too many steps. Every time a user needs to download a wallet, sign up, and fund it, that’s a three-step process that many people won’t do. Add in the need for most wallets to perform KYC checks, and even more people give up on crypto before they get started. That’s even the case on the institutional level. 2024 saw the final failure of Qredo , which provided crypto custody solutions and on-chain settlements for individuals and institutions. Stripe has already taken steps to avoid the same fate; it added Bridge in October 2024, a leading stablecoin orchestration platform. But has Best Wallet token already changed the game? Like Privy, the Best Wallet app is designed for simplicity, speed, and secure onboarding. That means higher retention and more loyal users. Unlike Stripe, which serves enterprise giants, Best Wallet is building for the crypto-native community – traders, builders, degens, and more – who need a lightweight, secure, and scalable wallet solution today. Best Wallet Token ($BEST): The World’s Easiest, Most Powerful Non-Custodial Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) achieves the same simplicity and seamlessness that transformed Stripe into a major player. It’s a no-KYC, non-custodial wallet . There’s no barrier to setting up your account and getting started today. And with $BEST, the wallet benefits include higher staking rewards, lower transaction fees, and improved governance opportunities. The $BEST token presale is on now and has already raised $13.2M. A token costs $0.025165, but our price prediction analysis shows it could reach $0.072 by the end of 2025. That’s a 186% price increase for a token that provides: Improved access to a fully-powered, next-gen crypto wallet Early access to the best crypto presales Support for low-cost transactions and cross-chain functionality Above all, Best Wallet provides a chance to ride the same wave Stripe just validated, but with even higher upside potential.

With the 2024 Bitcoin halving now behind us and a renewed bullish sentiment in the air, 2025 presents a prime opportunity to explore promising altcoins. Below mentioned are the altcoins in each sector that could attract significant profits. AI & Infrastructure Tokens Render (RNDR) : The demand for the decetralised GPU rendering and AI-generated content surges, RNDR stands out. It’s already making waves in the digital art and metaverse sectors. RNDR price is defending the ascending support, which suggests the token is about to undergo a 40% recovery followed by a 40% upswing towards local highs. Fetch.ai (FET) : It is a key player in AI agents and decentralized machine learning, especially with its integration into the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The FET price has triggered a strong recovery, forming consecutive higher highs and lows. Once the token surges above the threshold at $1, the bulls may elevate the levels to new highs. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) : It enables secure and private data sharing for AI training, which is becoming increasingly valuable. After reaching the lowest point, the OCEAN price has triggered a strong recovery. Therefore, the token is expected to rise by more than 150% in the rest of 2025 and print new highs. Layer 1 (L1) Blockchain Tokens Ethereum (ETH) : Ethereum is the most dominant smart contract platform, which is the home for most of the DeFi, NFTs, and many more tokens. Besides the upgrades like Dencun and potential shrading improvements make it a long-term hold. The ETH price is holding strong above $2700, paving the way to reach $3000. Solana (SOL) : Known for its speed and scalability, Solana has attracted major meme coins and DeFi platforms. Besides, the SOL price has also displayed immense strength in recent times and hence is believed to reclaim $180 and later $200 which could further push the price to new highs. Avalanche (AVAX) : Its subnet technology and enterprise partnerships with Deloitte and AWS make it more attractive. The AVAX price is facing some upward pressure in the short term but remains under bullish influence in the long term, with a potential rise of over 40% in the next couple of weeks. Interoperability and Oracles-Based Tokens Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink is a leading decentralized oracle network, essential for DeFi. The LINK price volatility has increased for over a year and by raising the support levels, the bulls have displayed a huge rise in their dominance. Hence, the price in the long term is expected to rebound and validate a 50% upswing soon. Polkadot (DOT): Polkadot is focused on cross-chain compatibility through parachains. The token has lost traders’ interest over time as the price has failed to rise above $10 since the 2022 bear market. Therefore, an excessive compression is expected to trigger a strong breakout and breach above the levels. Cosmos (ATOM) : It popularizes the app-chain and modular blockchain. The ATOM price has been experiencing a massive drain for the past few years and might have reached the local bottom. Therefore, a strong rebound could follow hereafter that could elevate the price to new highs. Altcoins offer immense opportunities in 2025 especially as blockchain adoption spreads into AI, DeFi, Gaming, and beyond.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-just-3-away-from-highs-top-altcoins-to-buy-ahead-of-btc-price-marking-a-new-ath/,"ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|TRADING","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-06-12T08:21:07,"Is the Big Altcoin Season Starting in June? Here’s What Analysts Think","Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal has published a remarkable assessment that the altcoin season could begin in 2025. The analysis claimed that despite the disappointing altcoin performances for many investors in the last market cycle, a new turning point may have been reached. Alphractal analyzed the relationship between Bitcoin (BTC) price and the Altcoin Season Index on a weekly timeframe. This indicator measures the performance of altcoins against BTC over the past 3 months. According to the company’s assessment, two different scenarios could herald the altcoin season: Weakness After Bitcoin Rise: When BTC shows the first signs of weakness after a long period of rise, investors turn to alternative cryptocurrencies and the altcoin season begins. Related News: List of the 20 Altcoins That Crypto Developers Have Focused On the Most in the Last Year Has Been Revealed - There's a Big Surprise at the Top When Bitcoin is Declining or Bottoming: When BTC is at historical lows, some altcoins are gaining relative advantage by showing less decline. One of the striking findings in the analysis is that the altcoin season has started in June every year since 2022. According to these data, June 2025 may also be a part of this cycle. When the timeframe is reduced to the daily level, it is found that 23% of altcoins are outperforming BTC. The Altcoin Season Index is currently in the uncertainty zone, which suggests that the Bitcoin season may be over. According to the analytics firm, this signals that altcoins may exhibit stronger movements in the coming days. Total Web3 investments in the first quarter of 2025 reached $3.8 billion, the highest level since mid-2022, while second-quarter investments fell to the lowest level since 2019. Alphractal notes that these investment trends can show strong correlations with altcoin seasons. According to Alphractal’s analysis, the altcoin market is on the verge of a major transformation. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is the Big Altcoin Season Starting in June?

2025-06-12T08:20:48,"Here’s When Investors Will Stop Selling Bitcoin: Bitwise CEO","With Bitcoin pushing toward new highs, market participants are speculating on what comes next. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently weighed in, offering a bold take on potential shifts in holder behavior. The exec believes Bitcoin could enter a new phase of market behavior once it surpasses the $130,000 to $150,000 range. Bitcoin Holders to Change Tactics? In a tweet posted this week, Horsley noted that while the cryptocurrency is currently hovering around $100,000, long-term holders who accumulated BTC at much lower prices are still selling portions of their holdings. However, he argued that this trend will diminish once Bitcoin breaks into new all-time high territory. According to Horsley, at that point, rather than selling, holders will increasingly opt to borrow against their Bitcoin through a growing number of lenders in the space. This shift, he said, will tighten supply and push prices even higher. “There’s simply not going to be enough Bitcoin,” Horsley added, suggesting a future scenario where rising demand and limited sell-side pressure drive the upward momentum. His comments reflect growing market anticipation that the next major breakout could mark a transition from distribution to accumulation. Retail Crowd Turns Bullish Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s recovery triggered a surge in bullish sentiment among retail investors who have been mostly absent during this cycle. This was indicative in Santiment’s recent update , which found that positive Bitcoin-related commentary across social media now outpaces negative mentions by more than two-to-one, a level of optimism not seen since Donald Trump’s election over seven months ago. However, analysts caution that rising greed and retail enthusiasm may signal a market top. The Fear and Greed Index supports this with a score of 71. Long-term holders continue accumulating while also taking daily profits nearing $930 million. Whales, for one, have remained patient and are expecting higher prices. Analysts argue Bitcoin’s fixed supply could benefit from monetary instability as US debt ceiling tensions rise.

2025-06-12T08:11:24,"Lummis believes reconciliation will fix crypto’s double taxation","Senator Cynthia Lummis believes reconciliation is the best strategy at the moment to end the unfair double tax on digital assets. In an X post , she commented, “Reconciliation is our chance to fix crypto provisions that unfairly double tax bitcoin and digital assets.” In another post, Lummis argued that the current US tax system is antiquated and only stifles growth in the crypto industry. Cynthia Lummis argues that lawmakers should consider reconciliation Lummis argued that Bitcoin miners will particularly bear the brunt of double taxation, being hit once on block rewards and again when they sell their coins. She added that DeFi users also stand to face multiple taxable events without realizing any profits. While she did not directly mention which unfair tax regulations would cause this, analysts peg her comments to the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The act categorizes all crypto miners and developers as “brokers.” That means they must report details they often don’t have, such as user identities and transaction data, and are subject to more taxation. Lummis has asked Congress to resolve the problem using reconciliation, allowing tax changes to pass with a simple majority. She would like the “broker” term adjusted to alleviate the burden on digital asset miners and developers. The changes could include exemptions for non-custodial actors like developers and protocol operators. Aside from Lummis, some miners also voiced their concerns about the broker definition, arguing that it inaccurately portrays their role since they neither manage user transactions nor control customer funds. GENIUS Act passed a key vote in the US Senate The Republican senator has also shown her support for the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoin or GENIUS Act , which recently passed a key vote in the US Senate. The bill is moving to the next stage after a 68-30 vote. On Wednesday, Majority Leader John Thune called his fellow lawmakers to support the bill. He raised some of President Donald Trump’s main talking points on cryptocurrencies, particularly the idea that the legislation would solidify the US position as the “crypto capital of the world.” He added that the act would help grow crypto adoption in the country. Senator Lummis appreciated Thune’s speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, acknowledging that he understands crypto regulation’s vitality and even praised him for “visionary leadership.” Speaking on the Senate floor, however, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the GENIUS Act, stating that key issues remained unresolved due to the chamber’s failure to consider several bipartisan amendments. She also spoke on the president’s ties to his family crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, voicing the concerns of many other democrats. Meanwhile, the CLARITY Act is still under discussion. Thune still believes they could do more for the crypto industry, throwing his weight behind the bill to define the market structure for crypto assets. On Tuesday, the House Financial Services lawmakers voted 32 to 19 to send the CLARITY Act to a full floor vote shortly after the Agriculture Committee approved it with a 47–6 vote.

2025-06-12T08:00:17,"Bitcoin Options Traders Expect Quiet—But On-Chain Data Suggests Chaos","The Bitcoin Options traders have been pricing in low implied volatility, but on-chain data shows a setup ripe for amplified price swings. Bitcoin Options ATM IV Has Been Trending Lower In its latest weekly report, the analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the volatility risk associated with Bitcoin looks from the perspective of on-chain analysis. Related Reading: Ethereum To $3,400? On-Chain Shows No Big Hurdles Ahead The indicator shared by Glassnode is the Realized Supply Density, which tells us about how concentrated the cryptocurrency’s supply is around the current spot price. When the value of this metric is high, it means the investors have participated in a large amount of buying at or near the asset’s latest price. “In such environments, even modest price fluctuations can affect a broad swath of investors, often amplifying market sensitivity and, in turn, volatility potential,” explains the analytics firm. Below is the chart for the indicator shared by in the report. As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Realized Supply Density has gone through an uplift during the past few weeks, which suggests accumulation has taken place around the current spot price. “This concentration raises the probability of outsized reactions to price movements, increasing volatility risk in the near term,” notes Glassnode. While on-chain data may hint that volatility could go up in the future, it would appear the traders on the Options market don’t quite think the same, as the At-The-Money Implied Volatility (ATM IV) has been going down. The IV is a metric that represents the traders’ expectations of how volatile Bitcoin will be over a given period, based on the pricing of Options contracts. The ATM version of the indicator specifically calculates this expectation based on Options closest to the latest spot price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Back At $109,000, But HODLer Profit-Taking Down 89% Here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Options ATM IV across different expiration timeframes: From the above graph, it’s apparent that the Bitcoin Options ATM IV has been going down for all major tenors, an indication that the traders don’t expect high volatility for the cryptocurrency in the near future. “Historically, such complacency in volatility pricing has often served as a counter-trend signal, preceding periods of heightened volatility,” says the analytics firm. With on-chain data suggesting increased volatility risk and this signal forming at the same time, it now remains to be seen how Bitcoin would develop in the coming days.

2025-06-12T07:53:43,"Why “there’s not going to be enough Bitcoin” according to Bitwise CEO","The parabolic run of Bitcoin in recent years has ignited debates about demand, supply, and where the broader crypto market is headed next. While many investors are focused on higher price milestones beyond $110K, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley believes a major real shift is on the horizon. According to Horsley, once Bitcoin ( BTC ) crosses the $130,000 to $150,000 price levels, long-time holders will likely stop selling. He emphasized that many of these individuals and institutions accumulated Bitcoin years ago at much lower prices, and the recent price upticks have translated into profit-taking for the majority. I think once Bitcoin breaks through eg $130-150k, no one is going to sell their Bitcoin. Right now at $100k, it seems individuals who hold a lot of Bitcoin that was bought a long time ago at very low prices, are selling some. That said, once Bitcoin breaks new levels, this… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) June 10, 2025 But in his view, that trend may soon change. The higher Bitcoin climbs, the more confident holders become and Horsely believes that rather than selling, many will likely turn to alternative liquidity options that don’t require them to part with their assets. This shift could remove even more supply from circulation and put upward pressure on prices. You might also like: Will Bitcoin continue rising? Analyst eyes breakout as demand outpaces supply Not everyone agrees with Horsley’s view. Market participants argue that the inherent ‘buy-and-sell’ nature will trigger profit-seeking behavior as prices rise, resulting in more sell-offs. However, current market data supports Horsley’s thesis. Bitcoin supply dries up Recent on-chain analytics has revealed a tightening BTC supply, lower short-term selling pressure, and growing signs that investors are becoming more confident in holding their Bitcoin for the long term. According to a June 10 CryptoQuant report , the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges continues to fall. Over the past year alone, more than 550,000 BTC has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges. The numbers build on previous findings that exchange balances have dropped to their lowest levels in over eight years, an indicator that more investors are opting to store their assets privately rather than sell them. Also fueling the supply crunch is the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin. From ETFs to national reserves, global financial heavyweights are building long-term positions. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs launched in January now hold around 6% of the total BTC supply, and more countries are exploring creating their various dedicated Bitcoin reserves. Unlike retail traders, these institutional investors do not chase short-term gains, supporting the idea that more Bitcoin may be taken out of circulation and held for the long haul.

2025-06-12T07:52:33,"Japan eyes G7 support to thwart North Korea’s crypto-funded weapons programme","Japan will reportedly urge G7 nations to take coordinated action against North Korea’s cryptocurrency thefts at the upcoming summit in Canada. According to local media , Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is expected to raise the issue during the G7 meetings scheduled from June 15 to 17, citing the growing threat of cyber-enabled financial crime linked to North Korea. The proposal will mark the first time the G7 formally considers a collective response to crypto theft tied to state-sponsored actors. The Group of Seven comprises Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union. Ishiba is expected to call for enhanced cooperation among G7 members to tighten oversight of digital asset markets and curb illicit flows that finance weapons development . Officials believe that cutting off these funding channels is crucial to strengthening non-proliferation efforts and regional security. One of the catalysts behind Japan’s push is the $307 million hack of DMM Bitcoin , one of the country’s largest crypto exchanges. Japanese police and the FBI linked the May 2023 incident to a North Korean hacking group known as TraderTraitor, also referred to as Jade Sleet and UNC4899. You might also like: US DOJ moves to seize $7.7m in crypto linked to North Korean IT infiltration scheme Investigations revealed that the attack originated from a social engineering campaign and a malicious Python script, planted after a North Korean operative posing as a recruiter tricked an employee at Ginco, a wallet software provider that serviced DMM Bitcoin. The malware gave the attackers access to Ginco’s internal systems, which they later exploited to manipulate a transaction request at DMM Bitcoin, leading to the theft. Over 4,500 BTC, valued at $307 million at the time, was stolen, prompting the exchange to shut down its operations. Authorities traced the stolen funds to wallets controlled by the TraderTraitor group, a collective previously sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury for engaging in cyberattacks to fund North Korea’s weapons programme. Beyond Japan, North Korean-linked hackers have been tied to some of the largest crypto-related heists in recent years, including attacks on crypto exchange Bybit, the Ronin Bridge, Harmony, and various other DeFi platforms. In response, authorities across the globe have stepped up enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed a forfeiture action to seize over $7.7 million in crypto assets tied to North Korean IT workers embedded in blockchain firms as part of the DPRK RevGen initiative launched in 2024 to disrupt illicit revenue networks. Last year, the U.S. and South Korea signed a bilateral agreement to develop joint technologies to combat cryptocurrency theft by enhancing detection and response capabilities against DPRK-linked cyber actors.

2025-06-12T07:51:20,"Binance prepares to welcome Syrian traders after U.S. lifts sanctions","Binance declared that it is prepared to open its platform to Syrian residents interested in trading cryptocurrency. The shift follows the recent suspension of U.S. sanctions on Syria. According to a recent notice issued by the crypto exchange, Syria is no longer classified under the “prohibited country” category. This means that Syrian residents can now register themselves on the platform and access crypto-related services through the crypto exchange . The services now available to Syrian traders include spot and futures trading, staking and earn products, Binance Pay for cross-border payments, and educational content in Arabic. “This means we can now onboard and support Syrian residents, granting full access to products and services,” wrote the exchange in its notice. In May 2025, President Trump announced that the U.S. would lift its sanctions on Syria following a change in leadership. The current government, led by Syria’s new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, successfully overthrew the leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Al-Assad ruled over Syria from 1971 to 2024. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” said Trump according to an Al-Jazeera report . You might also like: Binance claps back against traders using bots to cheat the Alpha Points program Due to the sanctions in place, Binance was unable to make its platform accessible to Syrian traders. The shift indicates a major opportunity for Binance to reach the untapped Syrian markets, considering Syria is ranked among the top 10 countries globally for most crypto-related search activity since 2021. The spike in crypto interest in Syria may be due to the economic instability and high inflation in the region which led to Syrian residents relying on informal financial systems to combat the unreliable local currency. “We’re proud to offer real solutions that support Syria’s economic recovery and help grow its digital economy, in line with international efforts and applicable regulations,” wrote the exchange. In 1979, due to the radical al-Assad regime at the time, the U.S. and many other countries classified the country as “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, which led to a ban on arms and financial restrictions, including foreign assistance. This meant that foreign entities like crypto exchanges could not officially operate in the region or facilitate crypto-related services for its residents.

Following closely on the heels of its notable Bitcoin purchase, the company is now planning a substantial capital raise through a convertible notes offering. This latest development adds another fascinating layer to GameStop’s evolving strategy, blending traditional corporate finance with a foray into digital assets. Let’s dive into what this means for GameStop, its investors, and the broader landscape of crypto investment . Understanding GameStop’s Strategic Convertible Notes Offering According to information circulating, including a report from Solid Intel on X, GameStop is reportedly planning a private offering of senior convertible notes aimed at raising a significant $1.75 billion. But what exactly are convertible notes, and why would a company like GameStop choose this route? Convertible notes are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a predetermined number of shares of the issuing company’s common stock at a later date, usually at the option of the noteholder or under specific conditions. Think of them as a hybrid of debt and equity. Here are a few key aspects of convertible notes: Lower Interest Rates: Because they offer the potential for equity upside, convertible notes typically carry lower interest rates compared to traditional corporate bonds. This reduces the company’s ongoing cash interest payments. Delayed Dilution: Unlike issuing common stock directly, convertible notes only result in stock dilution if and when they are converted. This delays the impact on the company’s earnings per share. Flexibility: They can be structured in various ways, offering flexibility in terms of conversion price, maturity date, and conversion triggers. For GameStop , a company that has experienced significant volatility in its GME stock price, this type of financing could be appealing. It allows them to raise a large amount of capital without immediately diluting existing shareholders, while potentially benefiting from lower borrowing costs. The Timing: GameStop’s Bitcoin Purchase Precedes Capital Raise What makes this offering particularly intriguing is its timing. The news of the planned $1.75 billion convertible notes offering comes shortly after GameStop revealed its significant investment in Bitcoin. Between May and early June, the company purchased 4,710 BTC. At current market prices, this represents a substantial holding, worth tens of millions of dollars. This raises an important question: Is there a direct link between the Bitcoin purchase and the capital raise? While the official announcement regarding the use of proceeds from the notes offering hasn’t specified funding further crypto buys, the sequence of events is noteworthy. Companies typically raise capital for general corporate purposes, working capital, potential acquisitions, or investments. GameStop’s recent actions suggest a potential shift or expansion in its strategic priorities, which now evidently includes holding digital assets. Could the Bitcoin purchase be an initial step in a broader digital asset strategy that requires significant capital? Or is the capital raise simply a timely move to strengthen the balance sheet and fund other initiatives, with the Bitcoin holding being a separate treasury management decision? Without explicit details from GameStop, much remains open to interpretation. Implications for GME Stock and Future Strategy How might this convertible notes offering impact GME stock ? There are a few potential angles to consider: Positive: Capital Infusion: Raising $1.75 billion provides GameStop with a substantial war chest. This capital could be used to fund transformation efforts, invest in e-commerce capabilities, explore new business ventures (perhaps related to gaming or digital assets), or simply provide financial stability. This influx of cash is generally seen as positive for a company’s operational capacity. Negative: Potential Dilution: The primary concern with convertible notes is the potential for future stock dilution. If the notes are converted into shares, it increases the total number of outstanding shares, which can put downward pressure on the stock price and dilute the value of existing shares. The conversion price relative to the current stock price will be a critical factor. Investor Sentiment: The market’s reaction will depend on how investors perceive the company’s use of funds and the terms of the offering. If the capital is seen as fueling a credible, growth-oriented strategy, it could be positive. If the terms are unfavorable or the use of funds is unclear, it could lead to skepticism. This capital raise, combined with the Bitcoin purchase , suggests GameStop under CEO Ryan Cohen is continuing to explore various avenues beyond its traditional retail model. The strategic direction appears to involve strengthening its financial position while potentially experimenting with new asset classes or business models. What Does This Mean for Crypto Investment? GameStop’s decision to hold Bitcoin and potentially use a large capital raise in proximity to this move sends a signal to the market regarding corporate adoption of digital assets. While not on the scale of MicroStrategy, GameStop is a well-known, albeit unconventional, public company making a direct crypto investment . Here’s what this could signify for the broader crypto investment landscape: Increasing Legitimacy: More public companies holding Bitcoin in their treasury can lend further legitimacy to Bitcoin as a store of value or a treasury asset. Potential Trendsetter: While GameStop’s situation is unique, its move might encourage other companies, particularly in the tech or gaming sectors, to consider similar treasury strategies. Market Interest: It brings cryptocurrency into the conversation for traditional stock investors who follow GameStop, potentially piquing their interest in digital assets. However, it’s also important to note that GameStop’s financial strategy is complex and influenced by its unique market position. Its crypto investment should be viewed within the context of its overall business transformation efforts and capital structure decisions. Challenges and Opportunities in GameStop’s Bold Move GameStop’s strategy, while potentially transformative, is not without its challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Execution Risk: Successfully deploying $1.75 billion into initiatives that generate returns and transform the business is a significant undertaking. Market Volatility: Both GME stock and Bitcoin are known for high volatility, adding layers of risk to the company’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Dilution Management: Managing the potential future dilution from the convertible notes requires careful financial planning and communication with shareholders. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for corporate crypto holdings and related activities is still evolving. Opportunities: Financial Flexibility: The capital raise provides significant flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives without being constrained by cash flow. Potential Asset Appreciation: The Bitcoin holding offers potential upside if the value of BTC increases. Strategic Pivots: The capital allows GameStop to make substantial investments in new business areas that could redefine the company. Investor Engagement: The combination of meme stock status, strategic capital raise, and crypto exposure keeps GameStop highly relevant and engaging for a certain segment of the investor base. The coming months will be crucial in observing how GameStop utilizes this significant capital and whether its foray into crypto investment becomes a more central part of its strategy or remains a treasury diversification tactic. Conclusion: A Strategic Blend of Tradition and Innovation GameStop’s planned $1.75 billion convertible notes offering, hot on the heels of its Bitcoin purchase , represents a fascinating intersection of traditional corporate finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This move provides the company with substantial capital, offering opportunities for strategic investment and business transformation, while also introducing the potential for future dilution of GME stock . The inclusion of a significant crypto investment adds a layer of modern treasury management to the mix, potentially signaling a broader corporate trend. As GameStop navigates this complex financial landscape, all eyes will be on how effectively it deploys these resources to reshape its future.

2025-06-12T07:40:12,"Solana ETF: Accelerating Potential for SEC Approval","BitcoinWorld Solana ETF: Accelerating Potential for SEC Approval Exciting news is circulating in the crypto world regarding the potential for a Solana ETF in the United States. A recent report from Bloomberg suggests that the likelihood of a spot Solana (SOL) exchange-traded fund product receiving approval is growing stronger. This development is significant for investors and the broader cryptocurrency market, indicating a potential expansion of regulated investment avenues beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. What’s Happening with the SEC Solana ETF Approval Process? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plays a crucial role in approving or denying financial products like ETFs. According to Bloomberg, the SEC has taken a notable step by engaging directly with asset management firms that have filed for a Solana ETF. At least three companies have reportedly received requests from the SEC to amend their S-1 filings. These filings are the initial registration documents required for securities offerings. The SEC’s requests focus on specific details within these applications, particularly concerning: Redemption Mechanisms: How investors will be able to redeem their ETF shares (e.g., for cash or potentially in-kind SOL). Solana Staking Rewards: Whether and how any rewards generated from staking the underlying SOL held by the fund will be handled and paid out to investors. Historically, the SEC’s engagement with applicants, asking for detailed amendments rather than issuing outright rejections, has been interpreted as a positive sign. It suggests the regulator is actively reviewing the applications and working through potential structural and operational considerations necessary for approval. Why Are These SEC Requests Seen as a Positive Signal for a Solana ETF ? Market analysts and commentators view the SEC’s requests for S-1 amendments as a significant step forward. It indicates that the SEC is moving beyond initial review and is delving into the practicalities of how a Solana ETF would operate under U.S. regulations. This level of engagement is a stark contrast to periods where the regulator seemed hesitant or unwilling to discuss the specifics of crypto-related investment products. Noelle Acheson, a respected voice in the crypto space and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, has asserted that the fact the SEC is requesting amendments suggests a potential approval timeline that could be relatively short – perhaps within a few days or at most a few weeks. This sentiment echoes the optimism seen during the final stages of the Bitcoin spot ETF approval process. The focus on redemption mechanisms is standard for any ETF, but the inquiry into staking rewards is particularly noteworthy for a Proof-of-Stake asset like Solana. It shows the SEC is grappling with the unique features of these cryptocurrencies and how they fit within the traditional financial framework of an ETF. Addressing the Nuances of Solana Staking in an ETF Structure Solana operates on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which allows SOL holders to ‘stake’ their tokens to support network operations and earn rewards. For a Solana ETF holding actual SOL tokens, the question of how to handle these potential staking rewards is critical. There are several potential approaches fund issuers might propose or the SEC might require: Reinvestment: Staking rewards could be automatically reinvested back into the fund, increasing the net asset value (NAV) over time. Cash Distribution: Rewards could be periodically distributed to ETF shareholders as cash income. Fund Manager Decision: The fund’s structure might allow the manager discretion on how to handle rewards, within regulatory guidelines. The SEC’s focus on this aspect highlights the complexity of translating native crypto economics into a traditional ETF wrapper. Clarifying how staking rewards will be managed is essential for investor understanding and regulatory compliance. The Broader Picture: Crypto ETF Landscape and Institutional Interest The potential approval of a Solana ETF follows the landmark approvals of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year and the recent approvals of Ethereum spot ETFs (though trading has not yet begun for Ethereum). This progression suggests a growing regulatory comfort level with certain cryptocurrencies as underlying assets for regulated investment products. A Solana ETF would provide investors with another regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to the SOL token without directly buying, storing, or securing the cryptocurrency themselves. This accessibility is particularly appealing to traditional financial advisors and institutional investors who operate within strict compliance frameworks. The entry of multiple asset management giants preparing applications underscores the significant market demand they perceive for a SOL investment product. Companies like Grayscale, Bitwise, and VanEck, who were also pioneers in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF races, are among those positioning themselves for a potential SOL ETF launch. Who’s Preparing for a SOL ETF Launch and What’s the Timeline? Reports indicate that at least seven asset management companies are actively working on preparing or have already filed applications for a spot SOL ETF . This includes major players in the crypto asset management space such as: Grayscale Bitwise VanEck And others… The competition among these firms highlights the anticipated demand and the race to be among the first to market if approval is granted. Regarding a timeline, while Noelle Acheson suggested days or weeks based on the S-1 amendments, previous reporting by Bitcoin World indicated that the SEC could potentially approve such a product within three to five weeks. These timelines are estimates and depend heavily on the SEC’s review process and any further questions or requirements they may have for the applicants. Benefits of a Potential Solana ETF Increased Accessibility: Allows traditional investors to gain exposure via brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: Offers a regulated investment vehicle for SOL. Enhanced Liquidity: May bring more capital into the Solana ecosystem. Institutional Adoption: Facilitates investment from large funds and institutions. Potential Staking Yield: Depending on the structure, investors might benefit from staking rewards. Challenges and Considerations Regulatory Hurdles Remain: While positive, approval is not guaranteed and depends on addressing SEC concerns. Staking Complexity: Handling staking rewards within an ETF framework is novel and requires clear rules. Market Volatility: The price of SOL, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. Custody and Security: Ensuring secure custody of the underlying SOL tokens is paramount. Actionable Insights for Readers If you are interested in the potential of a Solana ETF, here are a few things to consider: Stay Informed: Continue monitoring news from the SEC, asset managers, and financial news outlets like Bloomberg. Understand the Risks: An ETF tracks the price of the underlying asset, which in this case is a volatile cryptocurrency. Research Specific ETFs: If approved, compare the structures, fees, and how staking rewards (if any) are handled by different issuers. Consult a Financial Advisor: Determine if a Solana ETF fits your investment goals and risk tolerance. Conclusion: Optimism Builds for a Solana Investment Future The news that the SEC is actively engaging with Solana ETF applicants and requesting detailed amendments to S-1 filings is a genuinely positive development. While not a guarantee of approval, it signals that the regulatory path is being explored and potentially cleared. The focus on crucial aspects like redemptions and staking rewards shows the SEC is doing its due diligence. With multiple asset managers vying to launch a product and analysts suggesting a potentially rapid timeline once these details are ironed out, optimism for a U.S. Solana ETF is undeniably accelerating. This could mark another significant step in the integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, offering investors regulated access to the dynamic Solana ecosystem.

DJT, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Slide Trigger Panic in Crypto appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The global cryptocurrency market witnessed a broad downturn today, with total market capitalization falling by 1.68% to $3.39 trillion. Daily trading volume also dipped 5.27% to $133.81 billion, signaling cautious investor sentiment. The Fear & Greed Index currently sits at 61, still in the “Greed” zone, though edging downward as uncertainty clouds the outlook. The decline follows a sequence of macroeconomic and political events that have rattled both crypto and traditional markets. Talking about Wall Street, the S&P 500 is down 0.27% at 6,022.24, DJT fell 1.87% to 20.52, NASDAQ dropped 0.50% to 19,615.88, and the Dow Jones slipped marginally by 0.0026% to 42,865.77. Liquidations Surge as Traders Get Caught Off Guard? As price action turned against the bulls, liquidations began to mount. In the past 24 hours, 112,143 traders were liquidated, amounting to a total of $327.94 million wiped out across exchanges. The single-largest liquidation occurred on Binance’s BTCUSD perpetual pair, totaling $2.15 million. Source: CoinGlass The scale of the liquidations suggests that many traders were caught off guard by the rapid reversal in sentiment, especially those betting on a bullish continuation after the CPI dip. With leveraged positions wiped out across both long and short sides, volatility is expected to be present in the short term. BTC & ETH in Red, Altcoins Hit Harder? Bitcoin price is down 1.68% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $107,740.76. Its market cap stands at $2.14 trillion, with $53.99 billion in daily trading volume.

The new cap marks a doubling from the prior $500 million ceiling, which had itself been raised just days earlier following a community-driven outcry over bot activity and rapid sellout times. Plasma said the short-notice announcement was designed to give real users, such as those active in its Discord, a fairer shot at joining. But it’s not a token sale just yet. “Deposits are not the sale itself,” Plasma clarified in a post. “All funds remain fully owned by depositors and will be bridged to Plasma mainnet beta.” Participants earn the right to buy into the eventual $50 million XPL public sale based on how many units they’ve locked up by the cutoff. The sale is valued at $500 million on a fully diluted basis. Earlier this week, the project — which aims to bring native stablecoin functionality to Bitcoin through an EVM-compatible sidechain — saw its initial $500 million cap fill in just five minutes , according to Arkham data. That figure was ten times what Plasma initially planned, indicative of massive investor appetite for stablecoin infrastructure. The team behind Plasma has positioned its chain as a way to sidestep Ethereum’s high fees and congestion by building a zero-gas environment for stablecoin transactions while being anchored to Bitcoin’s security model. USDT will be the first supported asset, with more expected to follow.

2025-06-12T07:20:17,"Semler Scientific: Why Tom Lee Sees Unexpected Opportunity in This Bitcoin Treasury Stock’s Deep NAV Discount","BitcoinWorld Semler Scientific: Why Tom Lee Sees Unexpected Opportunity in This Bitcoin Treasury Stock’s Deep NAV Discount In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments, sometimes the most intriguing opportunities appear in unexpected places. Case in point: Semler Scientific (SMLR) . This medical technology firm recently made headlines by pivoting towards a Bitcoin treasury stock strategy, accumulating a significant amount of the digital asset on its balance sheet. However, its journey hasn’t been without turbulence, presenting a fascinating puzzle for investors. Semler Scientific’s Bold Pivot: Becoming a Bitcoin Treasury Stock Traditionally known for providing innovative products and services to healthcare providers, Semler Scientific took a decisive step into the world of digital assets. Recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, the company began converting its cash reserves into BTC. This strategic shift transformed Semler Scientific from a pure medical tech play into something hybrid – a medical technology company with a substantial Bitcoin treasury. This move places it alongside a growing, albeit still small, group of publicly traded companies that hold Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, effectively making it a Bitcoin treasury stock . This strategy offers investors indirect exposure to Bitcoin through traditional stock markets. Instead of buying BTC directly or through complex instruments, investors can purchase shares of companies like Semler, whose value is increasingly tied to their Bitcoin holdings. It’s a strategy that appeals to some institutional investors and those who prefer the regulatory familiarity of equity markets. Unpacking the Current Situation: The Significant BTC NAV Discount Despite its significant Bitcoin holdings, Semler Scientific’s stock has faced considerable pressure recently. The company’s share price has experienced a notable decline, leading to a situation where its market capitalization is now significantly lower than the value of its Bitcoin assets alone. This phenomenon is known as trading at a BTC NAV discount . Let’s break down the numbers as reported: Bitcoin Holdings: 4,449 BTC Approximate Value of BTC Holdings: Around $491 million (based on reported figures) Current Market Capitalization (SMLR stock): Around $420 million Discount Ratio: Trading at approximately 0.859x its Bitcoin Net Asset Value (NAV) What does a 0.859x BTC NAV discount mean? It means that for every dollar’s worth of Bitcoin the company holds, the market is valuing the entire company (including its medical tech business) at only about 86 cents. This deep discount highlights a significant divergence between the intrinsic value represented by the Bitcoin on the balance sheet and the market’s current perception of the company’s overall worth. This situation also presents a challenge for Semler’s corporate strategy. When a company’s stock trades below its NAV, issuing new shares to raise capital becomes dilutive. This is because selling shares at a price below the value of the underlying assets per share effectively reduces the NAV per share for existing shareholders. Under these conditions, Semler can no longer issue shares accretively (i.e., in a way that increases the NAV per share), limiting one potential avenue for growth or capital raising. Why Does Tom Lee Remain Bullish on SMLR Stock? In the face of this stock underperformance and the seemingly disadvantageous trading position, one prominent voice remains notably optimistic: Fundstrat’s head of research, Tom Lee . Known for his often bullish stance on Bitcoin and the broader market, Lee has included Semler Scientific in his curated list of investment opportunities, specifically within his “Granny Shot” portfolio. What is the “Granny Shot” portfolio? It’s a concept Lee uses to highlight unconventional or overlooked investment ideas that possess significant potential upside, often involving unique situations or strategies not widely appreciated by the mainstream market. By including SMLR stock in this portfolio, Tom Lee signals his belief that despite the current challenges and the deep BTC NAV discount , there are underlying factors that make Semler an attractive, albeit perhaps non-obvious, investment. Tom Lee’s bullishness likely stems from several potential factors: Deep Value Play: The significant discount to NAV could be seen as a mispricing by the market, offering an opportunity to buy assets (the Bitcoin) at a discount through the stock. Leverage to Bitcoin Price: As a Bitcoin treasury stock , Semler offers leveraged exposure to potential increases in the price of Bitcoin. If BTC’s value rises, the value of Semler’s holdings increases proportionally, which could eventually narrow the discount and boost the stock price. Belief in the Core Business: While the Bitcoin treasury aspect is key, Tom Lee might also see underlying value or future potential in Semler’s core medical technology business, which the market is currently heavily discounting due to the focus on the Bitcoin play. Potential for Corporate Action: A significant NAV discount can sometimes trigger corporate actions aimed at closing the gap, such as share buybacks (if the company has free cash flow from its operations) or strategic adjustments. For Tom Lee , Semler Scientific appears to represent a classic “value trap” turned potential opportunity – a situation where an asset is trading below its perceived intrinsic value, waiting for a catalyst to unlock that value. Challenges and Considerations for Semler Scientific While the deep discount might look appealing on paper, it’s crucial to understand the challenges Semler Scientific faces: Market Perception: Investors may be hesitant about a medical tech company diversifying so heavily into a volatile asset like Bitcoin, leading to uncertainty and a lower valuation multiple compared to either pure tech or pure Bitcoin plays. Operational Cash Flow: The ability to leverage the Bitcoin holdings or close the discount might depend on the profitability and cash flow generation of the core medical tech business. If the core business struggles, it limits financial flexibility. Bitcoin Price Volatility: While a rising BTC price is a tailwind, a falling price exacerbates the situation, potentially widening the discount and further pressuring the stock. Inability to Issue Accretively: As mentioned, trading below NAV makes issuing shares for expansion or acquisitions disadvantageous, hindering a common corporate finance tool. These factors contribute to the discount and represent real hurdles that Semler must navigate. Is SMLR Stock a Hidden Gem or a Value Trap? This is the central question for investors considering Semler Scientific. The deep BTC NAV discount , coupled with Tom Lee ‘s endorsement, presents a compelling case for potential upside. It offers leveraged exposure to Bitcoin in a potentially undervalued package. However, the discount exists for reasons. The market is clearly assigning a lower value to the combination of the medical tech business and the Bitcoin treasury than the sum of their parts. Investors must weigh whether the current challenges are temporary headwinds or structural issues that will persist. Key questions for potential investors: Do you believe in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin? Do you see potential for the discount to narrow over time, either through a rising Bitcoin price, improved performance in the core business, or strategic corporate actions? Are you comfortable with the volatility associated with both a small-cap stock and Bitcoin? Semler Scientific is not a low-risk investment. It’s a speculative play that combines the uncertainties of a niche medical tech business with the volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Tom Lee’s bullish view provides a notable perspective, but it’s essential for investors to conduct their own thorough research and understand the risks involved. Conclusion: A Bullish Endorsement Amidst the Discount Semler Scientific’s transformation into a Bitcoin treasury stock has created a unique investment scenario. Trading at a significant BTC NAV discount , the company faces clear challenges, including a recent sharp decline in its SMLR stock price and limitations on issuing shares accretively. Yet, prominent figures like Tom Lee see beyond the current struggles, viewing the deep discount as an potential opportunity within his “Granny Shot” investment framework. Whether Semler can successfully navigate its challenges, leverage its Bitcoin holdings, and ultimately see its market valuation align more closely with its underlying assets remains to be seen. For investors intrigued by the intersection of traditional markets and cryptocurrency, Semler Scientific offers a complex, high-risk, high-reward proposition worth watching closely.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Hougan says that more public companies are buying Bitcoin to hold on their balance sheets as a hedge against the declining strength of the dollar due to money printing and other factors. “We think this is a megatrend that’s going to accelerate into the future. One [reason], of course, is increased worries about the dollar. Corporations globally are sitting on record amounts of cash and what they’ve historically done is park it in short-term US Treasuries or, in fact, in cash accounts. But with the huge money printing and growing deficits, that no longer seems like a valid approach. They need another way to protect their wealth from degradation and they are turning to the best horse in that race, which is Bitcoin.” Hougan predicts that publicly traded companies with Bitcoin treasuries will one day number in the thousands as investors also start to favor companies employing the strategy. “The investing audience has just recognized this is a positive strategy. And so companies are being rewarded for taking this bold step of putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet. We think there will ultimately be thousands of companies that do this. We think we’re in inning one or two of this megatrend period, but you’re seeing it accelerate over time.

According to the report, centralized treasuries—including governments, ETFs, public companies, and centralized exchanges —now hold nearly 31% of all circulating Bitcoin , totaling over 6.1 million BTC worth approximately $668 billion . Government Bitcoin Holdings Surge Through Seizures Governments around the world collectively hold 529,705 BTC , valued at over $57 billion . The United States leads with 207,189 BTC , followed by China with 194,000 BTC and the United Kingdom with 61,000 BTC . The report highlights that these holdings are not from open market purchases but have mostly come from seizures and enforcement actions . ETFs Take the Lead in Bitcoin Accumulation Bitcoin ETFs are rapidly growing as dominant holders. They now control 1,390,267 BTC , worth about $150 billion . The largest holder is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust , which owns 665,638.1 BTC . Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust follow with 198,685.8 BTC and 185,203.6 BTC , respectively. These numbers reflect rising institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term financial asset. Public Companies Double Down on BTC Public companies have become aggressive buyers, collectively holding 763,479 BTC , valued at $82.38 billion . MicroStrategy continues to lead this category with a staggering 582,000 BTC in reserves. Other key players include Marathon Digital Holdings with 49,179 BTC and Riot Platforms with 19,225 BTC . This further signals Bitcoin’s growing role as a strategic asset for corporations seeking to protect against inflation and economic uncertainty. Centralized Exchanges Still Hold a Large Share The report also confirms that centralized exchanges make up a significant portion of the 6.1 million BTC controlled by centralized entities. Current BTC exchange reserves stand at 2.5 million BTC . However, analysts believe much of this Bitcoin belongs to retail users , not the exchanges themselves. Still, the inclusion of exchanges highlights the role of custodial platforms in Bitcoin’s ecosystem.

During the same period, Bitcoin’s price jumped from under $1,000 to over $100,000 . In just the past year, the price has climbed 60.2% , showing increased stability and mainstream acceptance. This price performance is closely tied to growing institutional interest, which has created a stronger foundation for Bitcoin as an asset class. Conclusion: Bitcoin Matures, but Risks Remain The data reflects a structural transformation in Bitcoin’s ownership landscape. With governments, ETFs, public companies, and exchanges holding a large share of circulating BTC, Bitcoin is now entering a phase of institutional maturity .However, despite this evolution, Bitcoin still remains a risk-on asset , subject to macroeconomic forces and market sentiment. Its volatility may have reduced, but it has not disappeared. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

ETFs controlling substantial Bitcoin signals its mainstream acceptance and legitimization. This attracts more institutional capital, potentially leading to increased price stability, enhanced liquidity, and a more robust market infrastructure. Why are public companies increasing their Bitcoin holdings rapidly? Public companies are increasing Bitcoin holdings rapidly to hedge against inflation, diversify treasury reserves, signal support for the crypto industry, and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential for significant appreciation, similar to MicroStrategy’s strategy. How does institutional ownership influence Bitcoin’s price stability and volatility? Institutional ownership, particularly from long-term holders like ETFs, tends to increase Bitcoin’s price stability by providing consistent demand and reducing sharp sell-offs during market downturns, thus lessening overall volatility. What risks remain despite Bitcoin’s growing maturity and institutional adoption? Despite maturity, Bitcoin remains a risk-on asset, susceptible to macroeconomic forces, market sentiment, and inherent volatility.

2025-06-12T07:00:22,"Financial Advisors Reveal Cautious Hesitation on Bitcoin Investment and Crypto","BitcoinWorld Financial Advisors Reveal Cautious Hesitation on Bitcoin Investment and Crypto The world of finance is constantly evolving, and few areas have seen as much dynamic change as the cryptocurrency market. With the advent of products like the spot Bitcoin ETF, many expected a flood of mainstream interest, particularly from financial advisors guiding their clients. However, the reality seems more measured. Despite these new accessible avenues, many financial advisors are still approaching the digital asset space with significant caution, particularly when it comes to recommending Bitcoin investment . Why the Hesitation? Understanding Financial Advisors’ Concerns A recent report highlighted that, even a year and a half after the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), a large number of financial advisors remain hesitant. Gerry O’Shea, head of global market insights at Hashdex, noted that most advisors are not yet recommending clients allocate significant portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies. The reasons cited for this reluctance are multifaceted and deeply rooted in traditional financial principles and concerns specific to the nascent crypto industry. Let’s break down the primary worries: Volatility: This is perhaps the most frequently cited concern. The crypto market, especially Bitcoin, is known for its dramatic price swings. Advisors are trained to manage risk and preserve client capital, and the potential for rapid, significant losses in a highly volatile asset class is a major deterrent. Unlike traditional assets that often have historical data spanning decades or even centuries, the relatively short history of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies makes long-term risk assessment challenging for many advisors. Energy Consumption: The environmental impact of Bitcoin mining, particularly its energy footprint, remains a point of contention and concern for many, including clients who may prioritize sustainable investments. While there are ongoing efforts to shift towards more renewable energy sources in mining and alternative consensus mechanisms (like Ethereum’s proof-of-stake), the perception of high energy use persists and can be a barrier to recommendation. Potential for Criminal Exploitation: Early associations of crypto with illicit activities, dark web markets, and scams have left a lingering stigma. While the transparency of public blockchains often aids in tracking illicit funds, and regulatory bodies are increasing oversight, advisors worry about the potential for fraud, hacking, and lack of robust consumer protection compared to regulated traditional finance products. Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite some progress, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains fragmented and unclear in many jurisdictions. Advisors need clarity on how assets are classified, taxed, and protected under law before confidently recommending them to a broad client base. Lack of Familiarity and Education: Many financial advisors received their training and certifications before cryptocurrencies became prominent. Understanding the underlying technology (blockchain), different types of digital assets, wallet security, and the nuances of the crypto market requires dedicated education and time investment, which can be a hurdle for busy professionals. The Role of the Spot Bitcoin ETF: A Game Changer, But Not Yet a Full Catalyst for Crypto Adoption? The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin ETF products in major markets like the U.S. were widely seen as a pivotal moment for crypto adoption . These products offer investors exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of directly buying, storing, or securing the underlying asset. For advisors, ETFs provide a familiar, regulated wrapper through which they can potentially access the asset class using existing brokerage accounts and compliance frameworks. However, while the ETF structure addresses some logistical barriers, it doesn’t eliminate the fundamental concerns about the asset itself. The ETF still tracks an asset subject to significant crypto market volatility , and the underlying concerns about its nature (energy, crime perception) are not mitigated by the wrapper. Think of it like this: an ETF makes it easier to buy gold, but it doesn’t change gold’s properties or its market dynamics. Similarly, a spot Bitcoin ETF makes it easier to buy Bitcoin exposure, but the inherent characteristics of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market remain the same. Bridging the Gap: What Needs to Happen for Increased Bitcoin Investment Recommendations? For financial advisors to become more comfortable recommending Bitcoin investment and other crypto assets, several developments are likely necessary: More Education: Industry-wide efforts to educate advisors on the technology, market dynamics, risk management strategies specific to crypto, and the evolving regulatory landscape are crucial. Increased Regulatory Clarity: Clearer rules regarding classification, taxation, and consumer protection would significantly reduce advisor liability concerns. Demonstrated Track Record: As the market matures and navigates various cycles, a longer track record of performance and resilience might build confidence. Improved Infrastructure: Continued development of secure, regulated, and user-friendly infrastructure for accessing and managing digital assets is vital. Addressing ESG Concerns: Visible and verifiable progress on reducing the environmental impact of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies and highlighting the sustainability of alternative consensus mechanisms can help. Ultimately, the pace of crypto adoption among traditional financial advisors will depend on a combination of market maturation, regulatory evolution, and increased understanding within the advisory community. While the spot Bitcoin ETF was a significant step, it’s clear that the journey towards widespread advisor endorsement of Bitcoin investment is still underway, heavily influenced by ongoing concerns about crypto market volatility and other factors. Conclusion: A Cautious Path Forward for Financial Advisors and Crypto The current landscape shows that while the door has been opened for easier access via products like the spot Bitcoin ETF , the majority of financial advisors are exercising significant caution. Their primary duty is to protect and grow their clients’ wealth responsibly, and the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with Bitcoin investment and the broader crypto market, particularly its volatility and perceived risks, mean that widespread recommendation is not yet a reality. The path to greater crypto adoption in traditional portfolios will require continued education, regulatory progress, and the industry effectively addressing the legitimate concerns held by financial professionals.

2025-06-12T07:00:14,"Ethereum Prepares For Massive Run After $2,800 Reclaim – ‘Up Only’ Ahead?","As Ethereum (ETH) attempts to reclaim its January 2025 price range, the cryptocurrency has been holding a recently recovered level, leading some analysts to suggest another 10% surge before new highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes New Highs As Price Retests $109,000, But Analyst Warns Of Potential Pullback Ethereum Breakout Eyes $3,100 Ethereum has reclaimed the key $2,800 barrier for the first time since February, nearing the $2,900 level on Wednesday morning. The King of Altcoins had been trading between the $2,475-$2,680 range since its May breakout, unable to turn the range’s upper boundary into support. During last week’s retracement, ETH dropped to the $2,400 support before bouncing over the weekend. The crypto market’s recovery saw Ethereum surge toward the key resistance, finally breaking past it at the start of the week and hitting a three-month high of $2,879 today. Following this performance, Analyst Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show noted that the cryptocurrency had broken out of an ascending triangle formation and now targets the $3,100 resistance. The analyst previously highlighted ETH’s triangle pattern, which began forming at the start of last month’s recovery rally. During that period, the price compressed between the support and resistance lines, with the latter situated around the $2,700 mark. He forecasted a 15% surge toward the $3,100 level if the altcoin reclaimed the crucial resistance level. Based on this, Ethereum could climb another 10.7% if it holds its current range. Runefelt also pointed out another bullish formation in ETH’s trading pair against Bitcoin (BTC). According to the ETH/BTC chart, Ethereum also formed a bullish pennant pattern during the May rally. Amid this week’s recovery, the cryptocurrency has broken out of the formation’s upper boundary, eyeing a 30% surge toward the 0.03300 mark. ETH To Repeat History? Market Watcher Kaleo highlighted the resemblance between ETH’s performance between 2020 and 2025. According to the analyst, there are “a lot of similarities on the chart to where we are now vs. where we were in 2020.” As he explained, in the Spring of 2020, Ethereum experienced a major sell-off, fueled by the COVID-19 crash, which sent its price below a key higher timeframe (HFT) support. However, once the ascending trendline was reclaimed as support, ETH was “up only for the next 20 months.” Kaleo detailed the recent sell-off, caused by the Trump Tariffs scare, sent the altcoin below its multi-year ascending support trendline, adding that “ETH is currently on the verge of reclaiming that line.” Related Reading: Solana Triangle Formation Breakout Targets Rally To $164 – Is A Recovery Around The Corner? The analyst suggested that if history repeats, investors could see “another great ETH bull run and accompanying alt season.” Meanwhile, analyst DonAlt affirmed that ETH’s chart looks “pretty good” amid its HTF range reclaim. To him, a new all-time high (ATH) is likely if the $3,800 resistance is reclaimed, while the rally’s invalidation level is a close below the $2,200 mark. As of this writing, ETH trades at $2,803, a 6.7% increase in the daily timeframe.
