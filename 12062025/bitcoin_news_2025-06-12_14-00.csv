2025-06-12T11:51:28,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 12, 2025","After two days of rising prices, the crypto market is down today. Nearly all top 100 coins have recorded decreases over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 4% to $3.51 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $132 billion. TL;DR: The market turns red today, most top 100 coins are down; BTC dropped to the $107,500 level, ETH is at $2,749; Ethereum’s bounce-back signals more than just price action; Volatility expectations are increasing; US spot ETH ETFs outperform their BTC counterparts: $240.29 million vs $164.57 million; Markets are digesting the news of the US-China trade agreement and the US inflation report; The dip may be a short-term development, but the market is at a crossroads. Crypto Winners & Losers In complete contrast to yesterday’s situation, all top 10 coins per market cap have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 1.7%, dropping from the $109,500 level to the current price of $107,563. Ethereum (ETH) is close by, decreasing by 1.6% to the price of $2,749. While Dogecoin (DOGE) was the highest gainer yesterday, it saw the highest drop in this category today: 6.2% to $0.1898. Moreover, most of the top 100 coins are down today. Only four are up, with SPX6900 (SPX) recording the highest increase of 8.1% to $1.68. Jupiter (JUP) saw the highest decrease, and the only double-digit one: 10.6% to $0.4538. The markets have seen a variety of significant developments this week, including the tentative trade agreement between the US and China, US inflation report, as well as the US Senate voting to invoke cloture on a substitute amendment to the stablecoin GENIUS Act . Big headline, but the devil’s in the details. Let’s see the terms before calling it a game-changer. Markets might pump short-term, but long-term trust takes more than a tweet. — GameCentric (@gamecentric_io) June 11, 2025 Speaking of stablecoins, Ant Group , the Jack Ma-backed fintech giant, plans to apply for stablecoin licenses in key Asian markets. It is eyeing licenses in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as in Luxembourg. Crypto Market Sensitivity to Price Fluctuations Rises Per Glassnode’s latest report, BTC is holding above the psychologically significant $100,000 level, indicating that investor confidence remains robust. At the same time, volatility expectations are rising. The dense concentration of coin supply near the current spot prices increases market sensitivity to price fluctuations, the analysts argue. That said, mature investors have no losses locked. Almost all loss-taking occurred from top buyers across the ATH formation. This suggests “a capitulation of only the most speculative of investors.” Yet, Options At-the-Money Implied Volatility “across all major tenors remain historically low, suggesting that options traders may be underpricing the likelihood of a volatility regime shift,” Glassnode says. Source: Glassnode However, many eyes are on Ethereum these days. Dom Harz, co-founder of Layer-2 BOB , commented that ETH’s price rise in recent days “marks a significant shift in sentiment toward an asset that had, until relatively recently, fallen out of favour.” Ethereum’s bounce-back signals more than just price action, Harz argues. “The momentum reflects a meaningful shift in sentiment, fuelled by a combination of technical progress, market activity, and regulatory signals.” The Pectra upgrade has gone live and been reinforced by the US Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commissioner Paul Atkins’ support for DeFi, as well as the strong performance of Circle’s record-breaking IPO, the co-founder says. “These are exciting times for DeFi and for Ethereum’s role in the industry’s next chapter. Hopefully, we are moving beyond the memecoin noise and back to building scalable, decentralised systems — the foundations for crypto’s future,” Harz concluded. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $107,563, the lowest it’s been today, significantly moving away from the all-time high of $111,814, which it hit on 22 May. Notably, it’s also back to the levels seen at the beginning of this week before it started this latest push upwards. Also notably, this is a pullback from the intraday high of $110,269, indicating the coin’s initiative to move towards and above the ATH. The key support level stands at $97,600, while the resistance is at $115,400. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView In the same time period, Ethereum hit an intraday high of $2,870. It’s also interesting to note that this intraday high moves higher every day. Analysts argue that ETH is poised for further increases. Moreover, the crypto market sentiment slightly decreased within the greed zone. Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell from 65 yesterday to 61 today . This may indicate that the market is overheating and heading for a correction, but there are also movements towards the neutral zone, which would ease these concerns. “Encouragingly, the wave of fear in market sentiment did not translate into a meaningful shift in spending behavior,” Glassnode says. “When assessing losses locked in on-chain, only -$200M of losses were realized, with the magnitude significantly shallower than previous correction events. This suggests that loss-taking remained contained, with investors largely unfazed by the drawdown.” Meanwhile, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw a net inflow of $164.57 million on Wednesday. BlackRock leads the list with $131.01 million. The cumulative total net inflow now stands at $45.22 billion. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs have recorded 18 consecutive days of inflows. Today, they surpassed the BTC counterparts, with $240.29 million in inflows. BlackRock is the biggest contributor to this amount with $163.64 million on 11 June. The cumulative total net inflow climbed to $3.74 billion. According to Seamus Rocca, Chief Executive Officer of Xapo Bank , “the rise of corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin is significant, but it shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions. It’s about allocating what a business can afford to hold over a five-to-ten-year horizon, without being forced to sell into volatility.” Companies like Strategy and Metaplanet represent “high-conviction outliers, headline grabbers with bold strategies that align with their unique business aims.” However, for most others, a more measured approach is better suited – “one grounded in long-term belief, not short-term reliance on volatility. In this space, patience and discipline can be underrated virtues,” Rocca emphasizes. “Our view has been, and remains, that Bitcoin deserves serious consideration—but with a disciplined, long-term framework: focus on the asset itself, avoid speculative trading, and size positions responsibly,” Rocca concludes. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move with stocks today? Both the crypto and stock markets have increased in the last day, though crypto’s increase is notably higher. The S&P 500 has decreased by 0.27%, the Nasdaq-100 is down 0.37%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.0026%. The markets are reacting to and are still digesting the developments related to Wednesday’s US inflation report and the result of the trade talks between the US and China. Is this dip sustainable? The dip may be brief, followed by another rally, given the still prevailing bullish sentiment. However, the market stands at a crossroads, and further dips, even if short-term, are possible.

To deal with the potential losses, the investment bank is planning to put aside hundreds of millions of dollars more than it did in the previous quarter, Bloomberg reports . While speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference this week, Vis Raghavan, Citigroup’s head of banking, reportedly cautioned that the firm’s credit reserve build can change its outlook rapidly. “Given the macro environment, etc., cost of credit compared to last quarter, we expect to be up a few hundred million.” Bloomberg also reports, however, that analysts expect loan losses to go down in the second quarter. Raghavan said 80% of Citigroup’s corporate exposure is to entities with high creditworthiness. “We still have a few more weeks to go in this quarter, but on the credit overall, I’m incredibly reassured of the quality.” The executive reportedly notes, however, that the firm’s investment banking business has been hurt by the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. “What investment banking likes is clarity.

2025-06-12T11:40:18,"Bitcoin Adoption: Why Only 121 Public Companies Have Taken the Plunge (So Far)","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Adoption: Why Only 121 Public Companies Have Taken the Plunge (So Far) In the ever-evolving world of finance and technology, the idea of companies holding digital assets like Bitcoin is gaining traction. Yet, a recent insight from Bitwise Head of Research in Europe, André Dragosch, shared on X, highlights just how early we are in this trend. Citing data from Bitcoin Treasuries, Dragosch revealed a surprising statistic: only 121 public companies globally currently hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. This number, when compared to the sheer volume of publicly listed companies worldwide – like the 5,000 included in the U.S. Wilshire 5000 Index alone – truly underscores the nascent stage of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . Understanding the Scope of Public Companies Holding Bitcoin The fact that merely 121 public entities out of tens of thousands worldwide have decided to allocate a portion of their treasury reserves to Bitcoin is a powerful indicator. It’s not just about the number itself, but what it represents in the grand scheme of global corporate finance. Think about the vast number of publicly traded companies across major economies – from the United States and Europe to Asia and beyond. The vast majority have yet to dip their toes into the Bitcoin waters. The data from sources like Bitcoin Treasuries is crucial because it provides a transparent look at which companies are leading the charge and, more importantly, highlights the massive untouched market. While names like MicroStrategy and Tesla often come to mind when discussing Public Companies Holding Bitcoin , they are part of a very small, pioneering group. This isn’t mainstream yet; it’s still the early adopter phase. Why Are So Few Public Companies Holding Bitcoin on Balance Sheet? If Bitcoin offers potential benefits, why is the number of companies holding it so low? Several significant hurdles stand in the way of putting Bitcoin on Balance Sheet for many corporations. These challenges range from regulatory uncertainty to internal complexities: Regulatory Ambiguity: Governments worldwide are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies. This lack of clear rules creates uncertainty for corporations concerned about compliance and future legal requirements. Accounting Treatment: Accounting standards for digital assets are still developing. Companies face challenges in how to value, report, and manage the tax implications of holding volatile assets like Bitcoin. Until recently, U.S. GAAP treated Bitcoin as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, often leading to impairment losses on price drops without recognizing gains until sold, which wasn’t appealing. New FASB rules offering fair-value accounting might change this. Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings. Corporations are typically risk-averse with treasury assets, prioritizing stability and liquidity. The volatility of Bitcoin is a major deterrent for many CFOs. Lack of Familiarity and Expertise: Understanding Bitcoin, its underlying technology, security requirements, and market dynamics requires specialized knowledge that many traditional corporate finance teams lack. Custody and Security Concerns: Safely storing and managing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols and reliable custody solutions, which can be complex and costly to implement at a corporate level. Stakeholder Skepticism: Boards of directors, shareholders, and even employees within a company might be skeptical or resistant to the idea of holding a volatile and relatively new asset like Bitcoin. Limited Use Cases for Treasury: Unlike traditional assets (cash, bonds) used for short-term needs or stable returns, Bitcoin’s primary appeal for treasury is long-term appreciation and inflation hedging, which doesn’t fit all corporate financial strategies. These factors combine to create a high barrier to entry, explaining why the list of Public Companies Holding Bitcoin remains exclusive. What’s the Appeal? Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Despite the challenges, the 121 companies that have adopted Bitcoin see significant potential upsides. For these pioneers, integrating Bitcoin for Businesses isn’t just a speculative bet; it’s often a strategic decision driven by several potential benefits: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation potentially devaluing fiat currencies, Bitcoin’s fixed supply is seen by some as a potential store of value and hedge against purchasing power erosion. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has shown significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial returns on treasury assets that traditionally yield very little. Treasury Diversification: Adding a non-correlated or lowly-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a corporate treasury portfolio beyond traditional cash and fixed-income instruments. Innovation and Forward Thinking: Adopting Bitcoin can signal that a company is innovative, forward-thinking, and adaptable to new technologies, which can be attractive to investors and talent, particularly in the tech sector. Attracting Institutional Investment: As institutional interest grows, being a company already familiar with and holding digital assets could potentially make it more appealing to a certain class of investors interested in the space. These benefits, while accompanied by risks, are compelling enough for a small but growing number of companies to navigate the complexities and become pioneers in Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . Examples of Institutional Bitcoin Investment in the Corporate World When we talk about the 121 Public Companies Holding Bitcoin , a few names inevitably dominate the conversation due to the size of their holdings and their vocal advocacy. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, is arguably the most prominent example, having made substantial Bitcoin acquisitions a core part of its corporate strategy. Tesla, under Elon Musk, also made headlines with a significant purchase, though they have adjusted their holdings over time. Beyond these tech giants, companies across various sectors, from finance (like Block, formerly Square) to mining and even food service (though less common), are represented in the list of 121. Each company likely has its own specific reasons and strategies for holding Bitcoin, whether it’s primarily as a treasury reserve asset, for transactional purposes, or as part of a broader digital asset strategy. The actions of these leading companies serve as case studies and potential blueprints (or cautionary tales) for others considering Institutional Bitcoin Investment . Their experiences navigating the challenges and opportunities provide valuable insights for the corporate world. What Could Drive More Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? If the number is currently 121, what could potentially increase that number significantly in the future? Several factors could accelerate Corporate Bitcoin Adoption : Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulations and legal frameworks surrounding digital assets would significantly reduce uncertainty and risk for corporations. Improved Accounting Standards: The recent move by FASB towards fair-value accounting for crypto assets held by companies is a positive step that could make holding Bitcoin more attractive from a reporting perspective. More Robust Institutional Infrastructure: Further development of secure custody solutions, easier access to liquidity, and more sophisticated financial products tailored for institutions can lower operational barriers. Peer Adoption: As more companies, especially competitors within the same industry, begin holding Bitcoin, others may feel compelled to investigate or adopt it themselves to avoid being left behind or to understand a potential strategic advantage. Increased Education and Familiarity: As corporate finance professionals become more educated about digital assets, the perceived risks may decrease, and the potential benefits become clearer. Stable Market Conditions (Relative): While volatility is inherent, periods of relative stability or sustained upward trends could make the asset more palatable for risk-averse corporate treasuries. These potential catalysts suggest that while 121 is a small number now, it may not remain so indefinitely. The path to broader Bitcoin for Businesses adoption is being paved, albeit slowly. Conclusion: Early Days, Significant Potential The finding that only 121 public companies hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets is a stark reminder of how early we are in the journey of corporate digital asset integration. It highlights the significant challenges – regulatory, accounting, and psychological – that still deter the vast majority of corporations. However, it also points to immense potential. The 121 pioneers represent the thin edge of the wedge, demonstrating that holding Bitcoin is feasible and strategically beneficial for some. As the regulatory landscape matures, accounting standards improve, and the infrastructure for Institutional Bitcoin Investment becomes more robust, we could see this number grow substantially. The narrative isn’t that corporate adoption has failed; it’s that it’s just beginning. The coming years will reveal whether the early trickle turns into a steady stream of companies adding Bitcoin to their financial playbooks, fundamentally changing the landscape of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption .

The aim is to introduce the adorable crypto-native characters to a global audience of motorsport enthusiasts, with the announcement generating considerable excitement. The partnership highlights a broader trend of crypto solidifying its position across both digital and real-world landscapes, bridging the gap in new and interesting ways. While assets like $BTC are often touted as a modern alternative to gold , the ecosystem is evolving fast, with real-world applications and brand-building efforts now gaining serious traction. This venture marks another major success for Pudgy Penguins, which has defied the general NFT market downturn by launching video games and successfully placing merchandise in over 2K US retailers, including Walmart and Target. High-Speed Opportunities on the Meme Coin Circuit The high-octane world of NASCAR parallels the fast-paced crypto market, where new projects are constantly emerging. If you’re looking to get in on the ground floor of the next potential breakout, several new meme coins are currently generating buzz with presale events. With the success of established brands like Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU), attention will shift to upcoming new meme coin projects that blend viral meme culture with unique features. Will this Pudgy NASCAR partnership help coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as investors search for the next project with an increased return on investment? Let’s explore this below. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Nose to the Ground, Sniping for Pole Position: The $SNORT Advantage Innovation comes in waves, and the savvy investors will already be looking for the next breakout project. While Pudgy Penguins masterfully takes to the NASCAR track, a new contender is revving its engine on the meme coin circuit: Snorter Token ($SNORT) . $SNORT answers the call for a blend of meme culture with genuine utility. It’s built around the Snorter Bot, a unique AI-driven tool designed to analyze market trends, sniff out opportunities, and provide a tangible edge to its community through its many features. This moves beyond hype, delivering a project with the horsepower to potentially lead the pack. It learns from the brand-building success of pioneers by offering a clear, engaging value proposition from the starting line. If you’re looking to get in the driver’s seat, you can buy $SNORT for $0.0949, and with staking rewards of 462%, you could see a hefty return. Ensure you don’t miss out: allow us to guide you through the buying process .2. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – Sliding Past the Competition: How a Smart Huddle Led to the Checkered Flag Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) is tyre screeching around the bend, taking a victory lap, whilst other cryptos are just approaching the starting line. The NASCAR partnership is a strategic long-term move, plus they’ve cleverly combined cute penguins and fast cars – a winning combination in our eyes. $PENGU kept its head down during the bear market and continued to build its brand whilst other crypto projects faded into obscurity. It strategically placed the adorable characters into the world’s biggest retail stores and built an ecosystem that delivers value. $PENGU is more than a moment; it embodies a movement that has masterfully bridged the digital and physical world. It bridges the gap between the digital collectibles and their massive fan base. You can buy $PENGU from reputable exchanges, such as Mexc and Binance , for around $0.01099. Holding $PENGU grants you access to exclusive events, rewards, and a voice in the project’s future. It allows the millions who enjoy the Pudgy Penguins’ viral content and physical toys to participate directly in the ecosystem. 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – From Bitcoin’s Starting Grid to Nitro-Charged Speeds Bitcoin Hyper($HYPER) pulls into the pit lane, not one to miss out on showing itself as the next innovation. It answers the simple question: What if you could combine the legendary trust of the $BTC name with the hyper-speed performance needed for today’s digital economy? $HYPER aims to do just that, being one of the first meme-oriented Layer 2 scaling solutions for the Bitcoin network engineered for blistering transaction speeds. It’s not about reinventing the wheel; it’s about making it spin faster than ever before, to solve $BTC’s historically slow transaction speeds and high fees. If you’re tired of network congestion, $HYPER is designed to be the fast lane. Its staking rewards of up to 650% also aim to help your investments speed ahead of the competition. Having already smashed the $1M barrier, $HYPER is quickly becoming one of the best crypto presales . Still in presale, you can buy $HYPER for $0.01185, and we’d recommend doing so soon as we predict it could reach $0.32 by the end of 2025 , giving you a potential 2600% increase on today’s price. The Final Lap: Choosing Your Racer The world of Crypto is full of excitement, featuring established coins like $PENGU setting the pace, while new challengers rev their engines. High-octane projects, from the AI-driven approach of $SNORT to the ambitious Layer 2 solution proposed by $HYPER , represent the thrilling, high-stakes nature of the meme coin circuit. However, picking a winner isn’t about passive observation. Before backing any project, you must do your own research, looking under the hood in great detail and understanding the roadmap to navigate any twists and turns.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/pudgy-penguins-partners-with-nascar-new-meme-coins-on-presale/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T11:35:00,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano’s price is expected to surpass $0.967 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $3.11. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $9.86 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.6855 Market Cap $24.23 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $687.05 Million Circulating Supply 44.99 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.7304 24-hour Low $0.6846 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.40% 50-day SMA $ 0.7306 14-Day RSI 47.94 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 71 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADA/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart on June 12, Cardano (ADA) is exhibiting bearish pressure, currently trading at $0.686 below the midline of the Bollinger Bands ($0.701). The RSI stands at 45.87, approaching oversold territory but not yet signalling substantial bullish divergence. The price has recently rejected the upper Bollinger Band ($0.775), suggesting resistance and a lack of bullish follow-through. A drop toward the lower band ($0.627) is possible if momentum remains weak. Conversely, a breakout above $0.701 with strong volume may indicate a trend reversal. For now, the bias leans bearish, with potential for a retest of lower support zones. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADA/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart for ADA, the market is experiencing weak momentum within a narrow consolidation range. The price is hovering around $0.687, slightly below the midline of the Bollinger Bands ($0.699), with resistance at $0.733 and support near $0.665. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, suggesting early bullish divergence, although the histogram remains flat, reflecting low conviction. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power remains neutral around 0.00, indicating neither buyers nor sellers dominate. Unless ADA breaks above $0.699 with volume, price action may stay range-bound or tilt bearish if support is breached in the short term. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $ 0.675497 BUY SMA 5 $ 0.697773 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.687697 SELL SMA 21 $ 0.717228 SELL SMA 50 $ 0.730696 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.714043 SELL SMA 200 $ 0.649839 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $ 0.708053 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.704837 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.6904 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.688565 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.721562 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.75492 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.725639 SELL What to expect from Cardano price analysis next Based on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts, ADA (Cardano) is showing signs of indecision with a slight bearish undertone. On the 1-day chart, the price has dropped below the mid-Bollinger Band, and RSI at 45.87 suggests weakening bullish momentum. On the 4-hour chart, while the MACD indicates a minor bullish crossover, it lacks strong volume support and the Balance of Power remains neutral. Price hovers around $0.687, constrained between $0.665 support and $0.733 resistance. Without a decisive breakout above the daily mid-band ($0.701), ADA may continue consolidating or drift downward if bearish pressure strengthens near-term. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $0.9665, with an average trading price of about $0.8824 and a minimum price of $0.8475. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA’s average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from $10 to $50 or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano’s (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach $50 to $100 or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below $10. The price will depend on mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano’s recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin’s future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano is likely to surpass $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $6.75. This projection is driven by Cardano’s continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $10 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $9.8 to $10 Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.69, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform’s unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.

It traded between $0.52–$0.401 in April and $0.317–$0.423 by July, with strong support at $0.33 in August.

2025-06-12T11:33:43,"Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming as BTC CAGR Hits 31%","The post Bitcoin Bull Run Incoming as BTC CAGR Hits 31% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s strong performance in April and May has reignited hopes for a major bullish breakout. From April 9 to May 22, the Bitcoin price surged by 46.32%, including an 18.48% rally between May 5 and 22. The price recovery has also pushed its Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) higher, signaling renewed market optimism. BTC CAGR Spikes as Price Recovers Crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr recently highlighted a notable spike in Bitcoin’s 4-year CAGR. In April 2025, it had dropped to just 7% , reflecting Bitcoin’s volatile start to the year. In January, BTC grew by 9.54%, but the following months saw sharp declines—down 17.5% in February and 2.19% in March. The price even touched a low of $74,446.79 in April. However, the market rebounded strongly. By June 2025, Adler reports that Bitcoin’s CAGR climbed back to 31%. “This sharp rebound shows how quickly the long-term trend can shift when strong buyer momentum enters the market,” Adler stated. Yet, he notes that 31% CAGR is still below historical bull market peaks, implying more room for growth. $168K BTC by October? Axel Adler Jr forecasts a possible Bitcoin price target of $168,000 by October 2025 , assuming momentum in the futures market and leverage continues. He bases this projection on accelerating growth and historical patterns observed during prior bull runs.

Novogratz Warns Against Strategy “Copycats” , Adjusting for Risk: CAGR vs. Standard Deviation In the discussion thread, X user Manu suggested a more refined way to interpret CAGR—by dividing it by the standard deviation to eliminate volatility and highlight risk-adjusted returns. Adler agreed with the approach, stating it offers a cleaner view of market performance, but also emphasized another critical point: “The real inflection point comes when investors start taking profits based on expected returns.” According to him, the risk of a bear market grows once BTC trading volume crosses 1 million coins, as large-scale profit-taking can disrupt supply-demand balance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-12T11:31:07,"European Giant 21Shares Announces Its Summer and 2025 Year-End Price Prediction for Bitcoin (BTC)!","This week, important economic data will come from the US for Bitcoin. The first of these, the CPI data, was announced yesterday and came in below expectations. US PPI data will be released today. At this point, while the decline in inflation is seen as positive for Bitcoin (BTC), 21Shares analyst Matt Mena said that the lower-than-expected US inflation data has prepared the necessary ground for Bitcoin to reach $200,000 by the end of the year. Mena stated that inflation data will fall further and that as the macroeconomic outlook becomes clearer, Bitcoin reserve and ETF inflows will accelerate and the price will rise. Mena thinks Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of the year. “This cooling trend in inflation strengthens the case for a possible easing of policy later this year. As the Fed's June meeting approaches, the focus is now shifting to how quickly policymakers can respond to cooling inflation and changing macro clarity. At this point, yesterday's inflation data could act as a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin and bring the $200,000 target forward by a few months. “If disinflation momentum continues to build, $200,000 is now firmly in play for Bitcoin by the end of the year.” The 21 Shares analyst recently said that rising spot ETF inflows, regulatory progress and US President Donald Trump’s BTC strategic reserve plan could accelerate Bitcoin’s rise above the $105,000-$110,000 range and push it above $138,000 by summer. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-12T11:30:08,"US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $165.77M Ignites Hope in Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: $165.77M Ignites Hope in Crypto Market Are you watching the pulse of the crypto market ? Recent data reveals a significant positive signal that investors are keenly observing: consistent inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETF products. This trend is often seen as a key indicator of growing institutional and retail interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Breaking Down the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows The landscape for investing in digital assets has shifted dramatically since the approval of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in the United States. These regulated investment vehicles offer a familiar and accessible way for traditional investors to participate in Bitcoin’s price movements. On June 11th, these funds collectively saw a net inflow of $165.77 million. This figure, reported by analyst Trader T on X, marks a crucial point: it was the third consecutive trading day experiencing positive net inflows. This streak suggests a potential shift in sentiment or strategy among investors, moving from periods of outflows back towards accumulation. Which BTC ETF Led the Charge on June 11th? While the total inflow figure is important, looking at individual fund performance provides deeper insight. On June 11th, several key players contributed significantly to the positive total: BlackRock IBIT: Leading the pack by a wide margin, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded an impressive $132.21 million in net inflows. This highlights IBIT’s continued dominance and popularity among investors. VanEck HODL: VanEck’s Bitcoin Trust (HODL) followed, adding $15.39 million in net new money. Fidelity FBTC: Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) also saw a healthy influx, with $11.87 million in net inflows. Franklin Templeton EZBC: Franklin Templeton’s Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) contributed $6.3 million to the day’s total. Interestingly, the remaining spot BTC ETF products tracked for the day reported no significant net changes, meaning their inflows and outflows essentially balanced out. Understanding the Significance of US Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Why do these numbers matter so much for the broader crypto market ? Spot Bitcoin ETFs directly purchase and hold actual Bitcoin to back the shares they issue. Therefore, net inflows into these funds translate directly into buying pressure on the underlying asset – Bitcoin (BTC). Benefits of Consistent Inflows: Price Support: Sustained buying from ETFs can help support or even drive up Bitcoin’s price. Institutional Validation: Large inflows often come from institutional investors or financial advisors allocating client funds, signaling increasing mainstream acceptance. Market Liquidity: Higher trading volumes and assets under management in ETFs can improve overall market liquidity. Potential Challenges: Market Volatility: While inflows are positive, the crypto market remains volatile, and ETF flows can reverse quickly. Correlation Risk: ETF performance is directly tied to Bitcoin’s price, exposing investors to its inherent risks. The consistent positive flow over three days, especially led by major players like BlackRock IBIT , is often interpreted as a bullish signal. It suggests that despite recent price fluctuations, demand for Bitcoin exposure via regulated products remains strong. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean? For investors watching the space, tracking Bitcoin ETF inflows provides valuable data points. While past performance and short-term flows are not guarantees of future results, they offer insights into current market sentiment and potential demand drivers. The June 11th data reinforces the narrative that the infrastructure for traditional finance to access Bitcoin is actively being utilized. This trend highlights the increasing integration of digital assets into traditional investment portfolios. As more financial advisors and institutions become comfortable with these products, the potential for continued growth in the US spot Bitcoin ETF market remains significant. A Compelling Summary of Recent Trends In conclusion, the $165.77 million in net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETF products on June 11th is a notable development. It signifies the third consecutive day of positive flows, indicating renewed investor interest. The strong performance of funds like BlackRock IBIT underscores their prominent role in facilitating access to Bitcoin for a broader audience. These consistent inflows provide a positive signal for the crypto market , suggesting underlying demand remains robust and the adoption of regulated Bitcoin investment vehicles is continuing its upward trajectory.

Source: BTCUSDT on Tradingview Top Bitcoin Pundit: Watch Out For This Level According to Daan Crypto, a senior crypto analyst, the Bitcoin price has weakened due to changes in the macroeconomic arena. In that sense, the analyst believes bull must hold the levels above $99,000 or they risk a bigger decline into the monthly lows sitting at around $90,000, as seen in the chart below. Some of the elements affecting the Bitcoin price on the macro side include a good Consumer Price Index (CPI) print from the US, and a ‘good deal’ between this country and Chinese representatives. These news indicate decline in inflation and potentially an end to trade war between the two giants, respectively. However, the analysis noted: At this point I’m fairly certain that if price breaks either the current monthly high or low, that it will keep trending that direction for the rest of June (and possible beyond). Eyes on those levels. Still quite a volatile and headline driven market currently(…). So markets down on good news is always something to note. Just one day for now but good to be aware of.

2025-06-12T11:10:00,"Israel Iran Conflict: Urgent Report on Potential Strike and Market Impact","BitcoinWorld Israel Iran Conflict: Urgent Report on Potential Strike and Market Impact Recent reports from CBS News have sent ripples of concern across global markets, including the ever-watchful cryptocurrency space. The core of the report? Israel is reportedly preparing for a significant military operation against Iran. This development isn’t just a headline from a distant region; it’s a potential flashpoint that could inject considerable market volatility into an already uncertain global economic landscape, with direct implications for the Crypto Market Impact . Understanding the Israel Iran Conflict Report According to CBS News, citing multiple sources, Israel is poised for a strike against Iran. This isn’t a mere possibility being discussed; the report suggests preparations are actively underway. The gravity of this situation is underscored by the actions of the United States, a key ally of Israel. The U.S. has reportedly advised its citizens to consider leaving the region and has ordered non-essential government personnel to evacuate Iraq. These precautionary measures highlight the perceived seriousness and potential immediate fallout of such an action. The source content provided is concise, stating: Israel is prepared to launch a military operation against Iran, prompting the U.S. to advise its citizens to leave the region and order non-essential government personnel to evacuate Iraq, CBS News reported, citing multiple sources. This brief statement carries immense weight, suggesting a significant escalation in the long-standing tensions between the two nations. While the exact timing and nature of any potential operation remain undisclosed, the report itself is enough to trigger concern among governments, businesses, and investors worldwide. Why Geopolitical Risk Matters for Your Portfolio In the complex world of finance, assets don’t exist in a vacuum. They are constantly influenced by a myriad of factors, including economic data, corporate performance, and, crucially, geopolitical events. Geopolitical Risk refers to the risk of loss due to political instability or conflict in a region or country. This can manifest in various ways: Supply Chain Disruption: Conflicts can halt trade routes, impact energy supplies (especially in the Middle East), and disrupt the flow of goods and services globally. Policy Changes: Governments might impose sanctions, tariffs, or other restrictive measures in response to conflicts, affecting international business and investment. Increased Uncertainty: Geopolitical instability creates unpredictability, making investors hesitant to commit capital, which can lead to market downturns. Currency Fluctuations: Conflicts can weaken or strengthen national currencies depending on the perceived safety or economic exposure of the country involved. The potential Israel Iran Conflict is a textbook example of high-stakes geopolitical risk. Both nations are significant regional powers, and any direct military confrontation could quickly draw in other actors and have far-reaching consequences that extend well beyond their borders. For investors, ignoring such risks is akin to ignoring a major storm on the horizon – it’s essential to understand its potential impact on your financial well-being. Examining the Impact of Middle East Tensions on Global Finance The Middle East has historically been a focal point of global energy production and a critical crossroads for international trade. Consequently, Middle East Tensions have a disproportionate impact on the global economy compared to many other regions. Here’s why: Oil Prices: The region contains a significant portion of the world’s proven oil reserves. Any instability or conflict raises concerns about supply disruptions, leading to spikes in oil prices. Higher oil prices act like a tax on consumers and businesses globally, potentially slowing economic growth and fueling inflation. Shipping Routes: Key maritime chokepoints, such as the Strait of Hormuz, are located in the region. Conflicts can threaten these routes, disrupting global shipping and increasing costs for virtually all imported goods. Investor Confidence: Persistent tensions create an environment of uncertainty that erodes investor confidence. This can lead to capital flight from the region and a general risk-off sentiment globally, where investors move money out of riskier assets into perceived safe havens. The potential Israel Iran Conflict adds another layer of complexity to existing Middle East Tensions, which have already been elevated due to various factors in recent years. A direct confrontation between these two nations could be significantly more disruptive than proxy conflicts, potentially triggering a larger regional crisis with severe global economic repercussions. Navigating Market Volatility in Uncertain Times Reports like the one from CBS News about the potential Israel Iran Conflict are direct catalysts for Market Volatility . Volatility refers to the degree of variation of a trading price over time. High volatility means prices can change dramatically in a short period, in either direction. This can be unnerving for investors. During times of heightened geopolitical risk and Middle East Tensions, we often see predictable patterns in traditional markets: Stock Markets: Tend to decline as investors sell off riskier assets. Sectors heavily reliant on global trade or stable energy prices might be particularly affected. Oil Prices: Almost always spike upwards on fears of supply disruption. Gold: Often sees inflows as investors seek its traditional safe-haven status. Government Bonds: Prices of bonds from stable countries (like U.S. Treasuries) may rise as demand increases, pushing yields down. Understanding these typical reactions is crucial for navigating the choppy waters that geopolitical events create. While volatility presents risks, it can also, for some, present opportunities, but it requires a clear head and a well-thought-out strategy rather than reactive panic. Potential Crypto Market Impact: What Investors Need to Know Now, let’s connect these dots to our specific interest: the cryptocurrency market. The Crypto Market Impact of geopolitical events is a subject of ongoing debate and observation. Unlike traditional assets tied to specific national economies or industries, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often touted as decentralized and borderless assets, potentially acting as a hedge against traditional financial system instability and geopolitical risk. However, the reality is more complex. While Bitcoin has, at times, shown characteristics of a digital safe haven, the crypto market as a whole is still relatively young and can be highly correlated with traditional risk assets, especially technology stocks. Here’s a look at potential impacts: Potential Scenarios for Crypto: Initial Sell-off: In the immediate aftermath of concerning news like the CBS report on the Israel Iran Conflict , the broader market fear might lead to a general risk-off move, causing investors to sell all perceived risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, to move into cash or traditional safe havens like gold or the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin as a Safe Haven (Debated): Some argue that persistent geopolitical risk and concerns about fiat currency stability or government control could drive investors towards decentralized assets like Bitcoin. If the conflict escalates and creates significant global economic uncertainty or impacts traditional financial systems, Bitcoin could potentially see increased demand. Increased Correlation: The crypto market has shown increased correlation with traditional stock indices (like the S&P 500) in recent years. This means that if the geopolitical tensions cause a significant downturn in stock markets due to Market Volatility, the crypto market might follow suit. Impact on Specific Regions: Tensions and potential conflict in the Middle East could also accelerate crypto adoption or usage in affected regions, either as a way to circumvent potential financial restrictions or as a store of value against local currency instability. Considerations for Crypto Investors: Given the potential for increased Market Volatility stemming from Middle East Tensions and the specific Geopolitical Risk highlighted by the CBS report on the Israel Iran Conflict , what should crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of geopolitical developments, but be wary of sensationalism. Rely on credible news sources. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how potential market downturns could affect your portfolio and emotional state. Review Your Portfolio: Consider if your current asset allocation aligns with your risk tolerance in a potentially more volatile environment. Diversification, even within crypto (e.g., holding stablecoins), might be a consideration. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Volatility can trigger fear and panic. Have a strategy and try to stick to it rather than making impulsive decisions based on short-term price swings. Long-Term Perspective: For many crypto investors, the focus is on the long-term potential of the technology and assets. Short-term geopolitical events, while impactful, may be viewed through this long-term lens. Ultimately, the Crypto Market Impact of the potential Israel Iran Conflict is uncertain and could unfold in multiple ways. It serves as a stark reminder that external global events, far removed from blockchain development or adoption rates, can significantly influence asset prices. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in a Connected World The CBS News report detailing Israel’s preparations for a strike on Iran is a significant development that immediately raises the global temperature. It’s a stark reminder of the persistent Geopolitical Risk present in the world, particularly emanating from long-standing Middle East Tensions . For anyone with exposure to financial markets, including the dynamic cryptocurrency space, this report signals a period of potential increased Market Volatility . While the direct and specific Crypto Market Impact is difficult to predict with certainty, it’s clear that such high-stakes geopolitical events do not occur in isolation. They influence traditional markets, energy prices, and overall investor sentiment, all of which can ripple through the crypto ecosystem. Staying informed, understanding the potential connections between global events and market reactions, and maintaining a disciplined approach are crucial for navigating these uncertain times. Whether crypto acts as a safe haven or follows traditional risk assets during this potential escalation remains to be seen, but being aware of the risks posed by the potential Israel Iran Conflict is the first step in preparing for whatever comes next.

2025-06-12T10:54:08,"How Much Bitcoin (BTC) Are Institutional Investors Holding? Here Are the Latest Surprising Figures…","Bitcoin (BTC) purchases have increased, led by the largest institutional bull, MicroStrategy (Strategy). In recent months, many companies, including US giant GameStop, have purchased BTC for the first time. A study at this point revealed that approximately one-third of the Bitcoin supply is held in central institutions. According to recent research by Gemini and Glassnode, it was found that nearly a third (30.9%) of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, or approximately 6.1 million BTC, is held by institutions. These BTCs, worth $668 billion, are held in central treasuries, including governments, ETFs, and public companies. According to the report, these figures represent a 924% increase over the past decade, indicating that these organizations view Bitcoin as a strategic store of value. “As institutional adoption has increased, the price of Bitcoin has risen from below $1,000 to over $100,000 over the same period, reinforcing the thesis that institutions are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a strategic asset. “While Bitcoin remains a risky asset, its integration with traditional finance has made its price action more reliable and less susceptible to speculative excesses.” The Gemini and Glassnode research also found that sovereign treasury wallets move infrequently and show little correlation to Bitcoin’s price cycles. However, the report noted that there is enough BTC in government treasuries to influence its price, and that when Bitcoins are moved or sold, they can affect markets. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-12T10:52:55,"Who controls Bitcoin? Just 216 entities now hold 30% of supply","Over 30% of Bitcoin ’s ( BTC ) circulating supply is now concentrated in the hands of just 216 centralized entities, according to the latest blockchain data from a Gemini and Glassnode report . The trend reflects both expanding institutional adoption and growing custodial centralization in the world’s largest cryptocurrency . The scale of this shift is striking. A decade ago, centralized exchanges collectively held just under 600,000 BTC for their users. Today the total amount of Bitcoin held across major institutional and custodial entities has surged to an estimated 6,145,207 BTC, a 924% increase over the past ten years. With this centralization comes as Bitcoin’s spot price continues to climb. Since early 2015, Bitcoin has risen from below $1,000 to now trading above $107,000, reinforcing its growing appeal as a strategic asset among large institutional players. The data spans 216 entities across six key categories: centralized exchanges, ETFs and funds, public companies, private companies, DeFi contracts, and governments. While the dataset is not exhaustive, it captures the most influential actors now collectively controlling nearly one-third of Bitcoin’s supply. The chart below shows this evolution visually. Exchanges (shown in orange) remain the dominant custodians of Bitcoin holdings, followed by ETFs and funds (yellow), with noticeable growth in holdings by private companies (blue) and governments (green) over the past two years. Public companies and DeFi contracts represent smaller but steadily growing segments of institutional Bitcoin ownership. Bitcoin holdings by entity type. Source: Glassnode/Gemini What is driving this trend in centralized Bitcoin adoption? Several factors appear to be at play. First, the rise of regulated Bitcoin ETFs and funds in major markets like the US and Europe has enabled a broader class of institutional investors to gain exposure to BTC without managing private keys directly, which has contributed to the significant growth in custodial balances. Second, as Bitcoin matures as an asset class, public and private companies are increasingly adding BTC to their treasuries, both as a hedge against fiat debasement and as a long-term strategic reserve. Notable examples include MicroStrategy, Tesla , and a growing number of smaller firms. Third, government holdings, once negligible, have begun to climb. While still small in absolute terms, several governments now report seized BTC balances or have quietly added Bitcoin to their reserves. But this deepening institutional embrace comes with trade-offs. On one hand, greater participation by regulated entities enhances Bitcoin’s legitimacy and liquidity. On the other, it also increases custodial risk and undermines one of Bitcoin’s core principles: decentralized ownership. As exchanges and custodians aggregate ever larger portions of the total supply, systemic risks emerge. A significant security breach or regulatory action targeting a handful of these entities could trigger outsized impacts on the broader Bitcoin market. For now, the trajectory is clear. Institutions continue to accumulate Bitcoin, and the network’s original ideal of wide, sovereign individual ownership is giving way, at least in part, to a more centralized custody model.

2025-06-12T10:51:35,"Strategy Launches STRD, Its Third 'Bitcoin-Backed' Preferred Stock on Nasdaq","Strategy (MSTR) has officially launched trading of its third "" bitcoin-backed preferred stock"", STRD, on the Nasdaq, with shares making their debut on Wednesday. The new security, formally named the 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD), closed the day slightly higher, gaining 0.24%. STRD offers a fixed 10% annual dividend, making it the highest-yielding instrument among Strategy’s capital offerings, which also include STRF and STRK. Unlike those, STRD is non-convertible and non-cumulative, meaning dividends are paid only when declared by the board and do not accrue if missed. Despite this added risk, the product is positioned to attract long-term investors seeking strong yield with no management fees. Strategy aims to raise nearly $1 billion through the offering by selling 11.76 million shares at $85 each. Net proceeds are expected to total around $979.7 million after fees and expenses. According to the company, the funds will be used for general corporate purposes, and further accumulation of bitcoin. Investor interest appears strong, including from inside the company. Board member Jarrod Patten disclosed the purchase of 5,000 STRD shares. Patten already holds 28,000 shares of MSTR Class A common stock and 10,000 shares of STRF, another preferred security issued by the company.

2025-06-12T10:51:03,"Offering Free Rewards: 12 Best and Trustworthy Bitcoin Cloud Mining Platforms in 2025","Cloud mining has transformed cryptocurrency earning in 2025, letting users mine Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), and Dogecoin (DOGE) without costly hardware or technical know-how. With platforms offering free bonuses, it’s easier than ever to dip into crypto mining and score daily passive income. But not all sites are created equal—some shine with security, transparency, and high returns, while others fall short. After digging into the market, here’s a detailed rundown of the top 12 cloud mining sites with free bonuses, starting with the standout QFSCOIN and covering HashFly, Richminer, Hartcoin, JU Miner, XYminers, Blockchain Cloud Mining, 35Global (Global Mining), BJ Mining, APT Miner, Winner Mining, and Cryptomining Firm. Let’s explore why these platforms are your best bet for daily BTC, LTC, and DOGE earnings. 1.QFSCOIN: The King of Cloud Mining Since its launch in 2019 in Minnesota, USA, QFSCOIN has set the bar for cloud mining, regulated by U.S. financial authorities. With data centers in the U.S., Canada, Norway, and Iceland, it uses AI-driven tech to mine BTC, LTC, and DOGE efficiently, tapping low-cost, eco-friendly energy in cold climates. QFSCOIN’s killer feature is its free $30 signup bonus, fueling a one-day contract with a 3% return—$0.90 in 24 hours. It’s a no-risk entry, ideal for beginners or cautious investors. QFSCOIN’s platform is slick and simple, with daily automated payouts, no electricity or maintenance fees, and top-notch security via SSL encryption and DDoS protection. Its affiliate program pays up to 3% commission, and 24/7 support keeps users covered. Top Features Commission of up to 3% via the affiliate program. Enhanced security with SSL and DDoS protection. Daily automated payouts. Free mining package available. A wide range of cryptocurrency contracts. 24/7 customer support. No additional costs for electricity. $30 registration bonus . Available Packages Contract Price Contract Term Fixed Return Daily Rate $30 (Free) 1 Day $30 + $0.90 3.00% $100 2 Days $100 + $5 2.50% $300 2 Days $300 + $19.2 3.20% $1,200 3 Days $1,200 + $144 4.00% $3,500 3 Days $3,500 + $630 6.00% $10,000 6 Days $10,000 + $5,400 9.00% Website: https://qfscoin.com Twitter: https://x.com/qfscoin YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@qfscoin 2.HashFly: Reliable but No Free Lunch HashFly boasts a global user base of over a million, offering cloud mining for BTC, LTC, and other coins without hardware hassles. Its interface is beginner-friendly, but unlike QFSCOIN, there’s no free $30 bonus—its “free” plan often requires a small deposit, starting at $50. Payouts are steady but not always daily, and maintenance fees can chip away at profits. Security includes encryption but lacks QFSCOIN’s SSL/DDoS duo. HashFly’s a solid mid-tier choice, but QFSCOIN’s free entry, higher ROI (up to 9% daily), and U.S. regulation steal the show. 3.Richminer: High Costs, Low Trust Richminer offers BTC and LTC mining but demands steep upfront investments, with contracts starting at $200 and no free bonus. Its platform claims daily payouts, but user reviews highlight delays and hidden fees. Security is murky, with no clear mention of SSL or DDoS protection, and there’s no regulatory oversight, raising red flags. Compared to QFSCOIN’s free $30 trial, transparent 6% daily return on $3,500, and U.S.-backed trust, Richminer feels like a gamble for serious miners. 4.Hartcoin: Green but Pricey Hartcoin stands out with its renewable energy-powered mining for BTC and ETH, appealing to eco-conscious users. Contracts start at $150, with no free bonus, but daily payouts and strong encryption keep it competitive. However, it lacks U.S. regulation and supports fewer coins than QFSCOIN’s BTC, LTC, and DOGE lineup. Hartcoin’s green focus is cool, but QFSCOIN’s free $30 deal, no-fee structure, and higher returns (like $5,400 in six days on $10,000) make it more accessible and profitable. 5.JU Miner: Small and Shaky JU Miner is a smaller platform focusing on BTC mining, with contracts starting at $100 and no free trial. Its interface is clunky, and payouts can take days, with returns around 1.8% daily—far below QFSCOIN’s 9% on high-tier plans. Security is basic, with no SSL or DDoS specifics, and there’s no regulation. JU Miner’s lack of scale and transparency can’t compete with QFSCOIN’s global data centers, AI tech, and free $30 entry for daily DOGE earnings. 6.XYminers: Limited and Risky XYminers supports BTC and DOGE mining but offers no free bonus, with plans starting at $120. Its platform is sleek but lacks regulatory backing, and security details are thin—think basic encryption, no DDoS protection. Payouts are weekly, not daily, and returns hover at 1.5% daily. QFSCOIN’s U.S. regulation, daily payouts, and free $30 contract delivering $0.90 in 24 hours make XYminers a tough sell for BTC or LTC miners. 7.Blockchain Cloud Mining: Opaque and Dodgy Blockchain Cloud Mining promises BTC and DOGE mining but falls flat on trust. Contracts start at $200, with no free bonus, and payouts are inconsistent, often delayed by days. Security is a weak link—no SSL, DDoS protection, or regulation, fueling scam concerns. QFSCOIN’s daily payouts, AI-driven efficiency, and U.S.-regulated platform with a free $30 trial outshine this risky option by miles. 8.35Global (Global Mining): Vague Value 35Global, or Global Mining, offers BTC and LTC mining but lacks a free bonus, with contracts starting at $100. Its ROI details are fuzzy, and there’s no regulatory oversight. Security is average, with basic encryption but no DDoS defenses. Payouts are weekly, and returns top out at 2% daily. QFSCOIN’s transparent plans—like $144 in three days on $1,200 at 4% daily—and free $30 bonus make 35Global a weaker contender. 9.BJ Mining: Generic and Underwhelming BJ Mining focuses on BTC mining with contracts starting at $150 and no free trial. Its platform is barebones, with slow payouts and modest returns—around 1.6% daily. Security is minimal, and there’s no regulation, making it less trustworthy. QFSCOIN’s free $30 deal, daily payouts, and high-yield options (like 9% daily on $10,000) leave BJ Mining in the dust for DOGE or LTC mining. 10.APT Miner: Barely Competitive APT Miner offers BTC mining with contracts starting at $100, but there’s no free bonus. Its interface is outdated, and payouts are weekly, with returns around 1.7% daily. Security details are scarce, with no SSL or DDoS protection mentioned. QFSCOIN’s U.S.-regulated platform, free $30 trial, and 3% to 9% daily returns make APT Miner a forgettable choice for daily crypto earnings. 11.Winner Mining: Inconsistent Returns Winner Mining supports BTC and LTC but struggles with reliability. Contracts start at $200, with no free bonus, and payouts can lag, with returns around 2% daily. Security is decent but lacks QFSCOIN’s SSL/DDoS firepower, and there’s no regulation. QFSCOIN’s free $30 contract, daily payouts, and up to $630 in three days on $3,500 make Winner Mining a less appealing option. 12.Cryptomining Firm: Generic and Risky Cryptomining Firm claims to mine BTC and LTC but offers no free bonus, with contracts starting at $250. Its platform lacks transparency, with delayed payouts and hidden fees. Security is questionable, with no regulatory backing or SSL/DDoS details. QFSCOIN’s free $30 trial, U.S. regulation, and clear ROI—like $19.2 in two days on $300 at 3.2% daily—make Cryptomining Firm a risky bet. Why QFSCOIN Takes the Crown QFSCOIN leads the pack with its free $30 bonus, letting users mine BTC, LTC, or DOGE without upfront costs—a feature missing from HashFly, Hartcoin, and others. Its U.S. regulation, SSL/DDoS protection, and AI-driven mining ensure trust and efficiency, unlike unregulated platforms like Blockchain Cloud Mining or XYminers. Daily payouts and no fees outpace Richminer’s delays and Winner Mining’s costs. QFSCOIN’s contracts, from $30 to $10,000 with up to 9% daily returns, crush JU Miner’s 1.8% or BJ Mining’s 1.6% rates. For newbies, QFSCOIN’s $30 bonus and easy setup make mining a breeze. For pros, its high-yield plans and 3% affiliate program unlock serious profits. Compared to 35Global’s vague terms or Cryptomining Firm’s risks, QFSCOIN’s transparency and track record since 2019 shine. To start, visit QFSCOIN’s site, sign up with your email, grab your $30 bonus, and pick a contract. Mine BTC for value, LTC for speed, or DOGE for buzz—QFSCOIN’s the trusted way to earn daily in 2025.

2025-06-12T10:48:44,"Fed Rate Cuts May Fuel Massive Crypto Rally—Altseason on the Horizon","The post Fed Rate Cuts May Fuel Massive Crypto Rally—Altseason on the Horizon appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A popular crypto analyst predicts a massive surge in Bitcoin and altcoins as the U.S. Federal Reserve is now 99.9% likely to cut interest rates this month. Crypto trader and market analyst Cyclop believes the rate cut could push Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $130,000 , followed by a large-cap altcoin rally and the start of a full-blown altseason. However, he cautions that short-term volatility is likely during this period. Fed Rate Cut Almost Certain According to Cyclop, current market indicators show a 99.9% probability that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates in June 2025. Recent U.S. economic data supports this claim: May CPI rose to 321.465, up from 320.795 in April. Inflation rate increased slightly from 2.3% to 2.4%, still below the 3% mark in January. The unemployment rate has remained stable at 4.2% for the past three months. Why Rate Cuts Are Bullish for Crypto Historically, interest rate cuts have been bullish catalysts for crypto markets. Lower rates boost liquidity, reduce borrowing costs, and encourage risk-on investment behavior, leading to: Bitcoin price surges Capital flowing into large-cap altcoins The start of altseason “Cheaper borrowing and rising liquidity create a perfect storm for crypto rallies,” notes Cyclop. Past Rate Cuts and Bitcoin Price Trends In early 2023 , after a significant rate cut, Bitcoin surged by over 20% within weeks. But not all rate cuts guarantee bullish outcomes. In 2024, a minor 25 basis point cut led to a 6% drop in BTC shortly after, highlighting the importance of broader macro conditions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? DJT, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Slide Trigger Panic in Crypto , 3 Key Triggers for Bitcoin Bull Run According to Cyclop, the bullish impact of a Fed rate cut on Bitcoin and altcoins will depend on three key conditions: Inflation drops closer to 2% Unemployment rises above 4.3%-4.4% Clarity around Trump’s proposed tariffs Currently, inflation is at 2.4%, and unemployment sits at 4.2%. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs are still being reviewed by a U.S. appeals court. A final decision is expected after July 31, but reports hint at a potential deal with China on rare earths and new tariff agreements with other nations. Bitcoin and Altseason Price Forecast If these conditions align with the Fed rate cut, Cyclop sees Bitcoin climbing to $130,000 in 2025. He also predicts that altseason could peak in November or December. However, he warns that short-term market fluctuations are inevitable, even if long-term sentiment remains bullish. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Slightly rising inflation (2.4%) and stable unemployment (4.2%) below key thresholds suggest the Fed might proceed with rate cuts. This is generally bullish for crypto as it encourages risk-on investment behavior due to increased liquidity. What are the risks of short-term volatility during a potential rate cut rally? Despite bullish long-term predictions, rate cuts often induce short-term volatility. This is due to profit-taking, leveraged positions being wiped out, and uncertainty around market expectations, leading to rapid price swings. Could upcoming trade negotiations with China affect the crypto bullish trend? Yes, clarity around Trump’s proposed tariffs and any potential trade deals with China (especially on rare earths) could significantly influence the crypto market.

2025-06-12T10:48:40,"Market indices and crypto extend dip as traders ignore US inflation and trade relief","Stocks dropped again Thursday morning as traders ignored fresh inflation data and signs of trade relief between Washington and Beijing, choosing instead to exit risk across the board. S&P 500 futures slid 0.37%, Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.29%, and Dow futures fell by 257 points, or 0.6%. The losses came after a weak Wednesday session, where the S&P 500 broke a three-day streak and closed down 0.3%, with the Nasdaq Composite also shedding 0.5%. The Dow was basically flat. The index is now more than 2% below its all-time high from late February, stalling any momentum toward another record. Traders didn’t wait for Thursday’s Producer Price Index before selling. The monthly inflation read for May was expected at 8:30 a.m. ET, with forecasts from Dow Jones calling for a 0.2% rise in headline prices and a 0.3% bump in core PPI, which excludes food and energy. But the market didn’t care. Positioning was already defensive, with investors reacting to other developments and treating the PPI release like background noise. Dollar weakens as global tensions push traders to safe havens The dollar was already slipping when markets opened, hitting its lowest level since April—a point that also marked its lowest value in three years. According to Dow Jones, it has now lost 10% against a basket of currencies in 2025 alone. Middle East risks and doubts around the strength of the current U.S.–China trade truce pushed investors toward safer currencies. The Swiss franc and Japanese yen gained, each up 0.6% against the dollar. European stocks joined the slide. The STOXX 600 index dropped 0.8%, with airlines and automakers taking the biggest hits as rising oil prices weighed on the sector. Meanwhile, global equities eased after a relentless rally that started in early April. The MSCI All-Country World Index dipped 0.1%, just under its record high from the previous day. Inside the U.S., recent tariff policy from President Donald Trump continued rattling investors. His erratic approach to trade has caused widespread dumping of U.S. assets, especially the dollar, as people brace for higher prices and slower growth. The euro gained from the dollar’s slump, reaching a seven-week high and sitting at $1.1535 during the session. Gold holds near highs, crypto falls, treasuries rally Gold held strong as traders avoided risk. Spot gold climbed 0.2% to $3,367.33 an ounce, reaching its highest point since June 5. Investors looked for direction from the PPI report and weighed the chances of a Fed rate cut later this year. “Gold remains stuck… with a break above $3,400 needed to change that. Near term focus (is) on Middle East developments, the dollar and speculation about the timing of the next U.S. rate cut,” said Ole Hansen, Saxo Bank’s head of commodity strategy. Crypto moved lower in step with tech and growth names. Bitcoin gave up earlier gains to $109K and is now struggling to stay above $107k, and altcoins followed as rate expectations kept changing. Source: TradingView Other metals were mixed. Silver dropped 0.8% to $35.94 an ounce, while platinum rose 0.3% to $1,260.14, hovering near a four-year high. Palladium was down 1.9%, trading at $1,059.25. U.S. government bonds rallied as cash flowed into safer ground. 10-year Treasury yields fell 1.5 basis points, sinking below 4.4%, while 2-year yields, which react more quickly to inflation outlooks, slid 1.6 basis points to 3.93%. That rally confirmed what traders were showing with their feet: they weren’t convinced by low inflation, trade optimism, or any of the day’s usual signals. They were bracing for whatever comes next.

2025-06-12T10:40:31,"Altcoin Season Index at 29: Crucial Insights for Navigating Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 29: Crucial Insights for Navigating Bitcoin Season Are you tracking the ever-shifting landscape of the cryptocurrency market? One key metric many investors watch is the Altcoin Season Index . This index provides a snapshot of whether altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) are generally outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. Understanding this can offer crucial insights into the current crypto market cycle and help inform your investing in altcoins strategy. Recently, the Altcoin Season Index, a metric tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 29 at 00:30 UTC on June 12. This marked a slight increase from the previous day but firmly places the market in what is commonly known as Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this number mean for your portfolio? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index The Altcoin Season Index is designed to give investors a simple way to gauge market sentiment and performance trends between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. Here’s a quick breakdown of how it works: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization listed on CoinMarketCap. It specifically excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to focus on organic price movements. The comparison is made against Bitcoin’s performance over the past 90 days. The index ranges from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining the ‘season’ is quite specific: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically high (above 75). Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score is typically low (below 25). Scores between 25 and 75 suggest a transitional or undefined period, sometimes called ‘Neither Season’. With the index currently sitting at 29, it clearly signals that the market is experiencing Bitcoin Season . This means that, on average, Bitcoin has been the dominant performer compared to a vast majority of the top altcoins over the last three months. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market? When the market is in Bitcoin Season , it often indicates a few potential scenarios or trends: Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors may be moving capital towards Bitcoin, perceived as a safer or more established asset within the crypto space, especially during periods of uncertainty or consolidation. Bitcoin Dominance Growth: Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization tends to increase. Slower Altcoin Growth: While some individual altcoins may still perform well, the broad altcoin market generally lags behind Bitcoin. Accumulation Phase for Altcoins: Some investors view Bitcoin Season as an opportunity to accumulate altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin before the next shift in the crypto market cycle . Understanding that we are currently in Bitcoin Season , as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index at 29, is fundamental for setting realistic expectations for your portfolio’s performance. Why Do We Have Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season? These distinct periods are part of the natural ebb and flow of the crypto market cycle . While there’s no single cause, several factors contribute to these shifts: Market Psychology: During bull markets, initial capital often flows into Bitcoin first. As confidence grows and profits are realized in Bitcoin, investors may rotate those profits into altcoins seeking higher, faster returns (leading to Altcoin Season ). Conversely, during downturns or sideways markets, investors might retreat to the perceived safety of Bitcoin (leading to Bitcoin Season ). Liquidity: Bitcoin is the most liquid cryptocurrency. Large institutional money often enters through Bitcoin. This dominance in liquidity and institutional interest can drive Bitcoin’s price performance ahead of altcoins. Technological Developments and Narratives: Specific upgrades (like Bitcoin halving events or major network updates) or compelling narratives can drive interest and investment into either Bitcoin or specific altcoin sectors, influencing the season. Global Macro Factors: Broader economic conditions, interest rates, and regulatory news can impact investor risk appetite, influencing whether they favor the perceived stability of Bitcoin or the higher potential returns (and risks) of altcoins. Investing in Altcoins During Bitcoin Season: Challenges and Opportunities Being in Bitcoin Season presents a unique environment for those interested in investing in altcoins . It’s not necessarily a time to avoid altcoins entirely, but it requires a different approach. Challenges: Underperformance: The most obvious challenge is that, on average, your altcoin holdings are likely to underperform Bitcoin during this period. Higher Risk: Altcoins, especially smaller cap ones, can be more volatile and susceptible to larger price drops when the overall market sentiment is weak or focused on Bitcoin. Longer Recovery: If the market experiences a downturn, altcoins often take longer than Bitcoin to recover their previous highs. Opportunities: Accumulation: Bitcoin Season can be an excellent time to accumulate promising altcoins at potentially lower prices relative to Bitcoin. This allows you to build positions for the next potential Altcoin Season . Research and Due Diligence: With less hype, this period provides a calmer environment to research projects, understand their fundamentals, technology, and team without the distraction of parabolic price movements. Spotting Outliers: Even in Bitcoin Season, some altcoins might perform well due to specific news, developments, or sector trends. Diligent research can help identify these potential outliers. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Implementing a DCA strategy during Bitcoin Season can be effective, allowing you to buy into altcoins consistently regardless of short-term price fluctuations, potentially lowering your average entry price. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Current Season Given the Altcoin Season Index is at 29, indicating Bitcoin Season , here are some actionable steps you might consider for your investing in altcoins strategy: Prioritize Research: Deep dive into the fundamentals of altcoin projects you’re interested in. Look beyond price charts at their use case, technology, team, tokenomics, and community. Consider Your Allocation: Re-evaluate your portfolio allocation. You might choose to hold a larger percentage in Bitcoin during this phase, or maintain a specific altcoin allocation with the understanding they may lag BTC. Focus on Quality: During less speculative periods, focus on established altcoins with strong use cases, proven technology, and active development. Set Realistic Expectations: Understand that broad, explosive gains across the altcoin market are less likely during Bitcoin Season. Focus on long-term potential rather than short-term pumps. Use Limit Orders: If accumulating, consider using limit orders to buy altcoins at specific price points you’ve identified through analysis. Stay Informed: Keep tracking the Altcoin Season Index and other market indicators. Shifts can happen, and being aware allows you to adapt your strategy. Remember, the index is just one tool. It provides a broad overview but doesn’t predict the future or guarantee the performance of any single altcoin. Market conditions can change rapidly. The Crypto Market Cycle is Dynamic The shift between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is a natural part of the dynamic crypto market cycle . Periods of Bitcoin dominance often lay the groundwork for the next altcoin surge, and vice versa. By understanding the current phase, as indicated by metrics like the Altcoin Season Index , investors can approach the market more strategically. Being in Bitcoin Season doesn’t mean the end for altcoins; it simply means the current market dynamics favor Bitcoin’s performance. For those looking to build or strengthen their altcoin positions, this period could offer valuable opportunities for accumulation before the market potentially shifts again. Summary: Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index currently sits at 29, confirming that the market is in Bitcoin Season . This means that over the past 90 days, Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins. While this presents challenges for broad altcoin performance, it also offers opportunities for strategic investing in altcoins , particularly through careful research, accumulation, and managing expectations within the current crypto market cycle . Stay informed and adapt your strategy as the market evolves.

2025-06-12T10:36:05,"ETH Bulls Tighten Grip as $393M Exits Exchanges and ETF Inflows Outpace Bitcoin","Ether( ETH) ETH struggled to maintain Tuesday’s momentum, falling 0.15% to $2,758 amid selling pressure that emerged during U.S. afternoon trading on June 11. The pullback followed a brief rally to $2,872.42, which proved unsustainable as price action reversed sharply between 15:00 and 17:00 UTC, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. The late-session sell-off intensified in early Asia hours, punctuated by a 1.29% dip from $2,772 to $2,736 on heavy volume, before ether rebounded slightly toward $2,758 at press time. Despite the downturn, key metrics suggest rising conviction among bulls. Glassnode reported that options skew flipped sharply negative over the past 48 hours—one-week skew dropping from –2.4% to –7.0% — indicating increased demand for short-dated calls. Put-call ratios remain heavily tilted toward upside exposure, with open interest and volume ratios holding near multi-week lows. On-chain flows also reinforced the bullish bias. Analytics firm Sentora (formerly, IntoTheBlock) flagged that over 140,000 ETH, worth approximately $393 million, was withdrawn from exchanges on June 11 — the largest single-day outflow in more than a month. Simultaneously, ETH-based ETFs extended their inflow streak with another $240.3 million added Wednesday, surpassing the day’s Bitcoin ETF totals. Analyst Anthony Sassano noted that Ethereum has avoided a single net outflow day since mid-May, calling the trend “accelerating” and arguing that the asset remains structurally undervalued. While price action shows short-term weakness, market positioning and capital flows suggest traders may be buying the dip in anticipation of another upside attempt. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH traded within a $139 range between $2,733 and $2,872 before closing at $2,758. Heavy selling emerged near $2,870–$2,880 during June 11’s late U.S. session. Support near $2,745–$2,755 was breached after multiple tests, triggering a quick declineVolume spiked above 34,000 ETH during a rapid drop from $2,772 to $2,736 early June 12.

2025-06-12T10:35:53,"Spot Ethereum ETFs Outshine Bitcoin with $240M Daily Flow","Spot Ethereum ETFs have outpaced their Bitcoin counterparts, raking in $240 million in net daily inflows on Wednesday, June 11. This figure eclipsed the $164 million flowing into BTC ETFs, marking the first time Ethereum products have led daily inflows since the launch of U.S. spot crypto ETFs 18 months ago. Ethereum Breaks Through The shift, hailed by analysts and echoed across social media, is seen by some as a potential turning point in institutional crypto adoption, fueled by unique catalysts driving capital towards the second-largest digital asset. “As far as I can remember, this is the first time this has happened,” noted prominent crypto commentator CryptoMe in a post on X, highlighting the historic nature of the flows. Data compiled by SoSoValue shows a consistent trend building over recent weeks. Ethereum ETFs have now enjoyed 18 consecutive days of net inflows, culminating in the near-record $240.29 million haul. The crypto-linked investment products now boast $3.74 billion in cumulative net inflows, $830.98 million in total daily trading volume, and $11.05 billion in net assets, making up roughly 3.25% of Ethereum’s market cap. The top performer, BlackRock’s ETHA, contributed just over $163 million on June 11 alone and leads all Ethereum ETFs with $5.13 billion in cumulative inflows. In comparison, while still dominant in absolute terms, spot BTC ETFs appear to be facing diminishing momentum. Despite some $45 billion in cumulative inflows and almost $132 billion in assets under management (AUM), net inflows have softened over the past week. After a mid-week rally on June 10, where the ETFs brought in $431.12 million, flows tapered off, dropping to $164.57 million on June 11. Even BlackRock’s flagship IBIT, which recently shattered records by becoming the fastest ETF in history to surpass $70 billion in AUM, is now experiencing moderated daily volumes, down to $1.89 billion yesterday. Regulatory Clarity, DeFi Potential Spark Inflows Market watchers have pointed to a combination of factors to explain Ethereum’s sudden surge in the spot ETF space. These include optimism in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector following recent remarks by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Paul Atkins directing the agency to explore rule amendments to accommodate on-chain financial systems. Other key drivers include a perception of ETH as an undervalued asset as well as institutional spillover from Bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory clarity, particularly regarding Ethereum’s classification, appears to be easing institutional hesitancy. Furthermore, ETH’s stronger recent price performance, up 5.4% over the past week compared to BTC’s 2.9% gain, and 12% over the last month versus the king cryptocurrency’s 4.9%, is reinforcing the undervaluation narrative, especially with Bitcoin trading just 3.8% below its recent all-time high while Ethereum remains 43.5% below its peak.

The company’s share price closed at 4.64 krona ($0.49) on the Nordic Growth Market exchange, continuing a meteoric rise of over 280% since first announcing its Bitcoin initiative on May 22, according to MarketWatch. This recent capital raise, significantly larger than its previous $2.2 million round led by prominent Bitcoin advocate Adam Back on May 25, signals the growing confidence of both investors and the firm in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. H100’s embrace of Bitcoin is part of a broader global trend, with over 126 publicly traded companies — 14 of them joining in the past three weeks — now holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . $10.6M Raise to Add More Bitcoin to Treasury The funding round was structured into two parts: a 69.65 million krona ($7.31 million) share issuance and 31.35 million krona ($3.29 million) in convertible loans. H100 said that the proceeds would be directed entirely toward accelerating its Bitcoin treasury strategy . Based on current market prices, the firm could use the funds to purchase an estimated 67.1 Bitcoin, increasing its total holdings to 81.85 BTC. Prominent investors in this round included Adam Back, UTXO Management, and regional investment firms such as Race Ventures Scandinavia and Crafoord Capital Partners. The convertible loans, which carry no interest, mature in five years and can be converted into equity at a price of 1.75 krona per share. Initially set at 21 million krona, the tranche was expanded to 31.35 million due to strong investor demand. H100 Introducing Bitcoin to Health Sector H100, which sells health and longevity tools aimed at helping individuals avoid dependency on conventional healthcare systems, sees philosophical alignment between its mission and Bitcoin’s core principles. CEO Sander Andersen noted this synergy in a May 22 statement, emphasizing values such as individual sovereignty and decentralization. “The values of individual sovereignty highly present in the Bitcoin community aligns well with the customers and communities we are building the H100 platform for,” Andersen said. With this bold move, the company becomes one of the few health-focused firms integrating Bitcoin into its financial framework.

Are investors feeling bullish and ready to buy, or are they panicking and looking to sell? That’s where tools like the Crypto Fear and Greed Index come in handy. It attempts to gauge the prevailing emotion driving the market, providing a snapshot of crypto market sentiment . As of June 12th, this index, provided by Alternative, registered a value of 71. While this is a slight dip of one point from the previous day, it firmly keeps the market mood anchored in the ‘Greed’ zone. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index So, what exactly is this index and why does it matter? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a simple yet insightful tool designed to visualize the two primary emotions that often influence investor behavior: fear and greed. In volatile markets like crypto, these emotions can be amplified, leading to irrational decisions. Here’s a quick breakdown of the index scale: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This indicates significant panic in the market. Investors are likely selling off assets, often irrationally. This could potentially be a buying opportunity for brave contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is still cautious or negative. Many investors are hesitant to buy. 50: Neutral – The market is balanced, with no strong leaning towards fear or greed. 51-74: Greed – This suggests investors are becoming overly optimistic and potentially overpaying for assets. While prices may still rise, this zone can signal increasing risk. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is likely experiencing a bubble-like euphoria. Prices may be unsustainably high, and a correction could be imminent. This is often considered a dangerous time to buy and potentially a good time to consider selling. A reading of 71, as we see now, places the market squarely in the ‘Greed’ category. This means that despite a slight pullback in sentiment from the day before, the overall mood is one of optimism and bullishness among market participants. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: What Factors Influence the Index? The Crypto Fear and Greed Index isn’t just a random number. It’s calculated using a weighted average of several different data points, aiming to capture various aspects of crypto market sentiment . Understanding these factors helps provide a more complete picture: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average corresponding values over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility in a positive direction can indicate bullishness, while sharp drops signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component looks at the current volume and market momentum compared to the average values of the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong positive momentum suggest greed is increasing. Social Media (15%): This factor analyzes posts on social media platforms (specifically Twitter, according to Alternative) to gauge how many different posts mention Bitcoin and how fast they are being posted. A high level of interaction and positive sentiment mentions can point towards growing greed. Surveys (15%): This factor is currently paused, but historically it involved weekly crypto polls to get a direct sense of investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks the market capitalization share of Bitcoin relative to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can indicate that investors are moving funds out of altcoins and into the perceived safety of Bitcoin, which can sometimes signal caution or fear in the broader altcoin market, or simply strong confidence in Bitcoin itself, depending on the context. Google Trends (10%): This analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin on Google Trends. A sudden surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear, while increased searches for “buy Bitcoin” could suggest growing greed. Each of these factors contributes to the final index score, providing a multi-faceted view of the market’s emotional state. While surveys are currently paused, the other five factors continue to feed into the calculation. Navigating the Greed Zone: What Does 71 Imply? A reading of 71 means the market is feeling optimistic. Prices have likely seen significant positive movement recently, attracting more buyers and generating positive buzz on crypto social media . The strong crypto market momentum contributes significantly to this score. However, it’s crucial to remember what the index represents. It’s a sentiment indicator, not a crystal ball or a direct buy/sell signal. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have often preceded market corrections, as excessive optimism can lead to inflated asset prices. Conversely, times of ‘Extreme Fear’ have sometimes marked market bottoms, offering potential buying opportunities. Being in the ‘Greed’ zone suggests caution might be warranted. While the rally could continue, the risk of a downturn increases as sentiment becomes overly positive. It implies that many market participants are expecting prices to keep rising, which can sometimes lead to speculative bubbles. Actionable Insights: Using the Index Wisely So, how should you use this information? Here are a few actionable insights: Use it as a Contra-Indicator (with caution): Some experienced traders use the index as a contra-indicator. When the index is showing ‘Extreme Greed’, they might consider reducing exposure or taking profits. When it shows ‘Extreme Fear’, they might look for potential buying opportunities. However, this strategy is risky and requires careful consideration and other analysis. Gauge Market Psychology: The index is excellent for understanding the general emotional climate. Are people euphoric or panicking? This context can help you evaluate news and price movements. Combine with Other Analysis: Never rely solely on the Fear & Greed Index. Use it alongside fundamental analysis (understanding the technology, use case, and team behind a project), technical analysis (studying price charts and patterns), and your own risk management strategy. Avoid Emotional Decisions: The index highlights how emotions drive the market. Seeing ‘Greed’ might make you want to jump in, or ‘Fear’ might make you want to sell everything. Use the index as a reminder to stick to your pre-defined investment plan rather than making impulsive decisions based on current sentiment. The fact that the index slightly decreased from 72 to 71 could suggest a minor cooling off or sideways movement in sentiment, but it’s not a significant shift out of the optimistic territory. The overall message remains: the market is currently operating with a high degree of positive sentiment. Conclusion: A Pulse Check on Crypto Emotions The Crypto Fear and Greed Index is a valuable tool for taking the pulse of the market’s emotional state. Its current reading of 71 firmly places us in the ‘Greed’ zone, reflecting the strong crypto market momentum , positive chatter on crypto social media , and overall optimism driven by factors like volatility and Bitcoin dominance trends. While this indicates bullish sentiment, it also serves as a reminder that markets driven by high levels of greed can be susceptible to corrections. Use the index as one piece of your analysis puzzle, helping you understand the prevailing psychological winds, but always combine it with thorough research and a disciplined investment approach. It’s not a guarantee of future price movements, but a fascinating look into the collective mind of crypto investors right now.

2025-06-12T10:20:20,"US Trade Policy: Trump’s Crucial Call for Global Trade Deal Decisions Sparks Economic Uncertainty","BitcoinWorld US Trade Policy: Trump’s Crucial Call for Global Trade Deal Decisions Sparks Economic Uncertainty In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, it might seem like global political maneuvering and trade deals are distant concerns. However, understanding the broader macroeconomic landscape is absolutely crucial for any investor, including those focused on digital assets. Significant shifts in US Trade Policy and international relations can send ripples across traditional markets, influencing investor sentiment, liquidity, and ultimately, the crypto market itself. A recent announcement from former President Donald Trump highlights just such a potential shift, signaling a period of potential Economic Uncertainty that warrants attention. Understanding the Latest on US Trade Policy According to reports from jin10.com, former U.S. President Donald Trump has indicated a significant upcoming move regarding international trade agreements. The core of the announcement is a plan to send formal letters to countries within roughly a week and a half. These letters will reportedly ask each nation to make a clear decision: either accept or reject a specific trade agreement. This isn’t just bureaucratic procedure; it’s a direct challenge that could reshape existing trade relationships and alliances. Under previous administrations, US Trade Policy has often involved lengthy negotiations, multilateral discussions, and phased implementations of agreements. Trump’s approach, however, has frequently favored more direct, bilateral, and sometimes confrontational tactics, often using tariffs and deadlines as leverage. This latest move appears consistent with that approach, aiming for a swift resolution or, conversely, a clear delineation of who is ‘in’ and who is ‘out’ of a proposed framework. Why is this relevant? Global trade isn’t just about goods crossing borders; it underpins international finance, supply chains, and geopolitical stability. Major changes or disruptions in trade can lead to volatility in currency markets, shifts in commodity prices, and altered risk assessments by investors worldwide. These factors collectively contribute to the overall health and sentiment of the global economy, which inevitably impacts risk assets like cryptocurrencies. What is This Global Trade Deal? The report from jin10.com specifically mentions a “trade agreement” that countries will be asked to accept or reject. The exact details of this specific Global Trade Deal are not explicitly detailed in the brief announcement provided. However, given Trump’s past focus, it could potentially relate to renegotiated terms of existing agreements, a new proposed multilateral framework, or perhaps a set of principles the U.S. wishes other nations to adopt regarding trade practices, intellectual property, or market access. A Global Trade Deal , or even a significant proposed one, involves complex interconnected elements: Tariffs and Duties: Taxes on imported or exported goods, directly impacting costs for businesses and consumers. Non-Tariff Barriers: Regulations, quotas, subsidies, or standards that can restrict trade indirectly. Intellectual Property Rights: Rules protecting patents, trademarks, and copyrights across borders. Dispute Resolution Mechanisms: How countries settle disagreements arising from the agreement. Market Access: How easily companies from one country can sell goods or services in another. Asking countries for a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ within a tight timeframe on something potentially this complex is a bold strategy. It forces nations to quickly weigh the potential benefits of alignment with the U.S. against the costs or disadvantages of the specific terms presented, or the potential repercussions of rejection. Navigating Potential Economic Uncertainty This impending deadline for a Trade Agreement Decision introduces a layer of Economic Uncertainty into the global outlook. Financial markets dislike uncertainty because it makes it difficult to price assets and predict future earnings or growth. Here’s why this announcement could fuel that uncertainty: Lack of Detail: Without knowing the specifics of the proposed agreement, countries (and markets) are left guessing the full implications. Tight Deadline: A week and a half is a very short time for countries to conduct thorough internal reviews, consult stakeholders, and formulate a definitive response to a potentially far-reaching agreement. This rush increases the chance of hasty decisions or miscalculations. Potential for Conflict: Rejections could lead to retaliatory measures, trade disputes, or the imposition of new tariffs, disrupting supply chains and harming businesses. Impact on Global Growth Forecasts: Trade is a key driver of global economic growth. Uncertainty or disruption in trade flows can lead economists to revise growth forecasts downwards, impacting investor confidence. For crypto investors, understanding Economic Uncertainty is key. When traditional markets face headwinds due to geopolitical or trade tensions, investors may become more risk-averse. This can lead to sell-offs in stocks and other assets, and sometimes this risk-off sentiment extends to cryptocurrencies, which are still largely perceived as risk assets, despite narratives around digital gold. Analyzing the Potential Market Impact The announcement of this looming Trade Agreement Decision is likely to be closely watched by financial markets around the globe. The potential Market Impact could manifest in several ways: Stock Markets: Companies with significant international operations or reliance on global supply chains could see their stock prices react based on the perceived likelihood of acceptance or rejection and the potential trade environment that follows. Currency Markets: Currencies of countries heavily involved in trade with the U.S. could experience volatility as the deadline approaches and decisions are announced. Commodity Markets: Prices of commodities like oil, metals, and agricultural products, which are heavily traded globally, can be sensitive to changes in trade policy and demand expectations. Investor Sentiment: Overall market confidence can be boosted by positive trade developments or dampened by the prospect of trade wars or disagreements. How does this translate to crypto? While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate outside traditional financial systems, their prices are often correlated with broader market movements, particularly during periods of high volatility or significant macroeconomic news. Increased Market Impact from trade tensions could lead to a flight to safety (potentially benefiting assets seen as stores of value, though crypto’s role here is debated) or a general de-risking across all asset classes, including digital ones. Examples from the Past: We’ve seen in recent years how trade tensions between major economies (like the U.S. and China) have caused significant volatility in stock markets. While crypto’s reaction hasn’t always been perfectly correlated, these periods of macro uncertainty have often coincided with notable price swings in the crypto market as well. The Significance of the Trade Agreement Decision The fact that countries are being explicitly asked to make a clear Trade Agreement Decision within such a short timeframe elevates the importance of this event. It’s not merely an invitation to negotiate; it appears to be a demand for a position. This approach could be designed to force clarity, identify allies, and isolate those unwilling to agree to the proposed terms. The outcome of each country’s Trade Agreement Decision will likely shape the geopolitical and economic landscape for the foreseeable future. Acceptance by many key trading partners could signal a new era of trade relations aligned with the U.S.’s proposed framework. Widespread rejection, however, could lead to increased trade barriers, fragmentation of global markets, and heightened international tensions. Actionable Insights for Investors: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on international news sources, not just crypto-specific ones. Developments in global trade and geopolitics can have indirect but significant effects. Understand Correlations: Observe how Bitcoin and the broader crypto market react to major global economic news events. While not always perfectly correlated, patterns often emerge. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Periods of increased Economic Uncertainty might call for a review of your portfolio’s risk exposure, across all asset classes, including crypto. Diversification: Consider whether your overall investment strategy is sufficiently diversified to weather potential volatility stemming from macroeconomic factors. This upcoming period, driven by the need for a swift Trade Agreement Decision from numerous countries, underscores the interconnectedness of the global financial system. Even in the decentralized world of crypto, external economic forces play a significant role. Conclusion: Why Global Trade Matters to Crypto While the headline about Trump’s trade letters might initially seem unrelated to Bitcoin or Ethereum, it serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market does not exist in a vacuum. Major developments in US Trade Policy and the outcome of a pivotal Global Trade Deal decision can inject significant Economic Uncertainty into the world economy, triggering a notable Market Impact that ripples through traditional finance and into the digital asset space. The next week and a half will be critical as countries formulate their responses to this direct request for a Trade Agreement Decision . The reactions – acceptance, rejection, or attempts to negotiate – will likely set the tone for international trade relations and global market sentiment moving forward. For crypto investors, staying abreast of these macro developments isn’t just about being informed; it’s about understanding the potential external pressures and opportunities that could influence the value and volatility of their digital holdings. Being aware allows for more informed decision-making in an increasingly complex global financial environment.
