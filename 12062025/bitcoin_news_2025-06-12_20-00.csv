2025-06-12T17:55:14,"Mercurity Fintech to Raise $800M for Strategic Bitcoin Treasury Reserve","Mercurity Fintech Holding announced plans to raise $800 million to establish a Bitcoin treasury reserve. The New York-based digital fintech firm aims to use the funds to acquire and hold BTC as part of a broader strategy to reshape its treasury operations through tokenized finance. Mercurity Fintech Bets Big on Bitcoin According to the official press release , MFH plans to store the assets using institutional-grade blockchain custody infrastructure while integrating staking services and tokenized treasury tools to unlock yield and capital efficiency. The initiative represents a transition from traditional treasury models to a blockchain-aligned reserve structure designed to boost long-term asset exposure and bolster financial resilience. In parallel, MFH is set to move from the Russell Microcap Index to the Russell 2000 and 3000, a development that could enhance visibility among institutional investors and signal market validation for its blockchain-centric approach. In an official statement, Shi Qiu, CEO of the company, said, “We’re building this Bitcoin treasury reserve based on our belief that Bitcoin will become an essential component of the future financial infrastructure. We are positioning our company to be a key player in the evolving digital financial ecosystem.” Bitcoin on the Books A growing number of public companies are integrating digital assets into their treasuries, with 117 firms now holding over 800,000 BTC, as per Binance Research’s latest stats . Recent adopters include GameStop, Paris Saint-Germain F.C., and Nakamoto, all following a model first implemented by Strategy and Michael Saylor. Trump Media & Technology Group joined the wave with a $2.5 billion Bitcoin initiative backed by 50 institutions. Ethereum is also gaining traction, as evidenced by SharpLink recently launching a $425 million ETH strategy advised by Consensys’ Joseph Lubin. Japan-based Metaplanet also continued its aggressive BTC acquisition. More recently, the Oslo-based cryptocurrency brokerage company, K33, also started holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet after raising $6.22 million via interest-free loans and new share and warrant issues.

2025-06-12T17:49:27,"Pi Coin Price Prediction: MACD Indicator Finally Flashing Green – $10 Incoming?","The persistent downtrend that has weighed on PI since mid-May may have finally run its course, with a golden cross on the daily MACD bolstering the near-term Pi Coin price outlook . While most altcoins staged recoveries through June, PI continued to slide, signaling a disconnect from broader market tailwinds. That prolonged sell-off has left PI down 43% over the past month, making it the worst performer among the top 100. But recent bullish momentum may have finally caught up to the token. Shaky Fundamentals Cloud Bullish Technical Outlook Despite the bullish technical outlook, Pi Coin’s future may hinge on ecosystem fundamentals as it stands at a crossroads, according to an X post by well-known PI commentator Pi Barter Mall. In their pessimistic outlook, Pi Barter Mall noted slow ecosystem development as the central obstacle to long-term growth. The fact of the matter is that the Pi ecosystem continues to struggle with adoption. Its price action remains largely speculative, lacking a meaningful use case to sustain long-term growth. This has also opened the door to liquidity issues, with short-term speculative trading amplifying deflationary pressure as unlocks continue at an average rate of $7 million PI tokens per day. PI token unlock schedule. Source: Piscan . The market struggles to absorb the excess supply without a rise in demand to stabilise Pi Coin price moves. Still, there is an optimistic case. Pi Barter Mall notes that mainstream exchange listings, such as a potential debut on Binance, could serve as major catalysts. If large-scale applications can be achieved, Pi Barter Mall suggests Pi could reclaim its $1–$3 range with real utility to encourage HODLing over flipping. Pi Price Analysis: Could a Golden Cross Push a Reversal? Given the underlying fundamental challenges, a $10 valuation for Pi Coin remains unrealistic—at least until Pi Barter Mall’s optimistic scenario materialises. That said, Pi coin could make a start on technical momentum alone as the recent breakout of a May-born falling wedge pattern pushes a potential golden cross on the daily. PI / USDT 1-day chart, falling wedge. Source: TradingView, OKX. The MACD line is on the verge of crossing above the signal line, poised to flash green for the first time since Consensus 2025 unfolded as a sell-the-news event. Selling pressure appears exhausted, with the RSI rebounding from deep bearish territory at 40—an early signal that buy pressure is returning, opening the door for the next leg up. If momentum continues, the pattern suggests a potential 40% Pi Coin price rally to $0.8725, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci extension level. Should bulls push further toward $1, Pi Coin would face a key accumulation zone at the 0.5 Fibonnaci level—a potential catalyst to fuel growth. However, if the golden cross is delayed or falters, strong support at $0.60 remains the critical downside level to watch for signs of a reversal. The Bull Market Could Be Back – Here’s How to Take Advantage Any trader hedging their risk likely features Bitcoin (BTC) as a major part of their portfolio, especially as altcoins continue to lag behind the leading cryptocurrency. But, while Bitcoin provides stable gains, it often sacrifices upside potential—that’s where Bitcoin Bull (BTCBULL) comes in, offering a fresh way to capitalize on BTC tailwinds. True to its name, Bitcoin Bull ties its tokenomics to Bitcoin’s price growth in a deflationary model. The project burns tokens and distributes BTC airdrops whenever Bitcoin reaches key milestones—starting at $125,000 and triggering new rewards for every $25,000 climb thereafter. With some analysts forecasting highs of $1M this cycle and BTC finally back on the recovery path, BTCBULL could become a Bitcoin Maxi’s best friend. With over $7 million raised in its ongoing presale , the project is already gaining strong momentum—potentially credited to its 57% APY on staking that rewards early investors.

(MFH), a financial services and crypto company, has announced its intention to raise $800 million. The funds will be used to build a large Bitcoin (BTC) treasury and create a blockchain-based financial system. This move is part of the company’s broader strategy to become a major player in the fast-growing world of digital finance. No Mercurity To Build A New Kind of Bitcoin Treasury Unlike traditional companies that hold Bitcoin as a passive asset, Mercurity plans to use it actively. The Bitcoin acquired will be integrated into a yield-generating treasury model. This means the flagship crypto will not just sit in storage; instead, it will be used to earn returns through tokenized tools and staking services. In a recent statement, Mercurity’s CEO, Shi Qiu, said that Bitcoin will be a key financial tool in the future. With this in mind, the company wants to be a leader in the world of digital finance by using cryptocurrency, blockchain, and new financial tools. Mercurity is following a new trend in which companies use Bitcoin as more than just a reserve. Today, many businesses, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, are finding ways to make money with their crypto holdings instead of letting them sit idle. Companies like Blockstream and MARA Digital are already doing this. They use their Bitcoin reserve for services like lending , staking, and other activities that help them earn extra income. Mercurity’s Bitcoin Funding Strategy Remains a Mystery While the company has revealed how it plans to use the $800 million, it has not disclosed how it intends to raise the capital. The New York-based firm is yet to explain whether the money will come from selling company shares, taking on debt, or using other financing methods. Following the news, Mercurity’s stock price rose 1.9% during regular trading but dropped 2.84% after hours. The dip may reflect investor concerns about the unknowns in the company’s funding plan. Mercurity Focus Beyond Crypto This news comes at a key time for Mercurity. The company is expected to be added to the Russell 2000 and Russell 3000 indexes, which are important stock lists that many big investors follow. If the company is included in these indexes, it could help more people notice Mercurity and make it easier to trade its shares. Besides working with cryptocurrency, Mercurity also makes cooling systems for data centers that run Artificial Intelligence (AI). These systems help save energy, which is vital because AI needs a lot of power. Mercurity also offers services to large companies and wealthy clients. This includes helping them manage digital assets and giving advice about blockchain technology.

The company’s average cost per Bitcoin is now $78,582, following this latest purchase, which delivered a 22% yield increase compared to its prior acquisition in late May. This latest move is in line with DDC’s long-term strategy to integrate Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. In a statement about the purchase, Founder, Chairwoman, and CEO Norma Chu reaffirmed the company’s unwavering Bitcoin strategy. “Today’s 38 BTC acquisition proves our focused execution. We continue to aim for higher BTC yield return for our shareholders,” she said. Chu also noted the symbolic value of each acquisition: “With every Bitcoin added, we strengthen shareholder exposure to digital scarcity—now at 0.029679 BTC per 1,000 shares. We remain uncompromising in our pursuit of being a top global corporate holder status.” Positioning Bitcoin as a Core Asset While most companies remain cautious in their approach to digital assets, DDC Enterprise said it has aggressively positioned Bitcoin as a long-term financial hedge and store of value. The company said it has structured its treasury strategy around this conviction, acquiring BTC at what it considers optimal market entry points. Its BTC-per-share metric—now sitting at 0.029679 per 1,000 shares—is touted as a novel value proposition for shareholders interested in digital asset exposure through traditional equity markets. The acquisition is also reflective of a growing trend among listed companies that use Bitcoin not merely as an investment, but as a strategic balance sheet tool. DDC’s move indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upside, despite market volatility and regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. DDC Enterprise said it is using BitGo as its official custodian. The firm said that by using BitGo’s custody solutions, DDC seeks to support its growing digital asset strategy with scalable and secure infrastructure designed to meet the demands of institutional investors.

2025-06-12T17:16:46,"Bitcoin Will Rally as U.S. Growth Improves, Crypto Bills Progress: Coinbase Research","A more upbeat macroeconomic backdrop, growing corporate appetite for digital assets, and increased regulatory clarity will fuel a constructive outlook for crypto markets in the second half of 2025, according to a report by Coinbase Research . After a bumpy first quarter marked by a brief contraction in U.S. GDP and trade disruptions, data now point to stronger growth. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow tracker has jumped to 3.8% QoQ as of early June, a sharp upgrade from earlier in the year. This shift, alongside expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and a less aggressive trade policy, has eased recession fears and strengthened investor sentiment. Declining dollar dominance and inflation protection use-cases may also boost bitcoin’s BTC appeal, even if long-dated U.S. Treasury yields remain elevated, the report said. Altcoins may lag unless they benefit from specific catalysts, such as ETF approvals or protocol developments. Meanwhile, public companies are increasingly adding crypto to their balance sheets, aided by a 2024 rule change allowing ""mark-to-market"" accounting for digital assets. While this trend is expanding demand, it’s also introducing new systemic risks. Firms that fund crypto buys with convertible debt may be forced to sell if refinancing options dry up or prices fall sharply. Regulatory clarity Regulatory developments are also expected to reshape the market, the report said. The Senate recently passed the GENIUS Act, a bipartisan stablecoin bill now heading to the House. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, aims to define the roles of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in overseeing digital assets. If passed, it could clarify rules for both issuers and investors. Separately, the SEC is considering more than 80 crypto ETF applications, including multi-asset funds and proposals involving staking and altcoins. Some rulings could be made as early as July, and the rest are likely to be finalized by October. Overall, bitcoin appears poised to benefit from both macro and structural tailwinds in the second half of the year, while the outlook for altcoins will depend on navigating a more complex and still-evolving regulatory and liquidity environment, according to the report.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/12/bitcoin-will-rally-as-us-growth-improves-crypto-bills-progress-coinbase-research,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH","Markets|Bitcoin|Macro|Regulation|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-12T17:14:37,"Crypto market drops 4% as ETH ETFs outperform BTC, altcoins fall sharply","The global crypto market has taken a sharp turn in the past 24 hours. Total market capitalisation has dropped nearly 4% to around $3.51 trillion. Almost every asset in the top 100 list is now showing losses. Bitcoin trades near $107,688, while Ethereum is around $2,736. Altcoins are feeling the squeeze as well, with Dogecoin at $0.1877 , Solana at $158 , and Cardano at $0.6827 . Source: CoinMarketCap Amid these declines, spot Ethereum ETFs in the US continue to attract larger inflows than Bitcoin ETFs—a shift that hints at deeper changes in investor behaviour. Spot Ethereum ETFs attract more flows US-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds continue to outperform their Bitcoin equivalents. On 11 June, BlackRock’s ETH ETF brought in a one-day inflow of $160 million. Ethereum ETFs in total pulled $240 million in net inflows. Overall, Ethereum ETFs have seen cumulative inflows of $3.74 billion over 18 straight days. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs totalled $45.22 billion, but inflows for 11 June were a more modest $133 million. The continuing strength of ETH ETF flows has coincided with Ethereum’s rebound from recent lows. On-chain analysts interpret this as a sign of shifting sentiment, fuelled by the Pectra upgrade, increasing DeFi activity, and more favourable regulatory commentary from figures such as SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins. Bitcoin and altcoins slide as volatility concerns rise The broader downturn in crypto assets has been led by Bitcoin’s decline of around 1.68%, dragging it down from earlier highs near $110,350 to current levels near $107,688. Ethereum lost about 4.29%, dipping from intraday highs of $2,868 to today’s $2,736. Source: CoinMarketCap Altcoins suffered deeper losses. Dogecoin fell roughly 7.5% to $0.1876, Solana dropped about 5–6% to $158, and Cardano slipped nearly 5.4% to $0.6827. These declines reflect a market-wide pullback following softer US inflation data and renewed uncertainty stemming from US-China trade discussions. On-chain data points to underpriced volatility risk On-chain data highlights several warning signs. Much of the supply of Bitcoin is clustered close to current price levels. When coins accumulate around a spot, even small flips in sentiment can trigger outsized moves. Meanwhile, options markets appear complacent—implied volatility remains low, even as on-chain activity suggests increasing volatility risk. Similarly, Ethereum options show subdued volatility pricing, despite its rebound and growing ETF interest. Analysts suggest both chains may be underestimating potential spikes during events like regulatory developments or protocol changes. Macro triggers and future direction Crypto markets are reacting in step with macroeconomic trends. The increasing tensions in the Middle East and US President Donald Trump saying he would impose unilateral tariffs on trading partners within two weeks have fed into asset-price uncertainty. Equities followed suit, with the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500 falling 0.37% and 0.27% respectively, adding to crypto’s downward pressure. However, Institutions continued with activities despite the market volatility. The Ant Group is advancing plans to launch stablecoins in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Luxembourg. The US Senate also voted to proceed with a substitute amendment to the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act. These developments show that regulatory momentum in digital assets continues even amid price volatility. Ethereum’s progress is further underpinned by the recently activated Pectra upgrade and influential endorsements from regulatory figures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maintains key technical levels. On-chain analysts highlight support at $97,600 and resistance near $115,400. Investor sentiment has cooled somewhat, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index easing from 65 into more neutral territory. Yet on-chain data suggests selling remains limited. Only around $200 million of realised losses have been recorded, indicating present declines have been absorbed by long-term holders.

One of the biggest influencers generating traffic for Hyperliquid has been James Wynn, a self-proclaimed “high-risk leverage trader and memecoin maxi” who claims to have risen from humble beginnings in a crime-ridden UK town and entered the crypto space in 2022. Despite his considerable recent losses, Wynn is optimistic he will make it all back, a mentality he shares with Andrew Tate, another influencer making big moves on the perpetual futures DEX. Andrew Tate( @Cobratate ) doesn’t seem to be good at perps trading. He has made 76 trades on Hyperliquid, with only 27 wins — a 35.53% win rate and a total loss of $583K. He's currently long $ETH with 25x leverage. https://t.co/09Rmkt6BIb pic.twitter.com/8LleWvjVXv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 12, 2025 Tate’s tumultuous journey on Hyperliquid Tate seems to have started his trading journey on Hyperliquid at the end of 2024. However, his activity on the platform did not blow up until early June 2025 when Tate shared a post on X showcasing a 138.5% profit on a 25x leveraged Ethereum (ETH) long position. The trade initially appeared successful, earning him $22,000 in unrealized profits at the time. However, he used high leverage, which made it vulnerable to price fluctuations. It did not take long for blockchain transparency to reveal a less favorable outcome as crypto sleuths were able to trace Tate’s Hyperliquid wallet using his referral code (“TOPGTOPSTRIKER”). They found that his cumulative profit and loss (PnL) showed a net loss of approximately $597,000–$600,000 across all trades on the platform since he began trading there. His 25x leveraged ETH position was liquidated after a slight price dip, costing him hundreds of thousands of dollars and forcing him to delete the initial post of him bragging about the 138% gain. Fast forward to June 8, and Tate shared a post about a potential $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position on Hyperliquid, with the caption, “100M BTC long. My turn?” Many thought the statement was made in reference to James Wynn’s billion-dollar BTC bets on the platform, but there is no direct evidence suggesting this. It is also not yet known if he has executed the trade, and some speculate it was a promotional stunt to drive referral sign-ups. He later took down the post as well. Tate insists he plans to make it all back Tate’s trading losses were revealed when he attempted to earn fees from new user sign-ups by sharing his referral code. Unlike centralized exchanges, Hyperliquid’s on-chain nature makes all trades publicly traceable, and crypto traders were quick to identify Tate’s wallet and expose his $600,000 loss, triggering widespread mockery on X. Andrew Tate’s trades on Hyperliquid have run up to $597,000–$600,000 in losses. Source: LookOnChain As usual, Tate was defiant in the face of the critics, stating, “I’ll make it all back with one trade,” but this did little to quell criticism. So far, LookOnChain claims Tate has made 76 trades on Hyperliquid and has only had 27 wins — a 35.53% win rate. He’s currently long $ETH with 25x leverage; however, his overall account is still down by nearly $600,000. Thanks to the volatile markets, it is unclear if his ETH long can end his streak of losses. While Tate’s posts about Hyperliquid have drawn more attention to the platform, his deleted posts and public exposure have made him a cautionary tale about the risks of leveraged trading and the transparency of DEXs like Hyperliquid. Now, many on X are waiting to see which runs out first, his ego or his ETH. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

2025-06-12T17:01:03,"Buy MARA Holdings For Its Bitcoin And Get The Mining Business 'For Free'","Summary MARA’s market cap is nearly matched by its $5.42 billion Bitcoin holdings, meaning investors value the mining business at a discount. MARA’s mining operation, adds more value annually in Bitcoin to the balance sheet than what the market appears to be valuing it. Investors can capture upside through new BTC mined monthly, valuation expansion in the mining business, or a BTC rally boosting existing BTC holdings. I have lately been quite interested in Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Treasury Companies, both in terms of how these companies can obtain fiat capital on favorable terms to generate shareholder value, and in the potential opportunities to buy many of them at a discount relative to their BTC holdings and underlying operations. Regarding the first category, I have recently covered Strategy ( MSTR ), and each of its preferreds STRF ( STRF ), STRK ( STRK ), and, most recently, STRD ( STRD ), here , here , here , and here , respectively. Regarding the second category, back in March, I wrote how one can buy Semler Scientific's ( SMLR ) operations at a great discount relative to its BTC holdings. By the way, I think that opportunity is even greater now, given BTC's rally against SMLR's underperformance. Today, I am writing about an opportunity like the latter, as MARA Holdings ( MARA ) appears to trade at levels that allow investors to essentially acquire its mining business ""for free."" The Bitcoin Holdings vs. MARA's Market Cap As of writing this article, MARA's market cap sits around $5.8 billion, based on a share price of roughly $16.52 and about 352 million shares outstanding. In the meantime, the company holds 49,375 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $5.42 billion, with BTC flirting with $110,000 per coin. MARA BTC Holdings (BitcoinTreasuries.NET) If we do the math, that's about $15.41 in Bitcoin per share. Compare that to the stock's $16.52 price, and you're basically buying MARA's entire operating business (data centers, proprietary tech, etc.) for just about $1.1 per share, or $387 million. But wait! MARA has $2.44 billion in net debt (including the zero-coupon convertible notes), and it also has $1.56 billion in property and equipment, so by adding the differences as a liability, the market is valuing the mining business at just about $850 million. I will explain why this implies a discount in a moment. The valuation discount has widened as MARA's stock hasn't kept pace with BTC's rally. While Bitcoin has gradually gained in recent months, MARA's share price has more or less moved sideways. BTC is up ~58% over the past year, all while MARA stock is down ~15% over the same period. BTC vs. MARA 1 Year Return (Koyfin) But why? The Management Discount: Why Investors Are Skeptical From following the stock regularly and reading the comments of other online investors, MARA's discount appears to stem from a doubt about management. Investors are essentially slapping a ""management discount"" on MARA, due to doubts about its track record, and it all goes back quite some time. You may remember, for instance, that in 2022, power outages at its Montana facility and delays in scaling mining capacity were a major source of frustration for shareholders. On top of that, the $2 billion stock offering in March wasn't exactly welcomed by investors due to earlier fears of dilution, while the company's pivot into AI infrastructure raised questions about management's focus. And these are valid arguments. If MARA is now a BTC treasury company and raising money MSTR-like, why are they suddenly saying they want to explore becoming a base layer infrastructure provider for AI and high-performance computing? Adding fuel to the fire, some investors have called out CEO Fred Thiel, pointing to his vague communication. For example, in the Q1 earnings call , he dodged specifics on AI strategy. This has led the market to undervalue MARA's mining operations, pricing the stock as if its Bitcoin stash is pretty much its only asset. The Mining Business Is Worth... The BTC However, I believe the mining business is not worthless, or at least the mere $850 million implied book value (for MARA to trade at NAV). This is because of all the BTC accumulation that the mining operations deliver, which is profitable for the company. Last quarter, MARA mined 2,286 Bitcoin, down 19% from 2,811 the year before due to the halving and increased network difficulty. At a direct energy cost of $35,728 as of Q1 (ex-depreciation), MARA can make roughly $74,300 per BTC at current BTC prices. This is about $170 million in value creation in a single quarter. Note that MARA is actually going to post a loss in this scenario, as it incurs the expenses but holds the BTC, but book value-wise, it has created actual value. Last month, MARA's mining produced 950 Bitcoin, a 35% jump from April , thanks to a record 282 blocks won and a 58.3 EH/s hashrate. At $110,000 per coin, those 950 Bitcoins are worth $104.5 million. With a $35,728 cost per Bitcoin, each coin adds $74,300 in book value, or $71 million for the month, or $852 million annualized. I believe the market doesn't understand this and merely sees MARA's GAAP losses. You can also see how the mining business seems extremely cheaply priced, given the value MARA can create via its BTC accumulation strategy from its mining business. Within a year, the mined BTC minus the expenses incurred can top what the market is currently valuing the mining business. Even if you believe the balance sheet assets do not reflect real values on the equipment side, and the market is actually valuing the mining business at $1 billion to $1.5 billion, you are still getting it about 1X to 2X earnings at current Bitcoin price levels. A Significant Risk To Consider The most notable risk to MARA's investment case hinges on the price of BTC, which has a wild history. BTC has tanked by over 80% from its highs more than once. So, despite growing institutional adoption that could prevent such a major drop today, another crash could make mining unprofitable if Bitcoin falls below MARA's cost per coin, slashing balance sheet value and making its core operations effectively worthless for as long as mining remains unprofitable. Along with MARA's $2.44 billion in net debt, this could hammer the stock. The Bottom Line Overall, I would say it's tough to be bearish on MARA stock these days. You're essentially buying $5.42 billion in Bitcoin for $5.8 billion and getting a mining business that added $852 million in annualized Bitcoin value to the balance sheet for just $850 million. Of course, the annualized figure can change from month to month, and the mining business could be worth anywhere between $0.50 and $1.5 billion at current share prices based on how much you think the balance sheet assets are actually worth. Still, the idea is the same, as we are talking about a low single-digit multiple on that business at current BTC prices. In the meantime, if you are actually long BTC, you have another reason to hold the stock, even if the mining discount doesn't close. Since the stock is not trading far from its BTC holdings, you are holding the BTC and essentially getting a call option that the market will value the mining business above today's valuation. Lastly, regarding the potential pivot toward AI, you have to trust that the management will indeed allocate power only if that is more accretive than actually mining BTC. It's all speculative to comment on that today, but if we assume that management doesn't mess up here, nothing fundamentally changes in my thesis.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794465-buy-mara-holdings-bitcoin-get-mining-business-free?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","BTC-USD|MARA",cryptocompare

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. BNB hits 275% transaction surge, Polkadot rallies 6%, and BlockDAG’s X1 Miner app brings global adoption, see why BDAG may lead the pack. Table of Contents BlockDAG: X1 Miner goes viral in 150+ countries Binance Coin: Transaction boom nearing $675 resistance Polkadot: Surging with Bitcoin, eyes $4.20 and beyond Summing up Crypto markets are heating up as major tokens flash bullish signals. Binance Coin saw a staggering 275% jump in daily transactions, driven by rising DeFi and network activity. Polkadot surged over 6% after Bitcoin broke $109k, with DOT reclaiming key support and setting sights on higher resistance levels. But the quiet giant in the room is BlockDAG (BDAG). Still in presale, BDAG is turning heads with its viral X1 Miner app, now used by 1.5 million people in over 150 countries. Unlike many tokens that launch without an ecosystem, BDAG already boasts real users, gamified tools, and massive engagement. With a potential NBA partnership looming and a June 13 “GO LIVE” reveal ahead, BDAG is more than a presale, it’s possibly the next breakout crypto brand of 2025. BlockDAG: X1 Miner goes viral in 150+ countries BlockDAG (BDAG) is no longer just a presale token, it’s rapidly evolving into one of the most compelling stories in crypto today. What started as an under-the-radar project is now capturing global attention, thanks to its viral X1 Miner app, which has already onboarded 1.5 million users across 150+ countries. That kind of pre-listing engagement is virtually unheard of and signals something bigger: BDAG isn’t just building tech, it’s building a user-driven movement. At its core, BlockDAG is powered by a CertiK-audited, EVM-compatible DAG architecture that allows for zero gas fees and near-instant transactions. But it’s the surrounding ecosystem that’s lighting up the crypto scene, gamified tools like mining streaks, referral bonuses, and Buyer Battles are keeping the community engaged daily. This isn’t idle hype; it’s active participation long before the coin hits exchanges. BDAG is priced at just $0.0018 until June 13, offering a rare opportunity to capture a 2,670% ROI before it launches at $0.05. The presale has raised more than $298 million so far. And with a rumored NBA franchise partnership expected to be unveiled soon, BDAG could become the first presale coin with real mainstream cultural visibility. Think courtside logos and NFT fan tokens, making it not just a token, but a brand people recognize. While BNB and DOT push through market cycles, BlockDAG is defining a new one, with global reach, real users, and a strategy that’s turning the crypto onboarding process into a household experience. Binance Coin: Transaction boom nearing $675 resistance Binance Coin ( BNB ) is showing exceptional strength as daily transaction volumes surge from approximately 4 million to over 15 million, a staggering 275% increase that reflects renewed interest across its ecosystem. This explosive growth is being driven by a combination of factors: expanding DeFi applications, increasing use in derivatives markets, and broader integration into real-world utility platforms. The heightened on-chain activity suggests sustained user engagement and a strong foundation for price momentum. From a technical standpoint, BNB is currently navigating a consolidation range between $659 and $675. This area has emerged as a key battleground, with bulls aiming to break above the resistance at $675. If this breakout materializes, it could pave the way for the next upward wave, particularly as institutional inflows and derivatives-based trades gain momentum. Despite some profit-taking during the rally, the overall health of the BNB ecosystem remains solid, supported by both retail and institutional participation. As BNB continues to play a critical role in Binance’s growing suite of products and services, its trajectory remains one of the most closely watched in the crypto space. A confirmed breakout could reaffirm BNB’s status as a top-tier digital asset. You might also like: BlockDAG scores big with NBA tease and $293M presale; SOL whales accumulate, PEPE slips Polkadot: Surging with Bitcoin, eyes $4.20 and beyond Polkadot ( DOT ) is gaining momentum, rising over 6% as Bitcoin crossed the $109,000 mark, boosting confidence across the altcoin space. DOT recently broke through a key resistance level at $4.10 and is now forming a bullish ascending channel, holding strong support above the $3.99 mark. This technical structure suggests strength and growing investor interest in the ecosystem. On-chain data backs the trend, with trading volume and user activity on the rise. Analysts are closely watching the $4.21 resistance zone, as a clean breakout could push DOT toward the $4.56 to $4.82 range in the short term. With favorable macro conditions, especially Bitcoin’s continued dominance, DOT has a clear upside path. Adding to its appeal is the broader narrative of Polkadot 2.0, which aims to enhance scalability, governance, and interoperability across parachains. This evolution makes the network more competitive and potentially more valuable as cross-chain activity expands. With a thriving developer community and multiple high-performing parachains already operational, DOT is regaining its status as a major player. In the current market cycle, it remains one of the top altcoins to watch. Summing up BNB showcases undeniable on-chain strength, and Polkadot is gaining from macro tailwinds and technical momentum. But when it comes to global buzz and accessibility, BlockDAG (BDAG) is clearly stealing the spotlight. Its viral X1 Miner app has already attracted 1.5 million users in 150+ countries, turning presale interest into active ecosystem participation. With features like gasless transactions, gamified engagement, and a rumored NBA franchise partnership, BDAG isn’t just building hype, it’s building visibility, infrastructure, and culture all at once. The presale price of $0.0018, ending June 13, is the last window before the jump to $0.05. That’s up to 2,670% in ROI baked in before listing. While other tokens chase momentum, BDAG is creating it from the ground up. For those hunting the highest trending crypto of 2025, BDAG might already be it.

That window is wide open right now, and Bitcoin Pepe is sitting in the middle of it. While most meme coins live or die on vibes, Bitcoin Pepe has been methodically laying track: infrastructure, token standards, bridges, and partnerships, and now, with tier 1 exchange listings locked and loaded for reveal, the setup is cleaner than most altcoin charts right now. With over $14m raised at only $0.0416, the presale is still active, but not for long. Check the official website for the latest updates. Solana on Bitcoin reveals what’s coming on launch At surface level, Bitcoin Pepe looks like what you’d expect: a meme token borrowing Bitcoin’s brand weight and pairing it with internet-native culture. But that’s just the hook. This is the first meme ICO built on Bitcoin, and it’s doing what Bitcoin hasn’t done in over a decade: evolving beyond store of value. The development team is constructing a layer 2 that facilitates staking, NFTs, meme trading, and DeFi, leveraging Bitcoin’s liquidity without the associated friction. The team has already revealed internal demos showing the bridge, the Bitcoin Pepe DEX, and a working block explorer. The bridge lets users move BTC into the L2 in real time, with wallet compatibility checks, safety prompts, and a clean, no-fuss UX that doesn’t assume technical knowledge. The DEX is functional and designed for speed with meme coin pairs, fast swaps, and no clunky onboarding. The explorer looks like something you’d expect from a major L2: it breaks down L1-to-L2 transactions clearly, supports mobile, and gives visibility into what’s actually happening on-chain. BPEP price prediction: What happens after T1 listings drop? The original launch was scheduled for the 31st of May, but the team made the call to hold and push for higher-tier coverage instead of a rushed debut. Markets noticed, and $500,000 came in on the 1st of June, the day after the announcement. If that kind of announcement pulled in half a million in 24 hours, what happens when the tier 1 listing details drop? Bitcoin Pepe’s listings are coming with volume, with top-tier visibility, and with a roadmap that doesn’t rely on hope. In fact, influencers on X and YouTube have already started weighing in. What’s more, Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 allows anyone to issue tokens natively on Bitcoin’s Layer 2, in the same way ERC-20 kicked off Ethereum’s altcoin boom. If that sounds like a stretch, look at what Solana’s SPL standard enabled or how Base gained traction by piggybacking ETH liquidity and rerouting it into meme-heavy DeFi. Bitcoin Pepe is doing that, but with a bigger base layer and Bitcoin’s $2 trillion liquidity to tap into. Eight partnerships have already been confirmed—across DeFi, gaming, and content—and they’re shaping the early footprint of BPEP’s ecosystem before listings go live. The structure is already in place. And between infrastructure, listings, timing, and Bitcoin’s flirt with its ATH, a 100x from presale levels is more than plausible. If the meme cycle accelerates the way it did for Solana’s ecosystem, a 1000x is on the table. Is Bitcoin Pepe the best crypto to buy now? Every cycle has a moment when a project transitions from a niche to a broader market, and those closely observing already recognize that Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) is perilously approaching this threshold. Bitcoin Pepe is backed by working tech, smart partnerships, and nearly perfect macro factors that are impossible to ignore. It sits right at the intersection of liquidity and narrative with the tools to convert attention into volume and volume into price.If you’ve been waiting for the best crypto to buy before it goes vertical, this is it .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/bitcoin-pepe-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-before-tier-1-cex-listing-hits/,"BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|ZRX","Information",cryptocompare

This is the asset’s highest price in five months. The Ethereum-based memecoin now holds a $1.5 billion market cap, surpassing competitors like FARTCOIN, BONK, and WIF.

By bringing the S&P 500 Index on-chain, it simplifies market exposure for everyday crypto investors, making it far less intimidating. Murad Mahmudov, a well-known crypto investor, is a vocal supporter of SPX6900. He even incorporated it into his “Memecoin Supercycle” thesis, which suggests that tokens like this, even without traditional utility, can deliver massive gains thanks to viral appeal and strong community backing. Contrary to what many claim, Memecoins *do* have Utility. In fact, they satisfy peoples’ thirsts far more pressing in the modern world than the problems solved by Tech projects.

Since its launch in August 2023, SPX has skyrocketed by 62,337%. To put that in perspective, a $1 investment back then would now be worth over $62,000, dominating the market and outperforming even Bitcoin’s legendary rise from $200 in 2013.

On-chain data from Arkham reveals that BlackRock, the trillion-dollar asset manager, now holds SPX as its third-largest crypto asset, behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. BlackRock holds $SPX in its crypto portfolio / Source: Arkham This high-profile endorsement has energized the SPX6900 community. On Reddit and other forums, members are increasingly bullish, with many calling for a $50 price target as they believe the token still has substantial upside potential. SPX6900 Just Flipped Major Resistance—Traders Eye $2 Next The SPX6900/USDT chart shows strong bullish momentum that’s held steady since late April. Prices have been climbing steadily within a well-defined upward channel, with each rally supported by increasing trading volume—a classic sign of sustainable growth. Key price levels also tell an important story. After breaking through resistance at $0.60 and $0.80, the token successfully retested these levels, which have now become solid support zones. This transformation from resistance to support confirms the market’s strengthening confidence in SPX6900’s upward trajectory. Now, at a key juncture, the token faces its biggest test at the $1.64–$1.67 resistance zone—the same level that halted January’s rally. Current price action proves particularly compelling as the token trades slightly above this level, indicating buyers may finally have the strength to overcome this historic barrier. SPX6900 looks like it's near a local top for a pullback. Very much overbought. If you're in this token, I would look to scale out soon. Might get a quick pump and then a pullback. For those that are keen on buying the token, I would hold off and look at other ETH memes for now… pic.twitter.com/6wK3QUy8RS — Junny (@junnyBCap) June 11, 2025 Momentum indicators support the bullish case. The RSI’s surge to 81.44 typically suggests overbought conditions, but during powerful uptrends, such extended highs often reflect genuine buying pressure rather than impending reversal. With the $1.67 breakout within reach, traders are eyeing the next psychological target at $2.00. However, some consolidation would be healthy as the market absorbs these gains.

Karen Weber, of Raleigh, North Carolina, says a $300 transfer via Zelle never made it into her friend’s account, but the money was taken from her First National Bank account, reports 5 On Your Side WRAL. Weber’s banking troubles began when she went to reimburse her friend for her share of the costs of a scenic trip they took to Canada. She used the money transfer service Zelle to send her friend $1,300. Says Weber, “The problem was that day I could only send $1,000.” She says her bank told her the remaining $300 would go through the next day. However, she says that while the $1,000 did go through, the $300 never showed up in her friend’s account. Weber says she reached out to First National and filed a dispute, but the bank continued to insist the funds had been sent, even though her friend’s account at Truist Bank continued to show the $300 was never received. After six months of contacting her bank to no avail, Weber reached out to 5 On Your Side for help and that’s when she finally got a resolution. With the two banks working together, the $300 finally appeared in her friend’s account. “It took about a month once I had [WRAL] on board.” Both banks declined to comment on the matter.

At this point, one BTC is ahead of another gold, while Mike McGlone warned that Bitcoin is approaching a risky turning point. Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Mike McGlone said Bitcoin volatility has fallen to an all-time low. Accordingly, he noted that Bitcoin's historically low volatility compared to gold and the S&P 500 could indicate a major breakout potential for BTC. However, the analyst also stated that this situation also carries great risks for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the risky side and the correction trend are more significant for Bitcoin. Stating that Bitcoin is approaching a key test in terms of further earnings potential at this point, the analyst said that the annual volatility of BTC against gold reaching a record low at the beginning of June showed that the market was maturing. McGlone noted that Bitcoin’s maturation could reduce its chances for major upsides, and the current low volatility in the bull market could also increase systemic risks for the increasingly politicized BTC. “Bitcoin's 60-day volatility has hit a record low compared to gold and the S&P 500. This suggests that a correction trend may emerge for Bitcoin against gold, given the recovery in the balance between assets. It could also signal an impending correction for Bitcoin, given the balance between Bitcoin and traditional assets. In the past, periods of low volatility have often occurred in an environment of extreme pessimism, but this time, with market optimism prevailing, systemic risk may become more pronounced.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-12T16:32:52,"Best Crypto to Buy Now? Is It Too Late To Buy Bitcoin As Price Puts In Double Top","The past week has pushed crypto watchers into familiar confusion. After crossing 110,000 with what looked like serious momentum, Bitcoin has now pulled back to the 107,000 range. Traders are split, with some calling it a cooldown and others reading it as a warning. What’s shaping up on the charts seems to be the structure of a potential double top, a technical signal that’s notorious for shaking weak hands and rewarding those who know how to wait. While short-term uncertainty dominates sentiment, this setup could mark a golden zone for those building long-term positions before the next real breakout begins. Is It Too Late To Buy Bitcoin - Price Chart Bitcoin’s latest chart structure has caught plenty of eyes, and for good reason. The price formed two sharp peaks near $110,500, both rejected at nearly the same level. What is being seen now is a classic double top pattern, a setup traders often interpret as a warning sign. It reflects exhaustion at higher levels, where bullish momentum fails to push through resistance. Once the neckline was broken, BTC didn’t just ease down; it snapped through the ascending trendline that had been holding up since $105,319, confirming the shift in sentiment. Prices have now dipped to test support around $107,000. If buyers manage to defend this level, a return toward $110K is possible. But if it gives way, Bitcoin may seek a new floor closer to the $103,000 to $104,000 range, which are zones that saw heavy interest during the previous run-up. Still, what’s playing out technically may not be fully in sync with what’s unfolding outside the charts. In recent days, ETF chatter has escalated. Bloomberg’s analysts have boosted the approval odds of Solana and Litecoin spot ETFs to over 90 percent , thanks to filings that now include staking features. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s parliament is reviewing a bill that would allow the central bank to include crypto in its reserve assets. While not a directive, it signals that policymakers are increasingly seeing digital assets as part of future economic architecture. I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 11, 2025 Even Elon Musk's softening tone toward Trump, after months of public spats, may have helped cool sentiment just enough to let the market breathe. Taken together, these developments suggest the recent correction might not be a red light but a positive-yellow one. The window for long-term entries and strong accumulation may be open. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Trending Projects That Could Pump At BTC’s Reversal SUBBD Social platforms have always leaned in favor of the platform, not the creator. SUBBD flips that equation entirely. It presents itself as a decentralized creator economy designed to make creators the owners, not the product. Instead of depending on algorithmic luck or ad revenue trickles, SUBBD introduces a token-powered structure that lets creators monetize directly and immediately from their audience interactions. No middlemen, no fine print. The project embeds token utility into actual creator workflows. Fans don’t just passively consume content; they participate, unlock perks, vote on content directions, or access gated material, all powered by the $SUBBD token. The platform also allows cross-chain exposure, meaning creators aren’t limited by one ecosystem or audience pool. Why this matters now is tied to the kind of shift being seen across crypto. While Bitcoin’s chart shows short-term tension, the macro environment is leaning in favor of long-term builders. Social media is overdue for a model change, and SUBBD steps in with a fully decentralized proposition just when users are beginning to tire of Web2 ownership rules. Educational crypto YouTube channel 99Bitcoins dubbed it a 100x potential crypto, likely to see major growth post its launch. The project’s smart contract has been audited, and staking is part of its roadmap. But unlike projects that just throw buzzwords around, SUBBD’s value proposition is linked directly to creator engagement. As crypto projects become more utility-driven, this one stands out for actually offering a platform where the token isn’t just an incentive, but the infrastructure. That makes it worth watching now, before creator onboarding hits critical mass. Bitcoin Hyper Layer 2 solutions built around Bitcoin often sound more ambitious than they are useful. Bitcoin Hyper doesn’t fall into that trap. Its proposition is simple but necessary: solve Bitcoin’s transactional limitations without compromising the security that makes it Bitcoin in the first place. Instead of creating a separate token economy that floats beside Bitcoin, it anchors itself to the original chain, enabling users to move BTC onto its faster layer using Solana’s architecture for scalability. Here’s how it works. When a user initiates a transaction, BTC is locked on-chain while an equivalent amount is minted on Bitcoin Hyper’s network. This synthetic BTC can then be transferred near-instantly and with dramatically lower fees. Once the user wants to exit, the synthetic tokens are burned and the original BTC is released. It’s a trust-minimized model designed for volume. The timing of Bitcoin Hyper’s rise has been almost suspiciously aligned with macro sentiment. ETF approvals, institutional capital creeping back in, and geopolitical moves hinting at state-level adoption are helping to create an environment where infrastructure actually matters. What makes this a worthwhile investment candidate right now is its simplicity. It’s not trying to be an all-in-one chain or a retail product suite. It’s focused on making Bitcoin more usable, more efficient, and more relevant. That alone makes it a strong contender for upside as attention swings back toward foundational tech in crypto. Solaxy Solaxy is built on a key blockchain need today, which is blockchain performance. While most Layer 2s crowd into Ethereum’s orbit, Solaxy opens the door for users who want to operate across both Ethereum and Solana without hopping between networks, interfaces, or standards. Solaxy is built as a bridge-layer protocol with the ambition to solve two long-standing problems at once. First, it enables fast, low-cost execution on transactions that originate from Ethereum while tapping into Solana’s speed. Second, it introduces native staking that is functional across both ecosystems. That means holders can stake SOLX tokens and earn rewards while still participating in cross-chain activity, a model that tends to lock liquidity without immobilizing it. Its utility shows in how the system works. Solaxy validators confirm transactions across chains using a consensus mechanism optimized for both finality and throughput. The protocol doesn't demand that users abandon familiar wallets or jump through token-swap loops just to complete basic actions. With Solaxy, it's always a hole-in-one. 🛸🪐48M Raised! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/n882gUs8yT — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 12, 2025 While short-term charts might be sparking worry across major tokens, Solaxy's use case grows more valuable during exactly this kind of market phase. When speculation cools, infrastructure that can actually process transactions quickly and at scale becomes the real differentiator. Solaxy is all about building a base layer that can carry serious transaction volume without turning into a toll booth. That’s the kind of utility that can quietly build value until the market catches up. Best Wallet There’s no shortage of crypto wallets. But there is a shortage of wallets that actually do more than just store tokens. Best Wallet Token with its key product- the Best Wallet approaches that gap like a toolkit rather than a vault. It offers custody, yes, but also integrates a full suite of tools built for people who don’t want to shuffle between ten different apps just to manage their assets. Here’s what sets it apart. Best Wallet operates across over sixty blockchains, syncing assets in real-time without creating sync delays or leaving users guessing about transaction finality. Within the same interface, you get access to a presale aggregator, a built-in decentralized exchange, and deep market analytics that aren’t just price feeds: they’re visual, responsive, and designed for decision-making. The goal is not just to hold tokens, but to know what to do with them. Staking is baked in. Not as yet another feature to boast about, but as a native feature that allows users to generate yield across assets directly within their portfolio dashboard. And then there’s the upcoming airdrop campaign, which ties user activity to real-time eligibility. Best Wallet’s concept seems to be focused on making DeFi easier to use. At a time when even seasoned investors are tired of hopping through interfaces to do simple tasks, that kind of streamlining becomes valuable. The next wave of users won’t want five apps. They’ll want one that works, and Best Wallet is aiming to be exactly that. Conclusion Bitcoin’s current dip may have technicals leaning bearish for now, but this pattern doesn’t cancel its larger trajectory. If support zones hold and momentum resets, a return to new highs remains firmly on the table. That kind of move rarely happens in isolation. When Bitcoin moves with conviction, it tends to pull altcoins into motion. If the macro signals align and the cycle continues building, the door opens for a true altcoin season. In that case, projects grounded in real utility, fresh ideas, and strong community mechanics are in a position to benefit the most. From here, the ones with substance could turn into the ones with serious upside. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T16:31:29,"Best Crypto Meme Presale Coins to Unlock Big Gains","The post Best Crypto Meme Presale Coins to Unlock Big Gains appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Welcome to Part 1 of the Neo Pepe Revolution ! Imagine it’s June 11, 2025, a time when centralized financial giants hold the reins a little too tightly. Enter the hero we didn’t know we needed: Neo Pepe Coin ($NEOP). Rising from the depths of the Memetrix , Neo Pepe isn’t just another meme coin; it’s a call to freedom , a rallying cry for decentralized financial unity. And you, my friend, have the opportunity to be part of this crypto rebellion before it takes off. If you’ve been searching for the best crypto presale opportunities, especially ones with meme coin flair, this article dives deep into Neo Pepe Coin and its competitors. Spoiler alert: Neo Pepe stands far ahead of the pack. Here’s everything you need to know about this unique project and why joining early could be your best decision yet. Why Neo Pepe Coin Is Leading Meme Coin Presales Neo Pepe isn’t just about memes; it’s about a movement . It takes everything we love about meme coins (the humor! the hype!) and combines it with real utility, transparency, and community-driven governance . Here’s why Neo Pepe is dominating the meme coin presale scene. Genius of Presale Structure Neo Pepe has a 16-stage presale format, and every single stage increases the price as demand soars. Starting now in Stage 0 at just $0.05423 , early adopters snag the best price while setting the foundation for incredible growth. And if you’re the type to procrastinate? Well, prices climb steadily with every stage. Waiting may spark some serious FOMO as others cash in. But here’s the real kicker: tokens are released hourly after launch. This ensures smooth distribution while avoiding those dreaded launch-day dumps that have plagued so many other projects. Standout Features of Neo Pepe Neo Pepe outshines its competition with these game-changing features. 1. Governance for Everyone Neo Pepe isn’t run by some shadowy central entity. Instead, it operates via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) . Every token holder gets voting power, whether it’s for new exchange listings or future development decisions. It’s your investment, your rules. 2. Rug-Pull Resistant No one likes a scammy coin, and Neo Pepe takes security seriously. By partnering with Certik and Coinsult for contract audits, Neo Pepe ensures every detail of its smart contracts is bulletproof. 3. Meme Power Meets Purpose Neo Pepe isn’t just another funny meme token. It wields the power of humor and community to drive a social movement for financial inclusivity and freedom. Think of it as the blockchain’s Che Guevara—but with 100% less berets and 1000% more internet humor. 4. Tight and Transparent Tokenomics With 1 billion tokens in total, 45% are reserved for presale-only buyers . That means no sneaky allocations or sketchy hidden wallets. It’s all shown transparently in the smart contract. 5. Easy to Join Neo Pepe makes it effortless to join the presale . The starting price is low, the process is compatible with major crypto wallets like MetaMask, and you can buy using Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or USDT. No hassle, just freedom. Best Meme Coin Presale Competitors Neo Pepe dominates the stage, but while other meme coin projects aim high, they simply cannot compete with the overall package Neo Pepe offers. Here’s a breakdown of its would-be challengers. 1. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM targets decentralized finance enthusiasts. Its focus on lending and borrowing is promising, but its lack of a mass appeal meme culture restricts it to hardcore DeFi nerds. 2. Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) Built for speed, Bitcoin Solaris tries to position itself as a blockchain solution. However, it fails to connect with the average investor looking for something simple and fun, like Neo Pepe. 3. Solaxy ($SOLX) Great for developers who need scalable blockchain solutions, but boring and niche for meme coin enthusiasts. This project has a lot of brainpower, but not much personality. 4. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) A meme coin that rewards Bitcoin holders. Fun in concept, but zero utility or long-term value beyond its gimmick. 5. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) Loud, hyped, and promising short-term gains. Longer term? Probably not. Unlike Neo Pepe, APC prioritizes flash over substance. Why You Should Join Stage 0 of Neo Pepe Now Neo Pepe is not just about the memes; it’s a financial rebellion against centralization and outdated systems. Investors who get in at Stage 0 will enjoy the lowest entry price, maximum growth potential, and a front-row seat in crypto’s next big movement.

2025-06-12T16:30:12,"Tether Buys Big Stake in Gold Firm to Strengthen USDT Stablecoin","USDT stablecoin issuer Tether has announced that it has bought 32% of a Canadian gold mining company, Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. Tether revealed that this move is part of its broader strategy to invest in diverse assets like gold and Bitcoin (BTC). The goal is to support and strengthen the value of USDT, which is gaining traction in the LATAM region . A New Step in Tether’s Investment Plan Announced on June 12, Tether confirmed that it has acquired 78,421,780 shares in Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. This Canadian-based company specializes in gold royalty streams. It allows investors to earn from gold production without being directly involved in mining. With this purchase, Tether wants to build stronger reserves that will give USDT more trust and stability. This deal also shows that the company sees gold as a safe and lasting investment. This news comes shortly after Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, said the company had already bought 50 tons of gold and 100,000 BTC. These steps show Tether is serious about protecting its stablecoin with strong, real assets. Tether Plans to Buy More Gold To Strengthen USDT Tether is not done with just the deal with Elemental Altus Royalties Corp. The company has also signed an agreement with another firm, AlphaStream Limited. This agreement allows Tether to purchase 34,444,580 shares after October 29, 2025. Notably, the purchase is subject to approval from Elemental. If this happens, it would help Tether grow its gold investments even more. Ardoino said Tether sees gold and Bitcoin as smart long-term investments. Bitcoin helps hedge against inflation , while gold offers stability in uncertain times. By investing these assets, Tether aims to keep USDT strong and reliable. Over the past year, both real-world assets have made significant returns, with more than 40% growth. These are the only two major assets that can perform this well. Bitcoin is now more popular than gold among U.S. investors for the first time ever. In December 2024, Fed Chair Powell even called Bitcoin “digital gold.” Tether Bets on Gold and Bitcoin for Stability Tether also supports Bitcoin by open-sourcing its Mining Operating System (MOS). This makes it easier for smaller miners to join and grow the Bitcoin network. Tether’s investments now include Tether Gold (XAUT), which is backed by real gold. By putting money into gold, Bitcoin, and digital tokens, Tether wants to build a strong and steady base. This plan shows that Tether is thinking ahead and wants to create a safer and more stable financial system for everyone.

2025-06-12T16:28:55,"Brazil may allocate $18.5B into Bitcoin as G20 digital asset shift accelerates","Brazil is on track to become the first G20 country to legalise the use of Bitcoin as part of its sovereign reserves, potentially committing up to 5% of its $370 billion in international holdings—equivalent to $18.5 billion—into the digital asset. A legislative proposal , Bill PL 4501/2024, has already cleared its first hurdle in the Chamber of Deputies. If approved into law, the bill could redefine how global financial systems treat crypto assets, establishing a structured precedent for Bitcoin to be held alongside gold and foreign currencies in national reserves. Bitcoin legislation advances in Brazilian Congress The proposed bill, titled the Strategic Sovereign Bitcoin Reserve (RESBit), would authorise Brazil’s Ministry of Finance and Central Bank to purchase and hold Bitcoin as part of the country’s official international reserves. The bill highlights Bitcoin’s potential to act as a strategic hedge against macroeconomic volatility and to help diversify reserve portfolios traditionally reliant on fiat currencies and sovereign bonds. According to the draft text, the RESBit aims to integrate blockchain-based digital assets into state policy while mitigating risks associated with global financial instability. The bill’s advancement through its first committee represents the first time a top-tier economy has taken formal legislative steps to include Bitcoin in its state reserves. Up to 5% of $370B reserves may be held in BTC Under the current framework, the Central Bank would be empowered to hold as much as 5% of Brazil’s $370 billion in foreign reserves in Bitcoin, a move that would inject billions into the digital currency market. This would amount to a potential $18.5 billion investment in BTC, signalling a sharp pivot in how central banks might view digital assets, not merely as speculative tools but as long-term reserve instruments. The bill has attracted significant attention on social media, with industry observers pointing out the significance of such a move by a G20 economy. On 5 June, user pete_rizzo_ noted that “Latin America’s largest economy wants BTC”, underscoring the broader implications of such a development. The Bitcoin Historian @pete_rizzo_ · Follow BREAKING: BRAZIL’S STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE BILL PASSES 1ST COMMITTEE WITH APPROVAL RECOMMENDATION LATIN AMERICA’S LARGEST ECONOMY WANTS BTC.

Financial institutions and policymakers in other G20 nations are watching the situation closely, recognising that a move of this scale by Brazil could set the tone for broader adoption. This would mark the first time a nation of Brazil’s size and influence openly treats Bitcoin as a reserve-grade asset. Brazil’s approach may also serve as a stress test for integrating crypto into regulated financial infrastructure. By adopting Bitcoin through legislative means and involving the Ministry of Finance and Central Bank, the initiative ensures alignment with macroeconomic policy and financial regulations. Such a move could legitimise Bitcoin in global monetary policy circles and potentially soften regulatory resistance in other regions.

2025-06-12T16:18:36,"Hong Kong developing new crypto tracing tool, here’s what you need to know","Hong Kong has confirmed that it is developing a cryptocurrency tracking tool to strengthen enforcement against cross-border money laundering. During a media briefing, Assistant Commissioner Mario Wong Ho-yin of Hong Kong Customs said the department is working with the University of Hong Kong to build the tool to counteract increasingly complex financial crimes involving virtual assets. While details of the tool’s operation remain confidential, officials said it is being designed to trace suspicious crypto transactions linked to money laundering schemes . According to Wong, the university has already supported the department with forensic technologies in other cases, including those involving illegal streaming, and that technical assistance is essential for meeting court evidence requirements. “These money laundering threats are characterised by a transnational and borderless nature, and no single agency can tackle this problem alone,” he added. Crypto’s role in money laundering Seven out of nearly 40 major laundering cases probed by Hong Kong Customs since 2021 have involved the use of cryptocurrencies. These seven cases accounted for more than HK$9 billion (US$1.1 billion) in suspected criminal proceeds, often disguised as routine trading activity. In one particular instance, officials uncovered over 1,000 suspicious transactions totalling HK$1.8 billion across five companies and 18 local bank accounts. Three suspects were arrested, with two accused of moving HK$760 million via a cryptocurrency platform. Plans for a digital crypto tracing tool were first revealed earlier this year when Hong Kong’s Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau introduced CryptoTrace, a system jointly developed with the University of Hong Kong. It was described as a platform providing “advanced intelligence and investigative support” for officers handling virtual asset cases. Announced during the Blockchain Security Summit in March, CryptoTrace is already in use by frontline police investigators and is designed to support intelligence gathering in virtual asset-related crimes. At the time, the bureau said CryptoTrace employed blockchain analytics, graphing, and visualization technologies to trace laundered funds and identify suspect activity. Reportedly, training sessions had already been held to equip frontline officers with the skills to use the system effectively. While the Customs Department did not confirm the name of the tool currently under development, its partnership with the same university and its stated objectives have raised speculation that the system may be an extension, or internal application, of the earlier CryptoTrace platform. Hong Kong takes a cautious approach Hong Kong’s approach to digital assets remains deliberately measured , as it plans to balance innovation and regulatory oversight. Nevertheless, locals appear undeterred by regulatory caution , with a November 2024 survey revealing that one in four adults plan to invest in cryptocurrencies. However, the findings also indicated a clear preference for regulated exchanges, with respondents expressing greater trust in licensed platforms compared to unregulated ones. This growing appetite among residents appears to be shaping how Hong Kong regulators calibrate policy. In April, the Securities and Futures Commission began allowing licensed virtual asset trading platforms to offer staking services, but only under strict conditions. Platforms must obtain written approval and comply with measures designed to protect users and disclose the risks associated with locking up assets for yield generation. By May, lawmakers had passed the Stablecoins Bill , mandating that all issuers of fiat-referenced stablecoins tied to the Hong Kong dollar obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority. Last week, the government confirmed that the Stablecoin Ordinance will take effect on August 1, 2025. The law will also limit stablecoin-related advertisements to licensed issuers and grant certain exemptions for offerings made exclusively to qualified investors.

2025-06-12T16:05:11,"Will Hamster Kombat price recover after falling 90%?","Hamster Kombat token crashed to a record low on Thursday, capping the downfall of one of the most prominent players in the tap-to-earn industry. Hamster Kombat ( HMSTR ) plunged to $0.0010, down 89% over the past year. The token’s market capitalization has collapsed from over $437 million in September to just $67 million today. HMSTR’s crash came as many holders capitulated and sold their tokens. Nansen data shows exchange balances have increased by 13% over the past 30 days, rising to over 17.86 billion HMSTR. A rise in exchange balances typically indicates that investors are moving tokens from self-custody to centralized platforms to sell. Additional on-chain data shows that the number of HMSTR holders dropped from over 300 million at its peak to just 672,200 today. Most exited as the token collapsed and user activity on its mini app declined sharply following its token generation event.

Futures open interest for HMSTR dropped to $30 million on Thursday, down from this month’s high of $60 million. At the same time, Hamster Kombat’s funding rate sank to a record low of minus 0.06%.

HMSTR price technical analysis HMSTR price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows HMSTR peaked at $0.0029 in April and formed a double-top pattern, with a neckline at $0.002438, the swing low from May 6. The token has since broken below key support at $0.001460, its lowest level in February. Price has also moved below all major moving averages, while both the MACD and the Relative Strength Index have plunged. Additionally, HMSTR has formed an inverse cup-and-handle pattern. Given these signals, the token will likely continue falling as buying interest remains weak. If the decline accelerates, the next level to watch will be $0.00095.

2025-06-12T16:00:06,"Trident Digital eyes $500 million XRP treasury in bold corporate crypto bet","Singapore-headquartered Trident Digital Holdings (TDTH), a Nasdaq-listed technology firm, has announced plans to raise up to $500 million to build one of the world’s first corporate treasuries based entirely on XRP. The company said in a statement that it intends to use the funds for long-term XRP holdings, staking strategies to generate yield, and to deepen its integration with Ripple’s broader ecosystem. The initiative marks a significant pivot in corporate digital asset management strategies, diverging from the Bitcoin-centric approach taken by most firms engaged in crypto treasuries. Trident aims to operationalise the XRP-based treasury in the second half of 2025, depending on regulatory approvals. Trident plans structured raise via equity and private capital The $500 million target will be raised through a mix of equity sales, private placements, and structured capital instruments, with the company tapping Chaince Securities, a United States-based advisory firm, to serve as strategic advisor on the fundraise. Trident did not disclose how much of the capital would be allocated directly to XRP acquisition versus staking and ecosystem development. However, it confirmed that a substantial portion of the funds would be committed to supporting infrastructure and application developers working within Ripple’s framework. According to CEO Soon Huat Lim, the initiative reflects Trident’s broader strategy to position itself as a long-term participant in blockchain-based finance. The company said the move also signals its belief in XRP as a stable, utility-driven digital asset suitable for treasury diversification beyond Bitcoin. XRP joins select group of treasury-held digital assets If completed, Trident’s treasury would place XRP in a rare class of corporate-held crypto assets. To date, Bitcoin remains the only digital asset widely held in corporate treasuries, with companies such as MicroStrategy and Metaplanet holding over 226,000 and 141 Bitcoin, respectively. By contrast, very few public firms have included altcoins like XRP in their balance sheets due to regulatory uncertainties, volatility concerns, and a lack of long-term utility use cases. Trident’s decision could set a precedent for other firms looking to diversify beyond Bitcoin while staying compliant. The company’s effort also comes as XRP’s regulatory status remains a subject of debate in the United States, following Ripple’s ongoing legal case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trident acknowledged the importance of “regulatory clarity” in the timing of its deployment, suggesting the treasury will only launch once key jurisdictional issues are resolved. Ripple integration central to long-term strategy A key component of Trident’s XRP treasury plan includes forging deeper ties with Ripple’s ecosystem through collaborations with infrastructure providers and app developers. While specific partners were not named, the firm said it would prioritise projects that promote scalability, compliance, and institutional use cases for XRP. The move may also help Trident position itself strategically in Asia-Pacific and global markets where Ripple has expanded its footprint. By becoming a major institutional participant in the XRP ledger, Trident could also benefit from potential appreciation in the asset’s value or increased on-chain utility over time. The announcement follows similar moves in adjacent sectors where digital assets are increasingly being used for yield generation, cross-border settlements, and treasury diversification. However, this is one of the first large-scale attempts to build an XRP-specific corporate treasury at this scale, setting Trident apart from crypto-native funds or speculative altcoin investments.

2025-06-12T16:00:00,"The Ultimate Summer 2025 Crypto Portfolio: What to Hold Now","The crypto market is heating up again in June 2025, and altcoins are leading the next bull run. Amid the new wave of massive gains, you might be wondering what to hold. Smart investors know that when the market heats up, the best options are those that show massive potential but have yet to be uncovered by the rest of the market. One of the finest examples of this is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Let us dive into which projects to consider this summer. Solana (SOL) Could Ride ETF Wave Analysts forecast that if the SEC approves a Solana (SOL) ETF, it could push Solana (SOL) past the $200 mark. The price of Solana (SOL) is currently at $150, after a massive slump of nearly 50% from the all-time high of $294 in January. Amid this falling enthusiasm for Solana (SOL), investors in the project are looking for options elsewhere, and so far, they have settled on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for bombastic returns. Even with an ETF approval, SOL would only rise by 25%, which is meager compared to the real gains that MUTM presale investors are expecting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) -Life-Changing Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project in the Defi sector that aims to give participants in its ecosystem some of the biggest returns of 2025. To achieve this, it has created a decentralized non-custodial protocol where users can participate as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. Lenders can deposit their assets for the chance to earn interest, while borrowers can deposit overcollateralized collateral to access those assets. The interest rate in the pools on Mutuum Finance is determined by a pool’s utilization rate. Security On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) completed an audit by the trust CertiK blockchain audit service. In the results, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) received a Token Scan Score of 80. These results have inspired confidence in the project, with investors now rushing to secure their presale tokens in phase 5 of the presale. The results of the presale have also helped Mutuum Finance (MUTM) secure a listing on CoinMarketCap, the leading platform for price movements in the crypto sector. The platform receives over 350 million monthly visitors, which will ensure that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gets the visibility it deserves. It will also allow crypto investors to view the price movement for MUTM tokens to make smart investment decisions. To further bolster security, the platform will implement an address screening program, which will ensure nefarious actors are kept outside of its reach. The program will use an independent third party, where addresses will be screened before being allowed onto the platform. However, private details like IP addresses and metadata will not be shared with the third-party security service. The project is also sending out an open invitation to security experts, developers, and ethical hackers to examine the code and report vulnerabilities. To do this, the project will launch a bug bounty program, which will be open to anyone with blockchain security expertise. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin (BTC) is the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Its main advantage is that it was the first, and has continued to grow a large community around it. Additionally, it has received a lot of institutional inflows in 2025. Based on these activities, analysts forecast that it could reach 200k by the end of 2025. However, while those gains seem massive, they are not as impressive as those in low-cap coins with massive potential. For instance, a rise to $200K would represent a 100% increase. On the other hand, conservative estimates on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) show that it could rise from the current price of $0.03 to $2. That would represent a 6,566.67% increase, eclipsing Bitcoin (BTC) gains on the highest end of the forecast. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in phase 5 of its presale, where it has raised over $10.4 million from investors so far. Over 11,900 unique buyers are taking part in the presale, where tokens are currently priced at $0.03. In the first phase of the presale, the tokens were priced at $0.01. The token price is set to go up by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035. Ongoing $100,000 Giveaway To reward presale participants, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has organized a $100,000 giveaway. This giveaway is open to all presale participants who purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the presale. They will then stand a chance to be one of the ten lucky winners who will receive $10,000 in MUMT tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project that prioritizes security and intends to become the leading Defi project. By investing in the presale, you stand a chance to make huge gains that could propel your portfolio to new heights.

Meet Bitcoin Solaris — The Next Evolution in Blockchain Bitcoin Solaris introduces a high-performance blockchain designed with real-world scalability and mobile-first accessibility in mind. By blending proven consensus models with next-gen architecture, BTC-S isn’t just building a new network — it’s redefining what a decentralized platform can do.

With this structure, Bitcoin Solaris is already proving capable of powering complex applications in DeFi, gaming, supply chain, and identity, all while staying efficient and sustainable. Your Fastest Path to Crypto Riches Starts with BTC-S Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Gaining Traction — Fast The tech alone is impressive. But it’s how BTC-S is empowering users that’s driving demand. From passive earners to hands-on builders, the network is designed to support everyone, and it’s doing it with speed. The upcoming Solaris Nova app adds another layer of appeal. While not yet released, this mobile-first innovation will allow users to mine BTC-S from anywhere, transforming smartphones into powerful contributors to the network. With mining made accessible and mobile-friendly, it’s no wonder BTC-S is rising through the ranks. Meanwhile, rewards aren’t just handed out randomly. They’re calculated based on: Resource contribution and device capability Time commitment and network support Task complexity and overall system demand The result? A fair, transparent reward system that values participation.

BTC-S Has the Tools to Build Wealth While other tokens focus on hype, Bitcoin Solaris is delivering the mechanics that support real wealth creation. It starts with its architecture and scales with its reward system. BTC-S empowers users through: Mobile-first mining via the upcoming Solaris Nova app Validator-driven consensus that ensures speed without compromising decentralization High-throughput smart contract support that opens doors to high-volume applications Cross-layer transparency and syncing that ensures stability even in volatile conditions And it’s not going unnoticed. As one of the few projects offering real innovation and strong token utility, Bitcoin Solaris is positioning itself to create wealth, not just opportunity. Security, Trust, and Transparency: Backed by Audits Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just bold — it’s verified. The project has passed two comprehensive audits: Audit by Cyberscope Audit by Freshcoins This level of transparency has only added to its credibility, solidifying BTC-S as one of the safest plays among presale-phase tokens. Stay up to date through the official Telegram and X accounts where updates, launches, and community news roll out live.

According to a Thursday press release , the company has secured a $5 billion equity line of credit with RK Capital Management. The agreement allows DeFi Dev to sell shares at its discretion, so long as it meets conditions like filing a resale registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said it plans to file the necessary paperwork soon. ""We now have the flexibility and structure we need to scale,"" said Joseph Onorati, Chief Executive Officer. ""This is a clean, strategic path to continue growing SOL per share and compounding validator yield."" DFDV shares rebounded from early losses and were up 12% during the Thursday session. The company, formerly known as real estate tech platform Janover, is part of a growing trend of publicly-traded firms raising funds by selling shares and debt to add cryptocurrencies on their balance sheet, following Strategy's playbook with bitcoin BTC. The firm focuses on Solana, accumulating the network's native token and operating validators. It held over 609,000 SOL tokens as of May 16, worth $96 million at current prices.

2025-06-12T15:37:02,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP: A Technical Look at Whether to Buy, Sell, or Hold This Week","Analyzing the current market trends and chart patterns, Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP present intriguing cases for traders this week. This piece delves into whether these leading cryptocurrencies signal a time to invest, offload, or maintain current holdings. Discover which of these digital assets may be poised for a breakout or further downturn. Bitcoin Market: Steady Growth with Bullish Focus at Critical Levels Bitcoin saw a steady price climb over the past month with a 5.70% gain, reflecting a calm yet positive performance. Over the last six months, a 9.85% rise demonstrated continued investor interest and an overall upward trend. Weekly price behavior, marked by a 4.08% increase, confirms resilience in the market during this period with gradual recovery evident in the price progression. Bitcoin currently trades within a price range of $94,832 to $113,326.8. Nearest resistance is located at $121,869.42, while the nearest support stands at $84,880.08. The Awesome Oscillator at 1,723.82 indicates positive energy, while the Momentum Indicator at 3,965.46 also suggests upward movement. The Relative Strength Index near 61.98 points to a moderately strong market. Bulls appear dominant, but caution exists as no clear long-term trend emerges. Tactical trades may be effective, with buying near support and selling near resistance for balanced risk and reward. Close monitoring of key signals is essential. Ethereum: Short-Term Rally Amid Mixed Half-Year Trends Past month ETH data shows a clear short-term gain, with a one-week increase of 7.61% and a monthly rise of 10.99%. Over the past six months, Ethereum experienced a decline of 28.12%, reflecting a challenging longer-term trend despite recent upward momentum. This mix of short-term recovery against a longer-term downturn highlights a market that can catch sudden lifts but remains influenced by broader bearish pressures over time. Current price action finds Ethereum trading in a range between $1923.57 and $2961.91. The nearest support is marked at $1318.72 while resistance looms near $3395.40. Bulls appear to be gaining ground in the short term, as reflected by recent gains and positive momentum indicators. However, the relative strength index shows upward pressure could soon face pushback if overbought conditions emerge. Traders might consider positions around the current range with stop-loss orders near the lower support, while monitoring for potential breakouts above $3395.40. XRP Price Snapshot: Week Gains Amid Minor Long-Term Decline XRP experienced a slight weekly increase of 2.08% with a monthly drop of 3.14% and a six-month decline of 1.98%. The coin’s performance has shown limited volatility, as modest gains balanced out larger period declines. Price activity over the past month and half-year has been mixed, featuring small upward moves offset by gradual fading values over time. Indicators reflected a neutral mood, with the market quietly adjusting without dramatic swings. The recent behavior indicates a consolidation phase where neither bulls nor bears have taken full control of the market. XRP currently trades in a price range of $1.95 to $2.53, sitting above clear support at $1.73 and below resistance at $2.88. A second resistance is seen at $3.45 while a lower support is marked at $1.15. The market’s momentum is positive with an indicator reading of 0.1126, though the Awesome Oscillator stands slightly negative. Moving averages suggest moderate buying interest. The overall price lies within well-defined boundaries, indicating a lack of a decisive trend. Traders may consider long entries near support levels, with profit targets around resistance zones while remaining cautious. Conclusion BTC shows potential for growth with current trends. ETH appears stable but needs close watching for market shifts. XRP remains volatile, requiring cautious consideration. Each offers unique opportunities depending on market interest and individual risk tolerance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-06-12T15:30:32,"Will Dogecoin Moon Or Crash? This Indicator Holds The Answer","According to market technician Cantonese Cat (@cantonmeow) a single metric—the 20-month simple moving average—could be the line that could separate another vertical rally from a gut-wrenching breakdown for Dogecoin. Currently, DOGE sits comfortable above that moving average, now plotted at $0.1751. The black curve on Cat’s chart shows only three clean retests of the 20-month SMA since 2014. All Eyes On Dogecoin’s 20-Month SMA The first came in March 2017, when price tapped the average near $0.00020 and then ripped more than 9,000% into the January 2018 peak. The second occurred in the winter of 2020, with price kissing the average at roughly one-fourth of one cent before the parabolic 34,500% run to $0.73 the following May. The third and current encounter began in August last year when DOGE rallied by more than 480%. As of today, two successive monthly candles dipped into the zone just below twenty-cents, but both were bought aggressively, leaving higher wicks and preserving the upward slope of the average. Cantonese Cat argues that as long as that moving average remains intact, “we’re going higher.” A decisive monthly close beneath $0.175 would, by this read, place the entire structure at risk and could usher in the sort of multi-month down-trend that followed the 2018 and 2021 climaxes. Related Reading: Dogecoin Faces Make-Or-Break Moment This Month, Predicts Analyst TOTAL2 Needs To Break Out Analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) overlays that micro view on a much broader canvas. His chart tracks the total crypto market capitalization ex-Bitcoin (TradingView ticker “TOTAL2”) in monthly candles back to 2017. Two bold yellow trend-lines define a seven-year rising channel whose upper rail repelled price at the January 2018 and November 2021 alt-season tops. Since the June 2022 low, the market has carved out an ascending triangle: a rising series of higher lows presses against a flat-topped supply zone between roughly $1.43 trillion and $1.7 trillion. The apex of the triangle now looms; aggregate alt-cap is already worth about $1.2 trillion — all that stands between the current print and a confirmed breakout is a monthly close above the upper edge of that yellow rectangle. Kevin’s projection measures the height of the pattern and adds it to the breakout level, dropping a vertical marker that intersects the mid-channel near $5.89 trillion. Kevin’s first Fibonacci extensions target is the 1.618 at $4.06 trillion. Higher extensions at 1.886, 2.0 and 2.618 cluster around $4.57 trillion, 5.89 trillion and $6.9 trillion respectively, the last of which coincides almost exactly with the channel’s ceiling and is circled as the analyst’s ultimate upside objective. Related Reading: Dogecoin Primed For Liftoff If It Can Break This Barrier: Key Price Targets Why does that matter for Dogecoin? The meme-coin’s two explosive cycles began only after TOTAL2 had broken its own prior-cycle high and money poured into non-Bitcoin assets. Kevin states that “altcoins are just scratching the surface of what is possible in the coming months,” provided that macro-liquidity and regulatory factors permit capital rotation out of Bitcoin into the wider market. In that scenario the 20-month SMA on DOGE would likely continue to slope higher, setting the stage for an explosive move higher. Conversely, failure of the alt-cap triangle would make a sustained loss of the SMA far more probable, robbing DOGE of its historical launch-pad. For now, the indicator holds—and with it the prospect that Dogecoin could be primed for yet another bout of furious upside. But as both analysts caution, the monthly close will tell the story: above the 20-month SMA and an alt-cap breakout, or below it and back into hibernation. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

2025-06-12T15:29:51,"Canadian Company Buys 10,000 HYPE as Hyperliquid Aims For New Highs","According to a press release , Tony G Holdings, a company trading under the TONY ticker on the CSE, joined the DeFi space with a massive acquisition. Per the document, the publicly traded company purchased 10,000 HYPE the native token of the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid. At press time, the 10,000 HYPE are worth over $420,000 and represent the biggest stake by a publicly traded company in this DeFi platform. Launched in late 2024, Hyperliquid has gained a lot of attention within the crypto space due to its bullish price action; HYPE rose from $1 to around $42 in less than a year. Why The Massive Bet in HYPE? Tony G CEO Answers As per the press release, Tony G Holdings operates as an investment company. Thus, they specialize in looking for opportunities to generate profits by investing in securities and different sectors with a special focus in cryptocurrency, payment processing businesses, and blockchain. The acquisition of 10,000 HYPE follows a “long term digital asset strategy” which marks a “significant milestone” for the company. Furthermore, it was revealed that the Canadian company used WonderFi as the trading venue that facilitated the transaction. Matt Zahab, CEO at Tony G, stated the following regarding their massive HYPE acquisition: This acquisition reflects our strategic commitment to supporting digital infrastructure that is driving the next wave of innovation. HyperLiquid represents one of the most exciting developments in decentralized trading infrastructure, and we are proud to be one of the first public companies to invest in the HyperLiquid ecosystem. This is far from the first time that Tony G has made headlines in the crypto space. The company attracted media attention in 2022 when it sold 51% of its stake in News 3.0 the entity operating as cryptonews.com. The Canadian investment company netted $2 million from this transaction. The totality of the money was to be paid monthly for $166,666. Tony G accepted cryptocurrencies as part this deal at a time when the DeFi sector saw severe losses due to the collapse of the FTX exchange . Hyperliquid Community Speculates: HYPE ETF On The Horizon? Since its inception, the Hyperliquid DEX has been heavily focused on favoring its users over institutions and Venture Capitalist firms. Thus, the DeFi platform has gained adoption, not without its critics, in this sector. Following the Tony G 10,000 HYPE acquisition, and due to the recent developments around the potential launch of a Solana Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), many in this community has begun circulating rumors about the potential launch of a HYPE ETF. Related Reading: Dogecoin Volume Remains Low Despite Price Rebound, What’s Going On?

2025-06-12T15:28:20,"An Unfazed Tim Draper is Standing by his $250,000 Bitcoin Prediction, Here’s Why","As chaos ensues over the increasing U.S. deficit amidst the continued trade wars that followed Trump’s increased tariff rates, cryptocurrency personalities are speaking up about the possible impact of the ongoing development on Bitcoin . Billionaire investor Tim Draper is one such figure, convinced that Bitcoin could benefit positively from the persistent volatility recorded in the traditional finance market. In a recent post shared to X, Draper doubled down on his previous forecast for Bitcoin, with a price target of $250,000. The billionaire investor told his 268,000 followers that Bitcoin could kick off a bullish marathon this year, despite hitting a new all-time high 15 days ago. “Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows.” He wrote. Outlining the main factors responsible for “pushing Bitcoin forward” at this time, Draper pointed to renewed optimism from market participants, as President Trump works out trade deals, the incoming regulatory frameworks essential for the provision of market clarity, and the increase in Web3 applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain. He observed that traditional banks are adding to their offerings, noting that JP Morgan plans to join the race, while businesses pile in— a development he believes could bring about mainstream adoption. He went on to make the following observations; “Bitcoin is extremely low risk compared to some other cryptocurrencies and stocks because people believe in it. It’s earning the title of a store of value. Meanwhile, Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum while keeping a solid foundation. The smart money sees what comes next.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin kicked off June with an opening price of $104,637 and traded at an intraday high of $105,884. On Thursday, Bitcoin sharply declined as selling pressure intensified, resulting in a revisit to the $100,000 price mark. Down 8.12% from its all-time high of $111,970, with a 2.04% decline in market cap value, Bitcoin is trading at a press time price of $107,598.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/an-unfazed-tim-draper-is-standing-by-his-250000-bitcoin-prediction-heres-why/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Tim Draper",cryptocompare

According to the company’s latest corporate statement, this latest purchase brings its total Bitcoin reserves to 153.4627 BTC. Japanese Fashion Brand ANAP Holdings Increases Bitcoin Reserves with New Acquisition The move reflects ANAP Holdings’ commitment to integrating digital assets into its treasury strategy and adds to the growing number of publicly traded companies in Japan and around the world turning to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. While ANAP is known for its trend-driven fashion collections, it has recently increased its focus on Web3 technologies and blockchain-based finance. This latest BTC purchase reflects a deepening belief in the long-term value and role of cryptocurrencies in the modern economy. The company did not disclose the purchase price or the timing of the transactions, but this addition brings ANAP’s total Bitcoin value into the millions of dollars based on current market prices.

The HINU token recently registered its latest price increase, rising from $0.00017889 to $0.00017941. The project’s next price jump will see the token rise to $0.00017993. Husky Inu’s (HINU) Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) is set to register its latest price jump, which will see the token’s value rise from $0.00017941 to $0.00017993. The project had only recently registered an increase to $0.00017889. The project has seen a surge of interest as markets rebounded, with Bitcoin (BTC) rallying past $110,000, while Ethereum (ETH) crossed $2,800 before registering a marginal decline. Interest in Husky Inu remains strong despite a decline in the broader crypto market over the past two sessions. The price jump is part of the project’s pre-launch phase, which aims to empower the project’s fledgling yet growing community and ensure they can benefit from favorable pricing. If you remember, the token price at the beginning of the pre-launch phase was $0.00015000 and has steadily increased since. The token price has risen every two days and will continue until the tokens sell out. Closing In On Another Milestone The project is also closing in on another major milestone, the $800,000 mark. The burgeoning interest in Husky Inu has seen the project raise $798,320 so far. The project could reach the $800,000 mark as early as next week and remains on track to achieve its stated goal of $1.2 million. Markets Stall After Burgeoning Rally Meanwhile, the crypto market’s rally stalled, with major cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, trading in bearish territory. BTC surged past $110,000 on Monday but lost momentum as selling pressure overwhelmed buyers. As a result, it fell 1.42% on Wednesday and extended its losses during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%. ETH also started the week on a bullish note, surging past $2,600 on Monday and $2,800 on Tuesday to settle at $2,816. However, it slipped back below $2,800 and currently trades around $2,770. Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), Toncoin (TON), Polkadot (DOT), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) also registered notable declines.
