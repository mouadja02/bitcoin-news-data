The Bitcoin hashrate , a measure of the total computational power being used to mine and process transactions, serves as a vital indicator of the network’s health, security, and geographical distribution. As we delve into the third quarter of 2025, a fascinating shift in the global mining landscape has been unveiled, with the United States solidifying its dominant position while Russia makes a significant and strategic ascent. This evolving scenario is not just about numbers; it reflects geopolitical shifts, energy policies, and the relentless pursuit of digital gold. Understanding the Global Bitcoin Hashrate Landscape The latest data from the Global Hashrate Heatmap by Hashrate Index paints a compelling picture of where the world’s Bitcoin mining power resides. For Q3 2025, the United States stands as the undisputed leader, commanding a formidable 323.4 EH/s (Exahashes per second). This significant lead underscores the country’s growing commitment to and infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining. Following closely, Russia has emerged as a formidable player with 150 EH/s, signaling its growing influence in the sector. China, despite past crackdowns, maintains a notable presence at 125 EH/s, indicating a persistent, albeit often clandestine, mining activity within its borders. This distribution isn’t accidental. It’s the culmination of various factors, including energy availability, regulatory environments, technological advancements, and investor confidence. The concentration of global hashrate in these key regions highlights their strategic importance to the Bitcoin ecosystem’s security and decentralization. Why is US Bitcoin Mining Leading the Charge? The United States’ pre-eminence in US Bitcoin mining is no fluke; it’s the result of a confluence of favorable conditions that have attracted massive investment and infrastructure development. Several key factors contribute to its leading position: Abundant and Diverse Energy Sources: The U.S. boasts a wide array of energy options, including natural gas, hydro, wind, and solar. Many mining operations are strategically located in regions with surplus energy, such as Texas (wind and natural gas), Kentucky (coal-fired plants), and New York (hydroelectric power), where electricity is relatively cheap and readily available. Favorable Regulatory Environment: While still evolving, the U.S. has generally adopted a more open and less restrictive stance towards cryptocurrency mining compared to some other nations. States like Wyoming, Texas, and Colorado have enacted progressive legislation aimed at attracting blockchain businesses, providing legal clarity and support. Robust Infrastructure and Capital Markets: The U.S. has a well-developed financial infrastructure that facilitates investment in large-scale mining operations. Access to capital, advanced data centers, and a skilled workforce capable of managing complex tech operations are significant advantages. Technological Innovation: American companies are at the forefront of developing new mining hardware (ASICs) and optimizing mining software. This innovation ecosystem helps maintain a competitive edge. Institutional Adoption: A growing number of publicly traded companies in the U.S. are entering the Bitcoin mining space, bringing institutional-level capital, management, and transparency to the industry. These elements combine to create an environment where large-scale, efficient, and profitable mining operations can thrive, solidifying the U.S.’s position as the global leader. Russia’s Strategic Ascent: A New Force in Bitcoin Mining The emergence of Russia as the second-largest contributor to the global hashrate is one of the most compelling narratives of Q3 2025. Russia’s rise in Russia Bitcoin mining is largely driven by its unique advantages: Vast Energy Resources: Russia is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas, often with significant energy surpluses, particularly in remote regions like Siberia. This translates to incredibly low electricity costs for miners, making operations highly profitable. Cold Climate: The naturally cold climate in many parts of Russia is a significant benefit for mining operations, as it reduces the need for expensive cooling systems for ASICs, thereby lowering operational costs. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While historically cautious, Russia has shown signs of softening its stance on cryptocurrency. The government has explored various regulatory frameworks, acknowledging the economic potential of mining. There’s a growing push to legalize and tax mining operations, which could further legitimize and expand the industry within the country. Geopolitical Considerations: In an era of economic sanctions, Bitcoin mining offers Russia an avenue to generate revenue and potentially circumvent traditional financial systems, making it a strategically appealing industry. The speed and scale of Russia’s ascent indicate a deliberate strategy to capitalize on its natural advantages and secure a significant share of the global Bitcoin network’s power. China’s Enduring Influence on Global Hashrate Despite the infamous crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in May 2021, China still holds a substantial share of the global hashrate , ranking third globally. The narrative around China Bitcoin mining is complex: Resilience of Underground Operations: While large-scale, overt mining farms were dismantled, many smaller, clandestine operations have persisted. These miners often leverage hidden hydropower resources or operate in remote areas to avoid detection. Shift to Overseas Operations: Many major Chinese mining companies and individuals relocated their operations to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like the U.S., Kazakhstan, and Canada after the ban. However, some still maintain ties or smaller operations within China. Renewed Interest in Green Energy: Paradoxically, some areas in China, particularly those with abundant hydropower (like Sichuan and Yunnan during the wet season), still offer attractive conditions for ‘green’ mining, which some authorities might tolerate more readily than fossil fuel-powered operations. China’s continued presence, even diminished, underscores the difficulty of completely eradicating an industry as distributed and resilient as Bitcoin mining, especially when significant energy advantages exist. The Significance of Global Hashrate Distribution The geographical distribution of the Bitcoin hashrate is more than just a statistical curiosity; it has profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem: Network Security: A higher and more distributed hashrate generally translates to a more secure network. It makes a 51% attack (where a single entity gains control of over half the network’s mining power) exceedingly difficult, protecting the integrity of transactions and the blockchain. Decentralization: While the concentration in a few countries might raise concerns about centralization, a diversified global distribution across multiple nations is healthier than dominance by a single region. The current spread, with the U.S. leading but Russia and China as significant players, indicates a level of decentralization. Energy Consumption Debate: The locations of mining operations heavily influence the energy mix used for mining. Regions with abundant renewable energy (hydro, solar, wind) are increasingly attractive, driving the industry towards more sustainable practices. Geopolitical Stability: The reliance on mining infrastructure in politically stable regions adds to the network’s resilience against government interference or economic instability. The ongoing shifts in hashrate distribution reflect the network’s adaptive nature and its ability to seek out optimal conditions globally. Challenges and Opportunities in Global Bitcoin Mining Despite the impressive growth and concentration of global hashrate , the Bitcoin mining industry faces its share of challenges, alongside burgeoning opportunities: Key Challenges: Energy Costs and Sustainability: Fluctuating energy prices and the increasing focus on environmental sustainability pose significant challenges. Miners are under pressure to source renewable energy or face criticism. Hardware Availability and Obsolescence: The supply chain for advanced mining hardware (ASICs) can be volatile, and older models quickly become unprofitable as network difficulty increases. Regulatory Uncertainty: While some countries are embracing mining, others remain hesitant or even hostile, creating a patchwork of regulations that can complicate international operations. Geopolitical Risks: Political instability or shifts in government policy in key mining regions can significantly impact operations and global hashrate distribution. Emerging Opportunities: Renewable Energy Integration: Miners are increasingly partnering with renewable energy producers, utilizing stranded energy assets, or helping to stabilize power grids by acting as flexible load balancers. Waste Heat Utilization: Innovations are emerging to repurpose the heat generated by mining, for example, to warm homes or greenhouses. Modular and Mobile Mining: The development of containerized and mobile mining units allows for greater flexibility in deployment, especially to areas with excess energy. Institutional Investment: As Bitcoin gains legitimacy, more traditional financial institutions are exploring investments in mining, bringing more capital and professional management to the sector. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Mining? The trajectory of Bitcoin hashrate distribution suggests a continued evolution driven by energy economics, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements. We can anticipate several trends: Diversification beyond the top three: While the U.S., Russia, and China currently dominate, countries like Canada, Kazakhstan, and parts of Latin America are likely to continue growing their share as they offer competitive energy prices and a welcoming regulatory environment. Increased focus on sustainability: The pressure to adopt greener mining practices will intensify, pushing innovation in renewable energy integration and waste heat recovery. Technological advancements: Further improvements in ASIC efficiency will reduce energy consumption per hash, making mining more profitable and accessible. Closer integration with energy grids: Mining operations may increasingly become part of smart grids, offering services like demand response and helping to stabilize intermittent renewable energy sources. The race for hashrate dominance is not just about securing a piece of the Bitcoin pie; it’s about influencing the future of decentralized finance and digital sovereignty. The latest Q3 2025 data confirms the United States’ commanding lead in the global Bitcoin hashrate , a testament to its robust infrastructure, favorable policies, and access to diverse energy. However, the remarkable rise of Russia as a key player, leveraging its vast energy reserves and cold climate, signals a significant shift in the competitive landscape. Even China, despite its past bans, maintains a resilient presence, highlighting the persistent global nature of Bitcoin mining. This evolving distribution underscores the network’s security, decentralization, and the ongoing quest for efficient and sustainable energy sources. As the industry matures, we can expect continued innovation and a dynamic geographical redistribution of mining power, shaping the very foundation of the Bitcoin network for years to come.

2025-07-14T06:40:18,"Unstoppable Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Soars 7.96% to New Heights","BitcoinWorld Unstoppable Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Soars 7.96% to New Heights The world of Bitcoin is constantly evolving, a dynamic landscape shaped by the tireless work of miners and the intricate rules of its underlying code. Recently, a significant milestone was reached that has everyone talking: the Bitcoin mining difficulty has surged to an unprecedented all-time high. If you’re invested in cryptocurrencies, or just curious about what keeps the Bitcoin network running, this development is crucial. It speaks volumes about the health and resilience of the world’s leading digital asset. What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty, and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to mine a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain. Think of it like a puzzle: the higher the difficulty, the more complex the puzzle. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; it’s a fundamental mechanism designed to keep the network stable and predictable. The Bitcoin protocol aims for a new block to be found approximately every 10 minutes. When more miners join the network and dedicate more computing power (hash rate) to finding blocks, blocks tend to be found faster than 10 minutes. To counteract this and maintain the 10-minute average, the difficulty automatically adjusts upwards. Conversely, if hash rate drops, and blocks are found too slowly, the difficulty adjusts downwards. This self-regulating mechanism ensures a consistent supply of new Bitcoin and maintains the integrity of the network. A climbing difficulty indicates a healthy, growing network with increasing participation and competition among miners. The Unprecedented Climb: A New Record for Bitcoin Mining Difficulty As of 04:42 UTC on July 12, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty experienced a substantial rise of 7.96%, pushing it to an astounding all-time high of 126.27 T. This isn’t just a slight bump; it’s a significant leap that marks a new record for the network. Data from CloverPool confirmed this impressive surge, highlighting the robust expansion of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. This record-breaking adjustment reflects a sustained increase in the computing power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin blockchain. It tells us that more miners are joining the fray, and existing miners are upgrading their equipment, all vying for the chance to earn Bitcoin rewards. This competition is a testament to the profitability and long-term appeal of crypto mining . Understanding the Bitcoin Hash Rate: The Engine Behind the Climb The direct correlation between mining difficulty and the Bitcoin hash rate cannot be overstated. Hash rate refers to the total combined computational power being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. Essentially, it’s the speed at which a miner is solving the cryptographic puzzle to find the next block. At the time of this latest difficulty adjustment, the seven-day average hash rate stood at an impressive 872.32 EH/s (Exahashes per second). To put that into perspective, an Exahash is one quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) hashes per second. This colossal amount of computing power signifies an incredibly strong and resilient network. The higher the hash rate, the more secure the network becomes against potential attacks. The surge in difficulty is a direct consequence of this booming hash rate. As more powerful machines come online and more mining farms expand, the network adjusts to ensure the block discovery rate remains consistent, reinforcing the fundamental design principles of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Crypto Mining Operations? For individual miners and large-scale crypto mining operations, a rising difficulty presents both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, it means that finding a block becomes harder, requiring more computational power and, consequently, more electricity. This can impact profitability, especially for miners with older, less efficient hardware or those operating in regions with high energy costs. Challenges for Miners: Increased Competition: More hash rate means more miners are competing for the same block rewards. Higher Energy Costs: To maintain profitability, miners must either upgrade to more energy-efficient hardware or seek out locations with cheaper electricity. Hardware Obsolescence: Older mining rigs quickly become unprofitable as newer, more powerful Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) enter the market. Opportunities for Miners: Innovation Drive: The challenge spurs innovation in mining hardware and cooling solutions. Geographic Relocation: Miners are incentivized to find optimal locations with abundant, cheap, and often renewable energy sources. Pool Mining: Smaller miners can pool their resources to increase their chances of earning rewards, sharing the proceeds proportionally. This continuous cycle of increasing difficulty and hash rate drives the professionalization and industrialization of the mining sector, making it a highly competitive and capital-intensive industry. Enhancing Network Security: A Fortress Built by Hash Power Perhaps the most significant benefit of an increasing Bitcoin mining difficulty and hash rate is the bolstering of network security . Bitcoin’s security relies on its decentralized nature and the computational power required to alter its ledger. A 51% attack, where a malicious entity gains control of more than half of the network’s hash rate, becomes exponentially harder and more expensive as the total hash rate climbs. With the hash rate at 872.32 EH/s, mounting such an attack would require an unimaginable amount of computing power and financial resources, making it practically impossible. This high level of security is fundamental to Bitcoin’s value proposition, ensuring that transactions are irreversible and the supply of Bitcoin is controlled. This inherent security, backed by a constantly growing and adjusting difficulty, instills confidence in users and investors alike, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a robust and trustworthy digital asset. It’s a testament to the strength of its underlying blockchain technology . The Future Outlook: What to Expect Next? The Bitcoin network is designed for continuous adaptation. The next difficulty adjustment is expected to occur in roughly 12 days and 8 hours. Given the current trend of increasing hash rate, it’s highly probable that we will see another upward adjustment, potentially setting yet another record. This ongoing trend indicates a healthy and expanding Bitcoin ecosystem. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the fundamental infrastructure supporting Bitcoin continues to grow stronger, attracting more participants and investments into the mining sector. For investors, a robust and secure network is a positive indicator of long-term stability and growth potential. Actionable Insights for Enthusiasts and Investors What can you take away from this monumental shift in Bitcoin mining difficulty? For Miners: Focus on efficiency. Invest in the latest ASIC technology, explore renewable energy sources, and consider joining well-established mining pools to mitigate risks and stabilize income. For Investors: Recognize that a rising difficulty and hash rate are strong indicators of network health and security. This reinforces Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and its resilience against attacks. It’s a sign of a maturing and robust blockchain technology . For Developers and Innovators: The increasing demand for efficient mining solutions opens doors for new hardware, software, and energy solutions within the crypto space. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Unyielding Strength The recent surge in Bitcoin mining difficulty to an all-time high is more than just a technical statistic; it’s a powerful statement about the enduring strength and growing adoption of the Bitcoin network. It signifies a thriving Bitcoin hash rate , a highly competitive crypto mining industry, and an unassailable level of network security , all underpinned by ingenious blockchain technology . As the network continues to expand and adapt, these adjustments serve as a constant reminder of Bitcoin’s decentralized resilience and its unwavering commitment to security and stability. This record-breaking achievement underscores Bitcoin’s position as the bedrock of the cryptocurrency world, a digital fortress growing stronger with each passing block.

2025-07-14T06:40:08,"The End of an Era: The Giant Bitcoin Whale that’s been in the Spotlight for Weeks Suddenly Disappeared – Here are the Theories","Anonymous crypto whale James Wynn, who attracted attention in the cryptocurrency market with his large transactions over the course of many weeks, has suddenly permanently closed his account on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). While the account under Wynn's username “@JamesWynnReal” is no longer accessible, the profile's last bio update before it was shut down included only one word: “broke.” According to blockchain data, only $6,580 remains in wallets identified as belonging to Wynn. However, in recent weeks, the total balance of these wallets had reached as much as $100 million. Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson made the following statement regarding Wynn's disappearance: Hyperliquid scam alert. This was likely a fake account, intended to mislead the public with false transactions. I've seen this repeatedly over the past 10 years. Be wary of accounts hiding behind aliases, anime avatars, or impersonating a famous whale. The crypto world is full of scammers, so be skeptical of everything you see. Related News: Controversial Cryptocurrency Figure Arthur Hayes Bought a Large Amount of This Altcoin During the Rally This sudden crash, which occurred after Wynn introduced himself as a “professional investor” on social media and made headlines with his large trades, has become a source of controversy among investors.

While the rest of the crypto market is enjoying a positive run, Bitcoin’s rise feels different, it’s not just going up, it’s moving up in a nearly straight line every single day. So, what exactly is driving this rally? And where could Bitcoin go next? Institutional Demand vs. Limited Supply One of the biggest reasons behind this surge is the growing demand from institutions. According to Matt Hougan, Director of Investments at Bitwise, there’s a tug-of-war between huge buying interest and extremely limited daily Bitcoin supply. To give some perspective, only 450 new Bitcoins are mined each day, but just yesterday, spot ETFs scooped up 10,000 BTC. That’s not a typo, that’s 20X more demand than supply. This imbalance is a major factor pushing prices up fast. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF Breaks Records BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT, has become a major force in the market. Last week, it hit $84 billion in assets under management, a number it reached in only 200 trading days. For comparison, it took the gold ETF (GLD) over 15 years to hit similar numbers. IBIT now holds more than 700,000 BTC, making it the largest holder by far, nearly 100,000 more than its next closest competitor. Dollar Drops, Bitcoin Climbs While interest rates are rising and the U.S. dollar has fallen by 11% in just six months, Bitcoin has surged more than $15,000 since July began. A lot of this sudden push came right after the U.S. House approved President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 3rd. For many, this signaled that big spending was here to stay, and that made Bitcoin, which many see as digital gold, look even more attractive. Geopolitical tensions are also playing a role. U.S. President Donald Trump has returned with a strong pro-crypto stance. Recently, Trump imposed 50% tariffs on copper and targeted Brazil with penalties. What’s Next for Bitcoin? Some market watchers say Bitcoin has now entered what they’re calling “crisis mode.” Meanwhile, Geoff Kendrick, head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, said Bitcoin could reach $135,000 by the end of Q3 and possibly hit $200,000 by year-end. However, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan also believes that if the current gap between strong demand and limited supply continues, Bitcoin’s price could climb toward the $200,000 mark by the end of the year.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-going-up-today/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|ZRX","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T06:00:08,"Dogecoin Returns To December 2020 Levels, Is Another 36,000% Rally Possible?","The Dogecoin price has shown a lot of promise recently after surging above the $0.2 mark with momentum over the last week. However, the price does remain very well below its all-time high of $0.7 , which means there is still a way to go for the meme coin from here. Interestingly, the meme coin’s price looks to have fallen into a trend not seen since December 2020, as highlighted by crypto analyst CryptoKaleo, showing a rising bullish trend. Dogecoin Price Returns To Levels Before 36,000% Rally In an X post, CryptoKaleo outlines the fact that the Dogecoin price has been trending similarly to where it was back in 2020. In particular, the Dogecoin price was struggling in December 2020 , but this was just before the legendary 36,000% surge that had been kick-started by billionaire Elon Musk posting about the meme coin on his X (formerly Twitter) post. Back then, the price had been struggling after its previous all-time high, following a trend line straight down. This was until it hit another upward momentum, followed by a downtrend, which marked the end of the price decline. At this point, the bottom signaled the start of the next rally. Now, once again, the Dogecoin price is beginning to mark another bottom after an initial breakdown within this trendline. According to the analyst, this puts the Dogecoin price right in the same place where it was back in December 2020. If it follows the same trend as it has been doing, then the meme coin could be getting ready to see a parabolic rally . From the analyst’s chart, the $1 mark is a no-brainer, with a possible top being as high as $2.4 before the trend is completed. Can The DOGE Price Rally 36,000% Again? The last time that the Dogecoin price broke out of this trend , it ended up rallying by 36,000% over the next few months. This opens up the possibility that a similar rally could be in the cards. However, multiple developments over the last few years suggest that this is not possible.

As interest in digital assets soars, a new study reveals where the most promising crypto careers are taking shape, and which countries offer the best mix of pay, opportunity and regulation. A recent Taurex study shows the US tops the list, cementing its role as the world’s largest crypto ecosystem. With 292 active job listings and an average salary of $148,100, crypto careers in the US now rival some of the best-paying roles in traditional finance. The country is also home to 170 crypto companies, reflecting a well-established infrastructure and supportive policy environment. UAE Leads in Crypto Ownership, India in Company Count and User Base Trailing just behind, the United Arab Emirates has carved out a stronghold of its own. The UAE not only offers the second-highest average salary at $111,483, but also boasts the highest Bitcoin ownership rate globally, at 27%. Online search interest in crypto jobs remains strong, displaying its appeal to both domestic and international talent. Image Source: Taurex India ranks third, driven by sheer scale. It hosts 173 crypto companies, the most of any country, and has the world’s largest number of Bitcoin owners by headcount. While average salaries trail behind at $83,687, India’s growing talent pool and expanding startup ecosystem make it a key player in the space.

2025-07-14T05:57:08,"Can Donald Trump Remove Fed Chairman Jerome Powell? He May Have Found a Way","The possibility of US President Donald Trump dismissing Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been raised again. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said today that Trump may fire Powell due to cost overruns on the Fed's headquarters renovation project. It's well known that the Trump administration has been pressuring Powell to cut interest rates for a long time. This pressure has fueled concerns about the Fed's independence, and the mere possibility of Powell's dismissal has previously significantly shaken markets. Indeed, earlier this year, even such a rumor triggered a rise in interest rates and a sell-off in the markets. Although Trump said last Friday that he would not fire Powell, Hassett's statements indicated that the possibility could be on the table again. Related News: Bitcoin's Weekend Breakout: Price Breaks All-Time High Record Again - Here's What We Know The White House has ratcheted up the pressure by alleging a $700 million budget overrun on the Fed's Washington headquarters renovation project. On July 10, Office of Budget and Management Director Russ Vought sent a letter to Powell, questioning the project and requesting clarification on its legality. Vought's letter gives Powell seven business days to respond, which falls at the end of this week and could give Trump the opportunity to take action before the next Fed meeting begins on July 29. Speaking to ABC, Hassett said, “Whether the president will pursue this path depends on the Fed's response.” When asked whether Trump could fire Powell, Hassett said, “That's under review, but if there's a justification, yes, he could.” Jerome Powell's term expires in May. Meanwhile, speculation that Hassett could succeed Powell is gaining traction. Economic circles consider Hassett, one of the most influential figures in the White House, a strong candidate. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-14T05:51:35,"Satoshi Nakamoto’s Wealth Soars to $132.8B as Bitcoin Hits $120K, Becoming 11th Richest","Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has vaulted into the ranks of the world’s wealthiest individuals as Bitcoin surged past $120,000 on Sunday. Key Takeaways: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth over $132.8 billion. Analysts predict Nakamoto could rise to second richest by 2026 if Bitcoin grows at its historical rate. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham estimates Nakamoto holds roughly 1.096 million BTC spread across thousands of wallets, valued at over $132.8 billion at current prices. The staggering fortune theoretically places Nakamoto at 11th on Forbes’ billionaire list, overtaking tech magnate Michael Dell, whose net worth sits at $125.1 billion. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Rise to Continue Analysts believe Nakamoto’s rise may continue. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted in early June that if Bitcoin maintains its typical 50% annual growth, Nakamoto could reach second place on the billionaire list by 2026. Balchunas highlighted the founder’s decision never to cash out, comparing Nakamoto to legendary investor Jack Bogle, who amassed a modest fortune despite revolutionizing the investment world. If bitcoin does its normal 50%/ann then Satoshi will pass Buffett this year and Zuck sometime next year-ish to be #2 richest in world (Elon has huge lead). It's fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in. It echoes Jack Bogle in that regard https://t.co/tu9MRzUD5h — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 2, 2025 Compared to other large Bitcoin holders, Nakamoto’s stash is unmatched. Corporations and custodians collectively hold about 847,000 BTC, or roughly 4% of Bitcoin’s capped supply. Notable individual holders include the Winklevoss twins with around 70,000 BTC, venture capitalist Tim Draper with about 30,000 BTC purchased at a 2014 auction, and Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, who reportedly holds close to 18,000 BTC privately. Notably, Forbes’ rankings exclude cryptocurrency holdings, focusing instead on publicly verifiable assets like stocks. Despite Bitcoin’s historic climb, Nakamoto still trails behind the likes of Elon Musk, who leads the list with an estimated $404 billion fortune. For Nakamoto to claim the top spot, Bitcoin would need to jump approximately 208% to around $370,000, assuming the wealth of other billionaires remains unchanged. The price leap would propel Nakamoto ahead of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who hold fortunes of $274 billion each. $20K Bitcoin Sent to Satoshi’s Wallet Last month, an unknown wallet transferred $20,000 worth of Bitcoin to Nakamoto’s Genesis Block address, marking the largest movement to the Bitcoin creator’s wallet in four months. Analysts from Arkham Intelligence said the transaction may have been either an accidental exchange withdrawal or a deliberate tribute from an early Bitcoin supporter honoring Nakamoto. The recent transfer follows a pattern of periodic large donations to Satoshi’s wallets, often linked to exchange withdrawals. Historical data shows transfers ranging from thousands to over a million dollars over the years. The dormant wallets now hold approximately $117 billion in Bitcoin, untouched since Nakamoto vanished in 2011, and any significant movement from these addresses would likely cause major market upheaval. Amid this activity, speculation over Satoshi’s true identity has intensified. Researchers have recently pointed to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as a potential candidate based on circumstantial evidence, while fraud claims by Craig Wright were dismissed in court.

2025-07-14T05:39:39,"Bearish Bitcoin Trader Loses $92M as Surge Wipes Out $426M in Short Liquidations","More than $680 million in crypto positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours with short traders taking the bulk of the pain as a bitcoin (BTC) breakout above $121,000 triggered a chain reaction across derivatives markets. Roughly $426 million of the total liquidations came from bearish bets, according to Coinglass data, making it one of the largest weekend liquidation events in recent months. The largest single order, a $92.5 million BTC short, was flushed on HTX. BTC alone saw $291 million in forced closures, with futures tracking ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP) following at $68 million and $17 million, respectively. XLM (XLM) and pepecoin (PEPE) also posted elevated activity, signaling that the squeeze extended deep beyond major tokens. Meanwhile, dogecoin (DOGE), Solana's SOL (SOL), and SUI (SUI) saw rising open interest, though with relatively smaller drawdowns, indicative of higher spot-based demand. Liquidations occur when traders using leverage are forced to close their positions due to margin calls. While they often signal excessive positioning, they also serve as a reset mechanism for markets, flushing weak hands and clearing the way for new directional flow.

2025-07-14T05:30:53,"Bitcoin Price Crash Possible As Correction Sentiment Takes Hold — $110,000 Next?","After hitting a new all-time high of $121,400, the Bitcoin price has started consolidating once again, although the support continues to hold. This is not out of the ordinary, as pullbacks after a major rally are quite common and could be the cool-off needed the uptrend to continue. However, while the $117,000 support has held nicely, it is possible that a deeper correction could be in the cards for the cryptocurrency before the price takes off again. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Could Begin With the hit to new all-time highs, the weekend brought a slowdown, and this could drive the next wave of correction. Crypto analyst TehThomas explains this in a TradingView post that suggests that there is still the possibility of a short-term correction for the Bitcoin price. However, it could go deeper than expected as the price moves to retest newly formed support at $109,000 and $110,000. Related Reading: Ripple’s $21 Trillion Dream: What Capturing 20% Of SWIFT Volume Means For XRP According to the analyst, the new peaks have plunged the Bitcoin price into uncharted territory, and there would be a new wave of sells from here. Given this, the analyst advices caution as investors engage with the market and the possibility of a deeper correction arises. Furthermore, there is the formation of an ascending trendline that formed with the horizontal support. Since the trendline moves through the $111,000-$113,000 area, it suggests that the price could fall back downward to retest this level. In the case of a deeper correction, then the analyst sees a price sweep into the $110,000 levels to take out liquidity. However, this sweep would be inherently bullish since the retest would provide a bounce-off point that could lead to a “more sustainable” breakout toward all-time highs. Bullish Prospects Still At Large For BTC While the possibility of a sweep down to former peak levels remains high, it is also possible that the price does not break down and instead continues its upward trajectory. Looking back at the ascending trendline, the analyst points out that it is possible that the price does hold the trendline, reducing the impact of the correction. Such a shallow correction would indicate a continuation without a deeper correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stalls After Rally: Will It Blast Through $125,000 Or Slip Back To $110K? In this case, the Bitcoin price could resume the uptrend with the $120,000-$125,000 targets in mind. Thus, any deep correction would be expected to begin at much higher price levels. “Bitcoin is currently in price discovery, which means the structure must guide our expectations. A retest of either the trendline or former resistance could provide the next best entry,” TehThomas explained. Regardless of what the case may be, the analyst believes that as long as the price remains above the $110,000 support, then it is inherently bullish.

2025-07-14T05:30:00,"Blockware Predicts 36 More Firms Will Buy Bitcoin in 2025","Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, continues to dominate this trend, now holding over 597,000 BTC. While other companies are also expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, concerns are rising about the long-term sustainability of this debt-fueled strategy. Critics, including analysts from Glassnode and Breed, warn that many Bitcoin-heavy companies could face a “death spiral” during downturns. Meanwhile, partnerships like Animoca Brands and DDC suggest that there are broader corporate strategies to extract yield from BTC. Companies Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation Public company interest in Bitcoin is gaining a lot of momentum, and Blockware Intelligence forecasts that at least 36 additional firms will adopt the cryptocurrency by the end of 2025. This projected increase would represent a 25% rise from the current 141 public companies holding Bitcoin. According to Blockware’s Q3 2025 market update , the adoption rate among public companies already surged 120% this year, thanks to Bitcoin’s growing role as a strategic treasury asset. The firm describes these Bitcoin Treasury Companies as a vital bridge linking equity and debt markets with digital assets. Rise of Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: Blockware ) Michael Saylor’s Strategy dominates corporate Bitcoin holdings with 597,325 BTC, dwarfing MARA Holdings’ 50,000 BTC. However, Blockware pointed out that the newest entrants into the Bitcoin treasury space are largely either nascent startups or companies facing financial difficulties. The firm argues that for businesses with low growth prospects or declining core operations, allocating earnings to Bitcoin can be a more straightforward path to generating 40–60% compound annual growth rates than trying to revitalize their existing models. While Blockware is still bullish about its belief that securitized Bitcoin exposure is becoming a permanent fixture in the financial landscape, some analysts are not so sure. James Check of Glassnode believes the easy gains from this strategy may already be fading and doubts the long-term viability of Bitcoin-heavy treasuries. Similarly, venture capital firm Breed warned that only a small number of these companies are likely to avoid the so-called “death spiral,” which is a phenomenon where firms that trade near their net asset value struggle to raise capital as market premiums erode. Crypto trader Saint Pump has similar concerns, and suggested that Bitcoin treasury firms may exacerbate the next bear market, particularly when net asset value premiums shrink and capital raises begin to falter. Despite the different views, data from Bitwise Asset Management reveals that corporate Bitcoin accumulation hit a record high in Q2 of 2025, with 159,107 BTC added during the period. Whether this trend is the beginning of a new corporate asset strategy or a short-lived experiment remains to be seen. Animoca Partners with DDC for Bitcoin Strategy Web3 powerhouse Animoca Brands entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding with DayDayCook (DDC) Enterprise to manage its Bitcoin holdings and generate yield on up to $100 million worth of BTC. The deal is part of the growing trend among companies to seek strategic ways of leveraging their crypto reserves, particularly thanks to Bitcoin’s rising status as a corporate treasury asset. Partnership advantages (Source: Press release ) DDC Enterprise is a meal-prep and packaged food company that recently embraced a Bitcoin treasury strategy. It revealed in May that it plans to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years. It began its journey with the purchase of 21 BTC that same month. Now, the company is taking a step further by partnering with Animoca to help manage and potentially grow the digital wealth under its oversight. Animoca Brands co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu pointed to DDC’s CEO Norma Chu as a key reason behind the partnership. Siu appreciates Chu’s ability to appeal to a broad, non-crypto audience, which will help bridge the gap between traditional consumers and the world of digital assets. He also believes her unique ability to navigate both Western and Eastern markets is crucial given the prominence of China in the global crypto adoption landscape. The partnership was made during a time of renewed optimism around Bitcoin as a treasury reserve. Some well known people in the industry like Blockstream CEO Adam Back declared that corporate BTC strategies could become the new ”altseason” for traders. In a recent post on X, Back urged investors to shift focus from altcoins to BTC or corporate treasuries holding BTC. Strategy Resumes Bitcoin Buying Meanwhile, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor announced that the company will resume Bitcoin purchases after a brief pause last week. The move follows a $4.2 billion capital raise and ends a 12-week streak of continuous BTC accumulation. Strategy’s last buy was on June 30, when it bought 4,980 BTC for $532 million, bringing its total holdings to 597,325 BTC. This is valued at over $70.9 billion. With shares trading at $434 and up 16% this month, Strategy is still below its all-time high of $543 from November of 2024. The company is part of the broader trend where firms are acquiring BTC at a pace faster than it is mined, fueling talk of a looming supply shock. However, some analysts warn this debt-driven buying spree could pose risks to market stability. Author Adam Livingston explained that Strategy’s aggressive accumulation has been averaging over 2,000 BTC per day, This outpaced the monthly production of all miners, which stands at around 13,500 BTC. He described the firm’s actions as a “synthetic halving,” and suggested that Strategy could soon emerge as a dominant financial force in the Bitcoin economy.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9919/blockware-predicts-36-more-firms-will-buy-bitcoin-in-2025,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

That momentum has continued into a new week, which should be laden with bullish announcements for the industry in the United States. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView ‘Crypto Week’ Begins The United States House has designated July 14 to 18 as “Crypto Week,” with three key industry bills up for review. These are the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulations, the CLARITY Act governing a clear crypto framework, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Observers have also speculated that there may be an announcement on a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Other analysts have suggested that Donald Trump’s spending bill (the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) and a surge in fiscal deficit will propel Bitcoin to new highs. “The biggest macro driver is the passing of Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill (BBB), a massive fiscal stimulus package signaling looser policy ahead,” said Derive founder, Nick Forster, in a note shared with investors. With a $2.4 trillion market capitalization, Bitcoin is now larger than Amazon, observed analyst Joe Consorti. $1.3 BILLION IN SHORTS were liquidated in less than 60 seconds. Bitcoin skipped straight past $120k and went directly to $121k. At $2.39 trillion, Bitcoin is now officially larger than Amazon, and is the world’s 5th largest asset. Remember this day. pic.twitter.com/CuZ9wQI32v — Joe Consorti (@JoeConsorti) July 14, 2025 “Breaking new highs was liquidation driven… ie, investors were neutral… this is now flipping bullish,” opined analyst Willy Woo on Sunday, who added that this rally has plenty more room to go. “Bitcoin is the only technology I am aware of that can solve the universal problem of currency debasement shared by billions of people in our modern world,” commented crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano. RWA Leading the Way CoinGecko reported that real-world asset tokenization is today’s top-performing category , up 13% and outpacing meme coins and AI tokens. Chainlink, Avalanche, Ondo Finance, and Algorand were all outperforming the broader market at the time of writing. While Ethereum’s gains were muted, the asset climbed to its highest level since early February, reaching $3,050 at the time of writing.

2025-07-14T05:25:17,"Bitcoin, Ether Traders Bet Big With Tuesday's U.S. Inflation Data Seen as Non-Event","Traders are betting big on bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as the BTC rally rages on, and observers downplay Tuesday's U.S. inflation data as a potential barrier for the bull. BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, rose to record highs above $121,000 during Monday's Asian trading hours, representing a 2.7% gain on a 24-hour basis. The new high took the year-to-date gain to nearly 30%, with prices up 13% this month alone, according to CoinDesk data. Ether followed suit, rising 3% to near $3,050, and other major coins such as XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), BNB (BNB), and Solana's SOL (SOL)boasted 3% to 5% gains. Activity on the leading decentralized options platform Derive backed the bullish price action, with significant open interest concentrated in the $130,000 call option. ""Almost 20% of the open interest on Derive’s Sept 26 expiry for BTC is concentrated at the $130K call, suggesting traders expect gradual but persistent price rises over the next three months,"" Nick Forster, founder at Derive, said. In ETH's case, 45% of ETH’s open interest on the July 18 expiry is concentrated in the $3,400 strike, with that one strike making up 16% of ETH weekend volume, Forester explained, calling that a sign of traders expecting a breakout in the second-largest cryptocurrency. ""While volatility remains moderate compared to 2020-21, directional conviction is growing, especially in ETH. We’re watching closely for confirmation of this trend over the coming week,"" Forster noted. Options listed on centralized giant Deribit painted a similar bullish picture for bitcoin and ether, with calls or bullish bets trading pricier than puts across tenors. Inflation a non-event The main event of this week's macro calendar is the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation data due Tuesday. According to FactSet , the June CPI is forecast to have risen 0.23% on the month, amounting to a 2.6% annualized growth, up from May's 2.4%. The annualized core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, likely rose 3%. Both traditional and crypto market investors have closely watched it for the past four years, as it heavily influences the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. However, this time, the crypto market may not be impacted, according to the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub. They believe fiscal profligacy, a rising global money supply, and a soft U.S. dollar are driving the ongoing bull market and not the Fed rate cuts story. ""We don’t think it matters. We’re still in a 'Goldilocks' macro environment with a slowing, not collapsing US economy and whilst inflation remains a little sticky, it’s not accelerating to a point that would change the direction of travel at the Fed from rate cuts to hikes. Meanwhile, the weaker dollar continues to feed into easy financial conditions and is helping facilitate the expansion in global money supply,"" the founders told CoinDesk. They added that with the Trump administration doing a complete 180 on deficit reduction, we are back running the fiscal dominance playbook of the Biden era."" Moreover, President Donald Trump's big beautiful tax bill, which recently passed in Congress, is projected to add over $3 trillion to the already record-high national debt over time. ""So the drivers for risk and bitcoin are currently not dominated by expectations for Fed rate cuts, but this fiscal dominance story, rising global money supply, alongside a softer dollar. Therefore, Sensitivity to the Fed and, by extension, the CPI data is much reduced,"" the founders told CoinDesk. Crypto week and corporate adoption This week, dubbed as the 'Crypto Week' by the Trump administration, could see the House of Representatives debate several crypto bills, including the Genius Act, Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Positive developments on these fronts are likely to insulate bitcoin and the wider crypto market from macro developments. The relentless corporate adoption of bitcoin also helps. ""The bitcoin market is moving quite strongly due to demand from my corporate treasuries and associated speculation. In addition, this week has been dubbed 'crypto week' by the Trump administration. I expect positive news to come from this. I think the inflation numbers, so long as they are somewhere in the range of normal, will have little impact on bitcoin,"" Alexander Blume, CEO at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, told CoinDesk. ""One, the bitcoin market is moving independently of the broader economy. Two, the increasing perception of the FED as politicized blunts the impact these numbers have on rate cuts anyway,"" Blume added.

2025-07-14T05:21:45,"Bitcoin shatters $120K in historic rally as US prepares landmark crypto legislation","Bitcoin has once again surged into uncharted territory, smashing through the $120,000 level for the first time on Monday. This major milestone for the world’s largest cryptocurrency comes as investors bet on a series of long-sought policy victories for the digital asset industry, with the US House of Representatives set to debate crucial regulatory legislation this week. Expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment in the US helped propel Bitcoin to yet another record high, reaching $121,207.55 during the Asian trading session on Monday. It was last seen trading 1.5% higher at $120,856.34. This surge marks an impressive 29% gain for Bitcoin year-to-date and has sparked a broader rally across the cryptocurrency market over the past few weeks, seemingly undeterred by the chaos of President Donald Trump’s global tariff policies. The optimism was not confined to Bitcoin. Ether (ETH), the second-largest token by market value, scaled an over five-month peak of $3,048.23 on Monday, last standing at $3,036.24. The sector’s total market value has now swelled to approximately $3.78 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap, reflecting a significant influx of capital and renewed investor confidence. The Washington effect: regulation and a ‘crypto president’ A key driver behind the current bullish sentiment is the legislative action taking place in Washington DC. Starting this week, the US House of Representatives will begin debating a series of bills designed to provide the digital asset industry with the comprehensive national regulatory framework it has long demanded. These legislative efforts have found a powerful ally in US President Donald Trump, who has styled himself as the “crypto president” and has urged policymakers to revamp existing rules in favor of the industry’s growth and innovation. While Bitcoin’s inherent volatility makes predicting its next price move effectively impossible, several factors could contribute to it reaching even greater heights in the second half of the year: A favorable regulatory shift: The Trump administration has, so far, been beneficial for the cryptocurrency market. President Trump’s appointee for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, Paul Atkins, has stated that the SEC should prioritize advancing innovation in the marketplace. Under his leadership, the SEC has notably dropped multiple crypto-related lawsuits, including high-profile cases against Coinbase, Binance, and Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. The US strategic Bitcoin reserve: In a significant move that validated Bitcoin at a national level, President Trump signed an executive order in March 2025 to begin the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a formal stockpile of the Bitcoin owned by the US government. Following this federal lead, states like Arizona and New Hampshire have also passed legislation to create their own state-level Bitcoin reserves. The GENIUS Act for stablecoins: Later this year, we could see the final passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill specifically designed to regulate the stablecoin industry. The U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill on June 17, and a House vote is next on the agenda. Although the GENIUS Act doesn’t directly involve Bitcoin, any major, well-defined crypto regulation is widely seen as helping the industry gain legitimacy and attract a new wave of investors. The power of ETFs: unlocking mainstream capital Another critical factor fueling Bitcoin’s ascent is the continued success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The first of these products received SEC approval in January 2024, a landmark decision that made Bitcoin significantly more accessible to both institutional and retail investors through traditional brokerage accounts. Since a surge in investments began in April, these Bitcoin ETFs have seen remarkable growth. As of July 10, they had crossed the $50 billion mark in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. While these inflows and outflows can fluctuate, Bitcoin’s excellent performance this year is expected to help it continue to draw strong interest from investors looking for exposure to the asset class. Underscoring this optimism, British bank Standard Chartered has predicted that Bitcoin will reach a price of $200,000 by the end of the year, and that continued ETF inflows will be a significant driver of this growth.

2025-07-14T05:10:10,"Bitcoin (BTC) Rebounds, New ATH Arrives! Will the Rise Continue? Analysts Explain!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week with a new record high. The price of BTC surpassed $120,000 for the first time in its history. According to Binance data, BTC briefly broke above $121,000, setting a new record. It is currently up 2.8%, reaching $121,500. While the main reasons for the rise in Bitcoin prices were seen as the continued institutional demand in the US and positive legal developments, this rise was also accompanied by Ethereum and altcoins. Ethereum (ETH) surpassed $3,000, while altcoins like XRP, Solana, and SUI also made significant gains. According to the data, ALGO, PENGU and HBAR were the altcoins that experienced the most increases in the last 24 hours. Analysts expect the rise in Bitcoin to continue during the highly anticipated 'Crypto Week' in the US, where significant developments are expected. Speaking to The Block, BTC Markets Crypto Analyst Rachael Lucas said that institutional demand is on the rise and that she expects the rise to continue. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and it's not happening alone. There's real momentum behind this rise, with ETF inflows exceeding $1 billion daily and total assets under management exceeding $150 billion. This means over 6% of the total Bitcoin market capitalization is currently held in ETFs, demonstrating institutional conviction. Bitcoin also benefited from entering what's being called “Crypto Week” in the US. This week, key crypto proposals that are generating market momentum, such as the CLARITY Act or the GENIUS Act, will be discussed, and significant progress is expected. What's Next for Bitcoin? Expecting this rise in Bitcoin to continue, Lucas stated that BTC's next target will be $125,000 and above. “Bitcoin's rise above $120,000 opens the door to $125,000-128,000 in the near term. “If ETF demand persists and macro conditions remain supportive, especially with the return of US interest rate cuts, we could see Bitcoin rally even higher in Q3.” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange BTSE, also predicted that long-term institutional buyers could push Bitcoin to $125,000 in the next month or two. Ledn CEO John Glover said that the BTC rally will continue and prices could rise to $136,000 by the end of the year. *This is not investment advice.

CEO Simon Gerovich said that the company has purchased an additional 797 Bitcoin for approximately $93.6 million for an average price of around $117,451. “As of 14 July, we hold 16,352 BTC acquired for $1.64 billion at $100,191 per Bitcoin,” he wrote on X. Metaplanet has acquired 797 BTC for ~$93.6 million at ~$117,451 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 435.9% YTD 2025. As of 7/14/2025, we hold 16,352 $BTC acquired for ~$1.64 billion at ~$100,191 per bitcoin. $MTPLF pic.twitter.com/zFSH0WIima — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) July 14, 2025 The Japanese listed investment firm has achieved BTC Yield of 435.9% from the start of the year to now, he added. Metaplanet uses BTC Yield to assess the performance of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which is intended to be accretive to shareholders, the Monday announcement read. Starting December 2024, Bitcoin treasury operations has become Metaplanet’s official business line. The company has strategically increased its total Bitcoin holdings through acquisitions funded by capital market activities and operating income. Metaplanet’s Sole Focus on BTC Accumulation – Is 210,000 BTC by 2027 Possible? As the Bitcoin treasury space grows and matures, it’s worth paying attention to possible divergences between Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its imitators. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings do not produce cash flow, and as a result, it needs to take loans out on it. The more interest rates on BTC-backed loans drop over time, the better it is for Metaplanet. Further, the firm is aiming for a stash of 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027: in other words, Metaplanet wants to multiply its current holdings by more than 13. Though this might seem like a tall order, it is less than half of Strategy’s current 597,325 BTC stash . Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, told Cryptonews that corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin “shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions.” “It is vital to remember that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet represent high-conviction outliers, headline grabbers with bold strategies that align with their unique business aims,” he said over email. “For most, a more measured approach will be better suited. One grounded in long-term belief, not short-term reliance on volatility.” Last week, Metaplanet purchased 2,205 more Bitcoins , adding to its aggressive Bitcoin buying spree. It has expanded its holdings from under 4,000 Bitcoin in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, quadrupling its position in just four months.

2025-07-14T04:45:39,"Bitcoin Knocking on the ATH Again—After Breaking $121,800, Here’s Where it May Head To!","The post Bitcoin Knocking on the ATH Again—After Breaking $121,800, Here’s Where it May Head To! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the 2024 breakout, the Bitcoin price has maintained a consistent trend. It has been forming consecutive higher highs and lows, signaling the bulls holding a significant dominance. Although the bears hindered the progress of the rally at frequent intervals, from a larger perspective, it remained within a strong bullish range. Now that the BTC price broke out above $121,800, the question arises: how high can the Bitcoin price go in the next few days? Huge Short Liquidations Crypto liquidation refers to the process of forcibly closing the trader’s positions in the market. The short positions increase when the traders bet largely on the price falling in the near future. However, when the token goes against the bet, the ‘forced liquidation’ occurs after hitting the set threshold levels set by them. This further pushes the price higher, which has been witnessed in the current breakout, as more than $200 million in shorts were liquidated in the past couple of hours. As per the data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, nearly $289 million worth of shorts were liquidated, of which $205 million were liquidated in the past hour. Nearly 110,000 traders were liquidated, with the single largest liquidation worth $95 million. The price has surged above all of the liquidation levels, which suggests there are no barriers to hinder the BTC bull run. Open Interest Smashed ATH Open interest (OI) is a crucial indicator that describes the mindset of the traders dealing in futures or options. It is nothing but the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts in the market. It indicates the amount of money invested in Bitcoin derivatives at any given time. The rise and fall in these levels highly impact the spot prices, which closely follow them. The BTC OI has now reached the highest ever levels, which point towards a massive rise in the traders’ optimism. The OI has been on the rise since the second quarter of 2024, which further exploded during the Q4 breakout. Ever since the BTC price has broken the psychological barrier at $100K, the OI has seen an exceptional rise, which has now marked a new ATH at $84.68 billion. Interestingly, the levels continue to rise, which suggests the traders are extremely bullish on Bitcoin and hence the price is set to rise high. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Rally? How High Can it Go? Bitcoin price smashed a new ATH at $121,209.01, a few moments ago after closing one of the highest weekly closes ever. With this, the momentum was already extremely bullish, which has kept the price above the $120,000 threshold. With this, the bullish continuation seems to be validated and hence the BTC price may remain elevated for the rest of 2025. A popular analyst, Ali , shares the chart of BTC, which displays the recent highs of Bitcoin when it reached the highest bands. MVRV pricing bands. Considering these bands, the next highs are expected to be somewhere around $127,000. However, it would be interesting to see how the price behaves after reaching these levels, as the rally witnessed a correction previously. With the recent rise, Bitcoin has now become the 5th largest asset, surpassing the giants like Amazon, Silver and Alphabet (Google). On the other hand, the institutions continue to accumulate BTC while their unrealized profits are in the billions. This suggests the Bitcoin bull run is being reinstituted, and hence a slow yet sustained rally may elevate the levels to new highs.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-knocking-on-the-ath-again-after-breaking-121800-heres-where-it-may-head-to/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T04:09:38,"BOE Governor Cites Threats to Financial Stability Over Private Stablecoin Issuance","The Bank of England (BOE) governor, Andrew Bailey, has expressed concerns over the rise of banks issuing their own stablecoins. He emphasized the significant systemic risks that these stablecoins pose to the financial system. In an interview with The Sunday Times , Bailey said he “would much rather” prefer tokenized bank deposits over private stablecoins. He said that stablecoins would take “money out of the banking system” and the “credit creation world”. By advocating for tokenized bank deposits, Bailey is promoting a more integrated and regulated digital financial system, aligning with existing banking practices. “I would much rather [banks] go down the tokenized deposit streets and say, how do we digitize our money, particularly in payments,” he noted. His comments come at a time when stablecoin markets have grown from $125 billion less than two years ago to around $255 billion today, according to a latest BIS report . UK Would Not Adopt CBDC, Bailey Disagrees With the US and ECB’s Crypto Take Furthermore, the British central banker stated that England should not adopt a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ), also known as a ‘digital pound.’ He said that it would be “sensible” for the UK to rather work towards digitizing deposits. Andrew Bailey was recently appointed as the new chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international financial regulator. Additionally, he openly disagreed with the Trump administration’s backing of stablecoins. “I would say that the US is going towards stablecoins. The European Central Bank is going towards central bank digital currency. Neither of them is going towards tokenising deposits.” Trump Poised for Quick Stablecoin Win The US House Financial Services Committee announced ‘Crypto Week,’ starting Monday, to consider three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. The US lawmakers noted that mid-July will be 'Crypto Week' to create a clear regulatory framework for digital assets and protect financial privacy. #USLawmakers #CryptoWeek #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/yhbiz4tMwr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 4, 2025 In June, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a speech at the White House Digital Asset Summit that stablecoins would “reinforce dollar supremacy.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also emphasized the need for stablecoin regulation , noting the importance of protecting consumers. However, according to BOE’s governor Bailey, stablecoins need to be looked at closely through lens. “Stablecoins are proposed to have the characteristics of money. That money is a medium of exchange. Therefore, they really do have to have the characteristics of money and they have to maintain their nominal value.” He also expressed concerns that the spread of stablecoins would undermine their sovereign control over money. Besides stablecoins, Bailey noted that the extreme volatility of Bitcoin shows that it is “unbacked asset.” “It’s not money, it doesn’t have the function of money, and if you’re going to buy it, please buy it with your eyes open,” he advised users.
