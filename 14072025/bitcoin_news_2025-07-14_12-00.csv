2025-07-14T09:57:42,"Crypto markets set Bitcoin’s next record high after BTC clinches $123,000 ATH","Sentiments across the cryptocurrency market remain elevated on the bullish side after Bitcoin ( BTC ) reached an all-time high of over $123,000. To this end, prediction markets are suggesting that the maiden cryptocurrency is likely to see more upside in the coming months. Specifically, traders on cryptocurrency betting platform Polymarket see an 84% chance that BTC will reach at least $130,000, the highest-probability outcome, according to the latest data retrieved by Finbold on July 13. The next most likely level is $150,000, with a 53% chance. Beyond that, optimism wanes but remains notable, with a 20% probability that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 and a 10% chance of surpassing $250,000. At the extreme end, the platform assigns a 3% chance that Bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2025. Bitcoin price prediction for end of 2025. Source: Polymarket Meanwhile, some traders are hedging for a potential correction, as lower price targets like $70,000 (13%), $50,000 (8%), and $20,000 (2%) remain on the board, though each has seen a slight decline in likelihood in the aftermath of Bitcoin’s new record high. Why Bitcoin is breaking out It’s worth noting that several factors drove the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency market rally. The asset’s valuation received a major boost following continued institutional inflows after Japan’s Metaplanet snapped up 797 BTC worth $93.6 million on July 14, as part of its plan to hold 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply by 2027. 🇯🇵JUST IN: Metaplanet acquires 797 more $BTC , bringing total holdings to 16,352 BTC.

Finally, macroeconomic trends have added momentum to Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. Investors are turning to the asset amid a weakening U.S. dollar, which has declined by 11% over the past six months, and renewed geopolitical tensions triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and sanctions threats. These factors have seen investors view Bitcoin as a potential safe-haven asset.

On this note, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) stands at 74, entering the overbought zone and signaling a possible retracement in valuation or consolidation.

2025-07-14T09:54:23,"Bitcoin Beats Gold as 2025’s Top Asset with $123K Price Breakout","The post Bitcoin Beats Gold as 2025’s Top Asset with $123K Price Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has officially taken the top spot this year, climbing past $123,000 and logging its highest-ever weekly close at $119,500. With a 30% gain so far in 2025, it has now outperformed gold, which is up around 27%. That’s a big moment for crypto. But it’s also raising some serious questions. According to Charlie Bilello, Chief Market Strategist at Creative Planning, this is the first time Bitcoin and gold are the top two assets in any calendar year. “We’ve never seen these two in the number one and number two spots,” he noted. When Bitcoin and gold lead the markets, it usually means something else is going on. A $15K Jump Since July 3: What Triggered It? Bitcoin’s latest rally started after the U.S. passed the “big beautiful bill” on July 3, adding nearly $15,000 to its price in just days. But the real driver behind this move is deeper. Investors are reacting to a mix of high U.S. interest rates, a weakening dollar, delayed tariffs, and rising geopolitical tensions. In the last six months: The dollar index (DXY) dropped by 11% The U.S. deficit hit a record $316 billion in May And tensions with countries like Iran have led to fresh military strikes It’s not a classic bull run. It’s what some are calling “crisis mode.” That’s how The Kobeissi Letter described it and the signs seem to back that up. What Bitcoin and Gold’s Rise Says About the Economy Both Bitcoin and gold are considered unproductive assets – meaning they don’t generate income like stocks or real estate. When these assets outperform, it often reflects fear, not confidence. Bilello pointed out that this kind of rally doesn’t usually happen in a strong economy. Instead, it shows that investors are pulling out of traditional markets and moving their money somewhere safer. Bitcoin or Gold? Here’s Where Investors Are Turning Now Bitcoin has often been compared to gold with strong arguments made for both. Now, Bitcoin seems to be performing better and becoming the go-to choice in times of uncertainty. But here’s the key takeaway: both are rising because people are worried. That’s the signal behind the surge. And right now, that picture shows investors preparing for more rough weather ahead.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-beats-gold-as-2025s-top-asset-with-123k-price-breakout/,"BTC|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T09:49:03,"XRP Price Prediction For July 14","The post XRP Price Prediction For July 14 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is on a roll, with Bitcoin breaking past $122,000 and altcoins, including XRP, starting to rally. XRP is showing a strong bullish trend as it attempts another breakout above critical resistance levels. Currently trading near $3, XRP is approaching a key pivot around the $3.10 to $3.40 range, a zone that previously triggered sharp rejections. A concern is the lack of strong spot volume behind this recent move, much of the push higher has been fueled by leverage and short squeezes, especially following similar moves in Bitcoin. If the token manages to break through and hold above this zone, it could confirm a bullish wave structure, possibly pushing prices toward $3.84, $4.33, and even $5.00 in the coming weeks. From a technical standpoint, XRP appears to be forming a diagonal bullish structure, with strong support between $2.46 and $2.76. If bulls maintain control above this level, XRP could see an extended third wave rally. Fibonacci extensions show possible targets at $3.84, $4.72, and eventually $5.00, should the rally gain strength. However, experts stress that a decisive breakout above $3.40 is important to confirm the next leg up. Some bearish divergences have also appeared on higher time frames. With major U.S. inflation data (CPI) due out tomorrow, overall market volatility is expected to rise, which could impact XRP’s next move. Unusually, Bitcoin dominance remains strong even as altcoins rally, which is seen as a bullish signal for the entire crypto market. If this liquidity continues to build, more capital will rotate from Bitcoin into major altcoins like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-july-14/,"TRADING|XRP|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Here Are the Details","Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” a book on financial freedom and investing known for his famous book, “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” described Bitcoin surpassing $120,000 as a major gain for existing investors in a social media post. However, he emphasized that those who haven't yet invested are about to miss out on this opportunity. Robert Kiyosaki: “Bitcoin Exceeds $120,000, Those Who Don't Act Are Missing the Opportunity” Kiyosaki stated that he would buy another Bitcoin, but he wouldn't buy more until the global economy's direction became clearer. He also issued a warning to investors: “Those who are greedy often lose in the market.” Addressing those who haven't yet invested in Bitcoin, Kiyosaki emphasized that large sums of money aren't necessary to get started, saying, “You can even start with one Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC).” Encouraging small investors with this advice, Kiyosaki stated that gradual accumulation over time makes more sense. Kiyosaki also noted in his post that famed investor Warren Buffett currently has $350 billion in cash reserves. He believes Buffett is likely looking for opportunities to buy high-quality assets cheaply after a global market correction or crash. Robert Kiyosaki has long expressed his belief in decentralized or limited-supply assets like Bitcoin, gold, and silver. In the face of inflation, interest rates, and global debt crises, he advises investors to turn to instruments that “preserve the purchasing power of money.” These statements by Kiyosaki are considered both a warning and an opportunity message to individual investors at a time when Bitcoin is reaching new highs. *This is not investment advice.

A $59M Move Amid BTC’s All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Royal Government of Bhutan is once again making headlines in the crypto world as Bitcoin hits $123K for the first time in history. Known for its surprisingly large Bitcoin reserves, the Royal Government has reportedly accelerated its BTC sales in recent days. According to blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain, Bhutan sold 512.84 BTC over the past four days, amounting to approximately $59.47 million. Despite this selling spree, the country still holds a sizable stash of 11,411 BTC, valued at around $1.4 billion. The Royal Government of #Bhutan has been accelerating its $BTC sales! In the past 4 days alone, #Bhutan sold 512.84 $BTC ($59.47M) — selling every day. They still hold 11,411 $BTC ($1.4B). https://t.co/hiNf1ySQhU https://t.co/dcqekOeedc pic.twitter.com/b3cQy0ryk8 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 14, 2025 A History of Strategic Selling This isn’t Bhutan’s first Bitcoin sale. Over the past year, the government has quietly been selling portions of its BTC holdings during periods of market strength. These moves appear to be part of a calculated strategy to take profits without making waves in the market. Data from Arkham Intelligence suggests that Bhutan has been particularly active during recent Bitcoin rallies, timing its sales to maximize returns. The country began accumulating Bitcoin as early as 2019, primarily through state-owned Druk Holding & Investments. With its vast supply of clean hydropower, Bhutan has been able to mine Bitcoin sustainably, a strategy that has proven lucrative given the digital asset’s long-term price appreciation. Bhutan vs Other Nations Bhutan is striking a smart balance in crypto strategy by mining, holding, and selectively selling Bitcoin. Unlike Germany, which sold nearly 49,858 BTC too early, losing out on $2B in gains, or El Salvador , which refuses to sell at all, Bhutan treats Bitcoin as both a long-term reserve and a funding tool. According to Arkham, its state-owned DHI holds about 12,000 BTC and smaller amounts of ETH, BNB, and MATIC. Bhutan’s Balanced Bitcoin Gameplan Bhutan’s recent spike in Bitcoin sales appears to be a strategic move timed with BTC’s price rebound, likely aimed at raising funds for national development while optimizing its crypto reserves. Rather than sticking to extremes, Bhutan is treating Bitcoin like both a reserve asset and a strategic funding tool. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Flips $120K, But On-Chain Metrics Warn of Caution , It mines its own BTC, holds a sizable reserve, and sells at selective intervals to raise funds without fully exiting the market. This approach allows the country to capitalize on Bitcoin’s value while still maintaining a long-term position. Moreover, Bhutan is one of the few nations that mines Bitcoin using clean energy. Its ongoing collaboration with Bitdeer and projects like the Gelephu Mindfulness City show that Bhutan isn’t just cashing out, it’s reinvesting in its future. Overall, Bhutan may be selling some of its Bitcoin now because the price has gone up, giving it a good chance to make profits. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Over the past seven days, ETH Price has posted a stunning 18.5% gain, even outshining Bitcoin’s performance . Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley points out, this rally isn’t about competing with BTC. It’s about something much bigger: replacing the aging infrastructure of Web2 and legacy financial systems. So, is Ethereum finally stepping into its role as the backbone of a new internet? Let’s dive in. Ethereum’s Mission: Not to Compete, But to Transform In a viral post on X, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said : “Ethereum’s mission is not to replace Bitcoin. It’s to replace Web2 platforms and legacy finance.” This shift in narrative—from chasing Bitcoin’s market cap to delivering real-world utility—is quickly gaining traction in the crypto community. Horsley compared blockchain networks to apps on an iPhone, noting that: Apps share a common operating system, yet each serves a unique purpose. Blockchains, similarly, use the same core tech but have distinct roles to play. Ethereum, according to Horsley, is not “just another coin”—it’s a new form of infrastructure for the digital economy. A New Financial System Is Being Built on Ethereum Unlike Web2 platforms that require central permissions, Ethereum is decentralized and permissionless, allowing anyone to build, participate, or innovate without gatekeepers. Ethereum is already powering: DeFi platforms are used by millions globally, Smart contracts replacing intermediaries, Tokenized assets and stablecoins are moving billions daily. And now, it’s getting even more powerful. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Solana Price Is Surging? Analysts Eye SOL ETF Catalyst , MegaETH: Ethereum’s Breakthrough in Scalability One of the most exciting developments in the Ethereum ecosystem is MegaETH, a next-gen Layer 2 solution built to supercharge Ethereum’s speed and scalability. Key Highlights of MegaETH: Performance: Up to 1.7 Ggas/s = ~130 million transactions per day. Speed: Sub-millisecond latency and 100,000+ TPS. Security: Utilizes EigenDA for data availability. Efficiency: Modular node roles for consensus, data, and execution. Accessibility: Full nodes still run on affordable hardware. This means Ethereum can now support real-time applications like high-frequency trading, decentralized gaming, and AI-integrated DApps —at scale. Is Ethereum Leading the Next Evolution in Crypto? With real-world adoption on the rise, technical innovations like MegaETH, and a growing narrative that separates it from the “store-of-value” label, Ethereum is no longer chasing Bitcoin—it’s building a different future. The focus is no longer on market cap, but on market impact. Final Thoughts Ethereum isn’t just growing in price—it’s evolving in purpose. From powering DeFi to becoming the infrastructure for next-gen finance and real-time internet applications, Ethereum is staking its claim as the most useful blockchain in the ecosystem. As the market matures, expect Ethereum to be judged less by comparisons to Bitcoin and more by how deeply it integrates into the global digital economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-14T09:30:15,"Hunter Horsley says ETH is designed to upgrade Web2, not to compete with BTC","Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley has stated that Ethereum’s mission is to upgrade the outdated systems of Web2 and traditional finance, rather than competing with Bitcoin. In his most recent X post , he stressed that Ethereum will position itself as the central infrastructure upon which decentralized application and fintech ecosystem developers can empower people. Ethereum isn't competing with Bitcoin. It's competing with web 2.0 and legacy financial services software — We're going to move away from the ""CoinMarketCap"" era over the next 6-12 mo; away from the view that every crypto asset is the same, just diff mkt caps. We're going to… — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) July 13, 2025 Horsley insisted that the industry should drop the mindset of CoinMarketCap, in which every token only has a price in the market. However, he compared the blockchain sector to the mobile app industry, in which various platforms have separate uses on top of a common technology base. According to him, Ethereum is a base protocol, more of an operating system, which enables a wide range of operations in the form of smart contracts. This position also strengthens the idea of Ethereum as a customizable blockchain that was created to change and update other technologies rather than to compete with the monetary thesis of Bitcoin. Ethereum has grown in its applications that include decentralized finance, data storage, digital identity, and tokenized assets. Ethereum’s architecture promotes open innovation Horsley argues that the design of Ethereum encourages permissionless participation, meaning that anyone can construct, maintain, or otherwise deal with the network. It allows its flexible structure to quickly evolve without causing a disruptive hard fork, unlike legacy Web2, which is still closed and uncompromising. Developers currently prefer the use of Ethereum as a way of breaking down siloed systems and creating transparent and decentralized services. The open-source character of the network leads to a higher rate of innovation, scale, and worldwide accessibility. The decentralized architecture also makes it inclusive and does not experience centralized tech stack bottlenecks. The upgrade path of Ethereum, which follows its modular development model, will allow it to integrate new technologies without undermining security or decentralization. This evolutionary ability is starkly opposed to traditional systems, where often total replacement is needed to introduce change. Not every response to Horsley’s commentary was favorable. Crypto user Row₿ear responded that Ethereum had generally stagnated crypto and prevented Bitcoin innovation. He acknowledged Bitcoin’s ongoing strength but criticized Ethereum’s long-standing presence. MegaETH ushers in a new era of scalability MegaETH is one of the most significant developments in Ethereum, a scaling project aimed at enhancing the transaction process without compromising on decentralization. The upgrade also brings a modular execution system where consensus, execution, and data availability are decoupled. This structure increases throughput by large margins without sacrificing node accessibility. During the initial public testing, MegaETH could process 1.7 Ggas/s, or 130 million transactions per day. Data throughput was up to 980 MB/s. In contrast to traditional approaches to scaling Web2, MegaETH improvements do not require costly hardware to maintain and make full nodes accessible to even more users. The upgrade is modular but still keeps Ethereum decentralized as it scales. One of the community members said that Ethereum was never positioned as a replica of Web2, and it was supposed to go beyond the boundaries of Web2. With these developments, the price of Ethereum has picked up. According to the recent update, ETH has reached a price of around $3,044.75, correlating to a rise of 3.18% in a single day. The rebound comes after episodes of high volatility in the wider market, and experts consider the structural improvements of Ethereum as a possible driver moving forward.

2025-07-14T09:29:25,"Why Solana Price Is Surging? Analysts Eye SOL ETF Catalyst","The post Why Solana Price Is Surging? Analysts Eye SOL ETF Catalyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana (SOL) price today is slowly winning back trader trust as it holds steady near $166, registering a 2.7% daily gain. After plunging to $136 in June, the recovery signals growing interest in the altcoin during this ongoing crypto bull run. But this surge isn’t just fueled by hype. According to top chart analyst Ali Martinez, a breakout above $170 could ignite a powerful rally and possibly lead SOL to $2,000. Solana Spot ETF Approval Odds Surge One of the biggest factors behind SOL’s latest upswing is speculation around a Solana spot ETF approval in the U.S. Polymarket shows a 90% probability of Solana spot ETF approval by the end of this month. The momentum follows earlier approval of Solana futures ETFs, and Canada has already launched spot SOL ETFs, making the U.S. the likely next step. As seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum, ETF approvals often attract institutional capital—a trend that could send SOL prices soaring. New REX‑Osprey Solana Staking ETF Boosts Confidence Further boosting investor sentiment is the recent launch of the REX-Osprey Solana and Staking ETF (SSK) on the Cboe BZX exchange. It attracted $12 million on launch day. Logged $33 million in first-day trading volume. Offers exposure to both SOL and staking rewards, giving passive income potential on top of price growth. This ETF sets Solana apart from many other altcoins, positioning it as a growth + yield asset for both retail and institutional investors. Technical Analysis: A Break Above $170 Could Trigger a Bull Run According to Ali Martinez, SOL is forming a cup-and-handle pattern on the weekly chart, a bullish technical indicator. A breakout above $170 could quickly send SOL to $200 or $300 in the short term. If momentum sustains, the rally could extend toward $2,000, marking a potential 10x move. The Solana Fear and Greed Index currently sits at 64 , indicating a “Greed” sentiment and increasing market optimism. Final Thoughts: Is Now the Time to Buy Solana? With bullish technical patterns, rising ETF speculation, and growing investor interest, Solana seems primed for a major breakout. If ETF approvals mirror Bitcoin’s success, SOL could become one of the top altcoin performers this cycle.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/solanas-170-breakout-could-send-sol-to-2000-say-top-analysts/,"SOL|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC|ALTCOIN","News",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T09:23:42,"Presale phase 5 ending soon, here’s your last chance to lock in 100% returns early","Once the remaining supply is gone, the price will instantly climb to $0.035, and the final listing is set at $0.06, doubling the value for anyone getting in now. Buyers who entered during Phase 1 at $0.01 and Phase 2 at $0.015 are already sitting on 200%+ returns, purely from presale growth. This is exactly how breakout runs start, and those who missed the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) often remember one thing: hesitation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers more than just price momentum—it delivers a powerful DeFi product built to generate real income through a dual lending engine and automated passive rewards. The final presale phase is approaching fast, and it may be the last real opportunity for a low-cost entry before broader market exposure. Real yield for lenders, flexible terms for borrowers What will set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its split lending design: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, lenders will be able to deposit top-tier assets such as ETH, LINK, or AVAX into non-custodial smart contract pools. These pools will then provide capital to borrowers who lock in overcollateralized crypto like ADA or MATIC. For example, an investor who deposits $20,000 worth of LINK at an estimated 8.6% APY could earn over $1,700 annually, with interest rates adjusting dynamically based on pool utilization. On the other side, the P2P system will offer retail borrowers a direct and flexible lending experience. Users who hold meme coins like SHIBA or PEPE will be able to use their assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins such as USDT or DAI. These smart contract agreements will remain trustless and allow repayment without expiration, putting full control in the borrower’s hands while providing the lender a solid yield, often higher than what traditional DeFi platforms will offer. Both systems will revolve around mtTokens, which will be automatically issued to lenders upon deposit. These mtTokens will represent the deposited amount plus any earned interest and can be held to accrue further value or staked within Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s designated contracts for additional protocol rewards. This will create a layered income mechanism: one from interest and the other from staking rewards, giving users multiple ways to compound returns over time. Strong audits, stablecoin plans, and long-term incentives The team behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has committed significant resources to security and transparency. A full audit was completed with CertiK, with updates made on May 20th following an initial review on February 25th. The project currently boasts a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50, placing it well above many of its DeFi peers in security standards. To further reinforce platform resilience, the team has launched a $50,000 bug bounty, open to white-hat developers who test the integrity of the smart contracts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also roll out its Layer-2 scaling solution, reducing gas fees and boosting throughput, making the lending platform far more usable and cost-efficient. The beta platform is set to go live alongside the token generation event, allowing users to access staking, borrowing, and lending as soon as the token lists. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will only be minted when a user borrows against collateral and burned upon repayment or liquidation. By keeping it tightly pegged to $1, governed by algorithmic interest rates and capped issuance per authorized minter, the system is designed to enhance liquidity while strengthening the protocol treasury. In parallel, a $100,000 giveaway is being held to reward early adopters. Ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, supporting long-term holders and increasing community engagement. While the current price sits at $0.03, analysts are forecasting an aggressive upward trajectory. Several leading voices in crypto research have now projected a 900% rally within six months, with the $0.30 mark in sight post-listing. The remaining 27% of Phase 5 tokens won’t last long. Once this window closes, the price immediately rises by 20%, and the road to public exchange listings will begin.

2025-07-14T09:22:08,"Summer’s top pick: a $0.03 token 70% sold, 1,000% gains expected post listing","What’s drawing even more attention is the bold prediction by a top-tier analyst—famous for forecasting Ethereum (ETH) at $1,200 in 2020 and Bitcoin (BTC) at $20,000 in 2017—who now expects Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to surge 1,000% after listing, landing it at a $0.30 valuation in the coming months. That forecast isn’t based on hype—it’s grounded in the project’s fundamentals: a revenue-generating, utility-driven DeFi protocol that empowers users to lend, borrow, and earn interest in a non-custodial way. Real yield, real tokens, real growth Unlike many crypto tokens that rely on pure speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being designed to produce on-chain yield. At the core of the protocol are mtTokens, which are minted 1:1 when a user deposits assets like ETH, DAI, or SOL into Mutuum’s lending pools. These mtTokens represent the user’s share of the pool and automatically accrue interest over time as borrowers tap into the liquidity. Holders don’t need to claim or compound—mtTokens grow in value on their own. But the earning doesn’t stop there. By staking mtTokens in Mutuum’s designated contracts, users become eligible for dividend rewards. These rewards will come from the platform’s own revenue, which will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the market and redistribute them to stakers. This dual-income mechanism—interest from lending and dividends from buybacks—offers a scalable and sustainable income stream. It’s no surprise that early buyers from Phase 1 at $0.01 are now holding 3x gains, and those entering now at $0.03 are tracking for 10x returns once the token lists at $0.06 and climbs. Mutuum isn’t just thinking short term either. The team is preparing to launch a decentralized stablecoin, designed to remain pegged at $1 and backed by overcollateralized assets like Ethereum (ETH). Only approved issuers will be able to mint this stablecoin, and it will be burned after loan repayment or liquidation. This system adds a layer of treasury stability that enhances the overall value of the MUTM token by anchoring the ecosystem in real, verifiable assets. Momentum building as whales rotate In Institutional and high-net-worth investors are always looking for asymmetric upside, and many are now rotating out of large-cap tokens like Chainlink (LINK) and Cardano (ADA) into the MUTM presale before the next price hike. With Layer-2 integration planned, Mutuum’s transaction speeds and fees will remain low, creating a seamless experience for both retail users and large-scale lenders. Security is another major draw. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol has already completed a CertiK audit, earning an impressive 95.00 Token Scan Score, and the team has launched a $50,000 bug bounty to reinforce user safety. At launch, users will be able to experience the platform firsthand through its Beta version, giving early adopters a front-row seat to its capabilities. Adding to the hype is a $100,000 giveaway , where ten lucky winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. This has amplified attention from social media channels and brought in a wave of new holders, swelling the total count to over 13,000 even before the token has been listed on any exchange. Don’t miss what’s almost gone Crypto summers often come with distractions, but opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are rare. The project combines real utility, protocol-based income, and a clear roadmap—all at a price point that’s about to vanish. With only 30% of Phase 5 remaining and a 20% price increase on the horizon, this is the kind of asymmetric entry serious investors wait for. Smart money is already flowing in. Whether you’re sitting on BTC profits, rotating out of large-cap bags, or entering the market fresh, the path to a 1,000% return this summer may be starting at $0.03—and its name is Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

2025-07-14T09:21:06,"BTC steady at $118K, traders shift to $0.03 token amid ETF watch","Currently in Phase 5 of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised over $12.10 million, gained more than 13,000 holders, and sold 70% of the allocated tokens at just $0.03. As this phase nears its end, the price is set to jump 20% to $0.035 in Phase 6. Traders looking for a real use-case and high upside are locking in before the next surge, knowing that once the presale ends, the listing price of $0.06 offers an easy double—even before exchange momentum begins. Bitcoin (BTC) updates Bitcoin (BTC) maintained stability this week, trading around $108,000–$118,000, reflecting cautious market sentiment. Investors are awaiting macroeconomic signals and ETF inflow trends, with no significant price movement reported for the week ending July 7, 2025. This consolidation follows Bitcoin (BTC)’s resilience despite global trade tensions, including Trump’s tariff threats against BRICS nations. Bitcoin (BTC)’s stability bolsters its appeal as a safe-haven asset, potentially attracting investors amid stock market uncertainty from tariff-related disruptions. In crypto markets, BTC’s steady price supports altcoin stability, though volatility may rise if trade wars escalate, impacting BRICS’ blockchain initiatives. In forex, a stronger dollar from US policies could pressure BTC’s upside, but long-term de-dollarization efforts may drive demand. Overall, BTC’s resilience signals confidence, but global trade risks could introduce short-term volatility. During periods of Bitcoin (BTC) consolidation, volatility often fades, but for the trader, that’s where opportunities emerge. While ETF investors hold for the long haul, crypto-native users are turning to decentralized protocols that create yield from utility, not speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers exactly that. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Its P2P (peer-to-peer) lending model will offer unmatched flexibility, particularly in markets where volatility is higher or asset types are more exotic. This model will allow users to create custom loan agreements directly with other users, using assets like SHIBA, DOGE, or PEPE as collateral. Terms such as interest rate, loan duration, and repayment conditions will be fully customizable, enabling tailored agreements enforced via smart contracts. For users seeking a more hands-off income stream, the platform’s P2C (peer-to-contract) model will support passive earning through decentralized liquidity pools. Lenders will deposit major assets like ETH, USDC, or BTC into non-custodial smart contracts and receive mtTokens—such as mtETH or mtUSDC—which will increase in value automatically as interest accrues over time. These mtTokens will also be eligible for staking into Mutuum’s dividend modules, allowing users to earn MUTM-based rewards directly from protocol revenue, creating a dual-yield structure that favors long-term holders. For example, a long-term BTC holder will be able to borrow stablecoins like USDC by using 1 BTC as overcollateralized backing through the P2C system. With an LTV ratio of up to 70%, the borrower will access liquidity without needing to sell their BTC, maintaining exposure while unlocking utility. That borrowed USDC can then be deployed into other on-chain strategies like stablecoin farming, enhancing returns without giving up core holdings. This structure will appeal to users looking for sustainable, yield-generating alternatives to traditional ETF products. While Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs attract institutional capital, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a decentralized infrastructure for real income generation, without dependence on market speculation or centralized platforms. Built for scalability, backed by trust What’s drawing analysts and traders alike to Mutuum isn’t just the income potential, but the quality of the infrastructure. The team has locked in a 95.00 Token Scan Score from CertiK, paired with a Skynet Score of 77.5, giving confidence to both individual users and large whales. In fact, the protocol is also running a $50,000 bug bounty with CertiK, showing their firm commitment to security across all code layers. With its Layer-2 integration, Mutuum is being built for speed and scalability, ensuring low fees and fast transactions even during high-volume lending and borrowing activity. At token launch, a Beta version of the platform will go live, giving users immediate access to its features rather than waiting on a roadmap to unfold post-listing. The utility doesn’t stop there. Mutuum will also introduce a decentralized stablecoin, minted only against overcollateralized loans and automatically burned after repayment. This mechanism will add treasury stability and offer further on-chain functionality, enhancing the long-term value of the ecosystem and reinforcing the core utility of the MUTM token. As part of its community reward campaign, Mutuum is running a $100K giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens—a bold reward for early believers. One smart early investor decided to lock in gains from Bitcoin (BTC)’s rally by rotating $10,000 worth of BTC profits into Phase 4 of the presale, securing tokens at just $0.025 each. At that stage, only 140 million tokens were allocated, and the price was still a fraction of its future potential. Today, just a few phases later, that same holding is already valued at over $12,000—a 20% increase even before the token officially launches on major exchanges. But the real upside is yet to come. According to a respected DeFi analyst—famous for accurately predicting Ethereum (ETH)’s explosive climb to $4,000 back in 2021—this token has a conservative price target of $0.12 within the first listing cycle. If this forecast plays out, the investor’s $10,000 rotation could soon transform into a $48,000+ windfall, representing nearly 5x returns in less time than most traditional assets take to move 10%. With Bitcoin (BTC) price action slowing and ETFs absorbing much of the institutional flow, retail traders are looking for the next meaningful upside. That upside is quickly materializing in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). As Phase 5 comes to a close, only 30% of the allocation remains, and the clock is ticking before the price increases by 20%.

2025-07-14T09:19:56,"Whales load up on $0.03 alt as presale nears 70%; 300% gains predicted","Once Phase 6 begins, that will climb 20% to $0.035. With early projections forecasting a 300% surge by listing and significantly more beyond, retail investors are now scrambling to get in before the price gap widens. One striking on-chain case stands out: a whale wallet that reallocated $50,000 worth of AVAX into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) back in Phase 2, when the price was just $0.015. That same wallet now holds over $100,000 worth of tokens—pure paper profit, with the listing price still pegged at $0.06. And once the protocol launches and the lending volume kicks into high gear, that 2x gain could evolve into 4x or even more. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): a protocol built for the next cycle At its core, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized, non-custodial lending and borrowing protocol that brings together the best of both worlds. It will support both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending structures—something very few DeFi projects will offer within a single platform. P2C will allow users to lend top-tier assets like BTC, ETH, BNB, and SOL directly to liquidity pools and earn interest. These pools will dynamically adjust APY based on utilization, rewarding lenders generously during periods of high borrowing activity. Meanwhile, borrowers will be able to post overcollateralized assets and receive instant liquidity in USDC, DAI, or other stablecoins—all without needing to sell their crypto. For example, someone who deposits $15,000 worth of BTC will be able to borrow up to $11,250 in USDC at a 75% loan-to-value ratio. That will unlock immediate capital for yield farming, covering short-term expenses, or deploying into other crypto opportunities, without ever triggering a taxable event from selling the original BTC. P2P lending on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will take things a step further, unlocking a market few protocols will touch. Holders of meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) will be able to create or accept custom lending agreements with other users. Everything will be governed by smart contracts, ensuring trustless execution and automatic liquidation rules to protect both parties. The terms—duration, APR, and collateral—will be fully customizable by users themselves. It will be a niche offering, and it will start attracting the attention of communities hungry for new utility. mtTokens, stablecoins, and a security framework that commands confidence Depositors on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) don’t just earn interest—they also receive mtTokens, such as mtETH or mtUSDT, in return. These ERC-20 compliant tokens reflect both the initial deposit and the accrued interest. But that’s not all. mtTokens can be staked in specialized smart contracts. These contracts are funded through protocol revenue buybacks of MUTM tokens, which are redistributed to mtToken stakers. This system creates passive income streams while applying upward price pressure on MUTM through market purchases—an elegant, investor-aligned feedback loop. The development team has also revealed its plan for a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted only by approved issuers, backed entirely by protocol assets, and burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. It will add depth to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s treasury system and increase platform-wide liquidity, while also creating another anchor of value for the ecosystem. Security, often the missing piece in early-stage DeFi, is front and center at Mutuum. The smart contracts have already passed through a comprehensive audit conducted by CertiK, receiving a Token Scan score of 95.00. Beyond the audit, a $50,000 Bug Bounty has been launched to attract ethical hackers and whitehat developers willing to stress-test the platform before mainnet goes live. These efforts send a strong signal to both retail and institutional investors: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking every step to ensure this is a secure, long-term protocol. As for visibility, a $100,000 giveaway is running in parallel, offering 10 winners a massive boost as the token prepares for listing. This might be the final stretch before liftoff Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap continues to build anticipation, with smart contract development, DApp front- and back-end engineering, demo launch, exchange listings, and Layer-2 expansion all planned in sequence. From AI-powered helpdesks to institutional onboarding, the project is structuring itself not just for a launch, but for long-term growth and usability. Whales have already moved. But retail still has a window—one that’s closing rapidly. Phase 6 will increase the price to $0.035, and those who delay will face higher entry points. Whether you’re looking to lend, borrow, stake, or earn passive rewards, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be a complete DeFi platform. This might be the final opportunity to catch one of the year’s most utility-driven protocols before the next surge.

2025-07-14T09:15:22,"Demand for US Treasuries May Fall Short Amid Surging Supply, Warns Ex-Bridgewater Exec Rebecca Patterson","A former executive of the hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio is warning that the market for US debt will soon hit a rough spot. In a new CNBC Television interview, ex-Bridgewater Associates chief investment strategist Rebecca Patterson addresses how the US dollar has lost about 10% of its value year-to-date, its worst performance in over 50 years. “I think there are three main things driving the dollar [devaluation]. One is slightly lower frontend rates, interest rates over this period because currencies trade on rate differentials. But I think more importantly and what’s different this time is that you’re seeing both re-allocation out of the US both by Americans diversifying and foreigners pulling back slightly. And then third and really importantly is hedging. So let’s say I’m a large overseas pension fund, and I have a tech equity exposure, and I want to keep it because I believe in the structural story, but I’m nervous about the dollar, I’m nervous about the Fed’s independence, I can hedge out that currency risk. So even if money stays in US equities, which helps explain where we are today, you can still see that dollar weakness.” Patterson, who is now the chair of the Council of Economic Education, warns that the dollar devaluation will continue as investors hedge and move their capital elsewhere. She also notes that the ongoing capital re-allocation will negatively impact demand for US debt. “This isn’t going to be a one-off. This is going to be a slow bleed out of the dollar, and I believe slowly out of US Treasuries.” Looking closer at US Treasuries, Patterson warns that she sees the bond market facing a demand shortage in the coming months. “I think this is rather a slow bleed. Most of the foreign investors who have US Treasuries have them in very short tenure bonds, so three years and less. They just have to let them expire and not replace them, so let them roll off. Again, it’s not going to be a one-and-done event, I think, without a trigger. It’s just going to be: we don’t have the demand to meet the supply that’s going to be coming, I think early next year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The collateral-optimized lending platform achieved this milestone in less than a month after completing its private beta in mid-June. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) deposits have doubled to $10 million since the private beta conclusion, driven by retail users seeking to optimize their crypto collateral for borrowing. Altitude’s protocol automatically rebalances borrowing based on collateral price fluctuations to maintain optimal loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. The platform addresses inefficiencies in traditional DeFi lending, where borrowers typically maintain LTVs of 30-40%, leaving up to half of their capital unused. Altitude’s dashboard displays loan health tied to LTV and allows users to adjust parameters. Protocol mechanics and funding When collateral values rise, Altitude uses the increase to borrow additional funds and channels them into yield-generating strategies to reduce loan balances. If collateral values drop, the protocol reallocates funds to the lending pool to maintain ideal LTV ratios. The system also adjusts positions to secure competitive lending rates. Altitude is backed by $6.1 million in funding from web3 investors, including Tioga Capital, New Form Capital, and GSR. Featured image via Shutterstock.

2025-07-14T09:09:51,"Bitcoin Price Surges Past Record $120,000 Amid Institutional Demand","On the night of July 14, the price of the first cryptocurrency updated its historical maximum, exceeding the mark of $120,000. The growth since the beginning of the month amounted to 13%. The rally is supported by institutional investors. The assets under management of BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF IBIT exceeded $84 billion. The fund reached that volume in 200 trading days, while the GLD gold ETF took 15 years to do so. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $122,547 (+3.6% overnight), according to CoinGecko. Eric Balchunas, a senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, emphasized that IBIT has crossed the $80 billion mark the fastest in the history of exchange-traded funds. Since April, the inflow of funds into spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US amounted to $16.2 billion. According to BTC Markets analyst Rachel Lucas, more than 6% of the entire market capitalization of digital gold is now concentrated in these instruments, which indicates ”deep conviction among institutional investors.” Regulatory Expectations and Macroeconomic Factors The market is also reacting to positive expectations from ”crypto week” in the US. Lawmakers will consider several key bills, including the CLARITY Act, which should delineate the authority of the SEC and CFTC in overseeing digital assets, and the GENIUS Act, which creates a legal framework for stablecoins. 10x Research analyst Markus Thielen thinks that the first cryptocurrency has transformed from a technology asset to a macroeconomic one—a hedge against US budget problems. He believes the recent $5 trillion increase in the national debt ceiling and rising budget deficits are strengthening the cryptocurrency's position. No one is talking about blockchain options anymore. Bitcoin has become a defense against uncontrolled budget deficits. Along with gold, it is now the main line of defense against the looming financial crisis, Thielen said. What On-Chain Metrics Say Data from the network points to the potential for further upside. The NUPL metric for long-term holders is at 0.69, below the euphoria threshold of 0.75. The market spent 228 days above that mark in the last cycle, only 30 days in the current cycle. Activity on the Bitcoin network also remains moderate. The average number of daily transactions has risen to 364,000, but this is well below the peaks of 530,000–666,000 seen at past market tops. ”There are no signs of active coin selling in the market. This reinforces both the fundamental and technical bullish signal,” explained analyst Axel Adler Jr. According to CryptoQuant, hoarding addresses that only buy Bitcoin have increased activity by 71% over the past month. They now hold 250,000 BTC—the highest since 2024. Analysts' Forecasts Experts expect the uptrend to continue. Lucas predicts movement to the range of $125,000–128,000 in the short term. Jeff May, chief operating officer of the BTSE exchange, believes the price will reach $125,000 within one to two months. A more optimistic forecast was given by OSL's chief commercial officer Eugene Cheung. He believes the asset could rise to $130,000–150,000 by the end of the year. Ledn CEO John Glover said that the price of Bitcoin will reach $136,000 by the end of this year. He believes that the rally of the first cryptocurrency has a basis for continuation. According to him, the breakthrough of the recent highs confirmed the completion of the corrective movement. Glover sees the June drop to $96,000 as a pullback of ”wave (ii)” within the larger ”wave 5”. Ledn's CEO noted that the ultimate target for the end of the bull cycle has not changed, but the timeline has shortened. ”Previously I expected it in the first quarter of 2026, but now it looks like we will reach $136,000 by the end of the year,” he explained.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9921/bitcoin-price-surges-past-record-120-000-amid-institutional-demand,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|FIAT|ZRX","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T09:08:08,"Bitcoin's Rise Dethroned Amazon! Bitcoin Now the 5th Largest Asset by Market Cap! Here Are the Details","Bitcoin has risen to become the world's fifth-largest asset by market capitalization after its price surpassed $122,000. The cryptocurrency's total market capitalization has reached $2.407 trillion, surpassing Amazon, Google, and silver. Bitcoin Surpasses $122,000, Becoming the World's 5th Most Valuable Asset Gold ($22.64 trillion) currently leads the ranking of assets with the highest market capitalization, followed by NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, respectively. Bitcoin's historic rise is being viewed as a rally fueled not only by market momentum but also by infrastructure developments. “This isn't just a price movement; institutional inflows via ETFs, progress on crypto policies in Washington, and improved liquidity are the key drivers of this rally,” said Vincent Liu, Investment Director at Kronos Research. Inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $16 billion in recent weeks alone, demonstrating continued institutional investor interest. Market expectations are also bolstered by the fact that the US Congress will consider key crypto bills like the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act as part of this week's “Crypto Week.” 2025 Target: Is $150,000 Possible? If interest rate cut expectations become clearer and ETF demand continues, Bitcoin could test the $130,000 to $150,000 range by the end of the year, according to Liu. However, he emphasizes that this would also require a resurgence of retail investor interest. Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at OSL exchange, also highlighted Bitcoin's potential to reach $150,000 by the end of 2025. However, experts warn that a pause in ETF inflows or regulatory uncertainty could disrupt the current upward trend. In line with Bitcoin's historic rally, a positive sentiment prevails in the altcoin market. In the last 24 hours: Ethereum (ETH) rose 2.71% to surpass the $3,000 level, XRP rose 4.82% to $2.91, Solana (SOL) rose 3.21% to $165.9. The GMCI 30 Index, which measures the market according to the 30 largest cryptocurrencies, also increased by 3.6% in the last 24 hours. Bitcoin's rise to the fifth-largest global asset position has once again demonstrated that crypto has become not only a digital investment tool but also a macro asset at the heart of corporate finance. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-14T09:04:22,"Bitcoin Price Flips $120K, But On-Chain Metrics Warn of Caution","The post Bitcoin Price Flips $120K, But On-Chain Metrics Warn of Caution appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has once again seized the spotlight by marking new levels in its price discovery phase, breaking past the key $120K level within the last 24 hours. This top crypto has advanced 3.7% intraday, 14% in the past week, and nearly 25% over the last 30 days. However, even as short-term momentum remains strong, yet, key on-chain indicators are beginning to flash caution. These conditions hint further upside in the short term but also build a dangerous situation where a sell-off-led price downturn could trigger a swift correction. Binance Record OI Hints Rising Traders’ Appetite For Bitcoin On Binance, the advancement in Bitcoin’s open interest has reached an all-time high of $14.1 billion, marking one of the most notable developments. Per the data from CryptoQuant , it is the largest OI ever recorded, revealing a massive influx of capital into BTC derivatives. It clearly shows that both retail and institutional traders have heightened risk appetite. Historically, it is evident that OI build-ups during bullish breakouts can fuel further upside in any asset; that’s what’s repeating in BTC. Yet, there is also history that suggests these times of high OI build up also heighten the risk of sudden volatility. Because, giant pile of capital is tied up in leveraged contracts, any unexpected price movement can trigger a chain reaction of liquidations, often resulting in swift and unpredictable price swings. Elevated Leverage Ratio Raises Volatility Risk In BTC’s Momentum Alongside the surge in open interest on Binance, the estimated leverage ratio on Binance now stands at 0.204, which seems to be approaching levels last seen in August 2023. This metric is critical as it reveals that a large portion of current open positions of traders are being held with high leverage and are on the rise. This may sound good from this distance, but elevated leverage could be fearsome and can act like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it amplifies gains during strong uptrends, which we are already seeing now on BTC price, with the price being in price discovery mode. On the other hand, it magnifies downside risks significantly, because in such an overheated market, even a slight sell-off could trigger a domino effect with cascading liquidations, intensifying downward momentum. Bitcoin Price Faces Downside Risk: TBSR Ratio Reflects Overheated Sentiment Adding to the overheated narrative is the taker buy/sell ratio (TBSR), which is now at a multi-month high of 1.14, as revealed on CryptoQuant’s chart. This ratio, combined with record leverage and open interest, worrisome market conditions, and overheated sentiment, is worrisome. This kind of bullish dominance could form local tops, as traders unknowingly expect continued gains, unaware that the odds of market sentiment turning bearish can erode gains heavily. Also, it is worth noting that this ratio has not reached such levels in months, and its at 1.14 is a clear hint towards caution. Chart Signals Support Rally In Bitcoin Price, but Caution Creeps In From a technical standpoint, the daily chart of the Bitcoin price remains firmly bullish and has displayed no such shakeouts yet. Also, the recent breakout above $120K confirms that BTC crypto is in a price discovery phase. Even key momentum indicators on its daily chart, such as MACD and AO, continue to show strength, suggesting that the rally could extend in the short term. However, some signs of exhaustion are beginning to appear, like RSI has now entered the overheated territory at 78, hinting at an overbought market. While the CMF has begun to curve downward slightly at 0.23, suggesting that capital inflows are slowing, which is a potential hint to profit-taking events. If Bitcoin price begins to correct, key support zones lie at $120,000, $116,000, and a more critical level at $110,000. These will be crucial in determining whether BTC consolidates or enters a deeper pullback.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-flips-120k-but-on-chain-metrics-warn-of-caution/,"TRADING|BTC|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET","Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Crypto news",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T09:01:21,"Bitcoin Soars Past $122,000: Can the Price Keep Climbing?","Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a sideways holding pattern on Sunday and continued its surge into Monday. From just under $118,000 the price put on a spurt and achieved a new all-time high of $122,550 on Monday morning. Is the alpha currency running out of steam now, or could there be a lot more upside to come? Extreme greed approaching The market appears to be licking its lips rather than becoming nervous at this particular stage of Bitcoin's ascent. The Fear and Greed Index is at a score of 74, which is still in the Greed segment. However, at Bitcoin’s current rate of climb, a move into Extreme Greed may not be far off. Huge inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and treasuries On the buying side of things the indications look very strong. The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought big over the last couple of trading days last week. A total of 19.45K BTC were bought on Thursday and Friday alone. Thursday’s purchase of 10.57K BTC was the second biggest on record, while Friday’s inflow of 8.88K BTC was the fifth biggest. As usual, Blackrock’s IBIT ETF bought the lion’s share of these inflows. The company now holds a total of just over 706,000 BTC, putting it well ahead of Fidelity’s ETF (FBTC) which holds a little more than 200K BTC. Among the other usual buyers, Metaplanet announced that it had bought 797 BTC for $94 million. Michael Saylor’s Strategy is likely to announce a purchase later on Monday. US CPI data release a potential banana skin? Regarding a possible banana skin for Bitcoin, one only has to look at the upcoming CPI data for the US, which will be published on Tuesday . CPI m/m is forecast to be 0.3%, compared with the last figure of 0.1%, while Core CPI is also expected to grow to 0.3 m/m from its previous monthly reading of 0.1%. If these figures are the ones published, a potential dip in the stock market would likely knock on to the crypto market. $BTC continues surge: now over $123,000 Source: TradingView The very short-term 1-hour price chart shows that $BTC has just surged higher again. This time the price stopped just short of $123,200. It remains to be seen if the bulls are now pausing to build some price structure, such as another flag, before pushing the price higher again. $14,000 added to $BTC price since bull flag breakout Source: TradingView The above 4-hour chart reveals the current $BTC surge in all its glory thus far. After breaking out of an 8-week bull flag, the price kept to the upper trendline for a while and then began its current surge. So far, around $14,000 has been added to the price of Bitcoin, and while it can be argued that this may still be small beer compared to a potential move to over $200,000, there will probably be a more extensive correction at some point. Tuesday’s US CPI data release has the potential to apply the brakes. Bearish divergence invalidated on daily Source: TradingView On the daily chart it must be noted that at least on this time frame, bearish divergence has been invalidated, as the indicator line on the RSI has now risen above the last high, which was recorded at the top of the bull flag. $BTC to $137,000 and beyond? Source: TradingView That said, on the weekly time frame, which has far more importance, the bearish divergence is still very much in evidence, as the price continues to climb and the trend on the RSI goes in the opposite direction. However, the indicator line is just in the process of crossing above the descending trendline, so in time, bearish divergence can be annulled on this time frame as well. While there may be the odd pause and retracement here and there, the $BTC price still looks set to rise beyond $130,000. If the measured move for the small bull flag plays out, this could take the price to $137,000. A lot of indicators are suggesting that Bitcoin is still nowhere near the top of its bull market yet. The next few months are bound to provide plenty of frills and spills. Paying closer and closer attention as the price rises would be a good strategy to follow.

2025-07-14T08:59:00,"XRP News: XRP Price Set To Outperform Bitcoin? Bullish Indicators Signal Breakout To $35+","XRP is making headlines again as analysts begin to question whether it could finally outpace Bitcoin. With strong technicals, rising trading volumes and renewed institutional interest, XRP is flashing major bullish signals. Speculation around a potential XRP ETF and Ripple’s expanding global use case has added fuel to the fire. Could XRP be gearing up for a breakout toward the $35 mark? Here’s what we know. Institutional Interest Grows as XRP Eyes $35 XRP news is once again making noise and this time, the breakout feels different. The price jumped nearly 12% in 24 hours, settling at $2.85 after brushing a high of $2.97. That puts the token within striking distance of the elusive $3 mark it hasn’t touched since 2018. With a market cap now above $170 billion, XRP has clawed its way back into the top four, catching the attention of traders betting on a long-awaited run. The bullish indicators are stacking up fast. XRP price has broken past key resistance at $2.60, holding above all major EMAs, while its RSI sits in overbought territory at 81.05 a classic setup for explosive follow-through. Volume is soaring across both spot and derivatives markets, and Coinglass reports open interest climbing to $7.2 billion. Whales are also flexing, reportedly sitting on $3.8 billion worth of XRP. But what’s really changing the game is the macro backdrop, per recent XRP news. The SEC has confirmed XRP isn’t a security and chatter around a potential XRP ETF is growing louder. Add Ripple’s new stablecoin (RLUSD) gaining real traction, and XRP is starting to look like more than just a comeback story it’s shaping up to challenge Bitcoin’s dominance in the next major leg up. Early Investors Say Remittix Is the Best Long Term Crypto Bet While XRP steals headlines with predictions of outperforming Bitcoin, another contender is quietly making waves with even more explosive momentum Remittix (RTX) . With over $16 million already raised and 550 million tokens sold, RTX is proving it’s not just hype. This isn’t a speculative pump, it’s a full-blown use case targeting the $250 trillion global remittance market. What sets Remittix apart is its PayFi protocol , which lets users send crypto that lands as fiat in any bank account with no complex wallets or conversions required. That means a freelancer in Lagos can receive payments from a client in Berlin, straight into their bank, even if they’ve never touched crypto. Early investors are already celebrating a 400% gain in 2025, with analysts predicting more upside ahead. Remittix’s smart design also empowers businesses to accept crypto through its KYC-enabled Pay API, supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs. Flat-fee structure with no hidden FX charges Supports mainstream and underserved regions like Southeast Asia and Africa RTX tokens currently priced at $0.0811 before next price tier As XRP price flirts with $35 forecasts, RTX may be the one actually racing ahead.

2025-07-14T08:52:00,"Bitcoin is heading to $200,000: Why MAGACOIN has more upside","Bitcoin just broke through a new all-time high of $118,667 on July 11, 2025 — a level that would have seemed unbelievable just a year ago. But market analysts believe the uptrend is just beginning, with Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expecting the Bitcoin price to reach $200,000 by year’s end. So, if Bitcoin is primed for further gains, where does that leave the next wave of altcoins? For some early-stage investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer an even more interesting angle. Bitcoin’s Supply Squeeze Fuels Broader Crypto Moves As Matt Hougan explained in a recent interview , Bitcoin’s “massive, unrelenting demand is meeting limited supply,” with ETFs alone adding $5.2 billion in BTC over just 30 days. These flows keep pushing price ceilings higher, and that enthusiasm often spills over into the altcoin market. BTC 7D price chart from CoinGecko When Bitcoin rallies, retail investors typically look for high-upside plays that match the market’s energy but with lower barriers to entry. That’s where narrative-driven coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE come in. While BTC may be about institutional hedging, MAGACOIN is about community power and ideology. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Meme-Powered Altcoin To Watch So, what exactly is MAGACOIN FINANCE? It’s a decentralized political meme coin designed for holders who want more than just speculation. Unlike DOGE or SHIB, which lean on humor and viral memes, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built around the “Make America Great Again” theme, giving it an instantly recognizable identity. Its zero-tax model means there are no hidden fees for buying, selling, or transferring the MAGA token. That’s a major difference from typical meme coins that quietly tax holders to fund central treasuries. Here, the community owns 100% of the supply — no venture capital or dev wallets holding everyone hostage. Metric Detail Supply Fixed at 170 billion tokens Audit Fully verified by HashEx Control 100% community ownership Tax Zero-tax model Still Early Presale: Timing and Upside Could MAGACOIN FINANCE really deliver more upside than BTC? For traders hunting early-stage opportunities, the numbers show there’s still room. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s successful fundraising so far sits at just $11.2M raised, keeping it well below the big-cap meme coins. Many see this as a phase of still early presale, where holders are positioning ahead of broader listings. Unlike Bitcoin, which is already heavily institutionalized, this meme-powered altcoin gives retail buyers more control over supply shocks. As funds rotate from major layer-ones, alt-chain capital rotation favors the MAGACOIN narrative. The project’s unique political edge sets it apart from coins like XRP, ADA, or ETH, which rely on enterprise use cases rather than grassroots identity. MAGACOIN’s Branding vs XRP, ADA, and DOGE Unlike XRP, which battles regulatory headlines, or ADA and ETH, which pitch smart contract scaling, MAGACOIN FINANCE is all about the grassroots holder. It fuses ideological branding with real tokenomics — no big treasury, no constant dilution. This anti-centralization theme is resonating. Holders see it as a decentralized political memecoin that can’t be easily captured by whales. Its tight supply model mirrors Bitcoin’s own scarcity narrative, which is what many believe will push BTC toward $200,000 by year-end. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE see a similar narrative lift on a smaller scale? That’s the trend many are betting on as the meme coin market pivots from jokes to identity-driven community projects. Final Takeaway: More Than a Meme Bitcoin’s path toward $200,000 reminds everyone how powerful a fixed supply and strong narrative can be. MAGACOIN FINANCE takes that same scarcity-driven model and layers on an ideological message that resonates deeply with its target community. For holders seeking early-stage exposure to a meme-powered altcoin that combines decentralization, zero tax, and American political branding, MAGACOIN FINANCE may stand out as one of the few genuinely narrative-driven tokens ready to catch the next wave.

2025-07-14T08:50:41,"Metaplanet acquires BTC at record prices","Metaplanet continued with its weekly purchases, even as BTC was charting new all-time records. The latest addition to the treasury was for 797 BTC. The Japanese BTC treasury company Metaplanet continued its series of regular purchases . In the past week, while BTC was charting new records, Metaplanet added another 797 BTC, to reach a total of 16,352 BTC. This ranks Metaplanet as the fifth largest treasury holder, surpassing Galaxy Digital. The last week’s purchase remains higher compared to the previous addition of just 116 BTC . Treasury companies, however, thrive on market exuberance and do not rely so much on ‘buying the dip’. Metaplanet’s announcement has been following the model of Strategy (MSTR), building up the treasury on a weekly basis. Unlike Strategy, Metaplanet’s purchases are transparent. Most of the BTC in the treasury is held in one known address , containing 15,555 BTC. For the latest purchases, the company used the BitFlyer exchange. The company also brought in direct deposits from Coinbase Prime and acquired some of the coins from QCP Capital. Metaplanet acquires BTC at record prices Metaplanet’s approach is to buy at any price, similar to other treasury companies. The latest purchase was for an average price of $117,451. Before the purchase, Metaplanet had an average acquisition price of $98,582. The latest purchase raised the average price to $100,191 per BTC, still allowing significant leeway to Metaplanet as BTC charted records above $122,000. For now, the MTPLF shares hold near their six-month high, though the price has been sliding for the past month. MTPLF shares slid in the past month, as Japanese investors sold.

Japanese investors sold some of their positions, though the slack may be taken up by US-based buyers. MTPLF is still expected to rally based on the recent BTC momentum. Treasury companies define market moves Treasury companies broke a milestone, holding 3.5M BTC, with all of the companies in profit as of July. Corporate buyers are absorbing all the newly mined supply, while also seeking other BTC reserves. Metaplanet alone acquires the equivalent of 32% of the mining supply each day. Currently, corporate buyers hold around 3.67% of the overall coin supply, or up to 4% based on different reporting methods. State governments hold 2.52% of the BTC supply, with most dedicated to long-term holding. Shrimp wallets still contain around 4.9% of the BTC supply, but corporate purchases are defining the latest market moves. ETF remain the most active buyers, but they often turn to selling when market conditions shift. While retail buyers are still holding, they are reluctant market participants near the peak. Treasury companies, on the other hand, are willing buyers, using market leverage from traditional markets to boost BTC. Metaplanet is one of the few buyers to perform open market buying, while some of the treasuries tap existing whales for OTC deals. The activity of corporate buyers remains a major factor in creating perceived scarcity for BTC, as more coins are taken off the market.

2025-07-14T08:50:31,"Single Trader Liquidated for $100 Million as Bitcoin Soars Past $123K: Market Watch","Bitcoin’s calm weekend didn’t last long as the cryptocurrency skyrocketed to a new all-time high on Sunday evening and another one, well above $123,000, on Monday morning. Many altcoins have followed suit by marking impressive gains over the past day, including SUI, CRO, UNI, ALGO, and others. BTC’s Latest Peak The past week proved why the cryptocurrency world is so interesting and unexpected. Recall that just less than seven days ago, the primary digital asset was confined in a tight range with an upper boundary of $110,000. Despite a few breakout attempts, it was unable to push through. That was until Wednesday evening. At the time, the bulls finally managed to break that resistance and drove the asset to $112,000. That was just the beginning as BTC kept climbing and neared $119,000 by Friday. Saturday was calm, with little to no reportable action, and so was most of Sunday. Yet, the landscape changed once again later during the day when bitcoin shot above $119,000 to set a new record . Monday started with fresh gains as well, and the latest all-time high stands at over $123,000 (on Bitstamp). This means that BTC has added roughly $15,000 since last Wednesday. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView The move to a new peak caught short traders off guard, and the total liquidations are up to $730 million. One particular whale stands out, as they were wrecked for almost $100 million on Binance. Liquidation Heat Map. Source: CoinGlass On the question of what could be driving today’s surge, Redstone’s Co-founder and COO, Marcin Kazmierczak, told us the following: “Bitcoin’s breakthrough past $120,000 today marks a significant psychological milestone, extending its impressive 28% year-to-date gain. The move follows President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a 30% tariff on the EU and Mexico, alongside growing institutional adoption through record ETF inflows.” Alts in the Green Many alts have mimicked BTC’s spectacular performance lately. Ethereum has reclaimed the $3,000 line following a 3% daily jump. BNB is above $700 after a 2% increase. SOL, DOGE, ADA, HYPE, TRX, and LINK have marked similar increases. XRP is close to $3 once again after a 6% daily pump. Even more impressive increases come from XLM, HBAR, AAVE, TAO, and ONDO. SUI, UNI, and CRO have charted double-digit gains. The total crypto market cap has added more than $100 billion since yesterday and is up to almost $3.9 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-14T08:47:03,"MUTM presale surge: why 70% of the supply is gone as whales target 2K% profits","The final 30% of this phase is vanishing fast as investors—especially whales—position for what many expect to be one of the year’s biggest breakouts. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and a projected listing price of $0.06, larger investors are aiming for serious upside. In fact, many are expecting 20x returns from early entries, and they’re not just buying and holding—they’re deploying capital through the very system Mutuum is building. Whether it’s $100,000 in ETH or $200,000 in stablecoins, whales are already tapping into the MUTM for future epic gains. Smart lending, serious yield Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be unlike most presale tokens. It will launch as a fully decentralized lending and borrowing protocol with two distinct models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) for stable and blue-chip assets, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) for custom lending in riskier markets like meme coins. In the P2C mode, users will deposit tokens like ETH, BTC, or USDT into audited smart contracts and will receive mtTokens in return—tokens that will grow in value as borrowers tap into the liquidity. For example, a whale will be able to deposit $100,000 in ETH, receive 100,000 mtETH in 1:1, and stake it for additional MUTM dividends—earning returns on top of returns. Meanwhile, borrowers will be able to post assets like ADA or LINK as collateral, borrow stablecoins at up to 75%(depending on LTV), and retain exposure to price growth without needing to sell. This structure will appeal not only to retail investors but also to institutional players seeking wealth preservation with built-in yield generation. Mutuum’s P2P lending system will also introduce a layer of customization that large investors will crave. Unlike traditional pooled lending, P2P will allow lenders and borrowers to negotiate directly. A future example might include a Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale issuing a custom loan to a borrower under self-set terms, including collateral ratio, interest rate, and duration. These over-the-counter-style deals will create opportunities for optimized risk and reward. Security, utility, and strategic growth Part of the reason whales are entering early is because of Mutuum’s clear commitment to security and transparency. The platform has earned a 95.00 Token Scan score and 77.50 Skynet rating from CertiK, one of the most respected audit firms in the blockchain space. Backing this is a $50,000 bug bounty, split into four severity levels—critical, major, minor, and low—ensuring every corner of the smart contracts gets attention. This reassures big capital, and it’s another sign that the team is building for the long haul. On the utility front, the MUTM token is more than just a presale asset—it will be the backbone of the protocol. A portion of platform revenue will be used to buy MUTM off the open market, distributing it to stakers who lock their mtTokens in the designated smart contracts. This buyback-and-burn system is designed to support long-term value and reward active contributors. A Phase 1 investor who entered with $5,000 from BTC now holds around $10,000 worth of MUTM at current prices, and is set to cross $30,000+ once the token reaches just $0.09. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside the token listing, giving early users a firsthand look at its lending engine. The team is also running a $100,000 giveaway campaign —ten early supporters will be selected to receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. Add to that Layer-2 integration for faster and cheaper transactions, and it’s clear that the project isn’t just about hype—it’s about scaling real utility. With only 30% of Phase 5 tokens remaining, and a 20% price hike right around the corner, time is running out for latecomers. Bitcoin (BTC), Chainlink (LINK), and Ethereum (ETH) whales have already started shifting their strategies toward Mutuum’s yield-based model. Those still watching from the sidelines risk missing what could be the last $0.03 entry before the protocol goes fully live.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs boosted institutional adoption and the demand for Bitcoin. Bitcoin has gained over 215% since the SEC’s spot ETF approvals in 2024. Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) expects Bitcoin’s price to rise much higher than its current price. According to Zhao, Bitcoin’s current all-time high could be worth a fraction of the cryptocurrency in the future, just like what was an all-time high a few years ago has become relatively insignificant in the value of the pioneer crypto. After I bought bitcoin in 2014, it took 3 years to reach an ATH of $1000 again in Jan 2017. We were excited. Now, that is just a small fraction, less than 1%. Today, you might be excited by the current ATH. In a few years, this will be just a fraction. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) July 14, 2025 Zhao’s latest post on the social media platform X highlighted his own experience of buying Bitcoin in 2014 and holding it for three years before the price first reached the milestone of $1,000 in 2017.

2025-07-14T08:39:25,"BREAKING: Bitcoin hits new ATH of 123456!","Bitcoin has hit an all-time high of $123,091 , overtaking Amazon in market value with a $2.39 trillion market cap, making it the fifth-largest asset globally. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) reminded followers that in 2014, it took years for Bitcoin to reclaim $1,000—implying today’s numbers may seem small in hindsight. The price surge wiped out $1.3 billion in short positions within seconds as BTC leaped past $120K. The market has gained $1.2 trillion since early April, helped by favorable political events like President Trump halting tariffs and pushing forward his economic agenda. Institutions are fueling the rally too. Hedge funds, family offices, and even conservative investors are reportedly eyeing 1% allocations to Bitcoin. The IBIT ETF has reached $76 billion in assets in under a year, far faster than gold’s GLD which took 15 years to do the same. Bitcoin’s recent 23.48% dip was mild compared to past cycles, which saw pullbacks of up to 87%. Historically, Bitcoin corrections stem from regulation, macro shifts, or investor profit-taking. Despite the volatility, each cycle has trended higher, reinforcing its long-term value. Technical analysis shows Bitcoin has broken above a long-standing trendline that limited all past bull markets since 2018. It’s now following a steep growth curve, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $200,000 by late 2025 . The absence of major sell-offs at recent highs indicates strong buyer demand. While corrections are always possible, they’re seen as buying opportunities. As CZ put it, today’s price is likely “just a fraction” of where Bitcoin is heading.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/bitcoin-hits-123k,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION","",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T08:36:12,"Banks and Deflationary Feature to Trigger XRP Price Rally. Here’s how","Crypto researcher SMQKE published a detailed statement about the price dynamics of XRP, referencing documented analysis of its integration into the banking sector and its deflationary monetary characteristics. SMQKE cited specific documentation on how Ripple’s technology connects to traditional banking systems and how its currency supply mechanism is designed to create upward price pressure over time. XRP’s Integration with Banking Channels According to the document shared by SMQKE, XRP does not seek to replace existing banking payment channels such as SWIFT. Instead, Ripple’s technology connects with conventional systems and facilitates faster and more efficient transactions between banks. This approach contrasts with traditional cryptocurrencies, which are primarily designed for retail use and aim to bypass established financial systems. Ripple, by contrast, focuses on institutional use, targeting large banks and financial institutions as its core customers. The document specifically states that Ripple actively integrates into the banking industry and enables payments to be executed in any currency, despite having its favorite digital asset, XRP. This interoperability with existing systems is described as a key differentiator that allows Ripple to complement, rather than supplant, SWIFT and similar infrastructure. Let’s talk XRP price. With documentation of course. “As XRP actively integrates with the banking industry, the deflationary characteristics of XRP will decrease its supply, causing its price to rise.” Read closely. pic.twitter.com/FmX9tJJLDs — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 11, 2025 Deflationary Mechanism of XRP SMQKE also highlighted how XRP’s deflationary nature contributes to its long-term price prospects. As outlined in the documentation, Ripple initially released a fixed supply of 100 billion XRP. Importantly, each time a transaction is processed on the network, a small amount of XRP (specifically, 0.00001 XRP) is permanently destroyed . This feature serves as an anti-spam mechanism to protect the network from abuse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Over time, this gradual destruction of XRP means the total supply in circulation decreases. As demand for XRP increases with its adoption in banking and cross-border payments, the decreasing supply is expected to exert upward pressure on the asset’s price. The documentation explicitly notes that “the total amount of the XRP currency will gradually decrease, and its price will rise.” SMQKE’s choice to include documentation lends weight to his argument, emphasizing that XRP’s design is specifically tailored to institutional use while maintaining a long-term deflationary supply model. The documentation he referenced also points out that XRP’s operational model does not rely on mining, thus avoiding the high energy consumption associated with networks such as Bitcoin. This further aligns XRP with the needs and expectations of the banking sector, which seeks efficiency and sustainability. SMQKE’s post draws attention to how Ripple’s integration strategy and XRP’s controlled supply dynamics are interconnected, and how these factors could contribute to a sustained increase in the value of XRP over time.
