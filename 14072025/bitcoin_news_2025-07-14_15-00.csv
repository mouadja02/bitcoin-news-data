2025-07-14T12:50:07,"Peter Schiff Claims Bitcoin’s 21M Supply is ‘Meaningless’ – Says Satoshi Count is What Matters","Peter Schiff, Chief Economist at Euro Pacific Capital and a persistent Bitcoin skeptic, has claimed that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap, frequently cited as evidence of the asset’s scarcity, is a “ meaningless ” metric. The economist contended that if Bitcoin’s total supply were 21 billion instead of 21 million, with each BTC redenominated as 100,000 satoshis rather than 100 million, it would eliminate the perception of scarcity surrounding the digital asset. That's my point exactly. Bitcoin's scarcity is about perception, not reality. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 12, 2025 Peter Schiff’s Shocking Bitcoin ‘Meaningless’ Supply Theory Exposed A Bitcoin advocate acknowledged Schiff’s point, agreeing that Bitcoin’s perceived scarcity is largely psychological. The supporter drew an analogy to Ferrari’s limited production, noting that while only approximately 250,000 Ferraris have ever been manufactured, scarcity alone does not determine value. Crypto investor Jeff Day countered this comparison, pointing out that Ferraris cannot function as currency and lack divisibility; you cannot own a fraction of a Ferrari. Yes but Ferraris can't be used as money. Also, they are not divisible. In other words you can own a part of a Ferrari. Even at 115k Bitcoin can be bought by people with 100 dollars or even less. You can't do that with Ferraris. — Jeff Day (@dayjeff) July 13, 2025 In contrast, even at Bitcoin’s current $120,000 price point, individuals with $100 or less can purchase portions of the cryptocurrency, unlike with luxury vehicles. When a crypto investor highlighted the irony of Schiff’s criticism given Bitcoin’s surge while gold, his preferred asset class, remains stagnant, Schiff responded that gold has merely taken a “temporary pause.” He claimed silver is outperforming Bitcoin. You always need an asset to back your story, don’t you Peter? First it was gold, then silver… soon it’ll be copper if it suits the narrative. Just admit Bitcoin keeps ruining your day — Mr. Crypto Degen (@subwayzarry1) July 12, 2025 Schiff’s Gold and Silver Bet Backfires As Bitcoin Crushes Record $123,000 On July 10, Schiff advised investors to sell portions of their Bitcoin holdings and purchase silver instead. He argued that even if Bitcoin continues rising temporarily, silver should appreciate significantly more, and while Bitcoin faces potential crashes, silver’s downside appears limited. Despite Bitcoin's new high today, had you followed the advice to sell Bitcoin and buy silver in yesterday's post, you would be better off. Plus, you would have taken on a lot less risk. https://t.co/6fhKHXOAru — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 11, 2025 However, Bitcoin ultimately outperformed silver during the measured period. While silver gained over 3.98% in the past seven days, reaching $39.04 per ounce, its highest level since September 2011, Bitcoin increased 12.2% over the same timeframe. This follows Schiff’s April prediction during the Iran-Israel conflict tensions , when he reignited debates about Bitcoin’s future by asserting that “the financial crisis of 2025 will kill” the cryptocurrency. This pessimistic forecast came just one month after he projected Bitcoin would fall to $65,000 . As with previous predictions, the cryptocurrency, originally created in response to the 2008 global financial crisis when major financial institutions collapsed due to risky lending practices and the housing market crash, has continued defying skeptics. Since April’s low of $74,508, Bitcoin has gained over 60% , outperforming gold, silver, the S&P 500, and every major asset class globally, rendering Schiff’s predictions inaccurate once again. BREAKING: Bitcoin surges to a record $123,000, now up +66% since the April 2025 low. In just 7 days, Bitcoin has added +$20,000. https://t.co/725h5pHI2f pic.twitter.com/PjFj1d1rGw — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 14, 2025 Despite Bitcoin’s approximately 700% surge since the 2022 bear market and growing institutional and retail adoption, several prominent investors have dismissed it as a viable asset class. In 2014, legendary investor Warren Buffett rejected Bitcoin at $600 ; it has since gained 19,400%. Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway’s late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger famously called Bitcoin “rat poison,” among other criticisms. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Charlie Munger calls Bitcoin a ""rat poison"" pic.twitter.com/gazQmwX32Q — Crypto Jargon (@Crypto_Jargon) July 13, 2025 JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has also criticized Bitcoin’s limited supply, suggesting that creator Satoshi Nakamoto would return when Bitcoin reaches 20 million in supply and erase all existing bitcoins. However, former Binance CEO and Bitcoin advocate Changpeng Zhao has stated that even the most successful investors are not always correct about everything. He encouraged people to purchase Bitcoin , suggesting that in several years, current prices will represent only a small fraction of its eventual value.

NBA Legend Shares a Mysterious Bitcoin Message appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto world has seen strange things before, but NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen may have just added another twist. Pippen claims that Satoshi visited him in a dream again, this time delivering a strange but powerful message about Bitcoin’s next move. Here’s what he says! Satoshi Sends a Message In his latest post, Pippen said he had a dream where Satoshi visited him and shared a strange message about Bitcoin. In the dream, Satoshi showed up with an afro and looked like a member of the Jackson 5. While singing, “BTC, easy as 1-2-3,” he gave Pippen a cryptic hint about Bitcoin’s future. Pippen compared it to how sports stars take a quick water break before pushing to the next level. He believes Satoshi’s message means Bitcoin might rest for a bit before making an even bigger move up. Just woke up from another wild Satoshi Nakamoto dream. This time he had an afro, dressed like the Jackson 5, singing ‘BTC, easy as 1-2-3.’ When Satoshi sings, I listen… but even legends take water breaks before hitting that next level. — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 14, 2025 Interestingly, Pippen’s dream messages about Satoshi aren’t new. In past tweets, he has mentioned receiving advice from Satoshi in dreams, often around major market moments. Pippen’s Watchlist: Not Just Bitcoin Pippen isn’t just watching Bitcoin. He’s also keeping an eye on other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE). His tweets show that he’s interested in the whole crypto market, not just one coin. Satoshi’s Bitcoin Fortune Nears Buffett’s Wealth Bitcoin’s latest rally has pushed its secret creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, into the spotlight again. Even though no one knows who Satoshi is, their Bitcoin stash now makes them one of the richest people in the world. As Bitcoin jumped above $122,000 on Monday, Satoshi’s estimated 1.1 million Bitcoins are now worth about $134 billion. That’s almost as much as Warren Buffett’s net worth of $143.9 billion . This huge pile of early-mined coins has quietly become one of the biggest fortunes on the planet. CZ Reminds Everyone: This Is Just the Beginning It’s not just celebrities talking about Bitcoin’s rise. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, shared his thoughts , too.

2025-07-14T12:45:29,"Investor Tom Lee Reveals Ethereum Price Target Amid ‘ChatGPT Moment’ of Stablecoins","Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes that Ethereum ( ETH ) could soar to a five-figure price as the rise of stablecoins brings new relevance to the world’s leading smart contract platform. In a new interview with Dierdre Bosa, Lee says that technical analysts at Fundstrat are currently targeting near $5,000 for Ethereum in the next several months. However, over the longer term, Lee says that ETH could be trading above $10,000 if it reaches similar valuations to Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, which largely relies upon the Ethereum network to power its products. “Mark Newton, who is head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, has some views on Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the near term, he thinks both have 20% upside from here, so that would be putting Ethereum closer to $3,300. And he thinks something around $4,500 or $5,000 in the next few months is achievable. That’s a pretty big move for Ethereum, but I think the perspective that someone could have is to realize that Circle trades at around 100 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization), which I think is fair because its scarce and it is one of the best IPOs (initial public offerings) really in several years. But if you applied that metric to the layer-1 Ethereum, it would imply a value per ETH token north of $10,000. So I think it shows you that if the stablecoin is being valued in the market at a hundred times, that the underlying layer-1, which is really what’s securing those transactions, probably is undervalued.” Tom Lee also believes that Ethereum is benefiting from the “ChatGPT moment” of stablecoins, as adoption for dollar-pegged crypto assets hit fever-pitch. “Stablecoins have really exploded because consumers, businesses and banks are really interested in adopting this. The majority of stablecoins are actually transacted on the Ethereum blockchain. And if Treasury Secretary [Scott] Bessent is right, and it goes from a $250 billion market to $2 trillion, that’s exponential demand for Ethereum.” At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,024.

Strategy has acquired 4,225 BTC for ~$472.5 million at ~$111,827 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 20.2% YTD 2025. As of 7/13/2025, we hodl 601,550 $BTC acquired for ~$42.87 billion at ~$71,268 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/HhlFIy1m3H — Strategy (@Strategy) July 14, 2025 The latest acquisition, announced on July 14, brings Strategy’s total BTC holdings to 601,550, purchased at an average price of $71,268 per coin, amounting to a total investment of $42.87 billion. The move reaffirms the company’s long-standing conviction in Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset. With this purchase, Strategy’s Bitcoin-related yield year-to-date has surged to 20.2%, underscoring the performance edge the company has enjoyed in 2025’s bullish digital asset environment. Funding Strategy: Preferred Stock Offerings Fuel Growth To fund its latest Bitcoin accumulation, Strategy tapped into multiple at-the-market (ATM) offering programs, including its common stock (MSTR) and three distinct preferred share offerings: STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Stride). Between July 7 and July 13, 2025, Strategy sold nearly 2 million shares across these instruments, raising a combined $472.3 million in net proceeds. The largest tranche came from the common stock ATM, which generated $330.9 million. The STRK preferred shares contributed $57.4 million, STRF added $44.4 million, and STRD rounded out the raise with $15.8 million. Each preferred share class offers annual dividends ranging from 8.00% to 10.00%, giving investors exposure to income-generating equity tied to Strategy’s long-term Bitcoin vision. These instruments also reflect Strategy’s financial creativity, offering scalable fundraising mechanisms without diluting common shareholders excessively. Transparent Reporting and Long-Term Positioning As part of its commitment to transparency, Strategy says it continues to maintain a publicly accessible dashboard at www.strategy.com , where it discloses real-time Bitcoin purchases, aggregate holdings, security market data, and key financial metrics. By integrating Bitcoin acquisition updates with structured equity offerings, Strategy has positioned itself as both a technology firm and a de facto Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin Breaks $123K ATH Earlier today, Bitcoin has shattered all previous records by reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $123,091, prompting former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) to put the milestone in historical perspective by calling it “just a fraction” of what’s to come. CZ reminded followers that after buying Bitcoin in 2014, it took three years to reach $1,000 again in January 2017, noting that today’s excitement over current highs will seem minimal in future years. Bitcoin ATH Wipes Out $1.3B Short Positions The latest surge liquidated $1.3 billion in short positions in less than 60 seconds as Bitcoin skipped past $120,000 and went directly to $121,000. At $2.39 trillion market capitalization, Bitcoin has now officially become larger than Amazon and ranks as the world’s fifth-largest asset by market value. Crypto markets have added $1.2 trillion in market cap since President Trump paused “reciprocal tariffs” on April 9th, with Bitcoin gaining $15,000 since the House passed Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 3rd The post Strategy Acquires 4,225 BTC for $472.5M, Boosts YTD Bitcoin Yield to 20.2% in 2025 appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/strategy-acquires-4225-btc-for-472-5m-boosts-ytd-bitcoin-yield-to-20-2-in-2025/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|STRK","Bitcoin News|News|Bitcoin|Michael Saylor|Strategy",cryptocompare

This move was powered by short-term holders aggressively bidding. Bitcoin’s sharp rebound from the tariff-induced April panic has firmly reasserted its status as a macro-resilient asset, outperforming traditional hedges like gold and equities. In a market grappling with global uncertainty, Bitcoin’s unique positioning as a high-beta safe haven is increasingly validated. Now the fifth-largest asset in the world with a $2.43 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has surpassed both silver and Amazon, in terms of market valuation. ETF-driven demand continues to dominate, with US spot Bitcoin ETFs recording over $2.7 billion in inflows last week, significantly outpacing the mined supply of BTC last week — with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF reaching $80 billion in AUM faster than any ETF in history. Meanwhile, grassroots accumulation by wallet cohorts under 100 BTC is also outpacing new issuance by a wide margin, reducing further supply pressure. Bitcoin’s role as a digitally native monetary asset, validated by sovereign-grade allocators and balance sheet investors, is driving its ascent through the global asset rankings. The price action reflects more than just momentum, it represents a fundamental repricing of Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios and macro frameworks. And while headline economic indicators also suggest broader stability in the US, a closer examination reveals deepening cracks beneath the surface. Labour market dynamics are weakening , with rising continuing jobless claims pointing to challenges in workforce reintegration, especially in entry-level roles. Simultaneously, consumer sentiment is cautiously optimistic but weighed down by persistent structural strains—elevated credit costs, essential living expenses, and growing geopolitical uncertainty are testing household resilience. On Main Street, small businesses are feeling the pinch. Despite stable readings in business surveys, data shows that many companies are grappling with sluggish sales, rising input costs, and hiring mismatches , forcing them to scale back investments and hiring plans. Meanwhile, Wall Street is showing its own signs of fragility , with a depreciating dollar, rising Treasury yields, and widening credit spreads reflecting heightened investor anxiety and scepticism toward US fiscal and monetary policy. Amid this backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, the digital asset sector is gaining momentum. BioSig , a Nasdaq-listed firm, has secured up to $1.1 billion in financing to spearhead its push into tokenised commodities, following its merger with blockchain firm Streamex. The capital will underpin the creation of a blockchain-based tokenised treasury—starting with gold-backed products—positioning BioSig to capitalise on growing demand for real-world asset tokenisation. Similarly, Tether, the issuer of USDt, has bolstered its compliance capabilities by investing in blockchain analytics firm Crystal Intelligence. This move enhances Tether’s capacity to detect and respond to illicit activity, reinforcing its commitment to transparency amid a surge in crypto-related fraud. Globally, governments are also signalling increased support for digital asset innovation. South Korea has proposed reclassifying crypto firms as “venture companies,” making them eligible for tax incentives, public funding, and startup programs. This policy shift, aligned with President Lee Jae-myung’s broader pro-crypto agenda, marks a significant step toward institutionalising digital assets within the country’s tech and financial landscape.

2025-07-14T12:34:29,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 2.95127413 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.95127413 4.65% Market cap $ 174,513,636,004.08 Circulating Supply 59,131,625,363.00 Trading Volume $ 11,479,081,350.3446 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case. Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Positive sentiment continued to strengthen in July. A “buy-the-dip” mindset gained traction, and investor panic appeared to subside. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into launching an XRP ETF also resurfaced in July. In addition, Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. The upper resistance of the falling wedge pattern, around $2.40, was successfully broken in the second week of July. This breakout was catalyzed by Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $123,231, which pulled altcoins like XRP upward. XRP now aims to reclaim its mid-Jan’s peak of $3.40(also ATH). A break above this could lead to a price discovery phase. Similarly, from a technical indicators perspective, XRP price has recently formed a short-term golden cross between its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, this is expanding upwards indicating bullish momentum. Increased exchange outflows and improving investor interest are driving liquidity into the asset. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has surged to 0.21, up from 0.04 earlier in the early july, highlighting growing accumulation. Likewise, both the MACD and AO show rising bullish momentum. However, there are warning signals to consider, which alarm short-term caution with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 77, indicating overheated overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or sideways consolidation is likely before the next leg upward. On the contrary, if XRP price fails to hold the $2.40 support, a retest of $2.10 is possible. This level aligns with the 200-day EMA, making it critical for sustaining bullish momentum. Should this support fail, XRP could fall further to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is becoming aggressively bullish as in the year’s second half, July, a new ATH has been marked, smashing previous all-time highs of $112K . As a wave of bullish momentum sweeps into the market, investors and traders are intrigued by its next stop, as it has entered a price discovery mode. This optimism has been directly fueled by massive inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , skyrocketing institutional adoption , much clearer regulations, and unwavering political support from figures like President Trump. It’s now seen as “a hedge against inflation” more than ever, and the cryptocurrency is capturing global attention. Major players like MicroStrategy , Metaplanet , Trump Media , and several other entities are boldly adding BTC to their balance sheets, signaling unshakable adoption and confidence in its future. With the Federal Reserve hinting at future rate cuts and market enthusiasm at a fever pitch, investors are buzzing with questions: “Can Bitcoin sustain its meteoric rise?” and “Will it redefine the financial landscape in the next five years?” This Bitcoin price prediction dives deep into the trends driving this historic rally. Read on for the full scoop. What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $110,660.75 and $118,856.47 today. Table of Contents Story Highlights Bitcoin Price Today CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 Bitcoin Crypto Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 BTC Price Forecast 2026 BTC Price Prediction 2027 Bitcoin Predictions 2028 BTC Price 2029 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2030 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Bitcoin Prediction: Analysts and Influencer’s BTC Price Target FAQs Bitcoin Price Today Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Token BTC Price $ 121,836.91419210 2.80% Market cap $ 2,423,608,041,436.40 Circulating Supply 19,892,231.00 Trading Volume $ 111,446,793,344.39 All-time high $109,114.88 on 20th January 2025 All-time low $0.04865 on 15th July 2010 CoinPedia’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Firstly, at CoinPedia, we feel optimistic about Bitcoin’s price increase. Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 (H1 2025) Bitcoin’s performance during the first half of 2025 was mixed, reflecting a combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility. In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure. On June 17, the situation escalated even sharply when U.S. President Donald Trump issued a warning to Iran’s Supreme Leader. Iran’s defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 The Bitcoin price performance in July 2025 has been nothing short of impressive. Since the final week of June, Bitcoin has broken free from its consolidation zone, fueled by a combination of whale accumulation, increased spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On-chain data also reveals a sharp increase in whale transactions especially in the $100K+ and $1M+ brackets. Spot volume also hit a 3-month high, indicating heightened market participation. These catalysts combined helped the BTC price to break above the $122K resistance, enter price discovery, and establish a new all-time high at $123231. Also, dormant wallets coming back online also suggest broader ecosystem confidence. These older addresses that were left untouched for years have recently reactivated during the current rally, pointing toward stronger belief in long-term price potential. From a technical perspective, BTC now eyes the psychological milestone of $125,000. Should the price maintain upward momentum, this level may be tested before the end of the month. However, any short-term pullback would make $120,000 a crucial support to hold. A drop below this level potentially pulls BTC back to the $110,000 swing low support zone, and the final defense line stays near the $101,000 mark. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July 2025 $95,000 $103,500 – $108,000 $120,000 Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 Recent insights from Santiment highlight that the Israel-Palestine conflict in H2 2024 caused a spike in social volume. Initially, crypto prices dropped, but the market rebounded, leaving panic sellers behind. A similar trend occurred in Q2 2025 when rising Ukraine-Russia tensions led to increased social activity. After a price dip, Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of $112,000. Now, the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict has prompted U.S. intervention, resulting in another surge in social volume. Bitcoin’s price dipped to $98,000, but analysts expect a strong rally in H2 2025. Despite geopolitical challenges in Q1 and Q2, the overall outlook for Bitcoin remains bullish. Source: santiment Looking ahead, advancements in financial products, especially ETF flows, could sustain Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. Market sentiment is optimistic, suggesting Bitcoin may reach new highs. Moreover, the speculation is growing that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates in the U.S., further supporting Bitcoin’s upward movement. Also, pata data is evident of its relationship with global liquidity, as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences price surges. Similarly, the CryptoQuant data also indicates rising accumulation, with exchange reserves declining to 2.4 million BTC, down from 3.1 million BTC a year ago. Ultimately, Bitcoin’s future market potential will depend on buying demand, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-07-14T12:27:34,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Nearing Exhaustion or Gearing Up for $130K Next?","Bitcoin has officially entered price discovery once again, trading just below $122,000 at the time of writing. After months of consolidation and multiple failed breakout attempts, the bulls have finally regained full control. The breakout above the previous all-time high around $112,000 was followed by explosive momentum, and investors are wondering how much further BTC will run. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart The daily chart shows that the asset is still respecting the long-term ascending channel, as it rebounded from its lower boundary and is currently rallying toward the mid-line. The price decisively closed above the $112,000 previous all-time high, a level that acted as a distribution zone for over a month. Following this breakout, BTC printed several bullish continuation candles, pushing all the way up to $122,000. Yet, a retracement into the $114K–$117K zone is probable to cool the market down. This pullback would not invalidate the bullish structure but instead offer a healthier continuation setup. As long as the price holds above the $114K breakout level, the medium-term structure remains strongly bullish. The 4-Hour Chart The 4H chart shows a clean breakout from the recent range and a near-vertical price expansion, confirming the daily momentum. After breaking above the descending channel, Bitcoin formed a strong impulsive leg. As a result, the RSI is now extremely elevated at 78+, hinting at potential short-term exhaustion. The 4H chart also highlights the newly formed Fair Value Gaps stacked below the price, which could get revisited in the coming sessions or days. These FVGs can both attract the price and act as potential support. As long as BTC remains above the 114K block, short dips into this region would be considered bullish retests. Moreover, if the price begins to range around the 121K–122K area, it would allow RSI to cool off and provide fresh momentum for the next breakout, without experiencing much correction. Sentiment Analysis Bitcoin Funding Rates Funding rates have started to spike again, reflecting the surge in long-side leverage after the breakout. This sharp uptick in funding confirms that traders are aggressively chasing the move. While elevated funding is expected during trend continuations, it also introduces risk: the higher the leverage imbalance, the more vulnerable the market becomes to a flush. Historically, when funding remains excessively positive while prices stall or consolidate, it often leads to a liquidation-driven pullback. So far, we haven’t seen aggressive spikes like those in Q1 2024, but it’s something to monitor closely. If the asset fails to push higher while funding stays elevated, a quick shakeout into the 114K zone is possible. Until then, the sentiment remains bullish but slightly overheated, which aligns with current RSI readings and market structure.

Due to the cryptocurrency’s substantial price expansion in the past few years, Strategy now sits at a mindblowing unrealized profit of roughly $30 billion. This is because the company has spent $42.87 billion to acquire its BTC stash of 601,550 bitcoins bought at an average price of $71,268 per unit. Given BTC’s price as of press time ($121,500), this puts Strategy’s fortune at over $73 billion. Strategy has acquired 4,225 BTC for ~$472.5 million at ~$111,827 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 20.2% YTD 2025. As of 7/13/2025, we hodl 601,550 $BTC acquired for ~$42.87 billion at ~$71,268 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/cdUkviddqp — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 14, 2025 Saylor hinted about this purchase yesterday, indicating that some weeks, “you don’t just HODL.” Recall that the company didn’t announce a new acquisition last week, which was somewhat surprising given its history since the US elections in November last year. Strategy’s former CEO has also been particularly vocal on X about different BTC purchases from other companies. In the past few days alone, he has reposted the accumulations completed by the likes of Metaplanet , K33, DigitalX Ltd., Sequans, and the Blockchain Group. The average price of Strategy’s latest purchase means that it was most likely completed in the middle of the previous week when BTC challenged $112,000.

2025-07-14T12:20:23,"Bitcoin’s Astonishing Anomaly: Why Public Search Interest Remains Low Despite Record Highs","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astonishing Anomaly: Why Public Search Interest Remains Low Despite Record Highs Are you observing the incredible surge in Bitcoin ‘s price, nearing its historical peak, yet sensing a strange quietness in the mainstream conversation? It’s not just a feeling. Despite the flagship cryptocurrency, BTC , recently circling near its all-time highs and even touching the impressive $119,000 mark (as reported by Bitcoin.com News), public search interest on Google Trends tells a surprisingly different story. This perplexing disconnect between price action and public curiosity is a fascinating anomaly in the current crypto market , prompting many to ask: what’s truly going on? Unpacking the Bitcoin Paradox: High Prices, Low Buzz For those who have followed Bitcoin ‘s tumultuous journey, bull markets have historically been synonymous with explosive retail euphoria. Think back to 2017 or even 2021 – periods when every dinner table conversation seemed to drift towards crypto, and Google searches for ‘Bitcoin price’ or ‘how to buy crypto’ skyrocketed. These moments were characterized by widespread public engagement, often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) among new investors eager to jump aboard the digital gold rush. However, the current landscape presents a stark contrast. While BTC ‘s price action is undeniably bullish, the accompanying buzz, particularly measured through platforms like Google Trends, is notably subdued. According to data, the keyword search score for Bitcoin now hovers around 55. To put this into perspective, during the peak of the 2017 bull market, this score reached 100, and it hit similar highs in 2021. This begs the question: if Bitcoin is performing so well, why aren’t more people searching for it? A Glimpse into Historical Google Trends Scores vs. Price To better understand this phenomenon, let’s look at a simplified comparison: Period Approx. BTC Price Range Google Trends Score (Keyword: Bitcoin) Dominant Market Driver 2017 Bull Run Peak ~$15,000 – $20,000 ~100 Retail FOMO, ICO Mania 2021 Bull Run Peak ~$60,000 – $69,000 ~100 Retail FOMO, Institutional Interest, DeFi/NFT Boom Current Period (2024) ~$60,000 – $73,000+ ~55 Institutional Adoption (ETFs), Macro Factors This table clearly illustrates the divergence. The lower Google Trends score suggests a different kind of market dynamic is at play, one less reliant on a broad surge in public curiosity. What Does Google Trends Reveal About Search Interest ? Google Trends is a powerful tool for gauging public interest in specific topics. A high score indicates widespread curiosity, often leading to new money flowing into an asset. A lower score, despite high prices, suggests that the buying pressure might be coming from different sources or that the existing holders are simply ‘HODLing’ without the need for constant updates. Several factors could contribute to this muted search interest : Market Maturity: The crypto space, particularly Bitcoin , is no longer a niche phenomenon. It has matured significantly. Many existing holders are seasoned investors who don’t need to Google ‘Bitcoin’ every day. They follow specialized news outlets, forums, and analytical tools. Institutional Adoption: A significant portion of the recent price surge is attributed to institutional capital, especially through the approval and success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the US. These large players don’t rely on general public search trends; they have dedicated research teams and sophisticated trading desks. Their buying doesn’t necessarily translate into Google searches. Alternative Information Channels: The average crypto enthusiast now relies heavily on platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, Telegram groups, Discord servers, and YouTube channels for real-time updates and community discussions. Google search might be less of a first port of call for these individuals. Reduced Retail FOMO: The initial wave of retail investors who might have experienced FOMO in previous cycles might already be in the market. New retail investors might be entering, but perhaps at a slower, more measured pace, or they are being onboarded through more traditional financial avenues (like brokerage accounts offering ETFs) rather than direct crypto exchanges, thus bypassing the need for initial ‘what is Bitcoin?’ searches. Macroeconomic Environment: While Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against inflation by some, the broader macroeconomic environment, including high interest rates and cost-of-living crises in many parts of the world, might be dampening the general public’s willingness or ability to invest in riskier assets, regardless of price performance. Analyzing the BTC Market: A Shift in Demographics? The current behavior of the BTC market suggests a significant demographic shift in its primary drivers. Previously, retail investors were the primary engine, their collective enthusiasm pushing prices higher and generating significant media buzz. Now, the narrative appears to be dominated by institutional inflows. When BlackRock, Fidelity, and other major financial institutions launch Bitcoin ETFs, they provide a regulated, familiar, and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset or navigating complex crypto exchanges. This simplifies the investment process for pension funds, wealth managers, and institutional clients, leading to substantial capital deployment that doesn’t necessarily originate from or correlate with a spike in casual Google searches. Consider the ‘silent accumulation’ theory: existing holders, confident in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, are simply holding or adding to their positions without creating a public spectacle. They are less likely to be ‘googling’ Bitcoin every day because they are already deeply invested and informed through their preferred, specialized channels. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Landscape For investors, understanding this nuanced behavior in the crypto market is crucial. The traditional indicators of retail interest, like Google Trends, might be becoming less relevant as the market matures and institutionalizes. This doesn’t mean retail interest is gone, but rather that its influence on price discovery might be less pronounced compared to previous cycles. What does this mean for the future? A market driven by institutional capital could lead to: Reduced Volatility (Potentially): Institutional investors often operate with longer time horizons and larger capital, which could lead to more stable price movements compared to the rapid pumps and dumps often associated with retail-driven FOMO. Increased Legitimacy: The involvement of major financial players lends significant credibility to Bitcoin and the broader crypto space, paving the way for wider acceptance and integration into traditional finance. Different Price Drivers: Macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and institutional investment decisions may become more dominant price drivers than viral social media trends or sudden spikes in public curiosity. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Investors? Given the current dynamics, how should investors interpret this low search interest amidst high prices? Diversify Your Information Sources: Relying solely on mainstream news or general search trends might not provide a complete picture. Engage with crypto-native news, on-chain analytics, and institutional reports to understand market sentiment and flows. Understand the New Demand Drivers: Recognize that institutional inflows, particularly through ETFs, are a significant force. Monitor ETF flows and institutional sentiment as key indicators. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: Bitcoin’s underlying technology, scarcity, and increasing adoption as a store of value remain strong. Don’t be swayed by a lack of ‘hype’ if the fundamental value proposition holds. Beware of Complacency: While the market might seem calmer, crypto is still a volatile asset class. Conduct thorough due diligence and understand your risk tolerance. Identify Potential Future Catalysts: While retail FOMO isn’t driving this cycle, a significant breakthrough, further regulatory clarity, or a sustained period of price stability could re-ignite broader public interest. A Compelling Summary: The Quiet Evolution of Bitcoin The current state of Bitcoin ‘s market, characterized by soaring prices and surprisingly subdued public search interest , paints a picture of a maturing asset. It suggests a shift from a largely retail-driven speculative asset to one increasingly influenced by sophisticated institutional players and long-term holders. The lack of widespread Google Trends buzz, far from being a negative indicator, might actually signify a healthier, more sustainable growth trajectory for BTC . It’s a market that is evolving, where fundamental value and institutional adoption are perhaps outweighing the ephemeral spikes of retail euphoria. As the crypto market continues to evolve, understanding these changing dynamics will be key for navigating its future successfully.

2025-07-14T12:17:08,"This Crypto is Cheap, Below a Cent, But It Will Create Massive Wealth Like Early Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana","The post This Crypto is Cheap, Below a Cent, But It Will Create Massive Wealth Like Early Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s price increased from under a dollar to near $69,000 in 2021. At the peak, an investment of $100 would have yielded over $69 million. When Ethereum’s price reached $4,800, it had increased 9,500 times from its $0.30 price at its 2015 ICO. And in 18 months, Solana went from $0.22 to over $250, making millionaires out of little wagers overnight. These weren’t just numbers; they were life-altering events. And although those opportunities may seem distant, many crypto insiders believe that one low-priced project, Little Pepe (LILPEPE), is quietly setting itself up for a comparable run. Little Pepe’s Price Tag Is Small, But the Vision Is Not At $0.0013, LILPEPE is technically a sub-penny token. But it’s far from a microcap novelty. This Ethereum-based project is in Stage 4 of its presale and has already raised over $4.3 million, selling more than 3.68 billion tokens out of the 3.75 billion allocated for this round. The final listing price is already set at $0.003, providing presale participants with a guaranteed 130% return before public markets even open their gates. But LILPEPE isn’t gaining attention because it’s cheap. It’s gaining attention because it’s building what no other meme coin has dared to: its own Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain. Why Memes Now Need Infrastructure For years, meme tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu succeeded purely on cultural gravity. They didn’t promise to build, they pledged to belong. And that worked for a time. But the market has matured. Today’s retail investors want more than dog jokes; they want structure, fairness, and tools. Little Pepe Delivers That With Three Critical Ingredients: Sniper-Bot Protection: Built into the chain itself, giving traders a level playing field. Zero-Tax Trading: No hidden costs on buy/sell transactions, a sharp contrast to meme coins with 5–10% token taxes. Pepe’s Pump Pad: A native launchpad designed to help new meme coins launch safely with anti-rug and auto-liquidity lock systems. Together, these features turn Little Pepe from a “funny frog token” into a serious infrastructure layer for future meme coin ecosystems. Community: The Fuel Behind Every Meme Surge While technology matters, every explosive crypto story starts with the community. LILPEPE seems to understand this deeply. The project’s tone navigates a fine line between irreverence and intentionality. Its branding, “the ancient king of memes reborn”, leans into crypto’s love for nostalgia, while the execution shows discipline. Telegram and Discord channels are swelling. Twitter engagement is climbing. And more than 30,000 people have already entered its $777,000 giveaway campaign, where ten presale participants will each receive $77,000 in tokens. This isn’t just community building. It’s ignition. In that short window between presale close and public debut, LILPEPE’s fully diluted valuation could double. But that’s just the beginning. The roadmap suggests a rapid ecosystem expansion, featuring NFT integration, meme DAO governance, staking for liquidity providers, and creator grants for meme developers seeking to launch on the chain. If even a fraction of that rolls out on schedule, demand for $LILPEPE isn’t a hope, it’s a requirement. Why Some Are Calling It “The Next Big One” There’s no guarantee that any project will become the next Bitcoin or Ethereum. But investors aren’t necessarily looking for the next 69,000× return. Many are seeking their next 50× or 100×, enough to transform their financial future. LILPEPE, with its low entry price, built-in upside from listing, and infrastructure-driven narrative, fits the profile. It’s early. It’s under a cent. And it’s building tools that other meme tokens will depend on to thrive. Those who believed in Bitcoin in 2010 or Ethereum in 2015 didn’t always fully understand the tech. But they understood momentum. And right now, that same energy is starting to swirl around LILPEPE. Conclusion Bitcoin, Ether, and Solana were once dismissed as lottery tickets, priced at mere pennies per coin. However, they ultimately enriched a select few. Little Pepe is still in the same position, still cheap, constantly made fun of, but quietly building proper foundations. The window is still open. However, like all great crypto stories, it won’t last long.

2025-07-14T12:00:18,"Bitcoin’s Unseen Ascent: Why Market Euphoria Is Still Ahead, According to Alphractal CEO","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Unseen Ascent: Why Market Euphoria Is Still Ahead, According to Alphractal CEO Are we truly in a full-blown bull market for Bitcoin, or is there more to come? For many seasoned observers and new entrants alike, the recent price action of Bitcoin has been nothing short of exhilarating. Yet, despite significant gains and renewed optimism, a crucial indicator suggests that the peak of Bitcoin market euphoria might still be on the horizon. This insight comes from Joao Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, a prominent crypto investment data analysis platform, who points to a specific metric that often precedes parabolic rallies. Understanding the Spot-Perpetual Gap in Crypto Market Analysis To truly grasp Wedson’s perspective, we need to delve into a nuanced aspect of crypto market analysis : the relationship between Bitcoin’s spot price and its perpetual contract price. On platforms like Binance, the spot price reflects the current market rate for immediate delivery of Bitcoin, while the perpetual price refers to the price of perpetual futures contracts, which are derivatives that mimic spot market prices but never expire. Here’s why this distinction is vital: Spot Price: Represents actual demand and supply for Bitcoin itself. Perpetual Price: Reflects the sentiment and leverage of derivatives traders. When the perpetual price is significantly higher than the spot price (a positive premium), it often indicates strong bullish sentiment, as traders are willing to pay more for future exposure, often using leverage. Conversely, a lower perpetual price (a negative premium or discount) suggests caution or even bearish sentiment. Wedson highlighted that the spot price on Binance still trades above the perpetual price. This seemingly small detail is a powerful signal. It means that while there’s buying interest in the immediate market, derivatives traders – often the most speculative and leverage-hungry participants – are still exercising a degree of caution. They are not yet piling into perpetual futures with the kind of aggressive, high-premium buying that characterizes peak market euphoria. What Does This Mean for the Bitcoin Price Outlook? The current state, where spot price exceeds perpetual price, suggests that the market hasn’t fully embraced the ‘risk-on’ mentality that typically drives the most explosive phases of a bull run. This cautious stance among derivatives traders is precisely why Wedson believes we haven’t entered true Bitcoin market euphoria . However, the narrative isn’t entirely static. Wedson noted a critical development: the gap between the spot and perpetual prices is narrowing. This trend is a clear indicator of a gradual shift towards growing optimism. It implies that the cautious sentiment is slowly eroding, and derivatives traders are becoming more willing to take on leveraged positions, pushing the perpetual price closer to, and eventually potentially above, the spot price. Historically, a positive flip in this metric – where the perpetual price moves above the spot price and maintains a premium – has often served as a precursor to significant price movements. Why? Because it signals that the market is ready to embrace higher levels of leverage and, crucially, a surge in the ‘Fear Of Missing Out’ (FOMO) phenomenon. When FOMO takes hold, retail and institutional investors alike rush into the market, driving prices up rapidly, often leading to parabolic rallies. Decoding the Bullish Bitcoin Trend: A Historical Perspective To appreciate the significance of Wedson’s observation, it’s helpful to look at past market cycles. During previous Bitcoin bull runs, particularly in 2017 and 2021, the transition from a cautious market to one driven by euphoria was clearly marked by this very metric. Once the perpetual funding rates (an extension of the spot-perpetual gap) turned consistently positive and high, signaling aggressive long positioning, Bitcoin often entered its most explosive growth phases. Consider the dynamics: Early Bull Phase: Often driven by fundamental accumulation, institutional adoption, and cautious retail interest. The spot market leads, while derivatives remain relatively subdued or even slightly discounted. This is where we might be now. Euphoria Phase: Characterized by rampant speculation, high leverage, and widespread FOMO. Derivatives markets become extremely active, with perpetual contracts trading at significant premiums. This is the ‘breakout signal’ Wedson refers to. The fact that the gap is narrowing, even if still negative, suggests that the market is ‘priming’ itself. It’s like a coiled spring, building pressure before a significant release. This implies that the current bullish Bitcoin trend , while strong, may still have a substantial leg up before it reaches its peak. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what does this mean for you as an investor or market observer? Alphractal’s analysis provides several key takeaways: Patience is Key: While the market is trending up, the absence of full-blown euphoria suggests that there might be more sustained growth ahead rather than an immediate top. This isn’t a signal to sell, but rather to observe closely. Monitor the Gap: Keep an eye on the spot-perpetual premium. A sustained flip to a positive premium, especially accompanied by rising funding rates, could indeed serve as a powerful ‘breakout signal’ for an accelerated rally. This is a crucial metric for understanding market sentiment beyond just price action. Beware of Over-Leverage (Eventually): While the current environment suggests caution, the eventual shift to euphoria will likely involve significant leverage. Understanding this dynamic can help you avoid getting caught in the inevitable corrections that follow periods of extreme greed. Focus on Fundamentals: Even as sentiment indicators provide valuable clues, always balance your perspective with fundamental developments like institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It’s important to remember that market analysis is not an exact science, and no single indicator guarantees future price movements. However, insights from platforms like Alphractal provide a deeper understanding of underlying market mechanics and participant psychology, offering a more nuanced view than simply looking at price charts. The Road Ahead: Is True Bitcoin Market Euphoria Inevitable? While Wedson’s analysis suggests that Bitcoin market euphoria is not yet here, the narrowing gap between spot and perpetual prices paints a compelling picture of a market preparing for its next major move. The historical precedent is strong: when derivatives traders shed their caution and embrace leverage, the market tends to react with significant upward momentum driven by FOMO. The journey towards full market euphoria is often marked by increasing retail participation, mainstream media attention, and a pervasive sense that ‘everyone is getting rich.’ We are seeing elements of this, but perhaps not yet the fever pitch that defines true euphoria. The current bullish Bitcoin trend seems to be building a solid foundation, rather than peaking prematurely. The breakout signal, according to Wedson, will be a sustained positive gap. When that happens, buckle up. It could signify the beginning of the most explosive phase of this market cycle, characterized by rapid price appreciation driven by both fundamental strength and speculative fervor. Until then, the market remains in a state of cautious optimism, slowly but surely paving the way for what could be an truly exciting period for Bitcoin.

2025-07-14T12:00:00,"Bitcoin Still Looks Like The Smartest Bet In Crypto, Even At These Highs","Summary Bitcoin remains a buy, even after a strong run, as mainstream adoption and institutional interest accelerate. On-chain data shows strong holder conviction, low exchange reserves, and robust network security, supporting higher prices. Regulatory risks persist, but the tone is shifting toward integration, while macro trends like potential rate cuts favor Bitcoin. I expect Bitcoin to consolidate between $105K–$125K, with upside to $150K+ if bullish catalysts emerge. Buying in tranches makes sense. Why I Still Like Bitcoin at These Prices Even after Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) huge run , I still think there’s a lot more gas in the tank. Since the last time I called it a buy at $83,000 back in March , Bitcoin’s climbed more than 40%. That’s not just a good trade—that’s a statement. And to me, what stands out isn’t just the price. It’s how the entire conversation around Bitcoin is changing. There’s this sense now that Bitcoin isn’t just a toy for traders or something you brag about at a tech conference. It’s moving into the financial mainstream—maybe not everywhere but in a big enough way that it actually matters. So, where do I land? I actually feel stronger about owning Bitcoin now than I did when it was lower, which probably sounds crazy to anyone who just chases dips. I think the market still isn’t seeing the full picture, and there’s a real shot for Bitcoin to punch past $150,000 if even a few things break right. Sure, we might get a pullback, and yeah, there’s always noise, but I don’t see a better asymmetric bet out there right now. BTC-USD Price (Author, YF) Why Bitcoin Stands Out If you ask me, Bitcoin is still the center of gravity in crypto, and nothing else is really close. It’s the only coin that’s truly decentralized; nobody controls it, and its reputation is battle-tested at this point. I keep seeing people talking about the “next Bitcoin” or hyping whatever’s hot this week, but honestly, BTC is still the name every serious investor—especially the institutional crowd—wants exposure to. Under the hood, the tech isn’t standing still either. There’s been progress, like Taproot upgrades and layer-two solutions, but it’s not really about bells and whistles anymore. The big story is more companies holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset, and there’s real chatter (not just internet rumors) about some governments considering adding BTC to their reserves. I think the broader market is just starting to get this. How Bitcoin Fits in the Bigger Crypto Picture Zooming out, I’m seeing Bitcoin keep its dominance even as headlines gush about altcoins gaining fans and “new tech.” There’s fresh interest in all sorts of crypto projects, and sure, some altcoins are gaining fans, but BTC still owns the institutional narrative. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF is now bringing in more fee revenue than some of its most famous stock funds, which says a lot about where big money is pointing. Regulation is the wildcard, as always. Lately, the tone feels less like “we’re going to kill crypto” and more like “okay, let’s figure out how to fit this in.” That’s a pretty big shift, and the vibe in the U.S. is that rate cuts might actually come this year, which is usually good for assets like Bitcoin. On the competitive side, I know Ethereum and stablecoins are growing up fast, but I don’t think they threaten Bitcoin’s spot as the digital gold standard anytime soon. What the Data Says About Bitcoin Here’s what’s really jumping out at me on the data side: people who actually believe in Bitcoin are holding tight, not selling. The number of coins sitting on exchanges is near record lows, which means less BTC is up for grabs if demand spikes. The hashrate—the raw power securing the network—is as strong as ever, and even with all the drama around mining costs and regulation, the backbone of the network isn’t showing cracks. Bitcoin Exchange Reserve (CryptoQuant) As for the price chart, Bitcoin’s up 73% year over year and more than 40% in just the last three months. It’s been volatile (when is it not?), but the swings actually feel less wild than past cycles at these heights. The $98,000 area looks like a real support level now. When I check out the options market, the $100K strike keeps coming up, which is probably going to be a key battleground. Compared to other coins, BTC is still the main way for big investors to dip their toes into the crypto world. Is Bitcoin Overpriced or Still a Deal? People keep asking, “Isn’t it too late?” My honest answer is no—at least not based on the usual metrics that matter in this space. When I look at the numbers and the charts, I don’t see the kind of “overheated” signals you get at the top of a bubble. The stock-to-flow chart, for example, shows that Bitcoin’s price tends to track right along with its scarcity over time, especially after each halving—right now, that puts a “fair value” north of $120,000, which fits with what we’re seeing. Bitcoin Stock to Flow (BiTBO) Meanwhile, the long-term holder data and the steady drop in exchange reserves back this up. People aren’t rushing to sell, and coins keep moving off exchanges, which usually means less sell pressure and more conviction from holders. All in all, the on-chain stats and the big-picture models both suggest that Bitcoin’s current price is actually right in line with its fundamentals, not disconnected. Long Term Holder Supply (BiTBO) Personally, if I step back and just imagine how this could go, I wouldn’t be surprised if Bitcoin spends some time hanging out in the $100K to $125K area. That’s a breather, not a disaster. Now, if something big goes sideways—like a nasty regulatory surprise or some major financial panic—I could absolutely picture a dip down to $90,000 or so. But honestly, every cycle, it seems like those “panic lows” keep getting higher, not lower. On the other hand, if we get a wave of bullish news—maybe more ETF hype, or especially if a country suddenly decides to buy Bitcoin for its reserves—then I wouldn’t rule out a big run toward $150,000 or even $200,000. That’s just how wild this market can be. What the Headlines Are Really Saying Honestly, most headlines around Bitcoin right now are upbeat. Prices keep hitting new highs, the ETF story just won’t die down, and even big-name banks are tossing out wild price targets . Even the folks who usually bet against the crowd aren’t really predicting a crash—they’re just bracing for some bumps. Sure, whenever something ugly hits the news, like a geopolitical scare or talk of new tariffs, Bitcoin can dip for a day or two, but so far, those drops have been short-lived. What actually stands out is how the conversation feels different this time. Bitcoin used to be all about internet hype or social media buzz. Now, the talk is coming from boardrooms, from Wall Street, and even from politicians. I honestly don’t think the average investor gets just how much this shift matters for where Bitcoin might go from here. What Could Go Wrong? If you want to know what could mess all this up, it’s the same story as always: regulation. If a major country really wanted to crack down—shut down miners, block ETF trading, or make it a legal headache—it could hurt. But most of the chatter these days is about finding a way forward, not pulling the plug. The economy matters too; if we get hit with a surprise recession or interest rates shoot up, crypto might take a spill along with everything else. Tech risks and security blowups are always out there, but so far, the system’s way tougher than it used to be. I watch altcoins like everyone else, but let’s be real: none of them come close to Bitcoin’s trust factor or brand. Some people say this rally feels “too easy” and that everyone’s too bullish, but honestly, I see more skepticism and “I missed it” regret than euphoria. In my view, lots of folks still aren’t fully in. What’s Next for Bitcoin? So, what happens next? I wouldn’t be surprised at all if Bitcoin takes a breather. Maybe it drops 10–20%; maybe it just moves sideways for a while. I don’t see that as a problem. If you step back, ETF demand keeps rising, the rules are becoming clearer, and the big picture macro stuff—think potential Fed rate cuts or a weaker dollar—still seems to lean Bitcoin’s way. Everyone’s watching for the next halving, and if the past means anything, that could set off some fireworks in the next year or two. I’m watching for more ETF headlines, any country adding BTC to their balance sheet, or a big regulatory announcement. How This Could Play Out In a worst-case world—maybe a nasty government crackdown, a financial crisis, or some black swan hack—Bitcoin might fall to $90K. But honestly, I doubt it goes much lower, and each cycle the “bottom” seems to climb. The most likely thing to me is we stay in a range, maybe $105K to $125K, as bigger investors quietly scoop up coins and the market sorts out the noise. But if we get another shot of good news, like a flood of ETF buying or a major government getting involved, I don’t see why we couldn’t shoot toward $150K or even higher. This is crypto—crazy things happen. My Bottom Line on Bitcoin So here’s where I land: I’m sticking with my call— buy . Even at these prices, Bitcoin is showing all the signs of getting ready for another big move up. The supply/demand picture looks better than ever, and the narrative has shifted so much that I actually think most people are still underestimating how important Bitcoin is becoming. If I were buying here, I’d probably do it in chunks—put some money to work now and add more if we get a dip to the $105K–$110K range.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801041-bitcoin-still-looks-like-smartest-bet-crypto-even-these-highs?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

Trading volume surged by 87.37%, crossing $210 billion, indicating a surge in market activity ahead of the U.S. CPI data release date, which is set for tomorrow. Talking about the bluechip coins, Bitcoin price is at $122,525, up 12.13% in the past 7 days, while Ethereum has outpaced with a 19.62% jump. The Fear & Greed Index sits at a greed-driven score of 70, signaling euphoria, but also caution. So, will the crypto bull run continue, or is a pullback in store? Join me as I decode the possible trend. U.S. CPI Data: The Volatility Trigger? All eyes now turn to the U.S. CPI data release on July 15 at 08:30 ET. The forecast stands at 2.6%, up from the previous 2.4%. A hotter-than-expected print could trigger a broad risk-off reaction, introducing volatility across crypto and equities alike. Conversely, a favorable CPI number could further extend the rally. Bullish Momentum Persists? It is worth noting that several market metrics continue to support the ongoing bull trend. As per CoinGlass , Funding rates for BTC at 0.0105% and ETH at 0.0107% remain modest. Which implies that leverage on majors is under control. Bitcoin’s breakout above $106,500 marked a critical technical acceleration, with the price currently in a vertical expansion phase. At the same time, altcoin funding rates are flashing red. Assets like LA/USDT and HIFI/USDT on Bitget are showing extreme funding levels above 0.26%–0.32%, which highlights the possibility of liquidation cascades due to overleveraged long positioning. Signs of a Pullback Still on Cards? However, short-term caution is warranted. A key on-chain indicator, the Bitcoin: Exchange Stablecoin Ratio, has surged from 5.5 to 5.95 in just one week. This suggests that stablecoin reserves on exchanges are not keeping pace with BTC deposits. This mirrors declining immediate buying power, a condition that often paves the way for short-term pullbacks. Analyst Views Michael Van de Poppe cites that Bitcoin has cleared multiple liquidity zones and could move toward $125k–$130k range. Any dip near the $110k–$105k zone may offer opportunities for spot accumulation. Successively, BTC’s next price move will determine the broader market’s projection. Furthermore, RSI on Bitcoin’s 4H chart is hovering near overbought territory, with signs of flattening momentum. While this doesn’t confirm a reversal, it aligns with the idea of an overheated short-term structure. Conclusion While the macro bull trend remains intact, a short-term pullback within the next 48 hours is likely. This would be driven by weakening stablecoin liquidity, excessive altcoin leverage, and macro uncertainty. However, such dips are expected to be temporary and present buying opportunities if CPI data and technical structures remain supportive. FAQs Will the crypto bull run continue, or is a pullback imminent? A short-term pullback within the next 48 hours is likely, owing to factors such as weakening stablecoin liquidity, growing altcoin leverage, among others. What is 1 Bitcoin price now?

In contrast, new Bitcoin supply entering the market from miners comes in at a rate of about $1.638 billion in BTC per month. “Looking at accumulation by wallet size: shrimps, crabs, and fish – wallets with Persistent net absorption across a wide base of holders is creating measurable supply-side tightening.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode adds that long-term holders, or entities that have held their coins for at least 155 days, are also gobbling up Bitcoin at a rate that’s “significantly larger than monthly issuance.” “’BTC balance on exchanges dropping = supply shock’ is a meme. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t supply constraints. Long-term holders are absorbing more BTC than miners issue. That’s where pressure builds.” Source: Glassnode/X The analytics firm also says that despite new all-time high prices for Bitcoin, the BTC bull market is still going strong based on the long-term holder net unrealized profit and loss (NUPL). Glassnode data shows that the long-term NUPL, an on-chain metric that tracks whether long-term holders are in profit or loss, remains below historical peak levels. The data suggests that investors who bought at least six months ago are still holding and have not yet begun aggressively taking profits. “While BTC has made a new ATH (all-time high) above $118000.

We’re watching closely for confirmation of this trend over the coming week.” Additionally, crypto exchange VALR co-founder and CEO Farzam Ehsani commented that BTC’s all-time highs are exciting, but “what’s truly transformative is its promise for humanity: a borderless, politically neutral money that restores financial sovereignty to individuals.” Bitcoin is “a potential global reserve currency, free from the manipulation we’ve seen throughout monetary history. As this vision unfolds, Bitcoin’s price will appreciate far beyond current levels, though with drawdowns along the way,” Ehsani argues.

However, ISO 20022 is laying the groundwork for DLT adoption via APIs , which could become a major catalyst for XRP in the future.

Investors are excited by the rise, which surpassed the peak of $118,000 last week. Prominent Bitcoin supporter Kiyosaki expressed his thoughts on X, describing the price increase as “great news” for existing Bitcoin owners. Those who “never pulled the trigger” on investing, he said, are now at a disadvantage because they “own nothing” in this quickly rising asset. “I suggest starting very small… starting with a Satoshi,” he advised, highlighting that even small investments can provide exposure to Bitcoin’s potential. “I am buying one more coin,” citing ongoing economic uncertainty as a key parameter for his continued accumulation. A Path to $1 Million Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin price prediction is staggering: he expects BTC to hit $200,000 this year and climb to $1 million by 2035. His confidence stems from Bitcoin’s scarcity and its role as a hedge against economic instability. “I will not buy any more… until I know where the economy is going,” he noted, signaling a strategic approach to his investments amid global financial uncertainty. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Beats Gold as 2025’s Top Asset with $123K Price Breakout , Will Warren Buffett Buy Bitcoin?

Despite Buffett’s skeptical views on Bitcoin, Kiyoshi assumes that the latter may use the money to buy Bitcoin after a possible price dip. Kiyosaki believes that Buffett’s stance might soften, leading the Berkshire Hathaway CEO to consider investing in cryptocurrency. A Turning Point for Bitcoin? With Bitcoin reaching new highs, Kiyosaki’s message is clear – even small steps into crypto could go a long way.

2025-07-14T11:30:24,"Core DAO’s Monumental BTC Transfer Sparks Market Speculation","BitcoinWorld Core DAO’s Monumental BTC Transfer Sparks Market Speculation The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with a significant development: Core DAO , the decentralized autonomous organization at the forefront of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Bitcoin layer, recently executed a substantial BTC transfer . This move involved 1,803 Bitcoin, valued at an astonishing $214 million, which was sent to the Binance exchange. This massive transaction, originating from wallets linked to the organization, has immediately ignited discussions and speculation across the entire crypto market , prompting many to question its underlying reasons and potential ripple effects. What does such a colossal movement signify for the future of decentralized finance and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem? Understanding Core DAO and Its Bitcoin Layer Ambition Before diving into the implications of this monumental BTC transfer , it’s crucial to understand who Core DAO is and their pivotal role in the evolving blockchain landscape. Core DAO is not just another decentralized autonomous organization; it’s the driving force behind a unique Proof-of-Stake Bitcoin layer. This innovative approach aims to combine the robust security and decentralization of Bitcoin with the flexibility and scalability needed for modern decentralized applications (dApps) and services. The core idea behind Core DAO’s Bitcoin layer is to enable Bitcoin holders to participate in a PoS consensus mechanism, thereby earning rewards and contributing to the security of a new network that leverages Bitcoin’s inherent strengths. This creates a bridge between Bitcoin’s foundational role as digital gold and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi), offering new utility for the world’s largest cryptocurrency without altering its core protocol. By allowing staked Bitcoin to secure a new layer, Core DAO seeks to unlock liquidity and foster innovation within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with BTC. Decoding the Massive BTC Transfer: Why Now? The transfer of 1,803 BTC, approximately $214 million, from Core DAO’s staked wallets to Binance is undoubtedly a move that warrants close examination. While Core DAO has not yet released an official statement detailing the reasons behind this significant BTC transfer , the crypto community is actively speculating on several plausible scenarios. Understanding these possibilities is key to grasping the potential impact on the crypto market and the future trajectory of the Bitcoin layer . Several factors could be at play: Liquidity Management and Treasury Optimization: As a large DAO, Core DAO manages substantial assets. Moving a portion of its Bitcoin holdings to a major exchange like Binance could be a strategic decision to enhance liquidity. This might be necessary for operational expenses, upcoming development initiatives, or even rebalancing the DAO’s treasury to manage risk or capitalize on new opportunities. Large organizations often need readily available capital for various strategic maneuvers. Staking Rewards Distribution: Given that the funds originated from “staked wallets,” one theory suggests this transfer could be related to the distribution of staking rewards to participants. While direct transfers to an exchange for distribution might seem unusual, it could be part of a larger process involving converting rewards into other assets or facilitating withdrawals for a broad base of stakers. Market Making or Strategic Partnerships: A significant amount of Bitcoin could be moved to an exchange to facilitate market-making activities, aiming to improve liquidity for Core DAO’s native token or other associated assets. Alternatively, it could be part of a larger strategic partnership with an exchange or another entity, requiring the movement of a substantial asset block. Preparing for a New Phase or Initiative: This transfer might signal the impending launch of a new product, service, or a major upgrade within the Core DAO ecosystem. Such initiatives often require significant capital for development, marketing, or securing partnerships, and having funds readily accessible on an exchange could streamline these processes. Diversification or Risk Management: While less likely for a direct transfer to an exchange, some DAOs engage in treasury diversification. However, moving to an exchange typically implies an intent to sell or utilize the funds, rather than simply holding them for diversification. It could be a move to de-risk a specific pool or reallocate capital. The sheer volume of the transfer suggests a calculated and significant decision by the Core DAO , one that is likely to have long-term implications for its operations and its role in the decentralized finance space. Implications for the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Ecosystem The Core DAO ‘s substantial BTC transfer resonates deeply within the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. DAOs, by their very nature, are designed to be transparent and community-governed. However, managing vast treasuries, especially those holding significant amounts of flagship cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, presents unique challenges and opportunities. This event highlights several key aspects of DAO treasury management in DeFi: Transparency vs. Strategic Discretion: While DAOs strive for transparency, strategic financial maneuvers often require a degree of discretion to prevent front-running or adverse market reactions. The community’s immediate reaction to this transfer underscores the ongoing tension between these two ideals. Impact on Trust and Governance: How a DAO manages its treasury, especially large asset movements, can significantly impact community trust and governance participation. Clear communication post-transfer will be crucial for Core DAO to maintain its community’s confidence and ensure alignment with its long-term vision for the Bitcoin layer . Liquidity Provision and Market Health: The ability of DAOs to efficiently manage and deploy capital is vital for the health and growth of their respective ecosystems. Whether this transfer is for liquidity provision, strategic investment, or another purpose, it demonstrates the dynamic financial operations that underpin large DeFi protocols. As DeFi continues to mature, the practices surrounding DAO treasury management, including large-scale asset movements, will increasingly come under scrutiny. This BTC transfer serves as a potent reminder of the financial power wielded by major DAOs and their potential to influence the wider market. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Market? A BTC transfer of this magnitude, especially from a prominent entity like Core DAO , inevitably sends ripples through the entire crypto market . While a $214 million transaction might not single-handedly crash or pump Bitcoin’s price, it certainly adds to market chatter and can influence sentiment, particularly among traders and institutional players monitoring large whale movements. Here’s how such a transfer can impact the market: Price Speculation: The immediate concern for many is whether Core DAO intends to sell these Bitcoin holdings. A large sell-off could exert downward pressure on BTC price, while a strategic deployment could signal bullish long-term plans. The uncertainty itself can lead to increased volatility. Market Sentiment: Large transfers to exchanges are often interpreted as a precursor to selling, which can foster a bearish sentiment. Conversely, if the purpose is revealed to be beneficial (e.g., funding a major development or partnership), it could bolster confidence. Liquidity Dynamics: Moving such a large sum to Binance increases the exchange’s available liquidity for Bitcoin. This can be beneficial for high-volume traders but also means that if a large sell order were to be placed, it could be absorbed more easily, potentially mitigating extreme price swings. Precedent for Other DAOs: Other decentralized autonomous organizations might observe Core DAO’s actions closely. Successful or unsuccessful outcomes from this transfer could influence how other DAOs manage their own substantial treasuries and engage with centralized exchanges. Ultimately, the long-term impact on the crypto market will depend heavily on Core DAO’s subsequent actions and their transparent communication regarding the purpose of this significant asset movement. The market is always seeking clarity, and the absence of it can often lead to amplified speculation. Navigating the Future of the Bitcoin Layer The recent BTC transfer by Core DAO is not just a financial event; it also has significant implications for the ongoing development and adoption of its Bitcoin layer . As a project aiming to expand Bitcoin’s utility, Core DAO faces the dual challenge of maintaining decentralization while facilitating large-scale operations. This transaction highlights the complexities involved in building a robust and functional decentralized finance ecosystem on top of Bitcoin. Key considerations for the future of the Core DAO Bitcoin layer include: Decentralization Concerns: While the transfer came from “staked wallets” linked to the organization, any large movement to a centralized exchange raises questions about the degree of decentralization in treasury management and decision-making. Future transparency on such matters will be crucial for community trust. Ecosystem Development: If the funds are indeed earmarked for development, marketing, or strategic partnerships, this could accelerate the growth and adoption of Core DAO’s Bitcoin layer, bringing more users and dApps into its ecosystem. This could be a powerful catalyst for its expansion. Competitive Landscape: The race to build effective Bitcoin layers and sidechains is competitive. Core DAO’s ability to execute large-scale financial maneuvers efficiently could give it an edge, provided these moves align with its long-term vision and community expectations. Regulatory Scrutiny: Large transfers to centralized exchanges can sometimes attract regulatory attention. Core DAO, like other major DeFi projects, must navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment, ensuring compliance while fostering innovation. The success of Core DAO’s Bitcoin layer will ultimately hinge on its ability to deliver on its promises of scalability and utility, while maintaining the core tenets of decentralization and transparency that are fundamental to the ethos of Bitcoin and the wider crypto market . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For investors, developers, and enthusiasts in the crypto market , the Core DAO ‘s BTC transfer offers several actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Core DAO regarding the purpose of the transfer. Transparency is key, and understanding the ‘why’ behind such moves is critical for informed decision-making. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like Arkham and Onchain Lens provide valuable insights into large transactions. Learning to interpret these data points can give you an edge in understanding market dynamics. Assess Project Fundamentals: Beyond a single large transaction, evaluate Core DAO’s long-term vision, technological progress, community engagement, and governance structure. These fundamentals are more indicative of a project’s health than short-term price movements. Diversify and Manage Risk: As always, the volatile nature of the crypto market necessitates a diversified portfolio and robust risk management strategies. Don’t let single events dictate your entire investment approach. This event underscores the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the decentralized finance space, where large capital movements can signal both opportunities and potential shifts. A Defining Moment for Core DAO and the Bitcoin Layer The recent 1,803 BTC transfer by Core DAO to Binance is more than just a large transaction; it’s a pivotal moment that underscores the growing sophistication and scale of operations within the decentralized finance ecosystem. While the immediate reasons remain speculative, this move has ignited significant discussion across the crypto market , highlighting the critical role of treasury management, transparency, and strategic decision-making for large DAOs. Whether it signals a new phase of development for the Bitcoin layer , a strategic liquidity play, or a distribution event, the implications are far-reaching. The coming weeks will likely shed more light on Core DAO’s intentions, shaping perceptions and potentially influencing future trends for Bitcoin-centric DeFi solutions. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, events like these serve as crucial reminders of the constant innovation and strategic maneuvers that define this exciting space.

Unlucky Whale Loses Big on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and This Altcoin!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started crypto week in the US on a high. The price of BTC broke a record by surpassing $123,000, while investors who had expected a decline were disappointed. At this point, according to Coinglass data, $622 million worth of short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Traders who expected Bitcoin to drop after last week's ATH and opened short positions suffered huge losses. One of these was the trader named Qwatio, following the big whale James Wynn, who lost his $100 million completely. Qwatio also suffered great losses, though not as much as Wynn. According to Lookonchain's post, the massive short positions of an investor named Qwatio, worth $334 million, were completely liquidated in just 3 hours. These short positions included transactions of 1,743 Bitcoin (worth $211 million), 33,743 Ethereum (worth $102.3 million), and 15 million FARTCOIN (worth $20.6 million). Liquidations in BTC, ETH, and FARTCOIN short positions caused Qwatio to lose $25.8 million. Qwatio experienced a similar situation in June, liquidating various long and short positions eight times and losing $12.5 million. But Qwatio didn't lose all the time. He made over $10 million in profits on TRUMP and MELANIA. Accordingly, Qwatio opened a long position before Trump's announcement of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency reserves, making a $6.8 million profit on MELANIA and a $3.5 million profit on MELANIA. Gambler @qwatio 's massive short positions worth $334M were fully liquidated in just 3 hours, including: 1,743 $BTC ($211M), 33,743 $ETH ($102.3M), and 15M $FARTCOIN ($20.6M).

2025-07-14T11:30:05,"El Salvador Crosses Bitcoin Holdings Over $760 Million","The post El Salvador Crosses Bitcoin Holdings Over $760 Million appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News El Salvador’s Bitcoin (BTC) holdings have skyrocketed, crossing $760 million as the value of BTC surpassed $122,000 over the weekend. Despite enduring the failure of Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, the country continued to buy holdings in digital assets. Several industry leaders and sovereign powers criticized El Salvador’s planning, which has now shaped into a fruitful investment. Despite Previous Criticism, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Stash Tops $760 Million Currently, El Salvador holds over 6,237 BTC, making the nation one of the most valuable sovereign crypto reserves in the world. In early 2025, the country removed its regulation of Bitcoin as legal tender after facing harsh criticism. Several critics blamed El Salvador’s poor policy-making for the country’s sovereign debt. Additionally, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to limit its Bitcoin ambitions. However, despite enduring objections, President Nayib Bukele’s administration continued to buy Bitcoin as a sovereign asset. The activity, which was once condemned, is now appearing as a remarkable outcome for the country as it holds over $762 million worth of BTC in the sovereign strategic Bitcoin reserve. El Salvador: A Trailblazer for Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Pravanv Agarwal, independent director at Jetking Infotrain India, is one of the several entities acknowledging El Salvador’s BTC hit. He encouraged other countries to consider Bitcoin as part of their long-term strategic asset. He said, “The mark-to-market gains by El Salvador are a great indicator of how this approach accrues value over a rolling four-to-five-year period.” Agarwal added, El Salvador’s president holds the support of its elected representatives, which is why this Bitcoin surge became possible. Countries that previously hesitated in regulating a national strategic bitcoin reserve can now follow the lead of El Salvador to reach high ends in terms of cryptocurrency.
