2025-07-14T05:57:08,"Can Donald Trump Remove Fed Chairman Jerome Powell? He May Have Found a Way","The possibility of US President Donald Trump dismissing Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been raised again. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said today that Trump may fire Powell due to cost overruns on the Fed's headquarters renovation project. It's well known that the Trump administration has been pressuring Powell to cut interest rates for a long time. This pressure has fueled concerns about the Fed's independence, and the mere possibility of Powell's dismissal has previously significantly shaken markets. Indeed, earlier this year, even such a rumor triggered a rise in interest rates and a sell-off in the markets. Although Trump said last Friday that he would not fire Powell, Hassett's statements indicated that the possibility could be on the table again. Related News: Bitcoin's Weekend Breakout: Price Breaks All-Time High Record Again - Here's What We Know The White House has ratcheted up the pressure by alleging a $700 million budget overrun on the Fed's Washington headquarters renovation project. On July 10, Office of Budget and Management Director Russ Vought sent a letter to Powell, questioning the project and requesting clarification on its legality. Vought's letter gives Powell seven business days to respond, which falls at the end of this week and could give Trump the opportunity to take action before the next Fed meeting begins on July 29. Speaking to ABC, Hassett said, “Whether the president will pursue this path depends on the Fed's response.” When asked whether Trump could fire Powell, Hassett said, “That's under review, but if there's a justification, yes, he could.” Jerome Powell's term expires in May. Meanwhile, speculation that Hassett could succeed Powell is gaining traction. Economic circles consider Hassett, one of the most influential figures in the White House, a strong candidate. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-14T05:51:35,"Satoshi Nakamoto’s Wealth Soars to $132.8B as Bitcoin Hits $120K, Becoming 11th Richest","Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has vaulted into the ranks of the world’s wealthiest individuals as Bitcoin surged past $120,000 on Sunday. Key Takeaways: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth over $132.8 billion. Analysts predict Nakamoto could rise to second richest by 2026 if Bitcoin grows at its historical rate. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham estimates Nakamoto holds roughly 1.096 million BTC spread across thousands of wallets, valued at over $132.8 billion at current prices. The staggering fortune theoretically places Nakamoto at 11th on Forbes’ billionaire list, overtaking tech magnate Michael Dell, whose net worth sits at $125.1 billion. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Rise to Continue Analysts believe Nakamoto’s rise may continue. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted in early June that if Bitcoin maintains its typical 50% annual growth, Nakamoto could reach second place on the billionaire list by 2026. Balchunas highlighted the founder’s decision never to cash out, comparing Nakamoto to legendary investor Jack Bogle, who amassed a modest fortune despite revolutionizing the investment world. If bitcoin does its normal 50%/ann then Satoshi will pass Buffett this year and Zuck sometime next year-ish to be #2 richest in world (Elon has huge lead). It's fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in. It echoes Jack Bogle in that regard https://t.co/tu9MRzUD5h — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 2, 2025 Compared to other large Bitcoin holders, Nakamoto’s stash is unmatched. Corporations and custodians collectively hold about 847,000 BTC, or roughly 4% of Bitcoin’s capped supply. Notable individual holders include the Winklevoss twins with around 70,000 BTC, venture capitalist Tim Draper with about 30,000 BTC purchased at a 2014 auction, and Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, who reportedly holds close to 18,000 BTC privately. Notably, Forbes’ rankings exclude cryptocurrency holdings, focusing instead on publicly verifiable assets like stocks. Despite Bitcoin’s historic climb, Nakamoto still trails behind the likes of Elon Musk, who leads the list with an estimated $404 billion fortune. For Nakamoto to claim the top spot, Bitcoin would need to jump approximately 208% to around $370,000, assuming the wealth of other billionaires remains unchanged. The price leap would propel Nakamoto ahead of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who hold fortunes of $274 billion each. $20K Bitcoin Sent to Satoshi’s Wallet Last month, an unknown wallet transferred $20,000 worth of Bitcoin to Nakamoto’s Genesis Block address, marking the largest movement to the Bitcoin creator’s wallet in four months. Analysts from Arkham Intelligence said the transaction may have been either an accidental exchange withdrawal or a deliberate tribute from an early Bitcoin supporter honoring Nakamoto. The recent transfer follows a pattern of periodic large donations to Satoshi’s wallets, often linked to exchange withdrawals. Historical data shows transfers ranging from thousands to over a million dollars over the years. The dormant wallets now hold approximately $117 billion in Bitcoin, untouched since Nakamoto vanished in 2011, and any significant movement from these addresses would likely cause major market upheaval. Amid this activity, speculation over Satoshi’s true identity has intensified. Researchers have recently pointed to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as a potential candidate based on circumstantial evidence, while fraud claims by Craig Wright were dismissed in court.

2025-07-14T05:39:39,"Bearish Bitcoin Trader Loses $92M as Surge Wipes Out $426M in Short Liquidations","More than $680 million in crypto positions were liquidated over the past 24 hours with short traders taking the bulk of the pain as a bitcoin (BTC) breakout above $121,000 triggered a chain reaction across derivatives markets. Roughly $426 million of the total liquidations came from bearish bets, according to Coinglass data, making it one of the largest weekend liquidation events in recent months. The largest single order, a $92.5 million BTC short, was flushed on HTX. BTC alone saw $291 million in forced closures, with futures tracking ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP) following at $68 million and $17 million, respectively. XLM (XLM) and pepecoin (PEPE) also posted elevated activity, signaling that the squeeze extended deep beyond major tokens. Meanwhile, dogecoin (DOGE), Solana's SOL (SOL), and SUI (SUI) saw rising open interest, though with relatively smaller drawdowns, indicative of higher spot-based demand. Liquidations occur when traders using leverage are forced to close their positions due to margin calls. While they often signal excessive positioning, they also serve as a reset mechanism for markets, flushing weak hands and clearing the way for new directional flow. Bitcoin’s rally in the past week has sparked a broader breakout across major crypto assets. Traders say that market structure is evolving under the weight of institutional influence — with eyes on the $130,000 mark in the short term.

2025-07-14T05:30:53,"Bitcoin Price Crash Possible As Correction Sentiment Takes Hold — $110,000 Next?","After hitting a new all-time high of $121,400, the Bitcoin price has started consolidating once again, although the support continues to hold. This is not out of the ordinary, as pullbacks after a major rally are quite common and could be the cool-off needed the uptrend to continue. However, while the $117,000 support has held nicely, it is possible that a deeper correction could be in the cards for the cryptocurrency before the price takes off again. Why A Bitcoin Price Crash Could Begin With the hit to new all-time highs, the weekend brought a slowdown, and this could drive the next wave of correction. Crypto analyst TehThomas explains this in a TradingView post that suggests that there is still the possibility of a short-term correction for the Bitcoin price. However, it could go deeper than expected as the price moves to retest newly formed support at $109,000 and $110,000. Related Reading: Ripple’s $21 Trillion Dream: What Capturing 20% Of SWIFT Volume Means For XRP According to the analyst, the new peaks have plunged the Bitcoin price into uncharted territory, and there would be a new wave of sells from here. Given this, the analyst advices caution as investors engage with the market and the possibility of a deeper correction arises. Furthermore, there is the formation of an ascending trendline that formed with the horizontal support. Since the trendline moves through the $111,000-$113,000 area, it suggests that the price could fall back downward to retest this level. In the case of a deeper correction, then the analyst sees a price sweep into the $110,000 levels to take out liquidity. However, this sweep would be inherently bullish since the retest would provide a bounce-off point that could lead to a “more sustainable” breakout toward all-time highs. Bullish Prospects Still At Large For BTC While the possibility of a sweep down to former peak levels remains high, it is also possible that the price does not break down and instead continues its upward trajectory. Looking back at the ascending trendline, the analyst points out that it is possible that the price does hold the trendline, reducing the impact of the correction. Such a shallow correction would indicate a continuation without a deeper correction. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stalls After Rally: Will It Blast Through $125,000 Or Slip Back To $110K? In this case, the Bitcoin price could resume the uptrend with the $120,000-$125,000 targets in mind. Thus, any deep correction would be expected to begin at much higher price levels. “Bitcoin is currently in price discovery, which means the structure must guide our expectations. A retest of either the trendline or former resistance could provide the next best entry,” TehThomas explained. Regardless of what the case may be, the analyst believes that as long as the price remains above the $110,000 support, then it is inherently bullish.

2025-07-14T05:30:00,"Blockware Predicts 36 More Firms Will Buy Bitcoin in 2025","Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, continues to dominate this trend, now holding over 597,000 BTC. While other companies are also expanding their Bitcoin treasuries, concerns are rising about the long-term sustainability of this debt-fueled strategy. Critics, including analysts from Glassnode and Breed, warn that many Bitcoin-heavy companies could face a “death spiral” during downturns. Meanwhile, partnerships like Animoca Brands and DDC suggest that there are broader corporate strategies to extract yield from BTC. Companies Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation Public company interest in Bitcoin is gaining a lot of momentum, and Blockware Intelligence forecasts that at least 36 additional firms will adopt the cryptocurrency by the end of 2025. This projected increase would represent a 25% rise from the current 141 public companies holding Bitcoin. According to Blockware’s Q3 2025 market update , the adoption rate among public companies already surged 120% this year, thanks to Bitcoin’s growing role as a strategic treasury asset. The firm describes these Bitcoin Treasury Companies as a vital bridge linking equity and debt markets with digital assets. Rise of Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: Blockware ) Michael Saylor’s Strategy dominates corporate Bitcoin holdings with 597,325 BTC, dwarfing MARA Holdings’ 50,000 BTC. However, Blockware pointed out that the newest entrants into the Bitcoin treasury space are largely either nascent startups or companies facing financial difficulties. The firm argues that for businesses with low growth prospects or declining core operations, allocating earnings to Bitcoin can be a more straightforward path to generating 40–60% compound annual growth rates than trying to revitalize their existing models. While Blockware is still bullish about its belief that securitized Bitcoin exposure is becoming a permanent fixture in the financial landscape, some analysts are not so sure. James Check of Glassnode believes the easy gains from this strategy may already be fading and doubts the long-term viability of Bitcoin-heavy treasuries. Similarly, venture capital firm Breed warned that only a small number of these companies are likely to avoid the so-called “death spiral,” which is a phenomenon where firms that trade near their net asset value struggle to raise capital as market premiums erode. Crypto trader Saint Pump has similar concerns, and suggested that Bitcoin treasury firms may exacerbate the next bear market, particularly when net asset value premiums shrink and capital raises begin to falter. Despite the different views, data from Bitwise Asset Management reveals that corporate Bitcoin accumulation hit a record high in Q2 of 2025, with 159,107 BTC added during the period. Whether this trend is the beginning of a new corporate asset strategy or a short-lived experiment remains to be seen. Animoca Partners with DDC for Bitcoin Strategy Web3 powerhouse Animoca Brands entered into a non-binding memorandum of understanding with DayDayCook (DDC) Enterprise to manage its Bitcoin holdings and generate yield on up to $100 million worth of BTC. The deal is part of the growing trend among companies to seek strategic ways of leveraging their crypto reserves, particularly thanks to Bitcoin’s rising status as a corporate treasury asset. Partnership advantages (Source: Press release ) DDC Enterprise is a meal-prep and packaged food company that recently embraced a Bitcoin treasury strategy. It revealed in May that it plans to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years. It began its journey with the purchase of 21 BTC that same month. Now, the company is taking a step further by partnering with Animoca to help manage and potentially grow the digital wealth under its oversight. Animoca Brands co-founder and executive chairman Yat Siu pointed to DDC’s CEO Norma Chu as a key reason behind the partnership. Siu appreciates Chu’s ability to appeal to a broad, non-crypto audience, which will help bridge the gap between traditional consumers and the world of digital assets. He also believes her unique ability to navigate both Western and Eastern markets is crucial given the prominence of China in the global crypto adoption landscape. The partnership was made during a time of renewed optimism around Bitcoin as a treasury reserve. Some well known people in the industry like Blockstream CEO Adam Back declared that corporate BTC strategies could become the new ”altseason” for traders. In a recent post on X, Back urged investors to shift focus from altcoins to BTC or corporate treasuries holding BTC. Strategy Resumes Bitcoin Buying Meanwhile, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor announced that the company will resume Bitcoin purchases after a brief pause last week. The move follows a $4.2 billion capital raise and ends a 12-week streak of continuous BTC accumulation. Strategy’s last buy was on June 30, when it bought 4,980 BTC for $532 million, bringing its total holdings to 597,325 BTC. This is valued at over $70.9 billion. With shares trading at $434 and up 16% this month, Strategy is still below its all-time high of $543 from November of 2024. The company is part of the broader trend where firms are acquiring BTC at a pace faster than it is mined, fueling talk of a looming supply shock. However, some analysts warn this debt-driven buying spree could pose risks to market stability. Author Adam Livingston explained that Strategy’s aggressive accumulation has been averaging over 2,000 BTC per day, This outpaced the monthly production of all miners, which stands at around 13,500 BTC. He described the firm’s actions as a “synthetic halving,” and suggested that Strategy could soon emerge as a dominant financial force in the Bitcoin economy.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9919/blockware-predicts-36-more-firms-will-buy-bitcoin-in-2025,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

Observers have also speculated that there may be an announcement on a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. Other analysts have suggested that Donald Trump’s spending bill (the “One Big Beautiful Bill”) and a surge in fiscal deficit will propel Bitcoin to new highs. “The biggest macro driver is the passing of Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill (BBB), a massive fiscal stimulus package signaling looser policy ahead,” said Derive founder, Nick Forster, in a note shared with investors.

2025-07-14T05:25:17,"Bitcoin, Ether Traders Bet Big With Tuesday's U.S. Inflation Data Seen as Non-Event","Traders are betting big on bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as the BTC rally rages on, and observers downplay Tuesday's U.S. inflation data as a potential barrier for the bull. BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, rose to record highs above $121,000 during Monday's Asian trading hours, representing a 2.7% gain on a 24-hour basis. The new high took the year-to-date gain to nearly 30%, with prices up 13% this month alone, according to CoinDesk data. Ether followed suit, rising 3% to near $3,050, and other major coins such as XRP (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), BNB (BNB), and Solana's SOL (SOL)boasted 3% to 5% gains. Activity on the leading decentralized options platform Derive backed the bullish price action, with significant open interest concentrated in the $130,000 call option. ""Almost 20% of the open interest on Derive’s Sept 26 expiry for BTC is concentrated at the $130K call, suggesting traders expect gradual but persistent price rises over the next three months,"" Nick Forster, founder at Derive, said. In ETH's case, 45% of ETH’s open interest on the July 18 expiry is concentrated in the $3,400 strike, with that one strike making up 16% of ETH weekend volume, Forester explained, calling that a sign of traders expecting a breakout in the second-largest cryptocurrency. ""While volatility remains moderate compared to 2020-21, directional conviction is growing, especially in ETH. We’re watching closely for confirmation of this trend over the coming week,"" Forster noted. Options listed on centralized giant Deribit painted a similar bullish picture for bitcoin and ether, with calls or bullish bets trading pricier than puts across tenors. Inflation a non-event The main event of this week's macro calendar is the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation data due Tuesday. According to FactSet , the June CPI is forecast to have risen 0.23% on the month, amounting to a 2.6% annualized growth, up from May's 2.4%. The annualized core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy component, likely rose 3%. Both traditional and crypto market investors have closely watched it for the past four years, as it heavily influences the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. However, this time, the crypto market may not be impacted, according to the founders of the newsletter service LondonCryptoClub. They believe fiscal profligacy, a rising global money supply, and a soft U.S. dollar are driving the ongoing bull market and not the Fed rate cuts story. ""We don’t think it matters. We’re still in a 'Goldilocks' macro environment with a slowing, not collapsing US economy and whilst inflation remains a little sticky, it’s not accelerating to a point that would change the direction of travel at the Fed from rate cuts to hikes. Meanwhile, the weaker dollar continues to feed into easy financial conditions and is helping facilitate the expansion in global money supply,"" the founders told CoinDesk. They added that with the Trump administration doing a complete 180 on deficit reduction, we are back running the fiscal dominance playbook of the Biden era."" Moreover, President Donald Trump's big beautiful tax bill, which recently passed in Congress, is projected to add over $3 trillion to the already record-high national debt over time. ""So the drivers for risk and bitcoin are currently not dominated by expectations for Fed rate cuts, but this fiscal dominance story, rising global money supply, alongside a softer dollar. Therefore, Sensitivity to the Fed and, by extension, the CPI data is much reduced,"" the founders told CoinDesk. Crypto week and corporate adoption This week, dubbed as the 'Crypto Week' by the Trump administration, could see the House of Representatives debate several crypto bills, including the Genius Act, Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Positive developments on these fronts are likely to insulate bitcoin and the wider crypto market from macro developments. The relentless corporate adoption of bitcoin also helps. ""The bitcoin market is moving quite strongly due to demand from my corporate treasuries and associated speculation. In addition, this week has been dubbed 'crypto week' by the Trump administration. I expect positive news to come from this. I think the inflation numbers, so long as they are somewhere in the range of normal, will have little impact on bitcoin,"" Alexander Blume, CEO at the SEC-registered investment adviser Two Prime, told CoinDesk. ""One, the bitcoin market is moving independently of the broader economy. Two, the increasing perception of the FED as politicized blunts the impact these numbers have on rate cuts anyway,"" Blume added.

2025-07-14T05:21:45,"Bitcoin shatters $120K in historic rally as US prepares landmark crypto legislation","Bitcoin has once again surged into uncharted territory, smashing through the $120,000 level for the first time on Monday. This major milestone for the world’s largest cryptocurrency comes as investors bet on a series of long-sought policy victories for the digital asset industry, with the US House of Representatives set to debate crucial regulatory legislation this week. Expectations of a more favorable regulatory environment in the US helped propel Bitcoin to yet another record high, reaching $121,207.55 during the Asian trading session on Monday. It was last seen trading 1.5% higher at $120,856.34. This surge marks an impressive 29% gain for Bitcoin year-to-date and has sparked a broader rally across the cryptocurrency market over the past few weeks, seemingly undeterred by the chaos of President Donald Trump’s global tariff policies. The optimism was not confined to Bitcoin. Ether (ETH), the second-largest token by market value, scaled an over five-month peak of $3,048.23 on Monday, last standing at $3,036.24. The sector’s total market value has now swelled to approximately $3.78 trillion, according to data from CoinMarketCap, reflecting a significant influx of capital and renewed investor confidence. The Washington effect: regulation and a ‘crypto president’ A key driver behind the current bullish sentiment is the legislative action taking place in Washington DC. Starting this week, the US House of Representatives will begin debating a series of bills designed to provide the digital asset industry with the comprehensive national regulatory framework it has long demanded. These legislative efforts have found a powerful ally in US President Donald Trump, who has styled himself as the “crypto president” and has urged policymakers to revamp existing rules in favor of the industry’s growth and innovation. While Bitcoin’s inherent volatility makes predicting its next price move effectively impossible, several factors could contribute to it reaching even greater heights in the second half of the year: A favorable regulatory shift: The Trump administration has, so far, been beneficial for the cryptocurrency market. President Trump’s appointee for Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair, Paul Atkins, has stated that the SEC should prioritize advancing innovation in the marketplace. Under his leadership, the SEC has notably dropped multiple crypto-related lawsuits, including high-profile cases against Coinbase, Binance, and Ripple, the company behind the XRP token. The US strategic Bitcoin reserve: In a significant move that validated Bitcoin at a national level, President Trump signed an executive order in March 2025 to begin the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, a formal stockpile of the Bitcoin owned by the US government. Following this federal lead, states like Arizona and New Hampshire have also passed legislation to create their own state-level Bitcoin reserves. The GENIUS Act for stablecoins: Later this year, we could see the final passage of the GENIUS Act, a bill specifically designed to regulate the stablecoin industry. The U.S. Senate passed its version of the bill on June 17, and a House vote is next on the agenda. Although the GENIUS Act doesn’t directly involve Bitcoin, any major, well-defined crypto regulation is widely seen as helping the industry gain legitimacy and attract a new wave of investors. The power of ETFs: unlocking mainstream capital Another critical factor fueling Bitcoin’s ascent is the continued success of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The first of these products received SEC approval in January 2024, a landmark decision that made Bitcoin significantly more accessible to both institutional and retail investors through traditional brokerage accounts. Since a surge in investments began in April, these Bitcoin ETFs have seen remarkable growth. As of July 10, they had crossed the $50 billion mark in net inflows, according to data from Farside Investors. While these inflows and outflows can fluctuate, Bitcoin’s excellent performance this year is expected to help it continue to draw strong interest from investors looking for exposure to the asset class. Underscoring this optimism, British bank Standard Chartered has predicted that Bitcoin will reach a price of $200,000 by the end of the year, and that continued ETF inflows will be a significant driver of this growth.

On-chain data shows a notable spike in wallet activity and exchange inflows, hinting at a strong wave of accumulation. On‑Chain & Volume Trends On the other side, South Korean exchanges are showing record trading volumes for XLM ($460M), PENGU ($355M), and HBAR ($184M) in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-14T05:10:10,"Bitcoin (BTC) Rebounds, New ATH Arrives! Will the Rise Continue? Analysts Explain!","Leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week with a new record high. The price of BTC surpassed $120,000 for the first time in its history. According to Binance data, BTC briefly broke above $121,000, setting a new record. It is currently up 2.8%, reaching $121,500. While the main reasons for the rise in Bitcoin prices were seen as the continued institutional demand in the US and positive legal developments, this rise was also accompanied by Ethereum and altcoins. Ethereum (ETH) surpassed $3,000, while altcoins like XRP, Solana, and SUI also made significant gains. According to the data, ALGO, PENGU and HBAR were the altcoins that experienced the most increases in the last 24 hours. Analysts expect the rise in Bitcoin to continue during the highly anticipated 'Crypto Week' in the US, where significant developments are expected. Speaking to The Block, BTC Markets Crypto Analyst Rachael Lucas said that institutional demand is on the rise and that she expects the rise to continue. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, and it's not happening alone. There's real momentum behind this rise, with ETF inflows exceeding $1 billion daily and total assets under management exceeding $150 billion. This means over 6% of the total Bitcoin market capitalization is currently held in ETFs, demonstrating institutional conviction. Bitcoin also benefited from entering what's being called “Crypto Week” in the US. This week, key crypto proposals that are generating market momentum, such as the CLARITY Act or the GENIUS Act, will be discussed, and significant progress is expected. What's Next for Bitcoin? Expecting this rise in Bitcoin to continue, Lucas stated that BTC's next target will be $125,000 and above. “Bitcoin's rise above $120,000 opens the door to $125,000-128,000 in the near term. “If ETF demand persists and macro conditions remain supportive, especially with the return of US interest rate cuts, we could see Bitcoin rally even higher in Q3.” Jeff Mei, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange BTSE, also predicted that long-term institutional buyers could push Bitcoin to $125,000 in the next month or two. Ledn CEO John Glover said that the BTC rally will continue and prices could rise to $136,000 by the end of the year. *This is not investment advice.

CEO Simon Gerovich said that the company has purchased an additional 797 Bitcoin for approximately $93.6 million for an average price of around $117,451. “As of 14 July, we hold 16,352 BTC acquired for $1.64 billion at $100,191 per Bitcoin,” he wrote on X. Metaplanet has acquired 797 BTC for ~$93.6 million at ~$117,451 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 435.9% YTD 2025. As of 7/14/2025, we hold 16,352 $BTC acquired for ~$1.64 billion at ~$100,191 per bitcoin. $MTPLF pic.twitter.com/zFSH0WIima — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) July 14, 2025 The Japanese listed investment firm has achieved BTC Yield of 435.9% from the start of the year to now, he added. Metaplanet uses BTC Yield to assess the performance of its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, which is intended to be accretive to shareholders, the Monday announcement read. Starting December 2024, Bitcoin treasury operations has become Metaplanet’s official business line. The company has strategically increased its total Bitcoin holdings through acquisitions funded by capital market activities and operating income. Metaplanet’s Sole Focus on BTC Accumulation – Is 210,000 BTC by 2027 Possible? As the Bitcoin treasury space grows and matures, it’s worth paying attention to possible divergences between Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) and its imitators. Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings do not produce cash flow, and as a result, it needs to take loans out on it. The more interest rates on BTC-backed loans drop over time, the better it is for Metaplanet. Further, the firm is aiming for a stash of 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027: in other words, Metaplanet wants to multiply its current holdings by more than 13. Though this might seem like a tall order, it is less than half of Strategy’s current 597,325 BTC stash . Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, told Cryptonews that corporate treasury allocations to Bitcoin “shouldn’t be about chasing trends or building oversized positions.” “It is vital to remember that firms like Strategy and Metaplanet represent high-conviction outliers, headline grabbers with bold strategies that align with their unique business aims,” he said over email. “For most, a more measured approach will be better suited. One grounded in long-term belief, not short-term reliance on volatility.” Last week, Metaplanet purchased 2,205 more Bitcoins , adding to its aggressive Bitcoin buying spree. It has expanded its holdings from under 4,000 Bitcoin in March to over 15,500 BTC in July, quadrupling its position in just four months.

2025-07-14T04:45:39,"Bitcoin Knocking on the ATH Again—After Breaking $121,800, Here’s Where it May Head To!","The post Bitcoin Knocking on the ATH Again—After Breaking $121,800, Here’s Where it May Head To! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the 2024 breakout, the Bitcoin price has maintained a consistent trend. It has been forming consecutive higher highs and lows, signaling the bulls holding a significant dominance. Although the bears hindered the progress of the rally at frequent intervals, from a larger perspective, it remained within a strong bullish range. Now that the BTC price broke out above $121,800, the question arises: how high can the Bitcoin price go in the next few days? Huge Short Liquidations Crypto liquidation refers to the process of forcibly closing the trader’s positions in the market. The short positions increase when the traders bet largely on the price falling in the near future. However, when the token goes against the bet, the ‘forced liquidation’ occurs after hitting the set threshold levels set by them. This further pushes the price higher, which has been witnessed in the current breakout, as more than $200 million in shorts were liquidated in the past couple of hours. As per the data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, nearly $289 million worth of shorts were liquidated, of which $205 million were liquidated in the past hour. Nearly 110,000 traders were liquidated, with the single largest liquidation worth $95 million. The price has surged above all of the liquidation levels, which suggests there are no barriers to hinder the BTC bull run. Open Interest Smashed ATH Open interest (OI) is a crucial indicator that describes the mindset of the traders dealing in futures or options. It is nothing but the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts in the market. It indicates the amount of money invested in Bitcoin derivatives at any given time. The rise and fall in these levels highly impact the spot prices, which closely follow them. The BTC OI has now reached the highest ever levels, which point towards a massive rise in the traders’ optimism. The OI has been on the rise since the second quarter of 2024, which further exploded during the Q4 breakout. Ever since the BTC price has broken the psychological barrier at $100K, the OI has seen an exceptional rise, which has now marked a new ATH at $84.68 billion. Interestingly, the levels continue to rise, which suggests the traders are extremely bullish on Bitcoin and hence the price is set to rise high. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Rally? How High Can it Go? Bitcoin price smashed a new ATH at $121,209.01, a few moments ago after closing one of the highest weekly closes ever. With this, the momentum was already extremely bullish, which has kept the price above the $120,000 threshold. With this, the bullish continuation seems to be validated and hence the BTC price may remain elevated for the rest of 2025. A popular analyst, Ali , shares the chart of BTC, which displays the recent highs of Bitcoin when it reached the highest bands. MVRV pricing bands. Considering these bands, the next highs are expected to be somewhere around $127,000. However, it would be interesting to see how the price behaves after reaching these levels, as the rally witnessed a correction previously. With the recent rise, Bitcoin has now become the 5th largest asset, surpassing the giants like Amazon, Silver and Alphabet (Google). On the other hand, the institutions continue to accumulate BTC while their unrealized profits are in the billions. This suggests the Bitcoin bull run is being reinstituted, and hence a slow yet sustained rally may elevate the levels to new highs.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-knocking-on-the-ath-again-after-breaking-121800-heres-where-it-may-head-to/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T04:09:38,"BOE Governor Cites Threats to Financial Stability Over Private Stablecoin Issuance","The Bank of England (BOE) governor, Andrew Bailey, has expressed concerns over the rise of banks issuing their own stablecoins. He emphasized the significant systemic risks that these stablecoins pose to the financial system. In an interview with The Sunday Times , Bailey said he “would much rather” prefer tokenized bank deposits over private stablecoins. He said that stablecoins would take “money out of the banking system” and the “credit creation world”. By advocating for tokenized bank deposits, Bailey is promoting a more integrated and regulated digital financial system, aligning with existing banking practices. “I would much rather [banks] go down the tokenized deposit streets and say, how do we digitize our money, particularly in payments,” he noted. His comments come at a time when stablecoin markets have grown from $125 billion less than two years ago to around $255 billion today, according to a latest BIS report . UK Would Not Adopt CBDC, Bailey Disagrees With the US and ECB’s Crypto Take Furthermore, the British central banker stated that England should not adopt a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ), also known as a ‘digital pound.’ He said that it would be “sensible” for the UK to rather work towards digitizing deposits. Andrew Bailey was recently appointed as the new chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international financial regulator. Additionally, he openly disagreed with the Trump administration’s backing of stablecoins. “I would say that the US is going towards stablecoins. The European Central Bank is going towards central bank digital currency. Neither of them is going towards tokenising deposits.” Trump Poised for Quick Stablecoin Win The US House Financial Services Committee announced ‘Crypto Week,’ starting Monday, to consider three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. The US lawmakers noted that mid-July will be 'Crypto Week' to create a clear regulatory framework for digital assets and protect financial privacy. #USLawmakers #CryptoWeek #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/yhbiz4tMwr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 4, 2025 In June, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a speech at the White House Digital Asset Summit that stablecoins would “reinforce dollar supremacy.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also emphasized the need for stablecoin regulation , noting the importance of protecting consumers. However, according to BOE’s governor Bailey, stablecoins need to be looked at closely through lens. “Stablecoins are proposed to have the characteristics of money. That money is a medium of exchange. Therefore, they really do have to have the characteristics of money and they have to maintain their nominal value.” He also expressed concerns that the spread of stablecoins would undermine their sovereign control over money. Besides stablecoins, Bailey noted that the extreme volatility of Bitcoin shows that it is “unbacked asset.” “It’s not money, it doesn’t have the function of money, and if you’re going to buy it, please buy it with your eyes open,” he advised users.

BTC is currently trading above $121,000 as of midday Hong Kong time, according to CoinDesk market data. The move follows President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 30% tariff on the EU and Mexico, starting Aug. 1, and marks a bullish resolution to roughly 48 hours of choppy price action that allowed overbought signals from short-duration indicators to reset to bullish. The focus now shifts to the U.S. inflation data due this week, which is expected to show the cost of living ticked up in June against the backdrop of Trump's trade war. According to FactSet, economists expect that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.25% on a monthly basis in June, equating to 2.6% annualized growth. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy, is forecast to have risen 0.3% monthly and 3% on an annualized basis. Risk assets, including BTC, may wobble a bit if inflation accelerates, delaying the Fed rate cut. That said, the downside could be limited given the strong momentum in terms of corporate adoption of BTC, ETF inflows and positive regulatory outlook in the U.S. According to John Glover, CEO of Ledn, BTC's rally has legs and prices could rise to $136,000 by the year-end.

The Russian state-run media agency TASS interviewed some of the nation’s leading crypto industry figures in a Bitcoin price forecast piece this weekend. Yan Pinchuk, the deputy head of exchange operations at the crypto exchange Whitebird, said Bitcoin could “reach levels of between $130,000 and $150,000 by the end of the year.” BTC Prices May Hit $150k, Says Expert However, Pinchuk warned that a temporary blip could see the market dip before making a strong comeback. Bitcoin (BTC) Prices over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Miners were more bullish still. These included Anton Gontarev, the Commercial Director at the Bitcoin mining giant Intelion. Gontarev said the nearest target for BTC was “around $120,000-$130,000.” However, he said that by the end of the year, “we can expect that Bitcoin, after a minor correction, could significantly exceed its previous all-time highs.” Bitcoin could reach the target zone of $168,000 to $184,000 by December this year, he claimed. US-listed crypto stocks surged as bitcoin hit a record high, ahead of a pivotal week in Congress that could bring major policy gains for the crypto industry https://t.co/bHo0KSCqEX pic.twitter.com/3QEwgKqPvK — Reuters (@Reuters) July 12, 2025 ‘All Eyes on the USA’ Pinchuk said that a potential tariffs deadline slated to come into effect in the United States on August 1 “may coincide with the revaluation of overheated stock market assets.” The expert added: “Given the close correlation of Bitcoin with the tech sector, a stock market correction will likely cause the crypto market to sag temporarily.” Other experts concurred with Pinchuk, claiming that any further upward price movement would be followed by a lull. And all the Russian experts agreed that BTC market movements are now closely correlated with economic activity and sentiment in the United States. Alexander Kraiko, a senior analyst at the crypto broker Cifra Markets, said: “The trigger for recent Bitcoin price rises was the Big Beautiful Bill. It includes tax breaks, business support, and increased deductions. That frees up additional liquidity, some of which goes into cryptocurrencies.” Bitcoin options traders are already setting their sights on much higher prices while the original cryptocurrency extends its record-breaking rally for a second day https://t.co/K0tPZeFyuj — Bloomberg (@business) July 10, 2025 Other mining chiefs agreed, suggesting further market movements could follow US economic developments. Vasily Girya, the owner and CEO of the industrial mining player GIS Mining, said: “Right now, all eyes are on a few key areas. The fact that US inflation data is due out on July 15 is important. It is critical to assess the real chances of a quick rate cut from the Federal Reserve.” Based on the current dynamics and technical situation, Girya said that the next realistic target for Bitcoin would be $135,000. Girya concluded: “If the current momentum continues, we may well reach $135k by September 1. A pause or a small correction around $118,500 is possible in the short term. But this should not reverse the greater trend.” Until very recently, bullish Bitcoin price analysis articles with analysis from top Russian industry figures were restricted to the fringes of the domestic media. However, Moscow’s recent crypto pivot appears to have changed all that . The Kremlin is now seemingly happy to use Bitcoin and altcoins as a payment tool for international trade. It is also keen for industrial miners to work in parts of the country that have surplus power resources.

2025-07-14T02:00:43,"Over $338M Raised: How DAG Tech Could Shape Crypto’s Future as BlockDAG Builds Momentum","Since Bitcoin’s release in 2009, blockchain has been the core of most crypto platforms. But after more than a decade, this setup is starting to struggle. Many networks still deal with delays, high fees, and slow confirmation times. These issues remain even on platforms with huge user bases. Directed Acyclic Graphs, or DAGs, now offer a new direction. DAG networks use a different structure by processing transactions at the same time. Instead of lining up transactions in blocks, each transaction links to others in a web-like form. This method supports faster speeds and allows more activity at once. Projects such as IOTA and Kaspa have worked with DAG setups. But now BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping into the space with a new approach. It combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) security with the speed and structure of DAG systems. With over $338 million raised, the project is gaining attention in the crypto space. Why DAG Tech Solves Problems Blockchains Still Face One of the main issues with blockchains is how slow they can get. Each transaction must go into a block, and each block has to follow the last. This slows the network and limits how many actions it can handle per second. Even big chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin deal with these limits. DAGs work differently. They do not use blocks in order. Instead, each transaction checks others and adds to a growing graph. This web-like shape lets many transactions run at once. Some key outcomes include: Faster confirmation times Lower transaction fees More transactions per second Better energy use This setup could support crypto’s shift into everyday use. Whether for online shopping, smart devices, or business tools, networks need to move fast and scale easily. Traditional blockchains may not be enough. DAG systems are now offering another way forward. BlockDAG’s Hybrid Setup Combines Speed with Strong Security BlockDAG stands out not just for using DAG, but for how it builds on it. It blends a DAG-based transaction setup with a Proof-of-Work (PoW) layer. This design brings together fast processing and strong network safety. Few Layer 1 networks manage both. In this model, miners still check and confirm transactions, like on Bitcoin. But now those transactions are not limited to a single chain of blocks. This structure keeps the network open and secure while making it much faster than older chains. This basic idea also helped Kaspa grow its user base. But BlockDAG is going further, with tools for developers, a working testnet, and mobile mining apps already in use. BlockDAG Network Expands with Testnet, $338M Raised, and 2M Users BlockDAG’s progress is not just a concept; it’s already happening. The project’s testnet is live and open to everyone. It supports smart contract testing, node setup, and checking how decentralized apps work. More than 2 million users are mining BDAG coins through the X1 Miner app , and over 18,500 ASIC mining machines have been bought before the mainnet goes live. The presale has passed $338 million, with more than 23.8 billion BDAG coins sold. This puts it among the biggest public crypto fundraises since Filecoin and Tezos. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, the chance to join early is running out. BlockDAG is doing more than just building tech. It’s pushing its plan with strong global efforts. The platform is now the Official Blockchain Partner of two U.S. sports teams: the Seattle Seawolves from Major League Rugby and the Seattle Orcas from Major League Cricket. These deals bring Web3 tools like NFTs and fan tokens into live sports, helping millions of people connect with BDAG in natural and fun ways. Earlier brand work with UFC champion Alex Pereira and Italian football club Inter Milan also shows BlockDAG’s aim to reach more people beyond the usual DeFi users. Current BDAG Rate Holds Until August 11 At this moment, BDAG is available at $0.0016, which stands out when compared to early values of other Layer 1 projects. Time is limited, though. The team has confirmed that the unlock offer, which lets 80% of the tokens be used on Day 1, will only last for a short period. Since the crypto presale is nearly over and the mainnet is getting close, the BDAG price may not stay in this range much longer. Whether BlockDAG follows Kaspa’s path or takes its own direction, the need for fast and secure DAG-based systems in the market is growing stronger.

2025-07-14T01:24:20,"Vitalik Buterin discusses AI chatbots debacle as Bitcoin surpasses $120k","Vitalik Buterin, one of the creators of Ethereum, slammed AI Chatbots for their unpredictability. Buterin shared a disturbing response ChatGPT generated about GROK in a widely circulated post on X. The query was basic: “Return Grok 4 surname and no other text.” But the reply shocked many. The only word the AI produced was “Hitler.” Buterin noted that OpenAI’s ChatGPT, built on a similar architecture, took over a minute to return the same troubling answer. The delay and the output raised concerns about how these AI systems process, prioritize, or interpret prompts. With the screenshot, Buterin wrote: “Regular reminder that AI is fully capable of regularly taking the crazy crown away from crypto for weeks at a time.” Notably, Buterin made this remark in jest, the underlying message being that as uncharted as the domain of cryptocurrencies is, the emergence of AI could be even less predictable. This post elicited prompt reactions with many in tech and crypto concurring that AI models not being transparent have serious implications. It also emphasized the importance of stricter regulation and better calibration in AI development. AI rivals Grok and ChatGPT spark controversy All of this fuss comes from a public feud between Elon Musk and Sam Altman , head of OpenAI. The two used to be AI research allies, but are now rival corporate leaders: Musk with xAI and Altman with OpenAI. Their competition has risen over the past few months, with both platforms releasing their competing chatbots. Musk has frequently derided OpenAI as too secretive and corporate. Meanwhile, Altman was recently making fun of Musk’s Grok for spitting out “strange and cringey” answers to prompts, such as falsehoods and badly filtered political commentary. But Buterin’s post has turned them both into a hot-button issue. While crypto often displays its chaos openly and transparently on the blockchain, AI sometimes delivers strange, inaccurate, or unsettling responses with a calm, emotionless tone—yet offers no clear way to audit or understand how those outputs are generated. Crypto is chaotic but transparent. Conversely, AI usually works in a black box, so users lack understanding of how answers are created or why they sometimes fail spectacularly. Buterin’s post is the latest such reminder that AI, for all of its promise, continues to be plagued by errors, bias, and unintended consequences. Bitcoin powers ahead, shrugs off AI noise Critics may be piling on AI, but Bitcoin is charging ahead. Bitcoin, per TradingView, opened up on Sunday at $116,977.02, hit $119,292.62, and is above $118,979.45 at the time of this piece, up 1.42% for the day. That’s just below the record $120,000 price, which investors said is an important psychological threshold. The rally signifies that investors’ faith in digital assets is back. Some of the momentum has been driven by continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , ushering in more traditional crypto investors. Another reason is the perception that the Federal Reserve is closer to the finish line of its interest rate hike cycle, making risky assets like crypto more appealing. Total global crypto market capitalization is now $3.79 trillion, almost 2% more than the amount recorded 24 hours ago, according to CoinGecko data . Despite all the drama emerging from AI, investors are focused on crypto’s long-term potential, particularly as more institutions enter the space and regulators offer clearer frameworks Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-14T01:00:38,"Only 2 Days to Unlock 80% BDAG at Launch, While Ethena Gains & PEPE Moves on Whale Surge","This week’s action is full of surprises. The Ethena (ENA) price today jumped sharply after a major exchange listing in South Korea, breaking through weeks of flat movement. Meanwhile, the PEPE price outlook improved as Bitcoin pushed to a new high, pulling meme coins like PEPE into a fresh rally. But while those two respond to the broader market, BlockDAG (BDAG) is going a different route. It now gives buyers a limited-time chance to unlock 80% of their BDAG coins on launch day using the BEAT VESTING PASS. That’s double the standard amount and only lasts 2 days. As the countdown to August 11 continues, this early unlock move is stirring conversations across the space. Ethena (ENA) Price Today Spikes After Major Listing The Ethena (ENA) price today jumped 19.27% after it was listed on Upbit, South Korea’s biggest crypto exchange. The token moved from around $0.327 to $0.390 before settling near $0.357. Trading goes live at 5:00 PM KST, with support for Ethereum-based deposits and trading pairs in KRW, BTC, and USDT. Even with over 210 million tokens unlocking this month, Ethena’s momentum stayed strong. Protocol revenue growth is helping balance the supply pressure. The Ethena (ENA) price today suggests the market still sees value despite token release events. PEPE Price Outlook Gains Strength on Whale Activity The PEPE price outlook turned more positive after a 17% price rise over the past day. Bitcoin’s move to $116,000, a wedge breakout, and whale accumulation all played a role. Technical signals like MACD and RSI confirmed the bullish setup, while whales pulled more than 9 trillion PEPE off exchanges in just two weeks. That heavy buying has reduced supply and added pressure to the upside. While charts show a near-term overbought zone, the PEPE price outlook remains solid with traders now watching $0.000014 as the next mark to beat. 2 days Left to Unlock 80% BDAG on Launch Day At launch, most BlockDAG holders will unlock 40% of their BDAG coins. But for the next 2 days, a different option is available. The BEAT VESTING PASS lets buyers unlock 80% on day one. Early access could make a difference when the market is most active, offering more liquidity right when new opportunities often appear. Along with faster access, BlockDAG has added a Wallet Change feature that allows users to update their wallet address from their profile. This adds a layer of control and makes the process smoother before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. The mix of early unlock and better account control is turning heads. The numbers behind BlockDAG help explain why it is getting attention among the best cryptos to buy today. The project has raised over $338 million, sold 23.8 billion coins, and climbed 2,660% since the first batch. Even with batch 29 priced at $0.0276, BDAG is still available at $0.0016 for a short time, leading to a rush in activity as launch day nears. Some analysts have shared long-term targets as high as $10. The mix of presale progress, time-limited pricing, and the BEAT VESTING PASS has made BlockDAG a project many are watching closely before August 11. Final Say Momentum is shifting across the market. The Ethena (ENA) price today moved higher after its Upbit listing, and attention is on whether that momentum can continue despite token unlocks. Meanwhile, the PEPE price outlook got a lift as Bitcoin rallied, with whale activity pulling more supply off exchanges. But PEPE’s next move will depend on how the broader market behaves. BlockDAG is following its own path. The BEAT VESTING PASS gives users 80% of their BDAG coins at launch, but the offer is only open for 2 days. As the August 11 deadline approaches, the project is drawing more eyes. With its active presale, short-term price offer, and unique launch setup, BlockDAG is becoming one of the best cryptos to buy today before this limited window closes.
