2025-07-14T04:45:39,"Bitcoin Knocking on the ATH Again—After Breaking $121,800, Here’s Where it May Head To!","The post Bitcoin Knocking on the ATH Again—After Breaking $121,800, Here’s Where it May Head To! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Since the 2024 breakout, the Bitcoin price has maintained a consistent trend. It has been forming consecutive higher highs and lows, signaling the bulls holding a significant dominance. Although the bears hindered the progress of the rally at frequent intervals, from a larger perspective, it remained within a strong bullish range. Now that the BTC price broke out above $121,800, the question arises: how high can the Bitcoin price go in the next few days? Huge Short Liquidations Crypto liquidation refers to the process of forcibly closing the trader’s positions in the market. The short positions increase when the traders bet largely on the price falling in the near future. However, when the token goes against the bet, the ‘forced liquidation’ occurs after hitting the set threshold levels set by them. This further pushes the price higher, which has been witnessed in the current breakout, as more than $200 million in shorts were liquidated in the past couple of hours. As per the data from Coinglass, in the past 24 hours, nearly $289 million worth of shorts were liquidated, of which $205 million were liquidated in the past hour. Nearly 110,000 traders were liquidated, with the single largest liquidation worth $95 million. The price has surged above all of the liquidation levels, which suggests there are no barriers to hinder the BTC bull run. Open Interest Smashed ATH Open interest (OI) is a crucial indicator that describes the mindset of the traders dealing in futures or options. It is nothing but the total number of outstanding Bitcoin futures or options contracts in the market. It indicates the amount of money invested in Bitcoin derivatives at any given time. The rise and fall in these levels highly impact the spot prices, which closely follow them. The BTC OI has now reached the highest ever levels, which point towards a massive rise in the traders’ optimism. The OI has been on the rise since the second quarter of 2024, which further exploded during the Q4 breakout. Ever since the BTC price has broken the psychological barrier at $100K, the OI has seen an exceptional rise, which has now marked a new ATH at $84.68 billion. Interestingly, the levels continue to rise, which suggests the traders are extremely bullish on Bitcoin and hence the price is set to rise high. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Price Rally? How High Can it Go? Bitcoin price smashed a new ATH at $121,209.01, a few moments ago after closing one of the highest weekly closes ever. With this, the momentum was already extremely bullish, which has kept the price above the $120,000 threshold. With this, the bullish continuation seems to be validated and hence the BTC price may remain elevated for the rest of 2025. A popular analyst, Ali , shares the chart of BTC, which displays the recent highs of Bitcoin when it reached the highest bands. MVRV pricing bands. Considering these bands, the next highs are expected to be somewhere around $127,000. However, it would be interesting to see how the price behaves after reaching these levels, as the rally witnessed a correction previously. With the recent rise, Bitcoin has now become the 5th largest asset, surpassing the giants like Amazon, Silver and Alphabet (Google). On the other hand, the institutions continue to accumulate BTC while their unrealized profits are in the billions. This suggests the Bitcoin bull run is being reinstituted, and hence a slow yet sustained rally may elevate the levels to new highs.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-knocking-on-the-ath-again-after-breaking-121800-heres-where-it-may-head-to/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T04:09:38,"BOE Governor Cites Threats to Financial Stability Over Private Stablecoin Issuance","The Bank of England (BOE) governor, Andrew Bailey, has expressed concerns over the rise of banks issuing their own stablecoins. He emphasized the significant systemic risks that these stablecoins pose to the financial system. In an interview with The Sunday Times , Bailey said he “would much rather” prefer tokenized bank deposits over private stablecoins. He said that stablecoins would take “money out of the banking system” and the “credit creation world”. By advocating for tokenized bank deposits, Bailey is promoting a more integrated and regulated digital financial system, aligning with existing banking practices. “I would much rather [banks] go down the tokenized deposit streets and say, how do we digitize our money, particularly in payments,” he noted. His comments come at a time when stablecoin markets have grown from $125 billion less than two years ago to around $255 billion today, according to a latest BIS report . UK Would Not Adopt CBDC, Bailey Disagrees With the US and ECB’s Crypto Take Furthermore, the British central banker stated that England should not adopt a central bank digital currency ( CBDC ), also known as a ‘digital pound.’ He said that it would be “sensible” for the UK to rather work towards digitizing deposits. Andrew Bailey was recently appointed as the new chairman of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), an international financial regulator. Additionally, he openly disagreed with the Trump administration’s backing of stablecoins. “I would say that the US is going towards stablecoins. The European Central Bank is going towards central bank digital currency. Neither of them is going towards tokenising deposits.” Trump Poised for Quick Stablecoin Win The US House Financial Services Committee announced ‘Crypto Week,’ starting Monday, to consider three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins. The US lawmakers noted that mid-July will be 'Crypto Week' to create a clear regulatory framework for digital assets and protect financial privacy. #USLawmakers #CryptoWeek #CryptoRegulations https://t.co/yhbiz4tMwr — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 4, 2025 In June, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a speech at the White House Digital Asset Summit that stablecoins would “reinforce dollar supremacy.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell has also emphasized the need for stablecoin regulation , noting the importance of protecting consumers. However, according to BOE’s governor Bailey, stablecoins need to be looked at closely through lens. “Stablecoins are proposed to have the characteristics of money. That money is a medium of exchange. Therefore, they really do have to have the characteristics of money and they have to maintain their nominal value.” He also expressed concerns that the spread of stablecoins would undermine their sovereign control over money. Besides stablecoins, Bailey noted that the extreme volatility of Bitcoin shows that it is “unbacked asset.” “It’s not money, it doesn’t have the function of money, and if you’re going to buy it, please buy it with your eyes open,” he advised users.

Despite some lawmakers pushing back through an “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” campaign, broader sentiment remains bullish. Rising ETF Interest and Policy Clarity Spark Talk of a New Crypto Cycle The total crypto market capitalization now stands at $3.86 trillion, supported by ETF inflows and Ethereum’s move back above $3,000. Altcoins like ADA and XRP have also shown strength, lifting market confidence. Meanwhile, decentralized finance is gaining fresh momentum. Last week, the total value locked across DeFi protocols jumped by more than $20b. As a result, the sector’s TVL now stands at roughly $176b. This surge reflects growing trust in on-chain financial solutions. Traders are now watching key macro and political developments.

BTC is currently trading above $121,000 as of midday Hong Kong time, according to CoinDesk market data. The move follows President Donald Trump's decision to impose a 30% tariff on the EU and Mexico, starting Aug. 1, and marks a bullish resolution to roughly 48 hours of choppy price action that allowed overbought signals from short-duration indicators to reset to bullish. The focus now shifts to the U.S. inflation data due this week, which is expected to show the cost of living ticked up in June against the backdrop of Trump's trade war. According to FactSet, economists expect that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.25% on a monthly basis in June, equating to 2.6% annualized growth. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy, is forecast to have risen 0.3% monthly and 3% on an annualized basis. Risk assets, including BTC, may wobble a bit if inflation accelerates, delaying the Fed rate cut. That said, the downside could be limited given the strong momentum in terms of corporate adoption of BTC, ETF inflows and positive regulatory outlook in the U.S. According to John Glover, CEO of Ledn, BTC's rally has legs and prices could rise to $136,000 by the year-end.

The Russian state-run media agency TASS interviewed some of the nation’s leading crypto industry figures in a Bitcoin price forecast piece this weekend. Yan Pinchuk, the deputy head of exchange operations at the crypto exchange Whitebird, said Bitcoin could “reach levels of between $130,000 and $150,000 by the end of the year.” BTC Prices May Hit $150k, Says Expert However, Pinchuk warned that a temporary blip could see the market dip before making a strong comeback. Bitcoin (BTC) Prices over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Miners were more bullish still. These included Anton Gontarev, the Commercial Director at the Bitcoin mining giant Intelion. Gontarev said the nearest target for BTC was “around $120,000-$130,000.” However, he said that by the end of the year, “we can expect that Bitcoin, after a minor correction, could significantly exceed its previous all-time highs.” Bitcoin could reach the target zone of $168,000 to $184,000 by December this year, he claimed. US-listed crypto stocks surged as bitcoin hit a record high, ahead of a pivotal week in Congress that could bring major policy gains for the crypto industry https://t.co/bHo0KSCqEX pic.twitter.com/3QEwgKqPvK — Reuters (@Reuters) July 12, 2025 ‘All Eyes on the USA’ Pinchuk said that a potential tariffs deadline slated to come into effect in the United States on August 1 “may coincide with the revaluation of overheated stock market assets.” The expert added: “Given the close correlation of Bitcoin with the tech sector, a stock market correction will likely cause the crypto market to sag temporarily.” Other experts concurred with Pinchuk, claiming that any further upward price movement would be followed by a lull. And all the Russian experts agreed that BTC market movements are now closely correlated with economic activity and sentiment in the United States. Alexander Kraiko, a senior analyst at the crypto broker Cifra Markets, said: “The trigger for recent Bitcoin price rises was the Big Beautiful Bill. It includes tax breaks, business support, and increased deductions. That frees up additional liquidity, some of which goes into cryptocurrencies.” Bitcoin options traders are already setting their sights on much higher prices while the original cryptocurrency extends its record-breaking rally for a second day https://t.co/K0tPZeFyuj — Bloomberg (@business) July 10, 2025 Other mining chiefs agreed, suggesting further market movements could follow US economic developments. Vasily Girya, the owner and CEO of the industrial mining player GIS Mining, said: “Right now, all eyes are on a few key areas. The fact that US inflation data is due out on July 15 is important. It is critical to assess the real chances of a quick rate cut from the Federal Reserve.” Based on the current dynamics and technical situation, Girya said that the next realistic target for Bitcoin would be $135,000. Girya concluded: “If the current momentum continues, we may well reach $135k by September 1. A pause or a small correction around $118,500 is possible in the short term. But this should not reverse the greater trend.” Until very recently, bullish Bitcoin price analysis articles with analysis from top Russian industry figures were restricted to the fringes of the domestic media. However, Moscow’s recent crypto pivot appears to have changed all that . The Kremlin is now seemingly happy to use Bitcoin and altcoins as a payment tool for international trade. It is also keen for industrial miners to work in parts of the country that have surplus power resources.

2025-07-14T02:00:43,"Over $338M Raised: How DAG Tech Could Shape Crypto’s Future as BlockDAG Builds Momentum","Since Bitcoin’s release in 2009, blockchain has been the core of most crypto platforms. But after more than a decade, this setup is starting to struggle. Many networks still deal with delays, high fees, and slow confirmation times. These issues remain even on platforms with huge user bases. Directed Acyclic Graphs, or DAGs, now offer a new direction. DAG networks use a different structure by processing transactions at the same time. Instead of lining up transactions in blocks, each transaction links to others in a web-like form. This method supports faster speeds and allows more activity at once. Projects such as IOTA and Kaspa have worked with DAG setups. But now BlockDAG (BDAG) is stepping into the space with a new approach. It combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) security with the speed and structure of DAG systems. With over $338 million raised, the project is gaining attention in the crypto space. Why DAG Tech Solves Problems Blockchains Still Face One of the main issues with blockchains is how slow they can get. Each transaction must go into a block, and each block has to follow the last. This slows the network and limits how many actions it can handle per second. Even big chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin deal with these limits. DAGs work differently. They do not use blocks in order. Instead, each transaction checks others and adds to a growing graph. This web-like shape lets many transactions run at once. Some key outcomes include: Faster confirmation times Lower transaction fees More transactions per second Better energy use This setup could support crypto’s shift into everyday use. Whether for online shopping, smart devices, or business tools, networks need to move fast and scale easily. Traditional blockchains may not be enough. DAG systems are now offering another way forward. BlockDAG’s Hybrid Setup Combines Speed with Strong Security BlockDAG stands out not just for using DAG, but for how it builds on it. It blends a DAG-based transaction setup with a Proof-of-Work (PoW) layer. This design brings together fast processing and strong network safety. Few Layer 1 networks manage both. In this model, miners still check and confirm transactions, like on Bitcoin. But now those transactions are not limited to a single chain of blocks. This structure keeps the network open and secure while making it much faster than older chains. This basic idea also helped Kaspa grow its user base. But BlockDAG is going further, with tools for developers, a working testnet, and mobile mining apps already in use. BlockDAG Network Expands with Testnet, $338M Raised, and 2M Users BlockDAG’s progress is not just a concept; it’s already happening. The project’s testnet is live and open to everyone. It supports smart contract testing, node setup, and checking how decentralized apps work. More than 2 million users are mining BDAG coins through the X1 Miner app , and over 18,500 ASIC mining machines have been bought before the mainnet goes live. The presale has passed $338 million, with more than 23.8 billion BDAG coins sold. This puts it among the biggest public crypto fundraises since Filecoin and Tezos. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, the chance to join early is running out. BlockDAG is doing more than just building tech. It’s pushing its plan with strong global efforts. The platform is now the Official Blockchain Partner of two U.S. sports teams: the Seattle Seawolves from Major League Rugby and the Seattle Orcas from Major League Cricket. These deals bring Web3 tools like NFTs and fan tokens into live sports, helping millions of people connect with BDAG in natural and fun ways. Earlier brand work with UFC champion Alex Pereira and Italian football club Inter Milan also shows BlockDAG’s aim to reach more people beyond the usual DeFi users. Current BDAG Rate Holds Until August 11 At this moment, BDAG is available at $0.0016, which stands out when compared to early values of other Layer 1 projects. Time is limited, though. The team has confirmed that the unlock offer, which lets 80% of the tokens be used on Day 1, will only last for a short period. Since the crypto presale is nearly over and the mainnet is getting close, the BDAG price may not stay in this range much longer. Whether BlockDAG follows Kaspa’s path or takes its own direction, the need for fast and secure DAG-based systems in the market is growing stronger.

2025-07-14T01:24:20,"Vitalik Buterin discusses AI chatbots debacle as Bitcoin surpasses $120k","Vitalik Buterin, one of the creators of Ethereum, slammed AI Chatbots for their unpredictability. Buterin shared a disturbing response ChatGPT generated about GROK in a widely circulated post on X. The query was basic: “Return Grok 4 surname and no other text.” But the reply shocked many. The only word the AI produced was “Hitler.” Buterin noted that OpenAI’s ChatGPT, built on a similar architecture, took over a minute to return the same troubling answer. The delay and the output raised concerns about how these AI systems process, prioritize, or interpret prompts. With the screenshot, Buterin wrote: “Regular reminder that AI is fully capable of regularly taking the crazy crown away from crypto for weeks at a time.” Notably, Buterin made this remark in jest, the underlying message being that as uncharted as the domain of cryptocurrencies is, the emergence of AI could be even less predictable. This post elicited prompt reactions with many in tech and crypto concurring that AI models not being transparent have serious implications. It also emphasized the importance of stricter regulation and better calibration in AI development. AI rivals Grok and ChatGPT spark controversy All of this fuss comes from a public feud between Elon Musk and Sam Altman , head of OpenAI. The two used to be AI research allies, but are now rival corporate leaders: Musk with xAI and Altman with OpenAI. Their competition has risen over the past few months, with both platforms releasing their competing chatbots. Musk has frequently derided OpenAI as too secretive and corporate. Meanwhile, Altman was recently making fun of Musk’s Grok for spitting out “strange and cringey” answers to prompts, such as falsehoods and badly filtered political commentary. But Buterin’s post has turned them both into a hot-button issue. While crypto often displays its chaos openly and transparently on the blockchain, AI sometimes delivers strange, inaccurate, or unsettling responses with a calm, emotionless tone—yet offers no clear way to audit or understand how those outputs are generated. Crypto is chaotic but transparent. Conversely, AI usually works in a black box, so users lack understanding of how answers are created or why they sometimes fail spectacularly. Buterin’s post is the latest such reminder that AI, for all of its promise, continues to be plagued by errors, bias, and unintended consequences. Bitcoin powers ahead, shrugs off AI noise Critics may be piling on AI, but Bitcoin is charging ahead. Bitcoin, per TradingView, opened up on Sunday at $116,977.02, hit $119,292.62, and is above $118,979.45 at the time of this piece, up 1.42% for the day. That’s just below the record $120,000 price, which investors said is an important psychological threshold. The rally signifies that investors’ faith in digital assets is back. Some of the momentum has been driven by continued inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , ushering in more traditional crypto investors. Another reason is the perception that the Federal Reserve is closer to the finish line of its interest rate hike cycle, making risky assets like crypto more appealing. Total global crypto market capitalization is now $3.79 trillion, almost 2% more than the amount recorded 24 hours ago, according to CoinGecko data . Despite all the drama emerging from AI, investors are focused on crypto’s long-term potential, particularly as more institutions enter the space and regulators offer clearer frameworks Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-14T01:00:38,"Only 2 Days to Unlock 80% BDAG at Launch, While Ethena Gains & PEPE Moves on Whale Surge","This week’s action is full of surprises. The Ethena (ENA) price today jumped sharply after a major exchange listing in South Korea, breaking through weeks of flat movement. Meanwhile, the PEPE price outlook improved as Bitcoin pushed to a new high, pulling meme coins like PEPE into a fresh rally. But while those two respond to the broader market, BlockDAG (BDAG) is going a different route. It now gives buyers a limited-time chance to unlock 80% of their BDAG coins on launch day using the BEAT VESTING PASS. That’s double the standard amount and only lasts 2 days. As the countdown to August 11 continues, this early unlock move is stirring conversations across the space. Ethena (ENA) Price Today Spikes After Major Listing The Ethena (ENA) price today jumped 19.27% after it was listed on Upbit, South Korea’s biggest crypto exchange. The token moved from around $0.327 to $0.390 before settling near $0.357. Trading goes live at 5:00 PM KST, with support for Ethereum-based deposits and trading pairs in KRW, BTC, and USDT. Even with over 210 million tokens unlocking this month, Ethena’s momentum stayed strong. Protocol revenue growth is helping balance the supply pressure. The Ethena (ENA) price today suggests the market still sees value despite token release events. PEPE Price Outlook Gains Strength on Whale Activity The PEPE price outlook turned more positive after a 17% price rise over the past day. Bitcoin’s move to $116,000, a wedge breakout, and whale accumulation all played a role. Technical signals like MACD and RSI confirmed the bullish setup, while whales pulled more than 9 trillion PEPE off exchanges in just two weeks. That heavy buying has reduced supply and added pressure to the upside. While charts show a near-term overbought zone, the PEPE price outlook remains solid with traders now watching $0.000014 as the next mark to beat. 2 days Left to Unlock 80% BDAG on Launch Day At launch, most BlockDAG holders will unlock 40% of their BDAG coins. But for the next 2 days, a different option is available. The BEAT VESTING PASS lets buyers unlock 80% on day one. Early access could make a difference when the market is most active, offering more liquidity right when new opportunities often appear. Along with faster access, BlockDAG has added a Wallet Change feature that allows users to update their wallet address from their profile. This adds a layer of control and makes the process smoother before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. The mix of early unlock and better account control is turning heads. The numbers behind BlockDAG help explain why it is getting attention among the best cryptos to buy today. The project has raised over $338 million, sold 23.8 billion coins, and climbed 2,660% since the first batch. Even with batch 29 priced at $0.0276, BDAG is still available at $0.0016 for a short time, leading to a rush in activity as launch day nears. Some analysts have shared long-term targets as high as $10. The mix of presale progress, time-limited pricing, and the BEAT VESTING PASS has made BlockDAG a project many are watching closely before August 11. Final Say Momentum is shifting across the market. The Ethena (ENA) price today moved higher after its Upbit listing, and attention is on whether that momentum can continue despite token unlocks. Meanwhile, the PEPE price outlook got a lift as Bitcoin rallied, with whale activity pulling more supply off exchanges. But PEPE’s next move will depend on how the broader market behaves. BlockDAG is following its own path. The BEAT VESTING PASS gives users 80% of their BDAG coins at launch, but the offer is only open for 2 days. As the August 11 deadline approaches, the project is drawing more eyes. With its active presale, short-term price offer, and unique launch setup, BlockDAG is becoming one of the best cryptos to buy today before this limited window closes.

This unexpected rise has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market watchers. What factors are fueling this dramatic climb? Understanding the elements behind this performance could provide insights into other coins poised for similar growth. XRP Price Stays Strong with Recent Gains and Promising Future Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35, reflecting a significant boost of over 25% in the past month. The coin shows stability, inching closer to its nearest hurdle at $2.43. If it breaches this, it could aim for $2.61, in line with its 100-day average, which represents a rise of about 8% from the current range. Trades show moderate momentum with an RSI around 54, indicating room for potential growth. With recent upward moves, XRP continues to capture interest, though it must navigate near-term resistance to unlock more gains. Such movement could mark a brighter path forward for this cryptocurrency. Ethereum Holds Steady, Eyes on Breaking Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Ethereum hovers between $2420 and $2679, showing signs of cautious optimism. Over the past week, the price jumped over 17%, and this month it's up by almost 12%. Despite a dip of about 6% over the past six months, Ethereum's current stance near the $2679 mark keeps traders watchful. The next hurdle sits at $2787, and if the momentum continues, it could challenge the $3047 level. Such a move would mean a rise of around 13.75% from its latest bounds. However, support at $2268 and $2009 should keep it stable if it faces downward pressure. The path forward looks intriguing as traders monitor these pivots closely. Bitcoin on the Rise: What's Next for the Leading Cryptocurrency? Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is moving steadily, ranging from around $106,000 to just above $111,000. It's showing a solid upward trend with a weekly gain of over 8% and about 24% growth over six months. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level, around $114,000. If it breaks this, it could head towards $119,000, reflecting potential growth of nearly 7%. Support levels sit at roughly $103,000 and $97,500, providing cushions if the price drops. The recent upward movement hints at positive momentum, suggesting Bitcoin still has room to grow in the coming months. Conclusion BTC and ETH remain strong players in the crypto market. Recent moves have seen XRP leap to $2.79, showcasing its significant upward momentum. This growth can be attributed to increased adoption, favorable legal developments, and growing investor interest. While BTC and ETH retain their established dominance, XRP shines through its unique attributes. The crypto market continues to evolve, highlighting the competitive landscape among top coins.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 870,600 followers on the social media platform X that XRP’s chart looks bullish and that the altcoin might see new all-time high prices in the coming weeks. But for now, Pentoshi thinks that XRP will take a breather before sparking the next leg up. “XRP: This is probably going to do price discovery in the next two weeks as well, in my opinion… XRP looks disgustingly good even on the BTC pair, to be honest… Also, one with quite a few tailwinds and held up very well for the past several months.” Source: Pentoshi/X As for XRP’s tailwinds, Pentoshi says the altcoin may benefit from Ripple’s push to obtain a banking license and the potential passing of stablecoin regulations into law. Looking at the broader altcoin market, the trader says he’s now seeing the possibility of rotation from large-cap to mid-cap coins. “Mostly been in large caps. So far, they’ve done ver,y very well. Will probably look out for a few mid-caps for [this] week. (Have not looked at those in a while). A lot of the charts structurally look great, and I hope we can get a good few weeks out of it and then go from there.” Mid-cap altcoins are crypto assets with a market cap of $1 billion to $10 billion.

Dragosz pointed to a decline in interest for the search term ”Bitcoin” on Google. According to Google Trends , during the week of July 6–12, the metric reached a level of 40. Although this figure rose amid the rally, it remains far from the peak of 100 points recorded in November 2024, just before bitcoin surpassed $100,000. Dragosz emphasized, ”The recent rebound is mainly driven by institutional investors.” His words are supported by significant inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent trading days. On July 10 and 11, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.18 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, bringing cumulative inflows to a record $52.36 billion, according to SoSoValue. Ethereum funds also recorded substantial inflows, with the all-time total now exceeding $5.3 billion, as reported by SoSoValue Some participants in the crypto industry have suggested that the price of ”digital gold” has become too high for regular investors. Digital asset advocate Lindsey Stamp noted, ”I guess a lot of retail traders find out that one bitcoin is worth $117,000 and think, 'No, I missed my chance,' and don't even consider buying it.” Discussing the topic, Cedric Yangelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, expressed confidence that bitcoin ”won't revive for retail investors for a long time.” About Market Cycles According to Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca, market cycles of new all-time highs followed by deep corrections remain consistent, contrary to popular belief. He believes the risk of a prolonged bear market is very real and does not require a ”catastrophic” event to trigger it. Simple factors such as a general slowdown in news, negative developments, or planned rebalancing of portfolios could spark the next downturn. ”We all want to think bitcoin is an inflation-protection tool, and I believe it will be one day. But I'm not sure if we've already achieved that. I still see it as a very risky asset. At least the correlation between bitcoin, the S&P 500 index, and stocks is still very strong,” Rocca explained. According to Rocca, the ”contagion effect” could simply drain all the news from the market, leading the crypto sector to ”exhaust its potential” in a natural and lengthy process. ”A lot of people say, 'Oh, institutionalization exists, therefore bitcoin's cyclical nature is dead.' I don't really agree with that,” Rocca emphasized.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9917/bitcoin-hits-record-highs-but-where-are-the-retail-investors,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-13T23:00:52,"Tokenized RWA Just Flipped The Switch – Onchain Finance Narrative Back On","The Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization market is gaining strength as momentum builds across the crypto sector. With Bitcoin entering price discovery after breaking past $112K and altcoins showing signs of a sustained recovery, RWA tokens are emerging as one of the most promising sectors within the digital asset space. Recent data reveals that the market cap for RWA tokens has reached $60 billion, supported by rising trading volume and growing institutional interest. This surge comes as investors increasingly seek exposure to blockchain-backed financial instruments that represent tangible assets, such as bonds, real estate, private credit, and commodities. The appeal lies in the ability to bring traditionally illiquid assets on-chain with greater transparency, efficiency, and accessibility. With macro tailwinds favoring the development of alternative markets and demand for yield-bearing instruments rising, RWAs are poised to play a defining role in the next phase of crypto adoption. As capital rotates across sectors, many investors are watching the RWA sector closely for signs of explosive growth. RWA Sector Breaks Out As the digital asset ecosystem matures, RWAs are emerging as a practical and scalable bridge between traditional finance and blockchain innovation. Stablecoins themselves—backed by fiat currency or US treasury bills—can be viewed as the most widely adopted RWA use case, with trillions in annual settlement volume and growing integration across both DeFi and payment platforms. According to the Real World Asset Watchlist, a leading media publication tracking tokenized assets, the RWA sector has just broken out from a long consolidation phase. A recently shared chart shows that the market cap has surged past the $60 billion mark, marking a clean technical breakout that signals renewed investor confidence and institutional participation. With rising trading volumes and momentum building across key protocols, the next logical target is the $80 billion milestone. This surge is not only a price-driven movement—it’s underpinned by structural developments, regulatory clarity, and growing on-chain infrastructure that enables secure tokenization, compliance, and real-world adoption. As capital rotates from highly speculative narratives to more fundamental and yield-generating sectors, RWAs are becoming the centerpiece of the next cycle. The current breakout could serve as a pivotal catalyst, triggering an influx of new products, capital, and participants into the space. If sustained, this could position RWA as one of the primary drivers of crypto’s transition from speculative to institutional-grade finance. Altcoin Market Cap Surges As Breakout Gains Momentum The total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum (TOTAL3) has just posted a decisive weekly breakout, now sitting at $938.6 billion. This move represents an 11.19% gain from the previous week, marking one of the strongest weekly performances of the year for altcoins. Price has convincingly broken above the 50-week moving average (currently at $798B), reclaiming bullish structure and targeting previous cycle highs. This breakout occurs after months of consolidation above the 200-week and 100-week moving averages, both of which acted as key support levels. The surge in volume further confirms the strength of this move, suggesting growing participation from investors rotating capital into the altcoin space as Bitcoin leads the market into price discovery. The chart structure shows a pattern of higher lows, pointing to a potential macro uptrend resumption. With key narratives like real-world asset tokenization (RWAs), DePIN, and Solana-based meme coin ecosystems gaining momentum, the TOTAL3 breakout could be signaling the start of a broader altcoin season.

2025-07-13T22:45:26,"Crypto Bull Says the Wealthy Are Quietly Stacking XRP to Recreate This Bitcoin Action","In a recent X post, crypto analyst Edo Farina claimed that while the masses are being lured into buying fractional amounts of Bitcoin, the wealthy are quietly accumulating XRP, positioning themselves to replicate the kind of life-changing returns seen during Bitcoin’s early years. Farina’s argument underscores a growing sentiment among XRP proponents: that history is rhyming, not repeating, and this time, XRP could be the next major wealth transfer event. The Bitcoin Parallel: Then vs. Now Farina draws a clear line between Bitcoin’s early adopters and today’s XRP accumulators. Back in 2012, savvy investors were buying entire Bitcoins for under $20. These individuals, who are now millionaires, recognized a transformative asset before it gained mass attention. Today, the mainstream narrative encourages the average person to invest in 0.01 BTC, hoping for similar results, despite Bitcoin already trading above $118,000. This, Farina argues, is a psychological trap. “The poor are buying 0.01 BTC hoping it’ll make them rich,” he said, “brainwashed by mainstream media and influencers.” Meanwhile, the smart money is investing in XRP, not because it’s trendy, but because it’s early. Today’s millionaires bought Bitcoin back in 2012. Now the poor are buying 0.01 BTC, hoping it’ll make them rich, brainwashed by mainstream media and influencers. Meanwhile, the wealthy are telling the masses to buy BTC… while quietly stacking $XRP behind the scenes. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 13, 2025 XRP: The New Wealth Transfer Vehicle? Farina believes XRP presents a similar opportunity to what Bitcoin offered a decade ago . With its price still relatively low and strong potential for institutional adoption, XRP remains accessible to everyday investors. According to recent data, owning just 2,486 XRP places you in the top 10% of global XRP holders, a staggering insight when compared to Bitcoin’s elite thresholds. He’s frequently stated that holding just 1,000 XRP could be “the best financial decision of your life.” If XRP reaches $100 per coin, that stack becomes $100,000. At $1,000, it’s life-changing. And if XRP were to reach a speculative $10,000 per coin, those 1,000 tokens would be worth $10 million. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Potential Unlike many altcoins, XRP has gained significant legal ground. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the public, providing regulatory clarity that few cryptocurrencies enjoy. This decision has paved the way for institutional confidence, renewed partnerships, and potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the future . Institutional sentiment appears to be shifting in XRP’s favor. Several macro analysts have forecasted XRP price targets ranging from $27 to $250, citing regulatory wins, Ripple’s enterprise partnerships, and the token’s growing use in cross-border payments as key catalysts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Quiet Accumulation and Missed Opportunities Edo Farina’s thesis is echoed in recent accumulation trends. Influential figures, including the once-famous “Dogecoin Millionaire,” have quietly pivoted to XRP, accumulating while attention remains fixed on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Farina warns against falling into the trap of buying what’s already run its course. “Don’t be the person who sold Bitcoin at $500 and missed $90,000,” he cautioned, implying that selling XRP early could mirror that same regret . He emphasizes the importance of patience and conviction, especially when the crowd is looking elsewhere. XRP’s Moment May Be Now While mainstream narratives fixate on Bitcoin, Farina’s insight suggests the true opportunity lies in XRP. The combination of legal clarity, early-stage pricing, institutional potential, and concentrated accumulation by wealthy investors paints a compelling picture. For those willing to look beyond the noise, XRP may very well be the digital asset that echoes Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, and rewards those who recognized it early.

2025-07-13T22:00:12,"Mike Novogratz Reacts To Peter Schiff’s Bitcoin Criticism","The world’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has hit a new record , crossing $118,000, but not everyone is cheering. Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of Bitcoin, took another shot at the digital currency. In a recent X post , Schiff called the top coin meaningless and pushed investors to move their money into silver instead. This time, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz had enough and responded directly to Schiff. Peter Schiff Doubles Down on His Anti-Bitcoin Views Peter Schiff, a well-known supporter of gold and silver, has spent over a decade warning people about Bitcoin. He claims the flagship crypto has no real value and that its limited supply is arbitrary. Even as Bitcoin continues to rise, Schiff insists it is nothing more than “digital fool’s gold.” As Bitcoin crossed all-time highs, Schiff told investors it was a good time to sell and buy silver. He said silver had more room to grow and less risk of crashing. Schiff believes silver could soon break above $40 and go even higher. At the same time, he warned that Bitcoin could easily crash. Mike Novogratz Fires Back at Schiff Mike Novogratz, a strong supporter of Bitcoin , quickly responded to Schiff’s latest comments. He criticized Schiff for ignoring Bitcoin’s growth and holding onto outdated views. Novogratz and many others in the crypto world believe Schiff refuses to accept how far Bitcoin has come. Novogratz pointed out that despite all of Schiff’s warnings over the years, Bitcoin has continued to grow in price and popularity. For over ten years, Schiff has warned that Bitcoin would fail. However, at the same time, Bitcoin has gone from a niche project to a global financial asset with a market value of over $2.2 trillion, larger than silver. While silver has seen some gains, its performance has not matched the top coin’s rise. Bitcoin has become more widely accepted by investors, companies, and even governments. Meanwhile, Schiff’s repeated warnings have become something of a joke online, with some calling him the best “contrarian indicator.” This means that whenever he says Bitcoin will fall, it usually rises instead. Peter Schiff Shows No Signs of Changing His Mind Even when asked what would make him admit he was wrong, Schiff has said only a world where Bitcoin replaces all fiat money would convince him. He believes that the outcome is still far away, if not impossible. Mike Novogratz and other crypto supporters continue to call out Schiff’s missed predictions, saying it is time to accept the facts. They argue that Bitcoin’s record speaks for itself.

2025-07-13T22:00:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction below $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.4664 Price Change 24h -1% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.4664 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis PIUSDT is consolidating near $0.4665, showing indecision ahead of the key announcement. PIUSDT support is forming near $0.4900, holding despite minor day declines. Resistance is around $0.5123, holding upside momentum in current trading range. As of July 13th 2025 PIUSDT is trading within a tight range, showing limited volatility. The price briefly touched a high of $0.4900 before pulling back. It closed near $0.4665, marking a small decrease. Trading volume remained moderate, reflecting cautious sentiment among traders. Pi 1-day price chart stalls as traders watch for a breakout PIUSDT is priced at $0.4664, showing a small upward movement on the daily chart. The RSI on the 24hour chart stands between 36.95 and 39.17, indicating weakening bullish strength. MACD values are at -0.00354, -0.032250, and -0.0361, pointing to sustained bearish momentum. These signals reflect a cautious market awaiting a clear directional shift. PiUsdt 1day chart by trading view Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network (PI) is currently priced at $0.4660 on the 4-hour chart, reflecting a narrow trading range. The pair has shown minimal movement, with slight fluctuations failing to break key levels. RSI remains neutral around 44.94, indicating a balanced momentum between buyers and sellers. MACD values of -0.0023 and -0.0001 suggest low volatility and indecision in the short term. Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. Pi Network has announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the main net, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility. Creating apps through Pi App Studio means anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, is able to own and run an online product and business built around their expertise and ideas. https://t.co/Vv88Jsqv8v This is made possible through the use of AI and supported by the blockchain… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) July 3, 2025 Pi Price Prediction July 2025 Heading into July 2025, the price of Pi is predicted to reach an average price of $0.5110, while the coin could trade between a maximum of $0.5256 and a minimum of $0.4672.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. As of July 13 PIUSDT is trading sideways, holding near $0.4665 with minimal price movement.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

Here is the Latest Situation in Altcoin Season Index","In the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to attract the attention of investors with its performance in the last 90 days. However, the volatility in altcoins, overshadowed by this rise, is not to be ignored. According to CoinMarketCap's (CMC) “Altcoin Season Index,” the market is still in a Bitcoin-heavy period. With a score of 31 out of 100, we are still in “Bitcoin Season.” However, it's noteworthy that some altcoins are significantly outperforming Bitcoin, generating substantial returns for investors. In order to call it an altcoin season, the value must rise above 75 in the index. Related News: How Much Profit Would You Make If You Regularly Bought Bitcoin Every Day Since 2022?

2025-07-13T21:00:40,"BlockDAG Redefines Layer 1 Infrastructure with PoW-DAG Hybrid as DAG Tech Surpasses Legacy Chains","Since Bitcoin’s debut in 2009, blockchain has been the go-to infrastructure for crypto projects. But after fifteen years, its limitations are hard to ignore. High fees, congestion, and slow confirmations still impact even billion-dollar chains. That’s where DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs, come in as a powerful alternative. Unlike traditional blockchains, DAG systems use a structure that enables transactions to process in parallel. Instead of linear blocks, data is stored as interconnected nodes across a graph, allowing faster confirmations, greater throughput, and scalability. While earlier projects like IOTA and Kaspa explored this concept, one newer platform is making real progress, BlockDAG . It’s a hybrid Layer 1 chain combining Proof-of-Work security with DAG’s parallel architecture. With momentum building fast, it’s clear the crypto community is taking notice. What Makes DAG Different, & Why It Solves Blockchain’s Bottlenecks One of blockchain’s core limitations is transaction bottlenecking. Every transfer must be included in a sequential block, which limits how many can be processed at a time. Even top networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum still struggle with throughput. DAG removes this constraint by eliminating the need for blocks altogether. Transactions instead verify each other directly, forming a branching graph. That lets the network confirm multiple transfers at once, delivering major benefits: Faster transaction confirmations Lower transaction fees Greater scalability and throughput More efficient energy usage This model is especially useful for real-world applications. Whether it’s retail payments, smart cities, IoT, or enterprise use, DAG systems offer the speed, cost-efficiency, and scale that standard blockchains may never fully deliver. BlockDAG’s Hybrid Architecture Combines Speed & Proof-of-Work Security BlockDAG isn’t just another DAG project, it brings something extra to the table. By layering DAG transaction structure with a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, it creates a unique hybrid that balances both performance and security. Here’s how it works: miners still validate and secure transactions like Bitcoin, but instead of being packed into blocks, those transactions flow across a DAG network. This setup allows BlockDAG to stay decentralized and permissionless while improving efficiency and speed. It’s a step beyond what Kaspa offers, and BlockDAG is pushing forward even faster. Developer tools, an active testnet, and user-friendly mining apps are already live, helping to build a strong foundation for adoption. Live Testnet, Over $338M Raised, & a User Base in the Millions BlockDAG isn’t just promising on paper. Its ecosystem is already expanding. The public testnet is live, supporting node creation, smart contract development, and dApp testing. More than 2 million users are currently mining BDAG through the X1 Miner app, and 18,000+ ASIC miners have been distributed in preparation for the mainnet launch. The presale has crossed $338 million, with over 23.8 billion BDAG coins sold. This makes it one of the largest decentralized crypto fundraising efforts since projects like Filecoin and Tezos. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release scheduled for August 11 , time is running out for early entry. But it’s not just about tech. BlockDAG has also made major moves in marketing. It’s now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) and Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket), bringing BDAG to wide-reaching sports audiences through NFT rewards and fan engagement tools. Add to that previous campaigns featuring UFC star Alex Pereira and European football club Inter Milan, and you get a clear view of how seriously BlockDAG is working to go mainstream. Final Price: $0.0016 Until August 11, Then It Moves At the moment, BDAG is priced at just $0.0016, a valuation that stands out among early-stage Layer 1 platforms. But this won’t last. BlockDAG is offering a special promotion: 80% of coins unlocked on Day 1. That’s a significant upgrade over standard vesting models, and the deal only runs for a short time. Once the presale closes and mainnet goes live, pricing is expected to shift upward fast. With a projected listing price of $0.05 and a max presale goal of $600 million, buyers today are eyeing a 3,025% potential ROI. Whether it follows in Kaspa’s footsteps or creates its own path, BlockDAG is clearly positioned as a top contender in the next wave of scalable, secure crypto infrastructure.

2025-07-13T21:00:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $120K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $119,000 (+4%) Market cap $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $111,970; May 22, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $119,376 24-hour low $117,000 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $119,000 Price Prediction $ 128,009 (10.76%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 1.77% Green Days 17/30 (57%) 50-Day SMA $ 106,055 200-Day SMA $ 87,760 14-Day RSI 54.56 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin triggered bullish pressure toward $120K. Resistance for BTC is at $119,842 Support for BTC/USD is at $116,412 The BTC price analysis for 13 July confirms that BTC faces a surge in volatility as the price surged toward $120K. The price is now making a strong comeback above EMA trend lines. BTC price analysis 1-day chart: Bitcoin faces bullish volatility above $118K Analyzing the daily Bitcoin price chart, we see that Bitcoin faced strong bullish pressure as it surged above $118K. Currently, buyers are triggering significant domination, resulting in a surge above immediate Fib levels toward $120K. The 24-hour volume has dropped to $978 million, showing a decline in trading interest today. BTC is trading at $119,000, surging by over 4% in the last 24 hours. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level and trades around the overbought region at 74, hinting that a bearish correction is on the edge. The SMA-14 level suggests volatility in the next few hours. BTC/USD 4-hour price chart: Bearish domination rises around EMA trend lines The 4-hour Bitcoin price chart suggests that bulls are strengthening their position to hold the price above the EMA trend lines. However, sellers are aiming for a trend continuation below $118K. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a positive region at 0.47, showing that short-term buyers are taking a chance to accelerate an upward trend. However, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for negative momentum, strengthening short-position holders’ confidence. Bitcoin technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 98,932 BUY SMA 5 $ 103,614 BUY SMA 10 $ 103,974 BUY SMA 21 $ 105,042 BUY SMA 50 $ 106,055 BUY SMA 100 $ 97,560 BUY SMA 200 $ 87,760 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 105,503 BUY EMA 5 $ 103,787 BUY EMA 10 $ 98,961 BUY EMA 21 $ 93,313 BUY EMA 50 $ 90,453 BUY EMA 100 $ 90,298 BUY EMA 200 $ 86,428 BUY What to expect from BTC price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $119,842, it will fuel a bullish rally to $122,349. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $116,412, beginning a bearish trend to $112,323. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $120K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $110K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $248,568 throughout the year. Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548. The average price is anticipated to stabilize at about $303,555 throughout the year.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare
