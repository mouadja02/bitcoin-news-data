2025-07-14T13:58:21,"Semler Scientific: Still A Cheap Proxy For Bitcoin's Surge","Summary Semler Scientific remains a high-leverage Bitcoin proxy, trading near BTC NAV while pursuing aggressive, accretive BTC per-share growth. The company now holds 4,636 BTC, funded through free cash flow, ATM equity raises, and $100M in convertible notes. While core business faces short-term pressure and BTC volatility adds risk, the stock’s deep value and upside potential make it appealing for BTC bulls. In late March, I covered Semler Scientific ( SMLR ) for the first time as part of a series of articles focusing on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) Treasury Companies. My thesis was simple. I argued that the stock was a great bet as you were getting most of the company's BTC holdings and cash as book value in the share price, and, thus, the rest of the company's medical operations ""for free"". My idea played out well during this period, as Semler's stock is about 17% in less than four months. However, this appreciation wasn't really due to a re-rating but instead due to Bitcoin's notable appreciation to new all-time highs. In fact, Semler is still as cheap if not cheaper since my previous article, which is why I believe it remains an excellent proxy for Bitcoin exposure, assuming of course, that you are a feel that the experiment Bitcoin Treasury Companies are running (i.e., leveraging the public markets to accumulatig BTC in more accretive ways which can result in levered BTC returns compared to holding the actual crypto or a spot ETF like IBIT), is going to work over the long run. Where is Semler today, and where is it going? As of writing this article, Semler holds 4,636 BTC , worth roughly $550 million at Bitcoin’s current price of $118,600 per coin. That’s up 45% from the 3,192 BTC they held when I first covered the stock back in March, with 1,444 new coins added for $149.6 million. The company has financed these buys through a mix of the $24.4 million in free cash flow last year from their QuantaFlo device (a blood-flow diagnostic tool for peripheral arterial disease), proceeds from at-the-market (ATM) share offerings, and the $100M 4.25% convertible senior notes issued earlier in Q1. Specifically, Semler sold 4,116,735 shares for $156.6 million in net proceeds between April 15 and July 2, 2025, under its $500 million ATM program that management launched in April 2025, which replaced their prior $150 million program. Here are all the BTC buys they did within Q2 by utilizing cash from these sources. Semler BTC Metrics (Semler IR) Semler is now the 15th-largest BTC Treasury Company, and while newcomers in the BTC accumulation game came with bigger bucks and surpassed it lately, including ProCap Acquisition Corp ( PCAPU ) and GameStop ( GME ), they will have to fight hard with Semler, as the company targets holding 105,000 BTC by the end of 2027 , and so far, has been way more commited when it comes to buying BTC regularly compared to companies like ProCap, GameStop, and Cantor Equity Partners/TWENTY ONE ( CEP ), which quickly rose the ranks as they came in heavy from the get go. BTC Treasury Companies (Bitcoin Treasuries Net) Convertible Debt: A Clear Example of The Value SMLR Can Create Now, if you haven't been following BTC Treasury Companies, it's natural to get confused. First, you wonder, what's the point of investing in a company vs just buying the actual digital commodity, and assuming there is a point, how do I choose which BTC Treasury company to buy? The first question has an easy answer. The idea here is that BTC Treasury Companies can leverage public market instruments to achieve BTC per share accretion. As for which one to choose, it’s obviously all very speculative, since there’s often a huge gap between how well a company can leverage financial instruments and the underlying multiple the market assigns to it, and that varies significantly from case to case. In some cases, the proof of concept is rock-solid, like with Strategy ( MSTR ), but smaller companies, including Semler, have indeed shown aptitude. Their $100M coverts, which was oversubscribed, is a great example of how they can create ""yield"" for shareholders by leveraging th public markets. These notes, with an initial conversion price of $76.44/share , let noteholders swap debt for equity if SMLR’s stock rises above that level. However, Semler also entered into capped call transactions that are designed to reduce dilution from conversions. As management explained in the latest earnings call, these hedges raise the effective conversion price to around $170 per share , a level above which dilution actually starts to affect existing shareholders. So, for simplicity and transparency, we’ll use the $76.44 conversion price from the SEC filing. This strategy allows Semler to retire debt without using cash, issuing stock instead, turning financial leverage into greater Bitcoin exposure. The key result is an increase in Bitcoin/share, which is the very metric you care about when you invest in a BTC Treasury Company, as I mentioned earlier. Here's how it works: Semler had 11.672 million diluted shares outstanding, including shares from prior ATM offerings and potential note conversions per their May 23rd 8-K and 4,636 BTC, or 0.000397 BTC per share. Suppose the $100 million in notes converts at $76.44, creating 1.308 million new shares, for a new total of 12.980 million shares. Suppose that $100 million bought 1,250 BTC at $80,000 per coin in early 2025. If Bitcoin hits $150,000 by 2026, for example, Semler’s 4,636 BTC would be worth $695 million, or 0.000357 BTC per share ( 4,636 ÷ 12,980,000 = 0.000357 BTC/share). Without the debt, Semler would have 3,386 BTC (i.e., excluding the 1,250 BTC it couldn't buy) and 11.672 million shares, or 0.000290 BTC per share. That’s a 23.1% increase in BTC per share (0.000357 vs. 0.000290). At $225,000 per BTC, it’s $80.33 vs. $65.25 of Bitcoin value per share, still, of course, a 23.1% gain. In other words, the added Bitcoin from the convertible debt more than offsets the dilution, meaning every share holds more BTC, which is what warrants a premium to NAV multiple, as investors are supposed to want to pay a little extra for that accretion potential versus holding a spot ETF, which, of course, doesn't engage in such activities. Semler Is Still Cheap Despite The Risks But despite this accretion potential, Semler still trades barely above the NAV of its BTC. As I mentioned, its BTC value is now at $550 million, and its market cap is just $623 million. So you are buying the rest of the company and the debt for $173 million (debt at ~$100M), and mind you that the core business posted $24.4 million in free cash flow last year, which would price the stock at 7x FCF. Semler Annual FCF (Koyfin) Now, FCF should come in materially lower this year, reflecting real pressure on the core business. In Q1, revenue dropped 27% YoY to $11.6 million, as one of Semler’s major customers scaled back purchases, and onboarding delays hit top-line growth. However, management suggested this could rebound later in the year, so even if the company doesn't grow its FCF much from last year's levels, the valuation multiple is still very attractive. Then you also have the risk of BTC price volatility. It's all fine when Bitcoin is rising and investor appetite is strong, but it introduces meaningful risk. If the price of BTC falls, the company could be left with a leveraged balance sheet and underwater Bitcoin holdings, especially with its $100 million in convertible debt on the books. The exotic financing, including ATM sales and convertibles, only works if BTC performs and the market continues to reward BTC per share growth. If those assumptions break, dilution and financial strain will follow quickly, but of course, the investment case assumes you are a BTC believer in the first place, looking for a vehicle that can offer levered returns, so it all balances out risk/reward-wise. Final Thoughts Semler remains a compelling, high-conviction bet if you are bullish on Bitcoin. Its disciplined accumulation, creative financing, and proven BTC per-share accretion offer leveraged crypto exposure at a discount, considering the mNAV and the underlying core business's free cash flow potential. I hold shares, but have found out that selling OTM puts makes for a great strategy to accumulate hefty premiums while allowing you to set your entry price. If you place your strike price at, say, 0.9X its BTC holdings, you are essentially getting a wide margin of safety, as such a notable multiple compression on the BTC book value is unlikely, all while premiums remain very high given the high volatility attached to the stock. This strategy is worth considering if you are looking to play it safe while indirectly capturing the BTC's upside.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801077-semler-scientific-still-a-cheap-proxy-for-bitcoins-surge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET","BTC-USD|SMLR",cryptocompare

Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. The Plomin Hard Fork, which activated in Q1 2025, has significantly enhanced Cardano’s appeal to investors by establishing full decentralized governance. This is seen as a key milestone that aligns with the blockchain’s long-term vision of community-driven decision-making. Despite these advancements, bullish attraction post-Plomin Hard Fork was tempered by market dynamics and challenges, on its price chart. However, in Q2 2025, things seem to have changed , as a variety of optimistic factors surround the altcoin sector, which is benefiting the ADA price. As a result, Cardano price prediction is heating up again in the community. With bullish technical signals, major upgrades, and ETF hopes rising , many are intrigued to know, “Is ADA Price ready for a massive breakout?” Here’s a detailed ADA price prediction for 2025 and beyond, including expert targets up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Assuming that Cardano continues to focus on the network’s upcoming updates, we can expect a wider adoption rate. Even the ETF odds has higher approval rate that could bring large crowd wil multi-billion dollars into the asset, once approved. Therefore, we expect the ADA price to reach $2.05 in 2025.

Over the last 22 days, it has recovered nearly 47% from the $0.55 support level. With the recent bullish momentum in the crypto sector, by mid-July, the ADA price has broken out from the upper border of the declining wedge. With the growing hopes of an ADA ETF, rising institutional interest, and global sentiment rising as BTC jumped to a new ATH of $123,231. ADA has now pierced the 200-day EMA band and turned it into support. The current rally shows a sustained bullish momentum that could lead to higher levels. The key level to watch next is $0.83. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $1.10, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.32 by July end. Moreover, in the past 15-day span, Spot volume has peaked at $1.82 billion, active addresses (7d) have increased to 147K, and whale transactions are also pacing up. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum. However, failure to stay above $0.70 could send ADA back to $0.65, and $0.55 Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) July 2025 $0.40 $0.74 $1.10 ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. If ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends.

2025-07-14T13:51:37,"El Salvador BTC portfolio surges to $767M as BTC sets $123K all-time high","El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings have tripled in value to over $767 million as of July 14. The country’s BTC holdings surged as Bitcoin broke to new all-time highs Monday, reaching $123,000. El Salvador’s BTC holdings could inch up higher this week as more developments in the sector are expected this week of July 14, which the House labeled “Crypto Week.” The U.S. House of Representatives will be considering several crypto legislations on Monday, including the GENIUS Act , in a bid to establish a clearer regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. El Salvador continues accumulating BTC despite IMF measures As bitcoin rockets past $120,000, El Salvador's Strategic Bitcoin Reserve soars to yet another new all time USD high: 💰$747,214,660 pic.twitter.com/WIs8XwjCtA — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) July 14, 2025 Data from the country’s Bitcoin Office showed that in the last seven days, the country has added 8 BTC to its national reserves, pushing its total holdings to 6,237.18 BTC . El Salvador’s Bitcoin accumulation initiative is part of President Nayib Bukele’s commitment to his “1 BTC a day” strategy. The Central American country was the first to adopt BTC as legal tender in 2021, but it reversed its decision in January, following pressure from the IMF. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) struck a $1.4B loan deal with the nation, which urged the government to halt its Bitcoin accumulation strategy and drop BTC’s status as legal tender. Despite the IMF’s non-accumulation stipulation, the nation has continued to purchase one BTC per day from Bukele’s strategy, initiated in 2022. The global lender issued the loan in December 2024 and said it would cover El Salvador for 40 months to reduce its debt-to-GDP ratio. The IMF also revealed that other banks, such as the World Bank, will chip in additional loans to push the total financing deal to over $3.5 billion. Rodrigo Valdes, director of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere Department, argued that El Salvador was still compliant with the institution’s directives despite the continued purchase of the digital asset. The global lender maintains that the restrictions called for El Salvador to drop its Bitcoin plans were due to BTC’s speculative nature, which poses a risk to the country. Stacy Herbert, director of the National Bitcoin Office (ONBTC), said the country is now branded globally as “Bitcoin Country,” proving that the Central American nation made the extraordinary possible. Herbert also compared El Salvador to Switzerland’s financial reputation built on gold, arguing that it has the potential to do the same with Bitcoin. El Salvador to build the first native BTC Capital Markets infrastructure The front page of today's highest-circulation newspaper proves the success of my work over the past 3.5 years in El Salvador. The Bitcoin Office never once took a shortcut. Our country brand speaks for itself: we built the extraordinary by choosing excellence over mediocrity. pic.twitter.com/8mQ2jFfWB8 — Stacy Herbert 🇸🇻🚀 (@stacyherbert) July 10, 2025 El Salvador also announced plans to build the first BTC-based capital markets infrastructure firm. Nexbridge and Nexplace revealed that they will spearhead the development of the trading platforms. Both firms completed an $8M Series A funding round to construct the new Capital Markets infrastructure. The funding was previously licensed and authorized by Salvadoran authorities and was led by Fulgar Ventures, hoping it will help boost the establishment of the capital markets in the second half of 2025. “We chose El Salvador because it offers legal certainty, openness to innovation, and a clear political will to become a next-generation financia l center.” -Michele Crivelli, CEO of Nexbridge and Nexplace. Criveli mentioned that the new trading platform will offer access to bonds and equities and include services to raise capital and issue token shares using BTC rails. He also acknowledged that establishing the infrastructure will take some time, but the country’s regulation offers the tools to accomplish the proposal. Criveli also believes the initiative will prove that the county can issue virtual assets securely. Last month, the U.S. Senate introduced the “El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025,” led by Senators Tim Kaine, Chris Van Hollen, and Alex Padilla. The legislation is focused on sanctioning the country’s executive branch involved in alleged gross violations of international human rights.

The token was trading at $9.80 at press time, showing a 13% gain over the past week. Nonetheless, the asset is still much lower than the ATH of $73.43, which is nearly an 87% decrease. This upward movement of the token is accompanied by a new ATH of Bitcoin (BTC) to $123,000, which has brought gains to most altcoins. Technical Indicators Show Tight Price Range Looking at the chart, TRUMP has been consolidating within a narrow price range of $8 to $10. Bollinger Bands have tightened, with the upper band at $9.94 and the lower band at $8.16, reflecting reduced volatility in recent sessions. Source: TradingView The price is close to its upper band and above the 20-day moving average at $9.05. The MACD line has also advanced above the signal and zero lines, indicating positive short-term momentum. However, a confirmed trend change has yet to occur. Token Unlock Set for July 18 Raises Market Questions Tokenomics data from Tokenomist shows that TRUMP’s founding team is scheduled to unlock 90 million tokens on July 18. This is nearly 45% of the total circulating supply and is worth $880 million. Source: Tokenomist The unlock is part of a broader wave of insider token releases in the altcoin market, which is expected to exceed $1.1 billion this week. These scheduled unlocks may introduce additional selling pressure unless demand increases. The TRUMP token will soon be supported on the Tron blockchain. Tron DAO confirmed the move, which could bring the token into a wider network and potentially increase its use across platforms. Major exchanges such as Coinbase were swift to list the token early this year. While Coinbase typically conducts extended reviews, the listing process for TRUMP was completed in one day.

The latest to go down this road is Grayscale Investments, as the entity said it had confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-1 to the SEC in order to begin public trading. “The number of shares to be registered and the price range for the proposed registration have not yet been determined. The registration is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions,” reads the statement . If approved, Grayscale will follow the likes of Coinbase, which went public years ago, and, more recently, Circle. The stablecoin issuer’s shares (CRCL) started trading in early June and have exploded in value from under $50 to almost $190 as of Friday’s closing price. Grayscale’s filing comes just as the crypto market was revived once again during this cycle, with BTC’s price breaking into uncharted territory and currently trading above $121,000 after setting a new peak earlier today at just north of $123,000.

2025-07-14T13:45:18,"Alleged Ponzi Fraudster Fleeces $140,000,000 From 300 Investors After Loan Business Collapse: SEC","The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says that a Georgia man allegedly defrauded 300 investors in a Ponzi scheme after his loan business fell apart. In a new press release , the SEC is accusing Edwin Brant Frost IV and his business, First Liberty Building & Loan, of running a Ponzi scheme by misappropriating funds and misleading investors. According to authorities, between 2014 and June 2025, the firm operated by offering investors promissory notes and loan participation agreements with returns of up to 18% for short-term loans to businesses at high interest rates that rarely defaulted. Frost and his company allegedly assured investors that the defaulted loans would be repaid by borrowers using funds from the Small Business Administration or other commercial lenders. But since 2021, Frost allegedly ran First Liberty Building & Loan as a Ponzi scheme after most loans defaulted. The SEC accuses Frost of using new investor capital to make principal and interest payments to existing investors. The complaint also alleges that Frost misappropriated the funds for personal use, such as purchasing rare coins, paying off personal debt and going on vacations. The SEC accuses Frost and First Liberty Building & Loan of defrauding 300 investors to the tune of $140 million. Says Justin C. Jeffries, Associate Director of Enforcement for the SEC’s Atlanta Regional Office, “The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money. Unfortunately, we’ve seen this movie before – bad actors luring investors with promises of seemingly over-generous returns– and it does not end well.” In a statement to Fox News, Frost admits his involvement and wrongdoing in the scheme and says he will cooperate with investigators. “I take full responsibility for my actions and am resolved to spend the rest of my life trying to repay as much as I can to the many people I misled and let down. I will be cooperating with the receiver and federal authorities and ask that everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to Ali Martinez, the current bull run was fueled by Bitcoin breaking out of a months-long parallel trading channel, a move that sets the stage for further gains, he said in an X post on July 14. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Martinez explained that the breakout represents a major shift in market structure. Specifically, Bitcoin’s surge past the crucial resistance zone near $113,000 confirmed the ongoing bullish trend that’s been forming since April. After spending weeks consolidating below that level, the breakout has now flipped former resistance into support, clearing the path for another leg higher. Martinez pointed out that the $123,000 peak was the first major upside target following the breakout. Bitcoin price levels to watch Now that it’s been achieved, attention turns to the next key resistance levels at $131,000, $144,000, and $158,000, all of which align with long-term technical projections and psychological market barriers. Meanwhile, fellow analyst Ted Pillows shared a similar outlook in a separate X post on July 14. According to Pillows, Bitcoin’s next target is likely $125,000, a level that could be reached within days. He noted that Bitcoin appears to be moving through a classic Wyckoff accumulation pattern, with $125,000 marking a critical resistance before any possible consolidation phase. $BTC made another ATH today.

2025-07-14T13:40:49,"Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Soar: Japanese Giant Unveils Massive 16,352 BTC Stash","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet Bitcoin Holdings Soar: Japanese Giant Unveils Massive 16,352 BTC Stash The world of corporate finance is witnessing a seismic shift, and at the forefront of this revolution is Japan’s Metaplanet. In a bold move that underscores growing confidence in digital assets, Metaplanet has just announced a significant Metaplanet Bitcoin acquisition, further solidifying its position as a leading proponent of cryptocurrency integration into traditional business models. What Does Metaplanet’s Latest BTC Acquisition Mean? Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company, continues to make headlines with its aggressive Bitcoin (BTC) strategy. The firm recently announced the purchase of an additional 797 BTC, valued at approximately $93.68 million. This latest BTC acquisition isn’t just a number; it’s a statement. It propels Metaplanet’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 16,352 BTC, positioning as a major institutional holder globally. This consistent accumulation reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For context, consider these key aspects of Metaplanet’s strategy: Strategic Accumulation: Metaplanet isn’t just buying Bitcoin; it’s systematically integrating it into its treasury management strategy. This isn’t a one-off purchase but part of an ongoing commitment. Inflation Hedge: In an era of global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, companies like Metaplanet are increasingly looking to Bitcoin as a robust hedge against currency debasement. Long-Term Vision: The scale of their holdings suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s future as a global reserve asset and a foundational technology. Why Are We Seeing More Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Metaplanet’s actions are part of a broader trend of increasing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption . While MicroStrategy remains the poster child for this movement, many other publicly traded companies are following suit. Why? The reasons are multifaceted: Macroeconomic Climate: Persistent inflation, quantitative easing, and geopolitical instability are driving companies to seek alternative store-of-value assets outside of traditional fiat currencies. Digital Transformation: Businesses are increasingly recognizing the digital nature of future finance and want to be early movers in this space. Shareholder Value: For some companies, adopting a Bitcoin strategy is seen as a way to enhance shareholder value by diversifying assets and potentially benefiting from Bitcoin’s appreciation. Transparency and Decentralization: The transparent and decentralized nature of Bitcoin appeals to companies looking for assets free from central bank control. This trend is not limited to tech companies; it spans various sectors, indicating a maturing perception of Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset rather than a speculative gamble. What’s Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy? Understanding Metaplanet’s approach provides valuable insights into a successful Bitcoin Investment Strategy . Their strategy appears to be rooted in a long-term hold (HODL) philosophy, focusing on accumulation during market dips and maintaining a significant treasury allocation to Bitcoin. This contrasts with short-term trading strategies and emphasizes Bitcoin’s role as a primary reserve asset. Key elements of their strategy likely include: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): While large lump sum purchases are made, a consistent approach over time helps mitigate volatility. Treasury Reserve Asset: Positioning Bitcoin as a core component of their treasury, similar to how companies hold cash or bonds. Public Commitment: Their transparency about holdings signals confidence and can attract investors who believe in the future of digital assets. This strategic clarity offers a template for other companies contemplating similar moves, demonstrating that a well-defined approach can navigate the complexities of crypto markets. How Significant Are Japanese Bitcoin Holdings Like Metaplanet’s? The emergence of substantial Japanese Bitcoin Holdings , particularly from publicly traded entities like Metaplanet, carries significant weight. Japan has historically been a key player in the crypto space, known for its progressive regulatory environment and high retail adoption. Metaplanet’s commitment further legitimizes Bitcoin within a major global economy. Significance of Japanese corporate adoption: Regulatory Clarity: Japan has one of the most developed regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, which provides a more stable environment for corporate investment. Market Influence: Large Japanese corporate holdings can influence local market sentiment and potentially encourage other domestic firms to explore similar strategies. Global Precedent: As a G7 nation, Japan’s corporate embrace of Bitcoin sets an important global precedent, especially for other Asian economies. Metaplanet’s actions could pave the way for a wave of institutional interest from other Japanese corporations, accelerating the mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin. What Are the Implications of Such Large BTC Acquisitions? Each significant BTC acquisition by a major corporation like Metaplanet sends ripples through the market. These purchases reduce the available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges, potentially contributing to price appreciation over the long term. More importantly, they signal a maturation of the asset class and a growing acceptance among traditional finance players. Implications include: Supply Shock: As more Bitcoin moves into long-term corporate treasuries, the circulating supply available for trading diminishes, which could lead to upward price pressure. Increased Legitimacy: Each new corporate adoption adds to Bitcoin’s credibility, making it more appealing to other cautious investors and institutions. Market Stability: Institutional holders often have a longer time horizon, potentially contributing to less volatility compared to short-term retail trading. Competitive Pressure: Companies might feel pressure to consider Bitcoin as a treasury asset if their competitors are seeing benefits from it. Metaplanet’s latest move is more than just a financial transaction; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of corporate finance and the undeniable rise of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Conclusion: Metaplanet Paving the Way Metaplanet’s consistent and substantial Bitcoin acquisitions are a powerful indicator of a fundamental shift in corporate treasury management. By embracing Bitcoin as a core asset, the Japanese company is not only securing its own financial future against macroeconomic headwinds but also setting a compelling example for other corporations globally. Their strategy highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a robust inflation hedge and a significant value driver in the long run. As more companies recognize these benefits, the trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption is likely to accelerate, reshaping the financial landscape for decades to come.

The latest share placement and addition to the treasury was announced on a day of BTC records, where the coin briefly rose as high as $123,000. The effect of Strategy on the price of BTC is becoming more subdued, as more corporate players are joining with regular or sporadic purchases. This time, Strategy’s announcement arrived a few hours after Metaplanet announced the addition of 797 BTC to its treasury. Strategy motivates other buyers Other companies have also drawn attention to their holdings and shares today. The Blockchain Group added another 29 BTC to its portfolio, in its usual approach of smaller acquisitions with no fixed schedule. DigitalX added another 109 BTC at $118,010 per coin, demonstrating the readiness to buy even at the new peak prices. KULR Tech joined the list of companies holding over 1,000 BTC after its latest purchase of 90 BTC. The British company TAO Alpha added 28 BTC, its treasury-initiating purchase. The company’s initial goal is to add 100 BTC. Treasury companies are still buying almost daily, with new ones starting with small additions. Despite the warnings, adding BTC is seen as a store of value, showing that a reserve playbook for Bitcoin is becoming even more widely accepted. MSTR charts a new yearly peak MSTR shares have completely recovered from the slump in Q2, despite warnings of dilution. The recent BTC rally was reflected by MSTR, which rose to a peak for 2025. MSTR expanded to $434.58, rising over 44% for the year to date. In the short term, MSTR is expected to rally to over $450 and continue to its previous peak above $540. The price moves of MSTR are seen as a proxy for BTC, with the expectation for a hike to $130,000. However, BTC price moves also boost demand for MSTR, which varies on a weekly basis. The recent market excitement and records boosted demand for all of Strategy’s share types. STRK traded at $122.50, near its peak for 2025. STRF was at $122.38, while the newest addition, STRD reached $95, again near its highest price for the year to date. The latest stock and crypto price moves continue to demonstrate the feedback loop that Strategy has created.

2025-07-14T13:23:05,"SUI Price Prediction: Break Above $4 Could Trigger 40% Rally","The post SUI Price Prediction: Break Above $4 Could Trigger 40% Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sui (SUI) is making waves again in the crypto space, jumping nearly 12% in a day and now inching closer to the $4 mark. This fresh surge follows a week-long rally that saw SUI climb almost 20%, breaking past a key resistance trendline. At press time, the token trades around $3.90, and market watchers are eyeing a clean breakout above $4, one that could send SUI soaring toward $5.36 , a level last seen in January. Why is SUI Price Up Today? A major reason behind SUI’s bullish run is the growing buzz around its ecosystem. The network’s Total Value Locked (TVL), which reflects the value of assets locked into Sui’s DeFi projects, hit a new record of $2.20 billion, according to DeFiLlama. This 8.74% jump in just 24 hours signals surging user activity and developer interest in the Sui blockchain. At the same time, CoinGlass data reveals that SUI’s Open Interest (OI) in the derivatives market has surged over 19%, reaching $1.73 billion. This sharp increase in OI means more traders are placing bets on SUI’s future moves, a sign of growing confidence. Adding to the bullish momentum, funding rates remain positive, and more short positions have been liquidated compared to long ones. The Money Flow Index (MFI) reading of 78 also reflects heavy capital inflow into SUI. $SUI REACHES $510 BILLION TOTAL TOKEN VOLUME pic.twitter.com/JhHRDxsH1x — Giannis Andreou (@gandreou007) July 12, 2025 As of July 10, 2025, the token has seen $510 billion worth of trades, proof that demand and liquidity are both strong. CoinGecko also shows SUI’s market cap jumped over 10% in the last week, a clear sign that more investors are jumping in. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : These Altcoins are Poised to Hit the Next ATH after Bitcoin? , SUI Price Prediction $SUI SUI is on the cusp of a breakout from its Macro Triangle It is one Weekly Close above the diagonal resistance away from kickstarting trend continuation to the upside SUI continues to be a leader in terms of metrics across Layer 1s, with its TVL is over $2B now #BTC #SUI https://t.co/KV1kYkpCiC pic.twitter.com/WtiuMi0cnz — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) July 11, 2025 Crypto analyst Rekt Capital says Sui is in a “coiling” phase, meaning the price is tightening and could soon break out. While $4 has been a tough level to cross in the past, strong support between $1.92 and $2.34 could give SUI the push it needs to move higher. However, technically, if SUI closes above the $4 mark, it indicates a move toward the 78.6% Fibonacci level at $4.20. Breaking past that, the token could target the previous high of $5.36. The 50-day EMA is also nearing a bullish crossover above the 100-day EMA , typically viewed as a strong buy signal. However, if SUI gets rejected near $4, it may retest support at $3.48. With rising DeFi engagement, bullish technicals, and growing trader interest, SUI’s momentum looks strong, setting the stage for a potential breakout just as broader market optimism rises. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-14T13:20:10,"Bitcoin Unleashes Historic All-Time High Amid Crucial Macroeconomic Shifts","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Unleashes Historic All-Time High Amid Crucial Macroeconomic Shifts The cryptocurrency world is abuzz! Bitcoin (BTC) has once again captivated global attention by smashing through its previous records, reaching an astounding all-time high . This isn’t just another fleeting moment of crypto euphoria; according to leading crypto analytics firm 10x Research, this monumental surge is deeply rooted in profound macroeconomic shifts rather than speculative hype. It’s a clear signal that the digital gold is evolving, solidifying its position as a serious contender in the global financial landscape. Understanding the Macroeconomic Undercurrents Driving Bitcoin’s Ascent What exactly are these macroeconomic forces that 10x Research points to? The firm highlights several critical factors currently shaping the global economy, all of which appear to be funneling capital into Bitcoin. This isn’t a mere coincidence; it’s a calculated response to systemic pressures. Massive Deficit Spending: Governments worldwide, particularly the U.S., have engaged in unprecedented levels of deficit spending to stimulate economies and combat various crises. While this can provide short-term relief, it often leads to concerns about currency debasement and inflation over the long term. As fiat currencies potentially lose purchasing power, investors seek alternative stores of value. Proposed $5 Trillion Debt Ceiling Hike: In the U.S., discussions around increasing the national debt ceiling by a staggering $5 trillion further amplify fears of fiscal instability. Such a move signals a continued reliance on borrowing, which can erode confidence in traditional financial systems and accelerate the search for non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin. Upcoming Crypto Policy Report from U.S. President Donald Trump’s Task Force: The anticipation of a significant crypto policy report from a high-level U.S. task force adds another layer of intrigue. A clearer, potentially more favorable regulatory framework could provide institutional investors with the confidence needed to allocate larger portions of their portfolios to digital assets, seeing them as legitimate and regulated investment vehicles. These factors collectively paint a picture of a global economy grappling with traditional financial vulnerabilities, pushing investors to reconsider their asset allocations. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and fixed supply, offers a compelling alternative. Bitcoin: Is it the Ultimate Macro Asset for Our Times? 10x Research emphatically states that Bitcoin is being redefined as a macro asset . This isn’t just a label; it signifies a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views BTC. Historically, Bitcoin was often dismissed as a niche, volatile digital currency. Now, it’s increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, and geopolitical instability – roles traditionally reserved for assets like gold. The $7 Trillion Opportunity: A Glimpse into the Future The firm specifically cites growing concerns over U.S. debt as a ‘$7 trillion opportunity’ for Bitcoin. This staggering figure suggests the potential scale of capital that could flow into BTC if even a fraction of traditional debt-hedging strategies shift towards digital assets. Imagine a world where large sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and institutional investors reallocate even a small percentage of their portfolios from traditional bonds or gold into Bitcoin to mitigate debt-related risks. The impact on Bitcoin’s market capitalization would be profound. Why Bitcoin as a Macro Asset? Decentralization: Unlike fiat currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by any single government or central bank, making it immune to political manipulation or inflationary policies. Scarcity: With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin’s supply is finite, making it deflationary by design – a stark contrast to the ever-expanding supply of fiat money. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin transcends national borders, offering a universally accessible store of value and medium of exchange, particularly appealing in an increasingly interconnected yet politically fragmented world. Behind the Surge: Unpacking Bitcoin’s All-Time High Momentum Beyond the overarching macroeconomic narrative, specific market dynamics have also played a crucial role in propelling Bitcoin to its current all-time high . 10x Research pinpoints several key triggers: Key Dates and Their Significance The firm highlighted two crucial dates that likely acted as catalysts: July 22: While the specific event on this date wasn’t detailed, such mentions often refer to significant market movements, news releases, or technical breakouts that trigger further buying interest. It could have been a key resistance level breach or a major institutional announcement that went under the radar for many. July 30 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Meeting: FOMC meetings are pivotal events for global markets. Decisions or statements regarding interest rates, quantitative easing, or economic outlook can send ripples across all asset classes. A dovish stance (indicating lower interest rates or continued monetary easing) would typically be bullish for risk assets like Bitcoin, as it makes traditional savings less attractive and encourages investment in higher-yield or alternative assets. Conversely, a hawkish stance (higher rates, tighter policy) could be bearish. The market’s interpretation of the July 30 meeting’s potential outcome likely fueled pre-emptive buying. Market Dynamics: The Fuel for the Rally The rally wasn’t just about big economic news; it was also about how market participants reacted: Favorable July Seasonality: Historical data often shows patterns in asset performance during certain months. A ‘favorable July seasonality’ suggests that Bitcoin has historically performed well in July, perhaps due to specific cyclical investor behavior or broader market trends. Traders often look to these seasonal trends for guidance. Increased Call Option Buying: Call options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset at a specified price (the strike price) by a certain date. A significant increase in call option buying signals that large investors are betting on Bitcoin’s price rising considerably in the near future. This creates upward pressure as market makers buy BTC to hedge their option exposures. Wave of Short Liquidations: Short selling involves borrowing an asset and selling it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price to profit from the difference. When the price unexpectedly rises sharply, short sellers are forced to buy back the asset to cover their positions and limit losses. This ‘short squeeze’ creates a cascade of buying pressure, further accelerating the price increase. Navigating the Future: What Does This Mean for Crypto Policy and Beyond? The redefinition of Bitcoin as a macro asset has profound implications, especially concerning future crypto policy . As its influence grows, regulators and policymakers will be compelled to take a more serious and nuanced approach to digital assets. The upcoming report from Trump’s task force is just one indicator of this evolving landscape. The Evolving Regulatory Landscape As Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional macro indicators strengthens, we can expect: Increased Scrutiny: Regulators will likely intensify efforts to understand and categorize digital assets, potentially leading to clearer guidelines for exchanges, custodians, and investors. Mainstream Integration: Clearer policies could pave the way for more traditional financial institutions to offer Bitcoin-related products and services, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and crypto. Global Coordination: Given Bitcoin’s borderless nature, international cooperation on crypto regulation may become more common, aiming to create a harmonized global framework. Actionable Insights for Investors For those looking at the market, these developments offer key insights: Diversification: Consider Bitcoin as a potential diversifier in a portfolio, especially if you’re concerned about inflation or sovereign debt. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and upcoming regulatory announcements, as these will increasingly dictate Bitcoin’s price action. Long-Term Perspective: While short-term volatility remains, the long-term narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal instability appears to be strengthening. The Resilient Rise of Bitcoin: A New Era The latest surge of Bitcoin to an all-time high is far more than just a price milestone; it’s a powerful testament to its growing resilience and evolving role in the global financial ecosystem. Driven by significant macroeconomic shifts , including massive deficit spending and concerns over national debt, Bitcoin is firmly establishing itself as a crucial macro asset . The insights from 10x Research underscore that this isn’t a speculative bubble, but a fundamental re-evaluation of its value in an increasingly uncertain economic climate. As discussions around crypto policy continue to unfold, Bitcoin’s trajectory appears increasingly intertwined with the future of global finance.

The company’s last major buy was June 30th, when it added 4980 $BTC to its holdings. That acquisition brought its total to an astonishing 597,325 $BTC. The strategic buying spree is funded by debt and equity, a smart tactic that’s helping Strategy stay on top as one of the biggest corporate Bitcoin holders. Institutional Demand Outpacing Mined Supply Right on cue, Metaplanet, an up-and-coming star in the Bitcoin treasury game, announced its own significant purchase. The Japanese investment firm snagged an additional 797 $BTC for around $93.6M, pushing its total holdings to 16,352 $BTC. Metaplanet CEO, Simon Gerovich, confirmed the buy, sticking to his ‘another week, another tranche’ motto. This latest move cements its spot as the fifth-largest publicly traded corporate Bitcoin holder. The continued accumulation by the institutional behemoths signals a shift in the market. Adam Livingston clearly explained, on X, that demands are beginning to outstrip the supply from miners. This dynamic has some analysts talking about a potential supply shock, though others are wary of the long-term risks of debt-fueled corporate buying. As more and more interest pours in, the big companies are increasingly calling the shots in the market and shaping Bitcoin’s future. The future of Bitcoin is an important thing to consider, not only from a financial point of view, but also when considering how retail players can invest in the OG crypto’s success. More and more people are turning to the best meme coins like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) that aim to help the growth of $BTC by addressiny its limitations. The Next Evolution of Bitcoin is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) While corporate giants are busy staking BTC, a new project is making waves by directly addressing Bitcoin’s core limitations. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a game-changing Layer 2 solution built to bring speed, low fees, and smart contracts to the world’s most secure network. Bitcoin’s been a store of value for a long time, but the slow transactions and high fees have stalled it from becoming a functional digital currency for everyday use. $HYPER aims to change that by building a fast and scalable network on top of Bitcoin’s secure foundation. Unlock New Opportunities with $HYPER Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) new approach uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to create a lightning-fast ecosystem where users can carry out transactions in a new Bitcoin-based environment without the usual latency and costs. This L2 network is designed to support dApps, DeFi, and more, opening up a whole new world of possibilities for Bitcoin holders. By using a canonical bridge, you can securely move your $BTC to the Hyper network, unlocking its potential beyond storage. If you feel priced out of $BTC’s current market highs, $HYPER offers a lower-cost entry point with huge growth potential, proving itself one of the best crypto presales . The presale has already raised over $2.4M, showing strong investor confidence in its vision to make Bitcoin more accessible and usable for everyone. And with current staking rewards of 315% you’ve got even more reasons to want in on the project. You can buy $HYPER now for $0.01225 and with a predicted high of $0.32 , that could see you with a potential return of 2512.24% The Institutional Bull Run Paves the Way for a New Retail Era The surge in corporate $BTC buying from players like Strategy and Metaplanet is creating a supply squeeze. While this could drive prices up, it also shines a light on Bitcoin’s scalability problems. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes in as the solution, making $BTC more accessible for everyone.The future of $BTC is being shaped by both institutional giants and innovative tech that brings together the world’s most secure network to the masses. Remember, crypto is volatile, and there are no guarantees of success even in projects linked to the big players like Bitcoin. Only invest what you can afford to lose.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/saylor-bitcoin-signal-metaplanet-797btc-bitcoin-hyper-timing/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL","Crypto News",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T13:16:48,"BTC News: Bitcoin Solaris Presale Attracts 13,900+ Investors Seeking Early Bitcoin-Like Returns","It’s the classic crypto dilemma. By the time everyone’s talking about it, it’s already too late. Bitcoin proved that to the world. Ethereum followed. And now, with the next cycle heating up, investors are scanning the horizon for a new name that could echo those early Bitcoin days. Right now, that name is Bitcoin Solaris. As Bitcoin Solaris crosses 13,900+ unique presale participants, it’s becoming clear this is not another fleeting hype coin. This is a calculated opportunity, drawing serious attention from early-stage seekers who remember what it felt like to get in before the world noticed. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is the Talk of the Town The reason behind the buzz is simple: Bitcoin Solaris is taking a ground-up approach to wealth creation. The project introduces a fresh layer of crypto functionality that meets real accessibility needs, especially with its focus on mobile-based mining. Through the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app, BTC-S plans to let anyone earn from their phone. No GPUs. No high fees. Just plug in and start contributing. The app is only one piece of the bigger puzzle. Bitcoin Solaris also boasts an advanced dual-consensus framework combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This hybrid model gives users both security and speed, with performance benchmarks hitting over 10,000 TPS and 2-second finality. The tech isn’t just hype, it’s audited, verified, and battle-ready. What the Influencers Are Saying Crypto content creators aren’t ignoring this. In fact, they’re diving in headfirst: Crypto Vlog highlights how Bitcoin Solaris could become the first mass-adopted, mobile-first mining platform in history. Crypto Show dives into how the project is already ahead of its roadmap and gaining traction among developers. Token Empire breaks down why the combination of smart contracts, speed, and mobile accessibility makes BTC-S the standout project of the year. These aren’t paid shills pushing a promo. These are detailed breakdowns by analysts who understand how rare it is to see a project deliver on this level, before launch. A Presale That’s Not Slowing Down The BTC-S presale is now in Phase 11, with the current price locked at $11. It’s holding firm until the next phase kicks in, and the token launches at $20, offering a projected return of 150%. More than 14,150+ users have joined, with over $6.6M raised, making it one of the shortest and most explosive presales in this cycle. But now comes a twist: Bitcoin Solaris has announced a Price Rollback. For a limited window, the price drops to $5 instead of $11. This is not a bonus. It’s not a discount. It’s a rare moment of intentional value redistribution aimed at letting more users in before the final rush. To receive tokens on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended. They’re not required for participation, but they offer seamless delivery once the token goes live. Not Just Scalable Designed to Be Unstoppable That’s BTC-S Tech Specs That Are More Than Just Specs Under the hood, Bitcoin Solaris delivers some serious power: A dual-layer blockchain that separates finality and scalability Validator rotation for network security and long-term decentralization Smart contract support using scalable execution environments An energy efficiency model that consumes 99.95% less energy than legacy mining Full audit verification by Cyberscope and Freshcoins You can also test the mining returns via the Bitcoin Solaris mining calculator to see how profitable your phone might become in this new ecosystem. A Roadmap with Big Vision Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just launching tech, it’s executing a carefully structured, multi-phase roadmap built for long-term growth. Each stage is aligned with real milestones that scale the ecosystem from core infrastructure to global adoption. Foundation & Launch (2025): Started with the Token Generation Event and presale in April, focusing on team expansion, whitepaper finalization, and smart contract development. Core Development (Early 2026): Includes wallet deployment, testnet rollout, Solana bridge integration, and dual-layer blockchain optimization. Mainnet & App Launch (Mid–Late 2026): Full mainnet goes live alongside the exciting release of the Solaris Nova app and a fully implemented governance model. Ecosystem Expansion (2027): Introduces hardware wallet integration, a Mining Power Marketplace, a native DEX, and advanced scaling features. Global Adoption (2028+): Focus shifts to blockchain education, government partnerships, and global validator decentralization. View the complete Bitcoin Solaris roadmap here Final Word Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just attracting early adopters, it’s creating them. With mobile mining, a dual-consensus framework, verified audits, and a limited-time rollback price of $5, BTC-S stands out as a project not just with hype, but with infrastructure. Whether you’re a new investor or someone who missed Bitcoin the first time around, this may be your shot to be early, truly early.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, Robinhood’s U.S. staking launch continues to push olana. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $167.36 with an intraday gain of 3%.

We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. With the $166.56 resistance now tested, SOL could trend higher if momentum holds. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

The asset manager didn't disclose details of the submission and said the registration is expected to take place after the SEC completes its review process, subject to market and other conditions, according to a press release . Confidential filings allow firms to negotiate with the SEC behind closed doors before revealing their plans. It’s a common tactic for gauging regulatory feedback while keeping competitive details out of public view until a launch is ready.

2025-07-14T13:13:40,"Is This The ‘Last Dance?’ Bitcoin (BTC) Smashes Another ATH, Euphoria Looms","As July’s third week opens, Bitcoin has set a fresh all-time high, touching $123,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has recorded an impressive gain of approximately 13% in the past week alone. This market activity, along with a significant inflow of capital into spot Bitcoin ETFs, has sparked discussions about the possible onset of a market euphoria phase. However, on-chain indicators suggest a more layered picture. “Prawns” Stay Out as Bitcoin Hits $123K Despite the recent price surge, CryptoQuant’s proprietary “Greed Indicator” remains at mid-levels, which indicates that broader retail participation has yet to materialize fully. The rHODL ratio, which is a gauge of long-term holder behavior and wealth distribution across investor groups, currently sits at 32%. This points to continued caution among retail participants, often referred to as “prawns.” Historically, genuine market euphoria phases have aligned with significant retail inflows, a condition that CryptoQuant believes is not yet clearly evident in the current cycle. Instead, the recent price momentum appears driven predominantly by institutional flows, while retail seems to have been sidelined as the rally extends. It is important to note that previous euphoric phases in the crypto market consistently followed mass retail entry after initial institutional-led rallies, which then led to parabolic price action. However, there are early signs of change, with the rHODL ratio beginning to rise in recent days. This uptick could signal the emergence of a retail-driven phase, which, in turn, could potentially set the stage for what some market observers refer to as “the last dance.” For now, the market appears positioned at the edge of euphoria rather than in its full grip. Bitcoin Rally Faces No Panic Selling Bitcoin’s surge to a peak has not triggered widespread panic selling, according to Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) data. While SOPR briefly spiked around July 3-4, which indicated some profit-taking activity, it has remained consistently above 1 without sharp declines. It essentially means that while short-term holders are taking profits, the broader market is not rushing to exit positions. The fact that profit-taking remains controlled signals a constructive environment for price discovery. This condition favors the ongoing bullish trend in the market.

2025-07-14T13:10:07,"Ethereum Unchained: Why Bitwise CEO Sees True Competition in Traditional Finance","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Unchained: Why Bitwise CEO Sees True Competition in Traditional Finance Forget everything you thought you knew about the competitive landscape of the crypto world. For years, the narrative often pitted Bitcoin (BTC) against Ethereum (ETH) as rivals vying for the top spot. However, a recent and compelling statement from Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley is challenging this long-held perception, suggesting a profound shift in how we should view the roles and future of these digital giants. Horsley argues that Ethereum competition isn’t with Bitcoin at all, but rather with established Web2 platforms and the behemoth that is traditional finance. Is Ethereum Really Not Competing with Bitcoin? Understanding Their Distinct Roles Hunter Horsley’s assertion on X cuts straight to the core of a critical misunderstanding in the crypto space. For many, Bitcoin and Ethereum exist on the same competitive playing field, often compared solely by their market capitalization or price movements. However, this view overlooks their fundamental differences and distinct value propositions. Bitcoin, often hailed as ‘digital gold,’ was designed primarily as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value and a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. Its core strength lies in its simplicity, security, and predictable scarcity. It’s a foundational layer, a robust asset for wealth preservation in the digital age. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a programmable blockchain. It’s a decentralized computing platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Think of Bitcoin as a digital commodity or currency, while Ethereum is more akin to a global, open-source operating system or a decentralized internet. This fundamental difference means their primary objectives and, consequently, their competitive arenas are vastly different. As Horsley points out, judging them solely by market cap is an outdated approach from the ‘CoinMarketCap era.’ The true Bitcoin Ethereum distinction lies in their architectural design and intended use cases. The Colossus Clash: Ethereum vs. Traditional Finance Integration and Web2 If Ethereum isn’t competing with Bitcoin, then who is its true rival? According to Horsley, it’s the vast landscape of Web2 services and the entrenched traditional financial system. This perspective opens up a much larger and more impactful competitive front for Ethereum. Challenging Traditional Finance (TradFi) Ethereum’s robust smart contract capabilities allow for the creation of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to replicate and improve upon traditional financial services without intermediaries. Consider these parallels: Lending and Borrowing: Platforms like Aave and Compound offer decentralized lending and borrowing, often with greater transparency and accessibility than traditional banks. Exchanges: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and SushiSwap facilitate peer-to-peer trading of assets, bypassing centralized stock exchanges or brokerage firms. Asset Tokenization: Ethereum enables the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) – from real estate to art – making them more liquid, divisible, and accessible to a global investor base. This directly challenges traditional asset management and ownership structures. Payments and Settlements: While still evolving, Ethereum-based solutions offer faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border payments compared to traditional banking rails. The benefits of Ethereum’s approach to finance include increased transparency, reduced fees, censorship resistance, and greater financial inclusion. However, challenges remain, including regulatory uncertainty, scalability concerns (though addressed by Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions), and user experience complexities. Competing with Web2 Platforms Beyond finance, Ethereum’s ecosystem extends into areas traditionally dominated by Web2 giants: Social Media: Decentralized social platforms built on Ethereum aim to give users more control over their data and content, contrasting with centralized platforms like Facebook or X. Gaming: Blockchain-based games leveraging NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) for in-game assets provide true digital ownership, a paradigm shift from traditional gaming models. Digital Identity: Solutions for self-sovereign identity on Ethereum empower individuals to control their digital footprint, moving away from reliance on centralized identity providers. Content Creation and Monetization: Platforms using NFTs allow artists and creators to directly monetize their work and connect with fans, bypassing traditional intermediaries like record labels or streaming services. Ethereum’s open, permissionless nature fosters innovation and community ownership, presenting a formidable alternative to the centralized, data-driven models of Web2. This fundamental shift underscores why traditional finance integration and Web2 disruption are Ethereum’s true battlegrounds. Decoding the Bitcoin Ethereum Distinction in a New Era To truly appreciate Hunter Horsley’s perspective, it’s vital to solidify our understanding of the inherent differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum. They are not merely different cryptocurrencies; they are different categories of innovation. Let’s look at a quick comparison: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Purpose Decentralized digital currency, store of value (digital gold) Decentralized computing platform, world computer, programmable blockchain Key Innovation Proof-of-Work, scarce digital asset Smart contracts, dApps, NFTs, DeFi Network Design Simple, focused blockchain for transactions Complex, versatile blockchain supporting various applications Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) since The Merge Transactions Per Second (TPS) Lower (around 7 TPS) Higher (15-30 TPS on Layer 1, thousands on Layer 2) Inflation/Supply Fixed supply (21 million BTC) Dynamic supply, often deflationary post-Merge due to EIP-1559 burning mechanism Competitive Arena Fiat currencies, gold, traditional stores of value Web2 services, traditional financial services, cloud computing This table clearly illustrates that while both are foundational blockchain technologies, their architectural choices and design philosophies lead them to solve fundamentally different problems and, therefore, compete in different markets. Understanding this Bitcoin Ethereum distinction is crucial for informed participation in the crypto space. Beyond Market Cap: Bitwise CEO Insights on a Maturing Market Horsley’s reference to moving beyond the ‘CoinMarketCap era’ is perhaps one of the most profound Bitwise CEO insights . For a long time, the crypto industry, especially to newcomers, was primarily defined by the rankings on sites like CoinMarketCap. Assets were judged almost exclusively by their market capitalization, leading to a simplistic and often misleading view of their actual utility or long-term potential. In the ‘CoinMarketCap era,’ a higher market cap often equated to perceived superiority, regardless of the underlying technology, use case, or adoption. This encouraged speculative trading based on price rather than fundamental analysis of a project’s value proposition. However, as the industry matures, this narrow perspective is becoming obsolete. Horsley expects that over the next six to twelve months, there will be a much greater recognition of the distinct use cases and unique value propositions of different blockchain projects. This shift signifies a maturation of the market, where investors and developers are increasingly looking beyond mere price action to the utility and real-world impact of a project. It means understanding that: Not all digital assets are designed to be currencies. Not all blockchains are trying to be the ‘next Bitcoin.’ The value of a project is increasingly tied to its ecosystem, developer activity, user adoption, and problem-solving capabilities, not just its circulating supply multiplied by its price. This insight from a prominent figure like the Bitwise CEO signals a healthy evolution, pushing the industry towards more sophisticated analysis and investment strategies. Shaping Future Crypto Market Trends: What’s Next? What are the implications of this evolving understanding for the broader market? Horsley’s comments suggest several significant crypto market trends we can expect to see unfold: 1. Increased Specialization and Niche Focus As the market matures, we will likely see projects and blockchains specialize further. Instead of general-purpose chains trying to do everything, there will be more focus on solving specific problems within particular industries (e.g., supply chain, gaming, identity, data storage). This specialization will foster deeper innovation and more effective solutions. 2. Greater Institutional Adoption Driven by Utility Institutional investors are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin as a simple store of value. They are exploring Ethereum and other smart contract platforms for their potential to revolutionize financial services, supply chains, and other industries. The focus will shift from speculative asset plays to investments in foundational technology that can generate real-world utility and revenue. 3. Regulatory Clarity and Frameworks As the distinct use cases become clearer, regulators will be better equipped to develop appropriate frameworks. This could lead to more tailored regulations for different types of digital assets and blockchain applications, fostering greater legal certainty and enabling further growth and adoption. 4. Enhanced Interoperability With different blockchains specializing, the need for seamless communication and asset transfer between them will grow. Solutions for interoperability (like cross-chain bridges and layer-zero protocols) will become increasingly vital, enabling a more interconnected and efficient crypto ecosystem. 5. Focus on Real-World Impact and User Experience The industry will increasingly pivot towards delivering tangible benefits to everyday users and businesses. This means prioritizing user-friendly interfaces, robust security, and applications that solve real-world problems, moving beyond the technical complexities often associated with blockchain. Actionable Insights for You: Educate Yourself: Go beyond market cap. Research the core technology, whitepapers, developer activity, and actual use cases of projects you’re interested in. Diversify Strategically: Consider diversifying your portfolio not just by asset type (BTC vs. ETH) but by their distinct functionalities and the problems they aim to solve. Look for Utility: Invest in projects that demonstrate clear utility, a strong ecosystem, and a viable path to real-world adoption, especially those challenging traditional finance or Web2. Stay Informed: Follow insights from industry leaders like Hunter Horsley, who offer valuable perspectives on the evolving landscape. The Future is Specialized, Not Singular Hunter Horsley’s perspective marks a crucial turning point in the cryptocurrency narrative. By clearly delineating Ethereum’s true competitive arena – the vast and established realms of traditional finance and Web2 – he underscores the growing maturity and specialization within the blockchain industry. This isn’t a zero-sum game between Bitcoin and Ethereum; instead, it’s an expansive ecosystem where different innovations serve different purposes, each carving out its unique niche. As we move further into this new era, the focus will increasingly shift from simplistic market cap comparisons to a deeper understanding of utility, technology, and real-world impact. This nuanced view promises a more robust, resilient, and ultimately transformative future for the entire crypto space, where innovation flourishes across diverse fronts, challenging established paradigms and building a decentralized future.

2025-07-14T13:08:45,"Bitcoin Surpasses Canada’s GDP and Amazon’s Market Capitalization","Bitcoin's market capitalization reached $2.4 trillion. This figure exceeded the GDP of countries like Canada ($2.2 trillion) and Brazil ($2.1 trillion). The total value of the entire crypto market is estimated at $3.8 trillion, which is comparable to the GDP of the UK. According to StatisticsTimes, this rise allowed Bitcoin to surpass tech giant Amazon ($2.3 trillion) and silver ($2.2 trillion) in terms of capitalization. The event sparked a reaction in the financial community. Gold supporter Peter Schiff, on his X account, urged investors to seize the moment: ”With Bitcoin hitting new highs today (in dollars), it's a great time to sell some and buy silver ahead of silver's next big leg up. Even if Bitcoin keeps rising for a while, silver should rise much more. And while Bitcoin can easily crash, silver's downside seems very limited.” Among the world's billionaires, Bitcoin's capitalization surpasses the combined net worth of Elon Musk ($404 billion), Larry Ellison ($274 billion), and Mark Zuckerberg ($247 billion), according to Forbes. The largest holder of Bitcoin remains its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, with 1.096 million BTC worth $134.3 billion, making him one of the richest people on the planet, according to data from Arkham. Bitcoin is gradually becoming a global asset on par with gold and the stocks of tech giants. To surpass gold in terms of capitalization ($22 trillion), Bitcoin must exceed $1 million per coin. Since the beginning of 2025, gold and Bitcoin have become the most profitable assets. Their returns amounted to 28% and 26%, respectively. Previously, gold and Bitcoin have never occupied the top two spots in the profitability ranking within a single calendar year.

2025-07-14T13:00:10,"Bitcoin Ignites Intraday Optimism With A Step Past $119,000 Threshold","Shaco AI, in a fresh update, highlighted that Bitcoin is showing off its moves, dancing upwards past both the 25-hour ($119,088.50) and 50-hour ($118,338.56) Simple Moving Averages. With such momentum, it’s clear BTC has decided it’s not a bear season yet. Momentum And Indicators Shaco AI’s analysis on Bitcoin dives deep into the technical indicators, and there’s no shortage of bullish energy in the air. First off, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently riding high at 86.02. That’s well into overbought territory, and as Shaco colorfully put it, “it might need to hydrate soon.” Such elevated RSI levels often signal a potential cooldown on the horizon, but for now, momentum is favoring the bulls. Related Reading: Bitcoin 30-Day Average Funding Rate Drops – Bullish Setup Takes Shape Adding fuel to the trend is the Average Directional Index (ADX), which sits at a robust 44 points. According to Shaco AI, this reading confirms that the current uptrend is strong and well-supported. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator is also reinforcing this bullish narrative, with a reading of 967.98. Shaco described it as “screaming positive vibes,” a signal that buying pressure continues to dominate. A rising MACD in conjunction with a strong ADX often paints a picture of confident market participants driving the trend with conviction. One of the most telling signs is volume. Shaco pointed out that Bitcoin’s trading volume has surged to 2704.5, a significant leap above its average of 856.81. He described this as “some serious weight lifting in buying interest,” underscoring that this isn’t a weak or speculative move — traders are putting real capital behind the rally. Support And Resistance: Bitcoin Make-Or-Break Levels The analyst went further to highlight key levels traders should closely monitor. He noted, “Key Levels Alert: Keep an eye on the resistance at $122,666.0 and support sitting firm at $116,900.05. It feels like Bitcoin is playing ‘The Floor is Lava’ with support levels!” This colorful analogy points to the importance of holding key support to maintain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Consolidation Continues: 2 Key Support Levels To Watch According to Shaco AI, if Bitcoin can sustain a move above the current resistance zone, traders might want to watch for a potential breakout. However, with the RSI already deep in overbought territory, there’s also the possibility that BTC may “peak too soon,” leading to a pullback or brief consolidation phase. He wrapped up the post with a reminder that while momentum is clearly favoring the bulls, it’s essential to stay cautious. “Always make well-informed decisions and manage your risk carefully,” the analyst advised, reinforcing the importance of strategic planning in a volatile market.

2025-07-14T12:58:32,"Countdown Begins:ProShares Set to Launch XRP Futures ETF on July 18","This move signals a historic shift for both XRP and the broader crypto-financial landscape, unlocking new avenues for mainstream adoption and capital inflow. Catalyst for Broader XRP Adoption Futures-based access enables big capital to flow into XRP through regulated asset structures. This new liquidity could significantly narrow bid-ask spreads, deepen the order book, and raise market confidence. ProShares already has a history of successfully launching crypto futures ETFs, with BTC and ETH futures products preceding this move. Futures ETFs also eliminate concerns over custody of XRP itself, allowing crypto exposure in a legally recognized form. This regulatory workaround is key to unlocking institutional interest without violating U.S. securities policy. Interestingly, the ETF’s launch coincides with record levels of whale accumulation. This is because whale wallets holding over 1 million XRP recently reached an all-time high of 2,708, underscoring growing investor confidence in the token’s long-term price potential. Therefore, rising institutional interest sets the stage for eventual spot XRP ETFs , especially as other asset managers like Voltatility Shares, Tuttle Capital, and Franklin Templeton await SEC rulings. A successful ProShares XRP futures launch could pave the way for spot-based products, with CME Group already laying the groundwork since its XRP futures topped $542 million in volume within the first month, signaling strong market demand. Why XRP Is Geared Toward the Psychological Price of $3 According to market analyst EtherGuru, “If bulls maintain pressure, continuation toward $3.05-$3.20 is in play.” At the time of this writing, XRP was up by 7.1% to trade at $2.98, showing that the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency is just shy of $3. Technical Breakout Signals XRP surged from $2.77 to $2.93 within 24 hours, smashing the $2.84 resistance level with strong institutional volume and a peak hourly spike of $176 million. Analysts had forecasted exactly this outcome: a breakout above the $2.25–$2.30 range clearing the path toward the $2.50–$2.71 Fibonacci magnet and eventual test of prior highs near $3.00. Technical patterns also align. CasiTrades model suggests potential resistance near $3.04 once XRP retests and holds above $2.25–$2.30. A falling-wedge breakout seen in early July further underpins the rise, with measured targets up to $3.80, making $3 both reasonable and conservative. On‑Chain & Sentiment Strength On‑chain metrics reflect rising retail conviction. Short‑term holder accumulation is significan with retail demand skyrocketing, as evidenced by South Korea’s Upbit exchange recording daily trading volume of more than $95 million. Another catalyst is the fact that the U.S. has formally included XRP in its strategic crypto reserve as of March 2025 alongside Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, and Cardano, ushering in greater legitimacy and potential demand Meanwhile, sentiment tools display strong bullishness. Polymarket odds suggest an 88 % probability of spot ETF approval by December 2025, and triangle breakout tools project multi-year targets around $6, but first clearing $3 is essential. Why $3? The $3 level matters psychologically and technically because it's the next round number beyond recent consolidation and represents a benchmark of momentum shift. With institutional validation, technical confirmation, and retail enthusiasm all aligning, crossing $3 appears not just possible but probable in the short to mid-term. Conclusion Launching on July 18, 2025, ProShares’ XRP futures ETF transforms XRP’s accessibility, opening institutional doors and legitimizing the token in regulated finance. With smart money accumulating and technical breakout momentum already in motion, this milestone may well mark the beginning of a new bull phase above the psychological price of $3.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9924/countdown-begins-pro-shares-set-to-launch-xrp-futures-etf-on-july-18,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE","News|Ripple",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T12:55:07,"Bitcoin Positioned as Shield Against US Fiscal Crisis, Analyst Says","Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally to $122,000 on Monday is being fueled by deep macroeconomic shifts rather than hype, according to 10x head of research Markus Thielen. In a note shared this week, Thielen stated that Bitcoin has evolved from a tech narrative into a macroeconomic asset, serving as a hedge against growing US fiscal crisis. “The narrative has completely shifted: no one is talking about blockchain use cases or Bitcoin’s technological promise anymore,” Thielen explained. “Bitcoin has become a macro asset, a hedge against unchecked deficit spending.” He argued that with the US continuing its deficit spending trajectory and an environment of potentially lower interest rates, Bitcoin is emerging as the “ultimate beneficiary” of this unraveling fiscal backdrop. US Fiscal Crisis Fuels Bitcoin’s Safe-Haven Status The analysis follows the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) in July, which raised the US debt ceiling by $5 trillion, marking the largest single increase in the nation’s history. While the bill initially aimed to cut deficits by $2 trillion, projections now indicate it could instead add between $2.3 trillion and $5 trillion to federal deficits over the next decade. Thielen highlighted this as a potential $7 trillion swing from initial expectations. “This isn’t just another crypto rally; it’s a direct response to a US fiscal landscape unraveling far quicker than expected,” Thielen said, adding that Bitcoin, alongside gold, is now viewed as a primary defense against a looming fiscal crisis in the United States. The macro environment, characterized by persistent deficit spending and a potential pivot to accommodative monetary policy, has transformed Bitcoin into a preferred safe-haven asset for investors seeking protection from dollar debasement and rising sovereign debt risks. Key Legislative Events and Market Catalysts Ahead Thielen also identified several catalysts that could continue to drive Bitcoin’s momentum in the coming weeks. Washington, D.C., is set to host “Crypto Week,” during which lawmakers will debate and potentially vote on significant crypto-related legislation. This includes the CLARITY Act for crypto regulatory oversight, the GENIUS Act for a stablecoin framework , and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Additionally, Trump’s Digital Asset Task Force is expected to release a crypto policy report on July 22, which may include a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve proposal. Investors are also closely monitoring the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on July 30, where rate cuts are anticipated, although CME futures currently indicate a 93% probability of rates remaining unchanged. With macroeconomic pressures mounting and legislative decisions approaching, Bitcoin’s role as a financial hedge may continue to expand, supporting its position alongside gold as a strategic asset in a shifting global economy.

2025-07-14T12:50:07,"Peter Schiff Claims Bitcoin’s 21M Supply is ‘Meaningless’ – Says Satoshi Count is What Matters","Peter Schiff, Chief Economist at Euro Pacific Capital and a persistent Bitcoin skeptic, has claimed that Bitcoin’s 21 million supply cap, frequently cited as evidence of the asset’s scarcity, is a “ meaningless ” metric. The economist contended that if Bitcoin’s total supply were 21 billion instead of 21 million, with each BTC redenominated as 100,000 satoshis rather than 100 million, it would eliminate the perception of scarcity surrounding the digital asset. That's my point exactly. Bitcoin's scarcity is about perception, not reality. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 12, 2025 Peter Schiff’s Shocking Bitcoin ‘Meaningless’ Supply Theory Exposed A Bitcoin advocate acknowledged Schiff’s point, agreeing that Bitcoin’s perceived scarcity is largely psychological. The supporter drew an analogy to Ferrari’s limited production, noting that while only approximately 250,000 Ferraris have ever been manufactured, scarcity alone does not determine value. Crypto investor Jeff Day countered this comparison, pointing out that Ferraris cannot function as currency and lack divisibility; you cannot own a fraction of a Ferrari. Yes but Ferraris can't be used as money. Also, they are not divisible. In other words you can own a part of a Ferrari. Even at 115k Bitcoin can be bought by people with 100 dollars or even less. You can't do that with Ferraris. — Jeff Day (@dayjeff) July 13, 2025 In contrast, even at Bitcoin’s current $120,000 price point, individuals with $100 or less can purchase portions of the cryptocurrency, unlike with luxury vehicles. When a crypto investor highlighted the irony of Schiff’s criticism given Bitcoin’s surge while gold, his preferred asset class, remains stagnant, Schiff responded that gold has merely taken a “temporary pause.” He claimed silver is outperforming Bitcoin. You always need an asset to back your story, don’t you Peter? First it was gold, then silver… soon it’ll be copper if it suits the narrative. Just admit Bitcoin keeps ruining your day — Mr. Crypto Degen (@subwayzarry1) July 12, 2025 Schiff’s Gold and Silver Bet Backfires As Bitcoin Crushes Record $123,000 On July 10, Schiff advised investors to sell portions of their Bitcoin holdings and purchase silver instead. He argued that even if Bitcoin continues rising temporarily, silver should appreciate significantly more, and while Bitcoin faces potential crashes, silver’s downside appears limited. Despite Bitcoin's new high today, had you followed the advice to sell Bitcoin and buy silver in yesterday's post, you would be better off. Plus, you would have taken on a lot less risk. https://t.co/6fhKHXOAru — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 11, 2025 However, Bitcoin ultimately outperformed silver during the measured period. While silver gained over 3.98% in the past seven days, reaching $39.04 per ounce, its highest level since September 2011, Bitcoin increased 12.2% over the same timeframe. This follows Schiff’s April prediction during the Iran-Israel conflict tensions , when he reignited debates about Bitcoin’s future by asserting that “the financial crisis of 2025 will kill” the cryptocurrency. This pessimistic forecast came just one month after he projected Bitcoin would fall to $65,000 . As with previous predictions, the cryptocurrency, originally created in response to the 2008 global financial crisis when major financial institutions collapsed due to risky lending practices and the housing market crash, has continued defying skeptics. Since April’s low of $74,508, Bitcoin has gained over 60% , outperforming gold, silver, the S&P 500, and every major asset class globally, rendering Schiff’s predictions inaccurate once again. BREAKING: Bitcoin surges to a record $123,000, now up +66% since the April 2025 low.

In 2014, legendary investor Warren Buffett rejected Bitcoin at $600 ; it has since gained 19,400%. Similarly, Berkshire Hathaway’s late Vice Chairman Charlie Munger famously called Bitcoin “rat poison,” among other criticisms.

However, former Binance CEO and Bitcoin advocate Changpeng Zhao has stated that even the most successful investors are not always correct about everything. He encouraged people to purchase Bitcoin , suggesting that in several years, current prices will represent only a small fraction of its eventual value.

NBA Legend Shares a Mysterious Bitcoin Message appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto world has seen strange things before, but NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen may have just added another twist. Pippen claims that Satoshi visited him in a dream again, this time delivering a strange but powerful message about Bitcoin’s next move. Here’s what he says! Satoshi Sends a Message In his latest post, Pippen said he had a dream where Satoshi visited him and shared a strange message about Bitcoin. In the dream, Satoshi showed up with an afro and looked like a member of the Jackson 5. While singing, “BTC, easy as 1-2-3,” he gave Pippen a cryptic hint about Bitcoin’s future. Pippen compared it to how sports stars take a quick water break before pushing to the next level. He believes Satoshi’s message means Bitcoin might rest for a bit before making an even bigger move up. Just woke up from another wild Satoshi Nakamoto dream. This time he had an afro, dressed like the Jackson 5, singing ‘BTC, easy as 1-2-3.’ When Satoshi sings, I listen… but even legends take water breaks before hitting that next level. — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 14, 2025 Interestingly, Pippen’s dream messages about Satoshi aren’t new. In past tweets, he has mentioned receiving advice from Satoshi in dreams, often around major market moments. Pippen’s Watchlist: Not Just Bitcoin Pippen isn’t just watching Bitcoin. He’s also keeping an eye on other popular cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Dogecoin (DOGE). His tweets show that he’s interested in the whole crypto market, not just one coin. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin at $122K Makes Satoshi Nakamoto 11th Richest Person on Earth , Satoshi’s Bitcoin Fortune Nears Buffett’s Wealth Bitcoin’s latest rally has pushed its secret creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, into the spotlight again. Even though no one knows who Satoshi is, their Bitcoin stash now makes them one of the richest people in the world. As Bitcoin jumped above $122,000 on Monday, Satoshi’s estimated 1.1 million Bitcoins are now worth about $134 billion. That’s almost as much as Warren Buffett’s net worth of $143.9 billion . This huge pile of early-mined coins has quietly become one of the biggest fortunes on the planet. CZ Reminds Everyone: This Is Just the Beginning It’s not just celebrities talking about Bitcoin’s rise. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, shared his thoughts , too. He remembered when Bitcoin first hit $1,000 and how exciting it was. Now, with prices above $121 ,7 30 , CZ believes today’s record will seem small in the future. He also pointed out how Binance Coin (BNB) has grown by over 10,000% since it started, showing just how fast the crypto world can change. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-14T12:45:29,"Investor Tom Lee Reveals Ethereum Price Target Amid ‘ChatGPT Moment’ of Stablecoins","Fundstrat’s Tom Lee believes that Ethereum ( ETH ) could soar to a five-figure price as the rise of stablecoins brings new relevance to the world’s leading smart contract platform. In a new interview with Dierdre Bosa, Lee says that technical analysts at Fundstrat are currently targeting near $5,000 for Ethereum in the next several months. However, over the longer term, Lee says that ETH could be trading above $10,000 if it reaches similar valuations to Circle, the second-largest stablecoin issuer, which largely relies upon the Ethereum network to power its products. “Mark Newton, who is head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, has some views on Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the near term, he thinks both have 20% upside from here, so that would be putting Ethereum closer to $3,300. And he thinks something around $4,500 or $5,000 in the next few months is achievable. That’s a pretty big move for Ethereum, but I think the perspective that someone could have is to realize that Circle trades at around 100 times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization), which I think is fair because its scarce and it is one of the best IPOs (initial public offerings) really in several years. But if you applied that metric to the layer-1 Ethereum, it would imply a value per ETH token north of $10,000. So I think it shows you that if the stablecoin is being valued in the market at a hundred times, that the underlying layer-1, which is really what’s securing those transactions, probably is undervalued.” Tom Lee also believes that Ethereum is benefiting from the “ChatGPT moment” of stablecoins, as adoption for dollar-pegged crypto assets hit fever-pitch. “Stablecoins have really exploded because consumers, businesses and banks are really interested in adopting this. The majority of stablecoins are actually transacted on the Ethereum blockchain. And if Treasury Secretary [Scott] Bessent is right, and it goes from a $250 billion market to $2 trillion, that’s exponential demand for Ethereum.” At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,024.

The move reaffirms the company’s long-standing conviction in Bitcoin as a strategic treasury reserve asset. With this purchase, Strategy’s Bitcoin-related yield year-to-date has surged to 20.2%, underscoring the performance edge the company has enjoyed in 2025’s bullish digital asset environment. Funding Strategy: Preferred Stock Offerings Fuel Growth To fund its latest Bitcoin accumulation, Strategy tapped into multiple at-the-market (ATM) offering programs, including its common stock (MSTR) and three distinct preferred share offerings: STRK (Strike), STRF (Strife), and STRD (Stride). Between July 7 and July 13, 2025, Strategy sold nearly 2 million shares across these instruments, raising a combined $472.3 million in net proceeds. The largest tranche came from the common stock ATM, which generated $330.9 million. The STRK preferred shares contributed $57.4 million, STRF added $44.4 million, and STRD rounded out the raise with $15.8 million. Each preferred share class offers annual dividends ranging from 8.00% to 10.00%, giving investors exposure to income-generating equity tied to Strategy’s long-term Bitcoin vision. These instruments also reflect Strategy’s financial creativity, offering scalable fundraising mechanisms without diluting common shareholders excessively. Transparent Reporting and Long-Term Positioning As part of its commitment to transparency, Strategy says it continues to maintain a publicly accessible dashboard at www.strategy.com , where it discloses real-time Bitcoin purchases, aggregate holdings, security market data, and key financial metrics. By integrating Bitcoin acquisition updates with structured equity offerings, Strategy has positioned itself as both a technology firm and a de facto Bitcoin ETF. Bitcoin Breaks $123K ATH Earlier today, Bitcoin has shattered all previous records by reaching a new all-time high (ATH) of $123,091, prompting former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) to put the milestone in historical perspective by calling it “just a fraction” of what’s to come. CZ reminded followers that after buying Bitcoin in 2014, it took three years to reach $1,000 again in January 2017, noting that today’s excitement over current highs will seem minimal in future years.

This move was powered by short-term holders aggressively bidding. Bitcoin’s sharp rebound from the tariff-induced April panic has firmly reasserted its status as a macro-resilient asset, outperforming traditional hedges like gold and equities. In a market grappling with global uncertainty, Bitcoin’s unique positioning as a high-beta safe haven is increasingly validated. Now the fifth-largest asset in the world with a $2.43 trillion market cap, Bitcoin has surpassed both silver and Amazon, in terms of market valuation. ETF-driven demand continues to dominate, with US spot Bitcoin ETFs recording over $2.7 billion in inflows last week, significantly outpacing the mined supply of BTC last week — with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF reaching $80 billion in AUM faster than any ETF in history. Meanwhile, grassroots accumulation by wallet cohorts under 100 BTC is also outpacing new issuance by a wide margin, reducing further supply pressure. Bitcoin’s role as a digitally native monetary asset, validated by sovereign-grade allocators and balance sheet investors, is driving its ascent through the global asset rankings. The price action reflects more than just momentum, it represents a fundamental repricing of Bitcoin’s role in institutional portfolios and macro frameworks. And while headline economic indicators also suggest broader stability in the US, a closer examination reveals deepening cracks beneath the surface. Labour market dynamics are weakening , with rising continuing jobless claims pointing to challenges in workforce reintegration, especially in entry-level roles. Simultaneously, consumer sentiment is cautiously optimistic but weighed down by persistent structural strains—elevated credit costs, essential living expenses, and growing geopolitical uncertainty are testing household resilience. On Main Street, small businesses are feeling the pinch. Despite stable readings in business surveys, data shows that many companies are grappling with sluggish sales, rising input costs, and hiring mismatches , forcing them to scale back investments and hiring plans. Meanwhile, Wall Street is showing its own signs of fragility , with a depreciating dollar, rising Treasury yields, and widening credit spreads reflecting heightened investor anxiety and scepticism toward US fiscal and monetary policy. Amid this backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, the digital asset sector is gaining momentum. BioSig , a Nasdaq-listed firm, has secured up to $1.1 billion in financing to spearhead its push into tokenised commodities, following its merger with blockchain firm Streamex. The capital will underpin the creation of a blockchain-based tokenised treasury—starting with gold-backed products—positioning BioSig to capitalise on growing demand for real-world asset tokenisation. Similarly, Tether, the issuer of USDt, has bolstered its compliance capabilities by investing in blockchain analytics firm Crystal Intelligence. This move enhances Tether’s capacity to detect and respond to illicit activity, reinforcing its commitment to transparency amid a surge in crypto-related fraud. Globally, governments are also signalling increased support for digital asset innovation. South Korea has proposed reclassifying crypto firms as “venture companies,” making them eligible for tax incentives, public funding, and startup programs. This policy shift, aligned with President Lee Jae-myung’s broader pro-crypto agenda, marks a significant step toward institutionalising digital assets within the country’s tech and financial landscape.

2025-07-14T12:34:29,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights Live XRP Price: $ 3.01519399 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 3.01519399 6.44% Market cap $ 178,293,321,500.64 Circulating Supply 59,131,625,363.00 Trading Volume $ 11,847,484,831.9070 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case. Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Positive sentiment continued to strengthen in July. A “buy-the-dip” mindset gained traction, and investor panic appeared to subside. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into launching an XRP ETF also resurfaced in July. In addition, Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. The upper resistance of the falling wedge pattern, around $2.40, was successfully broken in the second week of July. This breakout was catalyzed by Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $123,231, which pulled altcoins like XRP upward. XRP now aims to reclaim its mid-Jan’s peak of $3.40(also ATH). A break above this could lead to a price discovery phase. Similarly, from a technical indicators perspective, XRP price has recently formed a short-term golden cross between its 20-day and 50-day EMAs, this is expanding upwards indicating bullish momentum. Increased exchange outflows and improving investor interest are driving liquidity into the asset. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has surged to 0.21, up from 0.04 earlier in the early july, highlighting growing accumulation. Likewise, both the MACD and AO show rising bullish momentum. However, there are warning signals to consider, which alarm short-term caution with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 77, indicating overheated overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or sideways consolidation is likely before the next leg upward. On the contrary, if XRP price fails to hold the $2.40 support, a retest of $2.10 is possible. This level aligns with the 200-day EMA, making it critical for sustaining bullish momentum. Should this support fail, XRP could fall further to $1.88 or even $1.63. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP’s circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
