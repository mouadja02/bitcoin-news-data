2025-07-14T07:57:09,"Former Binance CEO CZ Shares BTC and BNB After Bitcoin's Consecutive Record Breaks! ""Remember 2017!""","Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week with new records, exceeding $120,000 for the first time in its history. At this point, BTC broke new records, first reaching $121,500 and then exceeding $122,000. While Bitcoin's consecutive record-breaking performance was met with great enthusiasm in the market, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also shared a post following the records. CZ said that BTC's new high may seem small in hindsight. CZ, in his post from his X account, said that there is no need to be overly excited about Bitcoin reaching a new record high, because the current price may be considered low in the coming years. Recalling that it took three years for the price to reach $1,000 after purchasing BTC in 2014, CZ pointed out that that record seemed significant at the time but now represents less than 1% of its current value. At this point, CZ reminded investors that they should adopt a long-term perspective, stating that today's historic peak may only be a small phase in the future. “After buying Bitcoin in 2014, it took me 3 years to reach the record high of $1,000 in January 2017. We were excited. Now it's just a tiny fraction, less than 1%. Today, you might be excited by the current ATH. In a few years, it will be just a fraction. BNB's Eighth Birthday! Binance founder CZ also celebrated BNB's 8th anniversary apart from Bitcoin's new ATH. CZ pointed out that Binance Coin (BNB) was priced at $0.06 when it first started trading 8 years ago, but has now risen to $698, a more than 10,000-fold increase. “BNB started trading 8 years ago today, its price was $0.06. Today it's $698.00. It's up just over 10,000 times. Happy 8th birthday! *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-14T07:52:00,"Grayscale Eyes BONK and BNB, but MAGACOIN Is the Real Contender to Watch","Could MAGACOIN FINANCE be emerging as the political memecoin market’s next serious challenger? Daily new wallet additions for this meme-powered altcoin are quietly on the rise, outperforming many small caps on sheer user traction. Meanwhile, analyst mentions in crypto newsletters have tripled over the past month, pointing to a growing narrative: MAGACOIN isn’t just a novelty play. It offers a real alternative to BONK, underpinned by zero-tax transactions, strong ideological appeal, and expanding cross-wallet utility that’s fueling its climb. In a market chasing fresh contenders, that blend of community governance and functional growth is pushing MAGACOIN into the spotlight. Grayscale’s strategic pivot: BONK, BNB—and wider sector hunts Grayscale’s July update has electrified crypto circles. Its expanded asset watchlist now includes BONK and BNB among 28 newly tracked tokens, alongside AI and DeFi players like Mantle and Monad. This follows hot on the heels of the SEC’s conditional approval of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) ETF—a multi-crypto product currently delayed by procedural disputes. The asset manager’s aggressive move to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into meme coins and ecosystem plays signals one thing: even institutions see meme-driven volatility as a strategic hedge. For BONK, this news compounds existing momentum. BONK’s daily volumes recently surged past $539 million on Bonk.fun, with token burns and buybacks pushing it toward a potential golden cross. However, skeptics note that BONK’s core dependence on Solana token launches could limit its broader cross-chain reach. MAGACOIN: Political memecoin with a purpose Unlike BONK or even BNB, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its explicit ideological brand as a decentralized political memecoin . Built around an anti-centralization ethos and zero-tax transactions, it taps directly into a cultural segment often overlooked by purely speculative meme tokens. Recent announcements on MAGACOIN’s new cross-wallet compatibility aim to solve fragmentation issues, letting holders move assets seamlessly across major chains. This utility-first expansion is catching attention. MAGACOIN’s community has already been lauded for driving grassroots marketing efforts that position it as more than just a meme gamble. Instead, it’s evolving into a politically charged store-of-value narrative with tangible usage, differentiating it from BONK’s primarily ecosystem-dependent growth or BNB’s traditional exchange utility. Could MAGACOIN outshine BNB or BONK this quarter? As Grayscale’s institutional spotlight widens, altcoins like BONK and BNB benefit from fresh inflows and potential ETF chatter. Yet MAGACOIN’s trajectory suggests it could carve a unique lane. With XRP dealing with lingering SEC clarity despite price targets pushing toward $5, and BONK facing the ceiling of Solana-centric expansion, MAGACOIN’s broader multi-chain, ideology-driven pitch offers a rare combination of narrative and functionality. Moreover, MAGACOIN’s zero-tax model is proving attractive to traders looking to sidestep compounding transaction fees that still burden swaps in ecosystems like BNB’s. As analysts track wallet activity, the steady uptick in MAGACOIN addresses is a hard on-chain metric supporting this story. The market’s next phase: diversification with values Grayscale’s aggressive watchlist expansion underscores how 2025 isn’t just about Bitcoin or even big-layer chains anymore. Investors are exploring new frontiers: utility meme coins, politically anchored tokens, and community-owned protocols. MAGACOIN FINANCE encapsulates this trend. It’s not simply chasing speculative hype like many meme plays; its community governance and cultural identity create a narrative that institutions can’t replicate with ETFs alone. For traders and crypto observers, the big takeaway is clear: while Grayscale’s interest in BONK and BNB is headline-worthy, the real alpha may lie in decentralized political memecoins like MAGACOIN—projects that blend meme culture with genuine, ideology-fueled financial ecosystems.

2025-07-14T07:30:07,"Altcoin Explosion Soon? Hidden Signal Hints at It as SpacePay Eyes Big Launch After Presale","The post Altcoin Explosion Soon? Hidden Signal Hints at It as SpacePay Eyes Big Launch After Presale appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Something interesting is happening in crypto right now. Charts are showing patterns that look a lot like what happened before big altcoin runs in 2023 and 2024. At the same time, SpacePay is building something pretty cool – a way for regular stores to accept crypto payments without changing their card machines or dealing with wild price swings. They’ve pulled in over $1.1 million so far, with their $SPY tokens going for $0.003181 each . That Chart Pattern Everyone’s Talking About There’s this chart called Total3 that crypto folks watch closely. It tracks how much all the altcoins are worth, minus Bitcoin and Ethereum. And honestly, it’s been doing the same thing for three years straight now. CaptainAltcoin broke this down in a recent video. Back in 2023, when this trend line got hit, smaller altcoins started moving up. Then 2024 came around and did the exact same thing – but way bigger. XRP flew from around 50 cents to $3. DOGE pushed from 10 cents up to 45 cents. When you see moves like that, people start taking notice. Fast forward to 2025, and wouldn’t you know it – that same trend line is under pressure again. It’s held up every time before, which got people excited about another run. But here’s the thing – if it breaks below that line this time, the whole pattern falls apart. That’s why everyone’s watching so closely right now. The next few weeks could tell us if another altcoin season is actually coming or if we’re just seeing wishful thinking. The Ethereum Problem Nobody Wants to Talk About Here’s what’s been bugging a lot of people lately – this doesn’t feel like a real altcoin season yet. And there’s a good reason for that. Ethereum is still stuck below its previous peak. If you look back at 2021, those insane altcoin rallies didn’t kick off until Ethereum smashed through its old high and kept running. Just look at what happened with Shiba Inu. That wild ride happened after ETH was already in uncharted territory. It’s like Ethereum gives everyone permission to go nuts with the smaller coins. But this time around, Ethereum has been kind of disappointing. Sure, we got all these Layer 2 solutions, staking rewards, and even ETF approvals. Yet ETH is still sitting below its 2021 peak. That’s probably why things feel different this cycle. The smart money is betting that if Ethereum is going to break out, it’ll happen in the last quarter of 2025. That’s historically been the strongest time for crypto moves. If ETH does finally pop then, altcoins could move fast. Really fast. SpacePay’s Smart Approach to Real-World Crypto While everyone’s debating chart patterns, SpacePay is actually solving a problem that matters. They figured out how to let regular businesses accept crypto without buying new equipment or learning complicated tech stuff. Think about it – there are over 400 million people who own crypto, but most stores can’t take their money. SpacePay fixes that by working with the card machines businesses already have. No new hardware, no training headaches, just a software update that suddenly opens up a whole new customer base. The really clever part is how they handle the price volatility issue. When someone pays with crypto, SpacePay instantly converts it to regular money for the merchant. So if Bitcoin drops 10% an hour later, the store owner doesn’t care – they already got paid in dollars or euros or whatever they wanted. And the fees? Just 0.5%. Compare that to what most payment processors charge, and it’s a no-brainer for businesses. They can accept payments from over 325 different crypto wallets, including all the popular ones like MetaMask and Trust Wallet. The platform supports the big cryptocurrencies too – ETH, BNB, MATIC, USDT – basically everything people actually use. Why the $SPY Token Actually Makes Sense Most crypto projects these days just slap a token on something and call it a day. SpacePay’s $SPY token is different because it actually does stuff. Token holders get to vote on what the platform does next, which means the community has real input on development. But here’s the part that gets people excited – revenue sharing. As SpacePay processes more payments and signs up more merchants, token holders get a cut of the profits. It’s like owning a tiny piece of the business that grows as the platform grows. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1941557862007996707 The monthly airdrops are nice too. The most active community members get extra tokens just for being involved. Plus there are quarterly video calls where the team explains what’s coming next and answers questions directly. Early access to new features is another perk that makes holding worthwhile. The token setup is pretty sensible with 34 billion total supply. They set aside 20% for the public sale, 17% for user rewards, and split the rest between development, partnerships, and marketing. It’s not some crazy scheme where insiders get everything. SpacePay already has a working product and they’re focusing on following regulations properly. That’s refreshing in a space where a lot of projects are all hype and no substance. With the potential altcoin season that these chart patterns suggest, having a real business behind the token could make all the difference. Anyone wanting to grab some $SPY tokens can head to the official SpacePay website and connect their wallet. The platform takes most major cryptocurrencies or even regular bank cards if you’re new to crypto. At $0.003181 per token, it’s positioned for the early crowd before any major exchange listings happen.

Since the recent ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, a total of nearly 50% of gains have been harnessed by XRP . This rally aligns with Bitcoin’s remarkable ascent, which recently reached new all-time highs around $121,000. In a significant turn of events, XRP has made headlines by overtaking Tether’s USDT, claiming the third spot in the crypto rankings. As of now, XRP crypto’s market capitalization stands at $172.79 billion, surpassing USDT’s $159.55 billion. According to Santiment , XRP’s fundamentals are also gaining strength. They reported a record number of wallets holding over one million XRP have surged, showcasing robust accumulation trend among investors. Experts are increasingly recognizing Ripple’s utility as unparalleled, suggesting it is the future of fast and cost-effective transaction settlements. This shift is evident as banks are becoming less reliant on SWIFT for their transaction needs, and Ripple Labs forecasts that XRP could even capture nearly 20% of SWIFT’s transaction volume, nearly $30 trillion. XRP Price To Hit $5 In July? In a recent post, an analyst highlighted that the XRP price is exhibiting such bullish momentum that it seems poised to break through the red resistance zone effortlessly. The expert predict a retest soon towards the previous all-time high at $3.40 is imminent, with price discovery on the horizon. $XRP is so bullish right now that it looks like it's gonna break through the red resistance zone easily and retest the prior ATH at $3.40 soon.

If broader market conditions favor a rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum surpassing their former highs, an extended rally could even propel XRP price toward $5 before the end of July. On the downside, a retracement to the $2.55 – $2.60 range is possible, with technical warning signs like RSI is overheated and CMF saw a decline.

2025-07-14T07:21:42,"UK-Listed Gold Miner Bluebird Secures Bitcoin Miners, Targets 30+ BTC in 3 Years","Bluebird Mining, a UK-listed gold explorer focused on high-grade projects across Asia, has doubled down on its Bitcoin ambitions by acquiring 756 ASIC mining rigs, to generate over 30 BTC through a new streaming arrangement. The company, traded under the ticker BMV on the London Stock Exchange, announced on July 14 that it had completed a deal for a mix of Bitmain and Canaan machines totaling a combined hashrate of 63.7 PH/s. The units are now part of an advanced plan to be re-sold under a streaming model that would give Bluebird a share of future Bitcoin production, rather than operating the equipment itself. Bluebird Charts New Territory With Structured Bitcoin Streaming Agreement If completed, the transaction would mark Bluebird’s first foray into “streaming Bitcoin” deals, a model commonly used in the gold sector but rarely applied to digital assets. According to the company, the structure allows it to gain Bitcoin exposure without adding operational risk or bloating its balance sheet. Bluebird Mining Ventures #BMV setting its stall out this morn with new Chairman Sath pioneering its innovative Gold + ""digital Gold"" Bitcoin Treasury approach that looks to shake up this nascent asset class. https://t.co/Nn9QHEwAPu Key lines – ""Over a three-year period, the — Align Research (@AlignResearch) July 14, 2025 Over a three-year period, the transaction could yield more than 30 BTC, depending on network conditions and the final terms of the streaming contracts. Bluebird also confirmed it would not incur further costs once the streaming deal is executed. Blending Traditional Mining Deals With New-Age Crypto Plays The move mirrors the firm’s recently announced Philippine gold project, where it secured a 10% profit share over the mine’s life, plus milestone bonuses of $250,000 for every 5,000 ounces of gold sold above $3,000 per ounce. Both deals are part of what the company describes as a broader shift in its treasury strategy. Bluebird is now actively building long-term asymmetric exposure to gold and Bitcoin, using structured streams alongside direct holdings. A more detailed update is expected in the coming weeks. Bluebird Eyes Capital Efficiency With £1m Allocation Toward Bitcoin “This is a small but symbolic step in our roadmap,” said non-executive chairman Sath Ganesarajah. “We’re building a portfolio of long-dated, asymmetric exposures across gold and Bitcoin.” Ganesarajah added that the structure aligns with Bluebird’s goal to deliver strong capital returns through intelligent asset positioning. He also confirmed that £1m ($1.3m) from an earlier £2m ($2.7m) loan facility would be used for further Bitcoin purchases, alongside the appointment of a new CEO. Treasury Gamble Gains Fresh Relevance In June, Bluebird announced plans to convert future mining revenues into Bitcoin . At the same time, the company aims to keep operating costs lean. Bluebird also plans to hold Bitcoin as a long-term reserve asset on its balance sheet. It views this move as both a hedge and a strategic financial pivot. As a result, management believes the shift will attract a new class of shareholders. It also signals growing confidence in the future of decentralized finance. The firm currently develops gold and silver assets through joint ventures in South Korea and the Philippines, reviving legacy projects like the Gubong, Kochang and Batangas mines. Its estimated total gold resource stands at 1.8m ounces. With the crypto market valued at over $3.8t and Bitcoin topping $122,000 , Bluebird’s timing may prove prescient. As traditional miners diversify into digital assets, Bluebird appears intent on leading that shift from the front.

2025-07-14T07:18:20,"Why Crypto Is Going Up Today?","The post Why Crypto Is Going Up Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today has soared big, with the total market cap hitting $3.8 trillion, marking a 3.25% daily gain. The rally was fueled by institutional accumulation, Bitcoin’s breakout to new all-time highs , and optimism around U.S. crypto regulation . That’s not all, major buys from enterprises like SharpLink and Metaplanet, combined with hype around “ Crypto Week ” and emerging support from the White House, are driving bullish momentum. As BTC dominance climbs to 63.6% and the Fear & Greed Index stays in “Greed” at 70, market sentiment is decisively optimistic. What Happened in Crypto Market Today? The crypto industry’s market cap rose by over $119 billion, hitting $3.8 trillion. The intraday trading volume surged by 29.10%, reaching $150.62 billion, signaling strong participation. Bitcoin price smashed through the psychological $122,000 resistance level, triggering $285 million in short liquidations. Ethereum followed suit with increased activity, supported by a $48 million ETH buy from SharpLink. Key Events Driving the Surge: Institutional Inflows : SharpLink and Metaplanet collectively invested over $140 million into ETH and BTC, respectively, evidence of growing institutional faith in crypto assets . Bitcoin Breaks ATH : The breakout above $122k marks a new all-time high for BTC, further catalyzing aggressive liquidations and FOMO buying. U.S. Regulatory Optimism : The market is energized by discussions of U.S. stablecoin legislation potentially passing this week. Additionally, speculation around White House-backed Crypto Reserves has sparked bullish narratives. Macro Correlation : With gold prices rising and tech stocks stabilizing, Bitcoin is again showing signs of being treated as a hedge asset. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big Week Ahead for Crypto – US CPI, Trump Tariffs, and U.S Crypto Regulations , Why This Matters Bitcoin is leading the rally, but altcoins remain subdued, with the Altcoin Season Index sitting at 34/100. This shows that capital is still concentrated in major assets. The return of institutional FOMO indicates growing mainstream adoption. Retail investors often follow big money, and that’s exactly what’s happening now. Global interest is surging, as Bitcoin climbed the global asset ladder, flipping Amazon to become the 5th largest asset by market cap. Expert Reactions “Bitcoin flipping Amazon is historic. Apple is next. The era of crypto as a fringe asset is over.” Lark Davis noted on social media. “This is the Bitcoin Supercycle. We’re entering stage 8: vertical expansion, nation-state buying, and institutional FOMO. Most won’t realize it… until it’s too late.” Merlijn , a crypto macro analyst, emphasized What Should Be Your Next Steps? If you’re invested in BTC or ETH, this rally could mark the beginning of a stronger bull wave. You should consider restructuring your portfolio if needed. Watch for regulatory developments this week, especially related to stablecoins. Altcoins may lag for now, but if Bitcoin consolidates, capital rotation into smaller tokens could follow. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are expected to collectively bring in about $26.4 billion in revenue from equities and fixed income trading on their upcoming earnings report, an 11% gain on the previous year, The Sunday Times reports . Says Saul Martinez, banking analyst at HSBC, “I think it’ll be a good quarter… There may be some upside to estimates and upside to some of the guidance figures that the banks gave, and it certainly feels like on the equity side, there’s still good momentum. I do think you know the results in this quarter and last quarter do raise questions about the sustainability of this kind of sales and trading.” Betsy Graseck, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley, says the bank sees investment banking revenue in Q2 being better than expected and management teams to “point to pipelines building.” Another unnamed senior Wall Street executive tells The Times, “Anybody that’s in the market-making business, providing people with instantaneous liquidity, is going to benefit. Stocks went down, bonds went down, and the currency went down, and we just saw derisking.” In the first quarter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said that financial institutions in the US reported a return of 1.16% and net income of $70.6 billion. The FDIC said the rise in income was a jump of $3.8 billion, or 5.8%, from the previous quarter.

2025-07-14T07:00:36,"The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle Has Just Begun, Says Hedge Fund CEO","Bitcoin punched through a fresh record above $122,000 on the morning of 14 July, extending its month-long rally to more than 16 percent. Against that backdrop, Charles Edwards—the founder and chief executive of digital-asset hedge fund Capriole Investments—argues that the market is only “in the early stages” of a much broader liquidity-driven boom that could dominate the rest of 2025 and beyond. The Bitcoin Liquidity Supercycle In the latest Capriole newsletter, Edwards contends that “money and liquidity provided the backdrop for capital flows, and Bitcoin Treasury Companies are the funnel.” He dismisses the idea that the past fortnight’s $20,000 advance was a technical accident, pointing instead to deep macro currents that have been building for months. “The biggest Bitcoin rallies occur when the market is net short the USD,” he writes, pointing to Capriole’s proprietary “USD Positioning” gauge, which aggregates futures data across major currencies. The metric has been “deeply negative” since early summer, signalling that global investors are decisively betting against the dollar and in favour of hard assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Soar To $146K In The Next Leg Up — Analyst Explains How Another pillar is credit. BBB-rated corporate-bond spreads have been grinding tighter since the spring, a classic risk-on signal in traditional markets that, since 2020, has mapped almost tick-for-tick onto major Bitcoin up-moves. “More evidence,” Edwards notes, “that Bitcoin is a tradfi asset.” Perhaps the strongest tail-wind, however, is raw money growth. Global M3 has been expanding at an annualised nine percent clip—an historically extreme rate that Capriole says last coincided with average 12-month Bitcoin returns of roughly 460 percent. Edwards cautions that, as a multi-trillion-dollar asset today, Bitcoin is unlikely to repeat that magnitude, “but it wouldn’t be surprising to see something very substantial from here.” Capriole’s framework also draws on an historical lead-lag relationship between gold and Bitcoin. When bullion enters a meaningful breakout, Bitcoin has tended to follow three to four months later. Gold’s early-2025 surge—and its outperformance versus global equities—therefore offered “strong support for the current market’s diminishing demand for fiat money and favour of hard money,” Edwards argues. Since Capriole flagged gold’s move in April, Bitcoin has risen 28 percent. Equities, too, are offering green lights. The New York Stock Exchange advance–decline line broke to new highs last week, while Capriole’s “Equity Premium” indicator reset to zero in late May—both historically consistent with multi-month stretches of expanding risk appetite. All of those data points feed into the firm’s flagship Bitcoin Macro Index, a composite of dozens of public and proprietary variables that Capriole uses to shape trading exposures in its fund. The index “is still in strong positive growth territory,” Edwards reports, even after the coin’s latest vertical move. That suggests the underlying drivers—liquidity, risk sentiment and on-chain activity—“remain intact.” The Bitcoin Treasury-Company Flywheel Yet perhaps the most striking piece of the puzzle lies outside pure macro. Edwards highlights the emergence of Bitcoin Treasury Companies (TCs)—corporate vehicles that raise fiat capital in equity or debt markets and then deploy it into spot BTC—as the new “primary bubble dynamic of this cycle.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Soars Past $118,800—Breakout Or Brutal Bull Trap? Quarterly inflows into TCs reached $15 billion in Q2, and Capriole counts at least 145 such firms now pursuing the strategy. With their market capitalisations inflated by paper gains on balance-sheet coins, they can tap ever-larger funding rounds—a reflexive loop that Edwards believes “will likely help add over $1 trillion to Bitcoin’s market cap over the next year.” He rejects the notion that this amounts to unhealthy centralisation: “If Bitcoin is to one day become base money, it needs to scale to tens of trillions to flatten volatility. The only way that happens is mass acquisition like we are seeing today.” Edwards stresses that his analysis sits on a months-long horizon. “When Bitcoin sees huge rallies there are always strong pullbacks and local overheating,” he concedes, adding that the newsletter deliberately sidelines short-term on-chain froth to focus on the “bigger picture and driving factors for the next six months.” Still, with central-bank liquidity abundant, the dollar crowded short, credit stress muted and a structurally new pool of corporate buyers stepping in, Capriole’s conclusion is unambiguous: the liquidity tap is wide open, and the Bitcoin supercycle it feeds has only just begun. “While today’s early adopters may be seen as speculators, it will be very obvious in hindsight. After the Treasury company wave is the Government treasury wave (next cycle). We are simply riding the adoption curve which requires trillions of dollars to flow in to Bitcoin from the entities that have it in order to achieve scale,” Edwards concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $122,438.

2025-07-14T07:00:28,"El Salvador Bitcoin Unveils Phenomenal 113% Profit on Daily BTC Investment Strategy","BitcoinWorld El Salvador Bitcoin Unveils Phenomenal 113% Profit on Daily BTC Investment Strategy Ever wondered if a nation could truly thrive by embracing Bitcoin? El Salvador’s bold move into the world of cryptocurrency has just delivered a resounding answer. The Central American nation’s consistent El Salvador Bitcoin strategy, involving the purchase of one Bitcoin every single day, has blossomed into an astonishing 113% return on investment, as revealed by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain. This isn’t just a win for El Salvador; it’s a powerful testament to the potential of digital assets on a national scale. How El Salvador’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy Paid Off? Since November 18, 2022, El Salvador has committed to a unique and disciplined Bitcoin investment strategy . Instead of large, sporadic buys, President Nayib Bukele’s administration opted for a dollar-cost averaging approach, acquiring one Bitcoin daily. This method, often recommended for individual investors to mitigate volatility, has proven remarkably effective for a sovereign nation. Lookonchain’s recent analysis highlights the impressive outcome of this steadfast commitment. According to their data, El Salvador has accumulated a total of 969 BTC. The total expenditure for these acquisitions stands at $54.15 million. What’s truly remarkable is the current valuation of these holdings. At prevailing market prices, this portfolio is now worth approximately $115.18 million. This translates into an unrealized profit of $61.03 million, marking that incredible 113% return. The average purchase price for El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings comes in at $55,886 per BTC, showcasing the power of consistent accumulation even through market fluctuations. Metric Value Total BTC Acquired 969 BTC Total Cost $54.15 million Current Value ~$115.18 million Unrealized Profit ~$61.03 million Return on Investment 113% Average Purchase Price $55,886 per BTC The Power of National Crypto Adoption: A Bold Experiment El Salvador’s journey into national crypto adoption began in September 2021 when it became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. This audacious move was met with both fervent support and significant skepticism. Critics warned of economic instability, money laundering risks, and the perils of tying a nation’s financial fate to a volatile asset. However, President Bukele remained steadfast in his vision, seeing Bitcoin as a pathway to financial inclusion for the unbanked, a tool for remittances, and a magnet for foreign investment and tourism. The success of their daily purchase strategy now serves as a powerful vindication for this pioneering approach. It demonstrates that with a long-term perspective and a clear strategy, even a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin can contribute positively to a nation’s treasury. Beyond the direct financial gains, El Salvador has gained significant international recognition, positioning itself as a hub for blockchain innovation and drawing in crypto entrepreneurs and enthusiasts from around the globe. Financial Inclusion: Providing banking services to a large unbanked population. Remittance Savings: Reducing fees for remittances, a vital part of the Salvadoran economy. Tourism & Investment: Attracting a new wave of crypto-focused tourists and businesses. Sovereignty: A move towards financial independence from traditional financial systems. Decoding El Salvador’s BTC Profit: What Does it Mean? The impressive BTC profit reported by Lookonchain isn’t just a number; it carries significant implications. Firstly, it showcases the potential of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) on a grand scale. By spreading purchases over time, the strategy smoothed out price fluctuations, allowing the nation to accumulate Bitcoin at a favorable average price. This approach minimizes the risk of “buying the top” and maximizes the chances of long-term gains. Secondly, this unrealized profit provides El Salvador with substantial financial flexibility. While the gains are currently “on paper,” they represent a significant boost to the national balance sheet. These funds could potentially be used for infrastructure projects, social programs, or even to strengthen the national reserves, depending on future policy decisions. It offers a tangible example for other developing nations contemplating similar strategies, demonstrating that strategic crypto holdings can be a viable asset class for national treasuries. This success story also serves as a counter-narrative to the prevailing skepticism often surrounding national Bitcoin adoption. It highlights that with foresight and commitment, even controversial economic policies can yield positive results, potentially inspiring more countries to explore the benefits of integrating digital assets into their financial frameworks. Beyond the Bitcoin Daily Purchase: Future Outlook El Salvador’s commitment to the Bitcoin daily purchase program has clearly paid dividends, but what lies ahead for this pioneering nation? The consistent accumulation strategy suggests a long-term vision for Bitcoin’s role in the country’s economy. As Bitcoin continues to gain mainstream acceptance and potentially higher valuations, El Salvador stands to benefit even further from its early and consistent entry into the market. For individual investors, El Salvador’s experience offers a compelling case study for the power of dollar-cost averaging and long-term holding. It underscores the importance of patience and discipline in navigating the volatile cryptocurrency markets. Rather than trying to time the market, consistent, small investments can lead to significant returns over time. Looking forward, the world will be watching El Salvador closely. Will this success encourage other nations to follow suit? Could we see a domino effect of countries exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset or legal tender? El Salvador’s bold experiment has not only yielded impressive financial returns but has also paved the way for a new paradigm in national economic strategy, demonstrating that innovation and conviction can indeed lead to prosperity in the digital age. Summary: El Salvador’s Bitcoin Triumph El Salvador’s unwavering commitment to its daily Bitcoin acquisition strategy has proven to be an extraordinary success. What began as a controversial experiment in national crypto adoption has now yielded a phenomenal 113% return, transforming a $54.15 million investment into over $115 million. This achievement, highlighted by Lookonchain, underscores the power of a disciplined investment approach, even in volatile markets. Beyond the impressive financial gains, El Salvador has solidified its position as a global leader in digital asset innovation, offering a compelling blueprint for other nations considering a future intertwined with cryptocurrency. Their journey stands as a powerful testament to foresight, resilience, and the transformative potential of Bitcoin.

2025-07-14T06:50:20,"Bitcoin Hashrate: US Reigns Supreme, Russia’s Strategic Rise Redefines Global Mining","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Hashrate: US Reigns Supreme, Russia’s Strategic Rise Redefines Global Mining In the dynamic world of digital assets, understanding the pulse of the Bitcoin network is crucial. The Bitcoin hashrate , a measure of the total computational power being used to mine and process transactions, serves as a vital indicator of the network’s health, security, and geographical distribution. As we delve into the third quarter of 2025, a fascinating shift in the global mining landscape has been unveiled, with the United States solidifying its dominant position while Russia makes a significant and strategic ascent. This evolving scenario is not just about numbers; it reflects geopolitical shifts, energy policies, and the relentless pursuit of digital gold. Understanding the Global Bitcoin Hashrate Landscape The latest data from the Global Hashrate Heatmap by Hashrate Index paints a compelling picture of where the world’s Bitcoin mining power resides. For Q3 2025, the United States stands as the undisputed leader, commanding a formidable 323.4 EH/s (Exahashes per second). This significant lead underscores the country’s growing commitment to and infrastructure for cryptocurrency mining. Following closely, Russia has emerged as a formidable player with 150 EH/s, signaling its growing influence in the sector. China, despite past crackdowns, maintains a notable presence at 125 EH/s, indicating a persistent, albeit often clandestine, mining activity within its borders. This distribution isn’t accidental. It’s the culmination of various factors, including energy availability, regulatory environments, technological advancements, and investor confidence. The concentration of global hashrate in these key regions highlights their strategic importance to the Bitcoin ecosystem’s security and decentralization. Why is US Bitcoin Mining Leading the Charge? The United States’ pre-eminence in US Bitcoin mining is no fluke; it’s the result of a confluence of favorable conditions that have attracted massive investment and infrastructure development. Several key factors contribute to its leading position: Abundant and Diverse Energy Sources: The U.S. boasts a wide array of energy options, including natural gas, hydro, wind, and solar. Many mining operations are strategically located in regions with surplus energy, such as Texas (wind and natural gas), Kentucky (coal-fired plants), and New York (hydroelectric power), where electricity is relatively cheap and readily available. Favorable Regulatory Environment: While still evolving, the U.S. has generally adopted a more open and less restrictive stance towards cryptocurrency mining compared to some other nations. States like Wyoming, Texas, and Colorado have enacted progressive legislation aimed at attracting blockchain businesses, providing legal clarity and support. Robust Infrastructure and Capital Markets: The U.S. has a well-developed financial infrastructure that facilitates investment in large-scale mining operations. Access to capital, advanced data centers, and a skilled workforce capable of managing complex tech operations are significant advantages. Technological Innovation: American companies are at the forefront of developing new mining hardware (ASICs) and optimizing mining software. This innovation ecosystem helps maintain a competitive edge. Institutional Adoption: A growing number of publicly traded companies in the U.S. are entering the Bitcoin mining space, bringing institutional-level capital, management, and transparency to the industry. These elements combine to create an environment where large-scale, efficient, and profitable mining operations can thrive, solidifying the U.S.’s position as the global leader. Russia’s Strategic Ascent: A New Force in Bitcoin Mining The emergence of Russia as the second-largest contributor to the global hashrate is one of the most compelling narratives of Q3 2025. Russia’s rise in Russia Bitcoin mining is largely driven by its unique advantages: Vast Energy Resources: Russia is one of the world’s largest producers of oil and natural gas, often with significant energy surpluses, particularly in remote regions like Siberia. This translates to incredibly low electricity costs for miners, making operations highly profitable. Cold Climate: The naturally cold climate in many parts of Russia is a significant benefit for mining operations, as it reduces the need for expensive cooling systems for ASICs, thereby lowering operational costs. Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While historically cautious, Russia has shown signs of softening its stance on cryptocurrency. The government has explored various regulatory frameworks, acknowledging the economic potential of mining. There’s a growing push to legalize and tax mining operations, which could further legitimize and expand the industry within the country. Geopolitical Considerations: In an era of economic sanctions, Bitcoin mining offers Russia an avenue to generate revenue and potentially circumvent traditional financial systems, making it a strategically appealing industry. The speed and scale of Russia’s ascent indicate a deliberate strategy to capitalize on its natural advantages and secure a significant share of the global Bitcoin network’s power. China’s Enduring Influence on Global Hashrate Despite the infamous crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in May 2021, China still holds a substantial share of the global hashrate , ranking third globally. The narrative around China Bitcoin mining is complex: Resilience of Underground Operations: While large-scale, overt mining farms were dismantled, many smaller, clandestine operations have persisted. These miners often leverage hidden hydropower resources or operate in remote areas to avoid detection. Shift to Overseas Operations: Many major Chinese mining companies and individuals relocated their operations to more crypto-friendly jurisdictions like the U.S., Kazakhstan, and Canada after the ban. However, some still maintain ties or smaller operations within China. Renewed Interest in Green Energy: Paradoxically, some areas in China, particularly those with abundant hydropower (like Sichuan and Yunnan during the wet season), still offer attractive conditions for ‘green’ mining, which some authorities might tolerate more readily than fossil fuel-powered operations. China’s continued presence, even diminished, underscores the difficulty of completely eradicating an industry as distributed and resilient as Bitcoin mining, especially when significant energy advantages exist. The Significance of Global Hashrate Distribution The geographical distribution of the Bitcoin hashrate is more than just a statistical curiosity; it has profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem: Network Security: A higher and more distributed hashrate generally translates to a more secure network. It makes a 51% attack (where a single entity gains control of over half the network’s mining power) exceedingly difficult, protecting the integrity of transactions and the blockchain. Decentralization: While the concentration in a few countries might raise concerns about centralization, a diversified global distribution across multiple nations is healthier than dominance by a single region. The current spread, with the U.S. leading but Russia and China as significant players, indicates a level of decentralization. Energy Consumption Debate: The locations of mining operations heavily influence the energy mix used for mining. Regions with abundant renewable energy (hydro, solar, wind) are increasingly attractive, driving the industry towards more sustainable practices. Geopolitical Stability: The reliance on mining infrastructure in politically stable regions adds to the network’s resilience against government interference or economic instability. The ongoing shifts in hashrate distribution reflect the network’s adaptive nature and its ability to seek out optimal conditions globally. Challenges and Opportunities in Global Bitcoin Mining Despite the impressive growth and concentration of global hashrate , the Bitcoin mining industry faces its share of challenges, alongside burgeoning opportunities: Key Challenges: Energy Costs and Sustainability: Fluctuating energy prices and the increasing focus on environmental sustainability pose significant challenges. Miners are under pressure to source renewable energy or face criticism. Hardware Availability and Obsolescence: The supply chain for advanced mining hardware (ASICs) can be volatile, and older models quickly become unprofitable as network difficulty increases. Regulatory Uncertainty: While some countries are embracing mining, others remain hesitant or even hostile, creating a patchwork of regulations that can complicate international operations. Geopolitical Risks: Political instability or shifts in government policy in key mining regions can significantly impact operations and global hashrate distribution. Emerging Opportunities: Renewable Energy Integration: Miners are increasingly partnering with renewable energy producers, utilizing stranded energy assets, or helping to stabilize power grids by acting as flexible load balancers. Waste Heat Utilization: Innovations are emerging to repurpose the heat generated by mining, for example, to warm homes or greenhouses. Modular and Mobile Mining: The development of containerized and mobile mining units allows for greater flexibility in deployment, especially to areas with excess energy. Institutional Investment: As Bitcoin gains legitimacy, more traditional financial institutions are exploring investments in mining, bringing more capital and professional management to the sector. What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Mining? The trajectory of Bitcoin hashrate distribution suggests a continued evolution driven by energy economics, regulatory clarity, and technological advancements. We can anticipate several trends: Diversification beyond the top three: While the U.S., Russia, and China currently dominate, countries like Canada, Kazakhstan, and parts of Latin America are likely to continue growing their share as they offer competitive energy prices and a welcoming regulatory environment. Increased focus on sustainability: The pressure to adopt greener mining practices will intensify, pushing innovation in renewable energy integration and waste heat recovery. Technological advancements: Further improvements in ASIC efficiency will reduce energy consumption per hash, making mining more profitable and accessible. Closer integration with energy grids: Mining operations may increasingly become part of smart grids, offering services like demand response and helping to stabilize intermittent renewable energy sources. The race for hashrate dominance is not just about securing a piece of the Bitcoin pie; it’s about influencing the future of decentralized finance and digital sovereignty. The latest Q3 2025 data confirms the United States’ commanding lead in the global Bitcoin hashrate , a testament to its robust infrastructure, favorable policies, and access to diverse energy. However, the remarkable rise of Russia as a key player, leveraging its vast energy reserves and cold climate, signals a significant shift in the competitive landscape. Even China, despite its past bans, maintains a resilient presence, highlighting the persistent global nature of Bitcoin mining. This evolving distribution underscores the network’s security, decentralization, and the ongoing quest for efficient and sustainable energy sources. As the industry matures, we can expect continued innovation and a dynamic geographical redistribution of mining power, shaping the very foundation of the Bitcoin network for years to come.

2025-07-14T06:40:18,"Unstoppable Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Soars 7.96% to New Heights","BitcoinWorld Unstoppable Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Soars 7.96% to New Heights The world of Bitcoin is constantly evolving, a dynamic landscape shaped by the tireless work of miners and the intricate rules of its underlying code. Recently, a significant milestone was reached that has everyone talking: the Bitcoin mining difficulty has surged to an unprecedented all-time high. If you’re invested in cryptocurrencies, or just curious about what keeps the Bitcoin network running, this development is crucial. It speaks volumes about the health and resilience of the world’s leading digital asset. What is Bitcoin Mining Difficulty, and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Bitcoin mining difficulty is a measure of how hard it is to mine a new block on the Bitcoin blockchain. Think of it like a puzzle: the higher the difficulty, the more complex the puzzle. This isn’t just an arbitrary number; it’s a fundamental mechanism designed to keep the network stable and predictable. The Bitcoin protocol aims for a new block to be found approximately every 10 minutes. When more miners join the network and dedicate more computing power (hash rate) to finding blocks, blocks tend to be found faster than 10 minutes. To counteract this and maintain the 10-minute average, the difficulty automatically adjusts upwards. Conversely, if hash rate drops, and blocks are found too slowly, the difficulty adjusts downwards. This self-regulating mechanism ensures a consistent supply of new Bitcoin and maintains the integrity of the network. A climbing difficulty indicates a healthy, growing network with increasing participation and competition among miners. The Unprecedented Climb: A New Record for Bitcoin Mining Difficulty As of 04:42 UTC on July 12, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty experienced a substantial rise of 7.96%, pushing it to an astounding all-time high of 126.27 T. This isn’t just a slight bump; it’s a significant leap that marks a new record for the network. Data from CloverPool confirmed this impressive surge, highlighting the robust expansion of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. This record-breaking adjustment reflects a sustained increase in the computing power dedicated to securing the Bitcoin blockchain. It tells us that more miners are joining the fray, and existing miners are upgrading their equipment, all vying for the chance to earn Bitcoin rewards. This competition is a testament to the profitability and long-term appeal of crypto mining . Understanding the Bitcoin Hash Rate: The Engine Behind the Climb The direct correlation between mining difficulty and the Bitcoin hash rate cannot be overstated. Hash rate refers to the total combined computational power being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. Essentially, it’s the speed at which a miner is solving the cryptographic puzzle to find the next block. At the time of this latest difficulty adjustment, the seven-day average hash rate stood at an impressive 872.32 EH/s (Exahashes per second). To put that into perspective, an Exahash is one quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) hashes per second. This colossal amount of computing power signifies an incredibly strong and resilient network. The higher the hash rate, the more secure the network becomes against potential attacks. The surge in difficulty is a direct consequence of this booming hash rate. As more powerful machines come online and more mining farms expand, the network adjusts to ensure the block discovery rate remains consistent, reinforcing the fundamental design principles of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for Crypto Mining Operations? For individual miners and large-scale crypto mining operations, a rising difficulty presents both challenges and opportunities. On one hand, it means that finding a block becomes harder, requiring more computational power and, consequently, more electricity. This can impact profitability, especially for miners with older, less efficient hardware or those operating in regions with high energy costs. Challenges for Miners: Increased Competition: More hash rate means more miners are competing for the same block rewards. Higher Energy Costs: To maintain profitability, miners must either upgrade to more energy-efficient hardware or seek out locations with cheaper electricity. Hardware Obsolescence: Older mining rigs quickly become unprofitable as newer, more powerful Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) enter the market. Opportunities for Miners: Innovation Drive: The challenge spurs innovation in mining hardware and cooling solutions. Geographic Relocation: Miners are incentivized to find optimal locations with abundant, cheap, and often renewable energy sources. Pool Mining: Smaller miners can pool their resources to increase their chances of earning rewards, sharing the proceeds proportionally. This continuous cycle of increasing difficulty and hash rate drives the professionalization and industrialization of the mining sector, making it a highly competitive and capital-intensive industry. Enhancing Network Security: A Fortress Built by Hash Power Perhaps the most significant benefit of an increasing Bitcoin mining difficulty and hash rate is the bolstering of network security . Bitcoin’s security relies on its decentralized nature and the computational power required to alter its ledger. A 51% attack, where a malicious entity gains control of more than half of the network’s hash rate, becomes exponentially harder and more expensive as the total hash rate climbs. With the hash rate at 872.32 EH/s, mounting such an attack would require an unimaginable amount of computing power and financial resources, making it practically impossible. This high level of security is fundamental to Bitcoin’s value proposition, ensuring that transactions are irreversible and the supply of Bitcoin is controlled. This inherent security, backed by a constantly growing and adjusting difficulty, instills confidence in users and investors alike, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as a robust and trustworthy digital asset. It’s a testament to the strength of its underlying blockchain technology . The Future Outlook: What to Expect Next? The Bitcoin network is designed for continuous adaptation. The next difficulty adjustment is expected to occur in roughly 12 days and 8 hours. Given the current trend of increasing hash rate, it’s highly probable that we will see another upward adjustment, potentially setting yet another record. This ongoing trend indicates a healthy and expanding Bitcoin ecosystem. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the fundamental infrastructure supporting Bitcoin continues to grow stronger, attracting more participants and investments into the mining sector. For investors, a robust and secure network is a positive indicator of long-term stability and growth potential. Actionable Insights for Enthusiasts and Investors What can you take away from this monumental shift in Bitcoin mining difficulty? For Miners: Focus on efficiency. Invest in the latest ASIC technology, explore renewable energy sources, and consider joining well-established mining pools to mitigate risks and stabilize income. For Investors: Recognize that a rising difficulty and hash rate are strong indicators of network health and security. This reinforces Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition and its resilience against attacks. It’s a sign of a maturing and robust blockchain technology . For Developers and Innovators: The increasing demand for efficient mining solutions opens doors for new hardware, software, and energy solutions within the crypto space. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Unyielding Strength The recent surge in Bitcoin mining difficulty to an all-time high is more than just a technical statistic; it’s a powerful statement about the enduring strength and growing adoption of the Bitcoin network. It signifies a thriving Bitcoin hash rate , a highly competitive crypto mining industry, and an unassailable level of network security , all underpinned by ingenious blockchain technology . As the network continues to expand and adapt, these adjustments serve as a constant reminder of Bitcoin’s decentralized resilience and its unwavering commitment to security and stability. This record-breaking achievement underscores Bitcoin’s position as the bedrock of the cryptocurrency world, a digital fortress growing stronger with each passing block.

While the account under Wynn's username “@JamesWynnReal” is no longer accessible, the profile's last bio update before it was shut down included only one word: “broke.” According to blockchain data, only $6,580 remains in wallets identified as belonging to Wynn. However, in recent weeks, the total balance of these wallets had reached as much as $100 million. Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson made the following statement regarding Wynn's disappearance: Hyperliquid scam alert. This was likely a fake account, intended to mislead the public with false transactions. I've seen this repeatedly over the past 10 years. Be wary of accounts hiding behind aliases, anime avatars, or impersonating a famous whale. The crypto world is full of scammers, so be skeptical of everything you see. Related News: Controversial Cryptocurrency Figure Arthur Hayes Bought a Large Amount of This Altcoin During the Rally This sudden crash, which occurred after Wynn introduced himself as a “professional investor” on social media and made headlines with his large trades, has become a source of controversy among investors. Some users in the X community argue that Wynn was never a true whale and was attempting to manipulate the market with fake trades. Allegedly, for every trade Wynn opened on the decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Hyperliquid, he would also open the opposite trade on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, minimizing his losses. The whale's aim is believed to be market manipulation and airdrop farming through Hyperliquid. *This is not investment advice.

Key Drivers Behind $122K Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin Price today is back in the spotlight as its price has surged to a new record high of over $122,600. While the rest of the crypto market is enjoying a positive run , Bitcoin’s rise feels different. Analysts and traders are asking one question: Can this rally continue? Fueled by record-breaking ETF demand, a falling dollar, and institutional hunger, Bitcoin may just be heading toward $200,000. What’s Driving Bitcoin’s Surge to $122K? Institutional Demand vs. Limited Supply One of the biggest reasons behind this surge is the growing demand from institutions. According to Bitwise’s July 10 report , daily ETF inflows averaged 8,200 BTC, while mining production remained at 450 BTC. To give some perspective, only 450 new Bitcoins are mined each day, but just yesterday, spot ETFs scooped up 10,000 BTC. That’s not a typo, that’s 20X more demand than supply. This imbalance is a major factor pushing prices up fast. How Are ETFs Impacting Bitcoin Price? BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT, has become a major force in the market. Last week, it hit $84 billion in assets under management, a number it reached in only 200 trading days. For comparison, it took the gold ETF (GLD) over 15 years to hit similar numbers. IBIT now holds more than 700,000 BTC , making it the largest holder by far, nearly 100,000 more than its next closest competitor. Why Is Bitcoin Outpacing the U.S. Dollar? While interest rates are rising and the U.S. dollar has fallen by 11% in just six months, Bitcoin has surged more than $15,000 since July began. A lot of this sudden push came right after the U.S. House approved President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” on July 3rd . For many, this signaled that big spending was here to stay, and that made Bitcoin, which many see as digital gold, look even more attractive. Geopolitical tensions are also playing a role. U.S. President Donald Trump has returned with a strong pro-crypto stance. Recently, Trump imposed 50% tariffs on copper and targeted Brazil with penalties. Will Bitcoin Hit $200,000 This Year? Some market watchers say Bitcoin has now entered what they’re calling “crisis mode.” Geoff Kendrick, head of digital asset research at Standard Chartered, said Bitcoin could reach $135,000 by the end of Q3 and possibly hit $200,000 by year-end. However, Bitwise’s Matt Hougan also believes that if the current gap between strong demand and limited supply continues, Bitcoin’s price could climb toward the $200,000 mark by the end of the year. FAQ Q: Why is Bitcoin going up today? A: Bitcoin is rising due to surging institutional demand, limited supply, and macroeconomic uncertainty, including a falling dollar and pro-crypto policy changes. Q: Will Bitcoin reach $200K in 2025? A: Analysts from Bitwise and Standard Chartered believe Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by the end of 2025 due to ongoing ETF inflows and macroeconomic factors.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-going-up-today/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|ZRX","News",cryptocompare

The breakout above $0.200 resistance was confirmed by back-to-back volume spikes of 615.53M and 581.80M during the 03:00–04:00 session. Institutional accumulation was visible as volume exceeded the 24H average (268.45M) throughout late trading. Futures volume reached $1.50B, driven by multiple +$1M transactions across major derivatives venues. News Background DOGE’s breakout coincided with a broader crypto uptrend led by easing Fed rate expectations and a thaw in BRICS–U.S. trade tensions. Derivatives market activity surged, with DOGE futures open interest and volume reaching their highest levels this month. Whale-led flows dominated on-chain metrics, while traders took aim at $0.213–$0.215 as the next resistance cluster. Bitcoin’s new all-time high of $118,000 provided risk-on momentum across meme and altcoin sectors.

Ether (ETH) broke through $3,000, supported by $383 million in ETF inflows on Friday. Majors tokens have surged in the past week amid BTC’s strength. XRP (XRP) trading near $2.95, up 30% on a weekly basis, Solana’s SOL reclaiming the $167 level, and dogecoin (DOGE) jumping over 20%, fueled by retail rotations and memecoin chatter. This mirrors patterns observed in previous cycles, where a BTC rally acts as a liquidity unlock for the broader market. If macroeconomic conditions hold and bitcoin stabilizes above $ 120,000, further upside in large-cap altcoins appears likely in the coming weeks, traders opine . With the U.S. kicking off “Crypto Week” in Congress, a series of hearings aimed at making America the “crypto capital of the world,” traders are positioning for legislative tailwinds. “Crypto prices benefited from the major melt-up fervor with BTC trading up to the high $118K area, liquidating over $1 billion in shorts,” said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, in a Telegram message. “Market sentiment is likely to stay frothy into the summer, with the only real risk catalyst being a complete breakdown of tariff negotiations, but the ball is sitting with the President on how aggressive he wants to push his current hand,” Fan added. Strong on-chain support at $109,000, along with cross-asset flows from equities into digital assets, is giving bulls more confidence. As Eugene Cheung, CCO at OSL, put it: “The trend remains bullish. We could see Bitcoin test $130K–$150K by year-end if macro winds cooperate.” Meanwhile, equity-index futures in the U.S. and Europe retreated early Monday after Trump announced a 30% tariff on goods from the European Union and Mexico, escalating trade tensions that had already rattled Brazil, Algeria, and Canada last week. S&P 500 contracts fell 0.4%, while Europe’s Stoxx 600 futures dropped 0.6% as of Asian morning hours.

Interestingly, the meme coin’s price looks to have fallen into a trend not seen since December 2020, as highlighted by crypto analyst CryptoKaleo, showing a rising bullish trend. Dogecoin Price Returns To Levels Before 36,000% Rally In an X post, CryptoKaleo outlines the fact that the Dogecoin price has been trending similarly to where it was back in 2020. In particular, the Dogecoin price was struggling in December 2020 , but this was just before the legendary 36,000% surge that had been kick-started by billionaire Elon Musk posting about the meme coin on his X (formerly Twitter) post. Back then, the price had been struggling after its previous all-time high, following a trend line straight down. This was until it hit another upward momentum, followed by a downtrend, which marked the end of the price decline. At this point, the bottom signaled the start of the next rally. Now, once again, the Dogecoin price is beginning to mark another bottom after an initial breakdown within this trendline. According to the analyst, this puts the Dogecoin price right in the same place where it was back in December 2020. If it follows the same trend as it has been doing, then the meme coin could be getting ready to see a parabolic rally . From the analyst’s chart, the $1 mark is a no-brainer, with a possible top being as high as $2.4 before the trend is completed. Can The DOGE Price Rally 36,000% Again? The last time that the Dogecoin price broke out of this trend , it ended up rallying by 36,000% over the next few months. This opens up the possibility that a similar rally could be in the cards. However, multiple developments over the last few years suggest that this is not possible. For one, a 36,000% rally from here would mean that the price would rise as high as $72, meaning that the Dogecoin market cap would have to rise above $2 trillion. This is highly unlikely given that the DOGE supply is always rising and remains unlimited. More than likely, the $1 mark would mark the beginning of the end of the Dogecoin price rally.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-december-2020-levels/,"AXL|ATOM|ENS|OM|FLR|PYTH|INJ|XAUT|LPT|BRETT|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|COMP|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|ALGO|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|CFX|NOT","Dogecoin|crypto|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T05:59:23,"US and UAE Offer Top Crypto Jobs Prospects, From Salary to Demand: Study","The global crypto jobs market is heating up, just as Bitcoin smashed through $122,000 for the first time on July 14. As interest in digital assets soars, a new study reveals where the most promising crypto careers are taking shape, and which countries offer the best mix of pay, opportunity and regulation. A recent Taurex study shows the US tops the list, cementing its role as the world’s largest crypto ecosystem. With 292 active job listings and an average salary of $148,100, crypto careers in the US now rival some of the best-paying roles in traditional finance. The country is also home to 170 crypto companies, reflecting a well-established infrastructure and supportive policy environment. UAE Leads in Crypto Ownership, India in Company Count and User Base Trailing just behind, the United Arab Emirates has carved out a stronghold of its own. The UAE not only offers the second-highest average salary at $111,483, but also boasts the highest Bitcoin ownership rate globally, at 27%. Online search interest in crypto jobs remains strong, displaying its appeal to both domestic and international talent. Image Source: Taurex India ranks third, driven by sheer scale. It hosts 173 crypto companies, the most of any country, and has the world’s largest number of Bitcoin owners by headcount. While average salaries trail behind at $83,687, India’s growing talent pool and expanding startup ecosystem make it a key player in the space. Singapore comes in fourth, offering 72 active roles with an average salary above $100,000. The city-state leads all countries in search interest for crypto jobs, suggesting a high concentration of tech-savvy professionals looking to make a mark in Web3. Top Crypto Salaries and Strong Policy Support Keep Europe in the Game The UK rounds out the top five, with 66 listings and an average salary of $97,204. It also shows robust search interest and a stable regulatory framework, making it Europe’s most attractive destination for crypto talent. Canada, Switzerland and Germany also place in the top ten, each offering six-figure salaries and maintaining solid regulatory standings. Switzerland, in particular, stands out for having the highest crypto regulation score at 9.5, while Germany leads Europe in job count with 84 listings. Emerging Markets Like Poland Join Established Hubs in Crypto Job Boom Further down the list, Hong Kong and Poland secure the ninth and tenth spots, respectively. Hong Kong’s crypto sector remains active, supported by strong search interest and competitive salaries. Poland, meanwhile, ranks high in job volume with 157 listings, though salaries remain more modest at just under $62,000. With the crypto market now worth over $3.8 trillion and Bitcoin pushing into record highs, the demand for blockchain talent is climbing fast.

2025-07-14T05:57:08,"Can Donald Trump Remove Fed Chairman Jerome Powell? He May Have Found a Way","The possibility of US President Donald Trump dismissing Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been raised again. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said today that Trump may fire Powell due to cost overruns on the Fed's headquarters renovation project. It's well known that the Trump administration has been pressuring Powell to cut interest rates for a long time. This pressure has fueled concerns about the Fed's independence, and the mere possibility of Powell's dismissal has previously significantly shaken markets. Indeed, earlier this year, even such a rumor triggered a rise in interest rates and a sell-off in the markets. Although Trump said last Friday that he would not fire Powell, Hassett's statements indicated that the possibility could be on the table again. Related News: Bitcoin's Weekend Breakout: Price Breaks All-Time High Record Again - Here's What We Know The White House has ratcheted up the pressure by alleging a $700 million budget overrun on the Fed's Washington headquarters renovation project. On July 10, Office of Budget and Management Director Russ Vought sent a letter to Powell, questioning the project and requesting clarification on its legality. Vought's letter gives Powell seven business days to respond, which falls at the end of this week and could give Trump the opportunity to take action before the next Fed meeting begins on July 29. Speaking to ABC, Hassett said, “Whether the president will pursue this path depends on the Fed's response.” When asked whether Trump could fire Powell, Hassett said, “That's under review, but if there's a justification, yes, he could.” Jerome Powell's term expires in May. Meanwhile, speculation that Hassett could succeed Powell is gaining traction. Economic circles consider Hassett, one of the most influential figures in the White House, a strong candidate. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-14T05:51:35,"Satoshi Nakamoto’s Wealth Soars to $132.8B as Bitcoin Hits $120K, Becoming 11th Richest","Bitcoin’s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, has vaulted into the ranks of the world’s wealthiest individuals as Bitcoin surged past $120,000 on Sunday. Key Takeaways: Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin holdings are now worth over $132.8 billion. Analysts predict Nakamoto could rise to second richest by 2026 if Bitcoin grows at its historical rate. Blockchain analytics firm Arkham estimates Nakamoto holds roughly 1.096 million BTC spread across thousands of wallets, valued at over $132.8 billion at current prices. The staggering fortune theoretically places Nakamoto at 11th on Forbes’ billionaire list, overtaking tech magnate Michael Dell, whose net worth sits at $125.1 billion. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Rise to Continue Analysts believe Nakamoto’s rise may continue. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted in early June that if Bitcoin maintains its typical 50% annual growth, Nakamoto could reach second place on the billionaire list by 2026. Balchunas highlighted the founder’s decision never to cash out, comparing Nakamoto to legendary investor Jack Bogle, who amassed a modest fortune despite revolutionizing the investment world. If bitcoin does its normal 50%/ann then Satoshi will pass Buffett this year and Zuck sometime next year-ish to be #2 richest in world (Elon has huge lead). It's fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in. It echoes Jack Bogle in that regard https://t.co/tu9MRzUD5h — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) June 2, 2025 Compared to other large Bitcoin holders, Nakamoto’s stash is unmatched. Corporations and custodians collectively hold about 847,000 BTC, or roughly 4% of Bitcoin’s capped supply. Notable individual holders include the Winklevoss twins with around 70,000 BTC, venture capitalist Tim Draper with about 30,000 BTC purchased at a 2014 auction, and Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, who reportedly holds close to 18,000 BTC privately. Notably, Forbes’ rankings exclude cryptocurrency holdings, focusing instead on publicly verifiable assets like stocks. Despite Bitcoin’s historic climb, Nakamoto still trails behind the likes of Elon Musk, who leads the list with an estimated $404 billion fortune. For Nakamoto to claim the top spot, Bitcoin would need to jump approximately 208% to around $370,000, assuming the wealth of other billionaires remains unchanged. The price leap would propel Nakamoto ahead of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who hold fortunes of $274 billion each. $20K Bitcoin Sent to Satoshi’s Wallet Last month, an unknown wallet transferred $20,000 worth of Bitcoin to Nakamoto’s Genesis Block address, marking the largest movement to the Bitcoin creator’s wallet in four months. Analysts from Arkham Intelligence said the transaction may have been either an accidental exchange withdrawal or a deliberate tribute from an early Bitcoin supporter honoring Nakamoto. The recent transfer follows a pattern of periodic large donations to Satoshi’s wallets, often linked to exchange withdrawals. Historical data shows transfers ranging from thousands to over a million dollars over the years. The dormant wallets now hold approximately $117 billion in Bitcoin, untouched since Nakamoto vanished in 2011, and any significant movement from these addresses would likely cause major market upheaval. Amid this activity, speculation over Satoshi’s true identity has intensified. Researchers have recently pointed to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey as a potential candidate based on circumstantial evidence, while fraud claims by Craig Wright were dismissed in court.

Roughly $426 million of the total liquidations came from bearish bets, according to Coinglass data, making it one of the largest weekend liquidation events in recent months. The largest single order, a $92.5 million BTC short, was flushed on HTX. BTC alone saw $291 million in forced closures, with futures tracking ether (ETH) and XRP (XRP) following at $68 million and $17 million, respectively. XLM (XLM) and pepecoin (PEPE) also posted elevated activity, signaling that the squeeze extended deep beyond major tokens. Meanwhile, dogecoin (DOGE), Solana's SOL (SOL), and SUI (SUI) saw rising open interest, though with relatively smaller drawdowns, indicative of higher spot-based demand. Liquidations occur when traders using leverage are forced to close their positions due to margin calls. While they often signal excessive positioning, they also serve as a reset mechanism for markets, flushing weak hands and clearing the way for new directional flow.
