The flagship coin has since opened the third week of July in a robust bullish momentum, especially after hitting its all-time high (ATH) of about $122,838 on Monday, during the early European trading session. The Bitcoin pump into the price discovery phase is heavily bolstered by the high demand in the spot market amid record peaks in futures and derivatives trading. According to market data from Coinglass, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) surged to a new ATH of $85 billion amid heavy liquidation of short traders. Vanguard Joins the Bitcoin Wagon For the past years, Vanguard Group Inc., has given pessimistic views on Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. The Pennsylvania-based asset manager, with around $10 trillion in assets under management, referred to Bitcoin as inappropriate for long-term investors. However, recent U.S. SEC filings show a different picture. The Vanguard Group owns more than 20 million shares, nearly 8 percent of Strategy Inc., a top-holder of Bitcoin with 601,550 coins at the time of this writing. Remarkably, Vanguard has possibly surpassed Capital Group as the top investor of Strategy. What’s Next for BTC Price? As Coinpedia has pointed out , BTC price is now in the euphoric phase of the 2024/2025 crypto bull market catalyzed by the rising demand from institutional investors and clear regulatory frameworks. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC ’s bullish sentiment is bolstered by the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) that recently surged above the 70 level for the first time year to date. Additionally, the weekly MACD indicator shows an increasing bullish histogram with the MACD line above the zero line. In the 2-hour timeframe, the bullish sentiment is visible through higher highs and higher lows, an established characteristic of a rising trend. As a result, it is safe to say that a rally towards $150k is much more likely to happen than a drop below $100k in the near term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/10t-asset-manager-vanguard-goes-hard-into-bitcoin-what-next-on-btc-price/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:45:16,"Anti-Bitcoin Vanguard Might Be the Largest Institutional Holder of MSTR Stock","Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to bitcoin ETFs, has emerged as the largest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), a company whose business model is built around buying and holding bitcoin. According to Bloomberg, Vanguard now owns more than 20 million shares of MSTR — over 8% of the company — surpassing Capital Group as the top institutional holder. The stake is worth about $9.26 billion. ""God has a sense of humor,"" said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who has also written The Bolge Effect. ""Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally."" ""Institutional dementia,"" said a somewhat less diplomatic Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck. “Indexing into $9 billion of what you openly mock isn't strategy,” he wrote in a post on X. Vanguard's exposure comes from passively managed index funds, not a deliberate bet on bitcoin or Strategy’s strategy. MSTR is included in several of Vanguard’s funds, such as the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX), the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund (VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG). These funds mirror the composition of broad stock indices and automatically include companies like Strategy when they meet certain criteria. Strategy, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has converted itself into a bitcoin holding vehicle, acquiring more than 600,000 BTC worth now about $72 billion since 2020. The company’s shares have become a proxy for bitcoin exposure, especially in the years before the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Still, Vanguard remains opposed to the asset class. The firm has refused to offer clients access to bitcoin ETFs, even as competitors like BlackRock launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF to manage over $80 billion in assets. Even the arrival of supposedly crypto-friendly CEO Salim Ramji in May last year hasn't shifted the firm’s position. “I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” Ramji said after his appointment.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/14/vanguard-accidentally-becomes-largest-holder-of-strategy-stock-despite-anti-bitcoin-stance,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH","Finance|Vanguard|Strategy|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:41:28,"$1,000,000,000,000 in T-Bills About To Flood Money Markets As Treasury Looks To Replenish Cash Balance: Report","Money market funds are reportedly gearing up for a big wave of new Treasuries to hit the market as the US government looks to stock up on cash. Over a trillion dollars worth of T-bills are expected to be issued in the next one to one and a half years as the Treasury positions itself to address a massive fiscal deficit, Reuters reports . On the demand side, money market funds reached a record $7.4 trillion in assets last month as investors looked to lock in higher returns before a potential rate cut from the Federal Reserve later this year or next year. As Deborah Cunningham, CIO for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes told Bloomberg, “Five-percent-plus rates were nirvana, four-percent-plus is still very good — and if we dip down into the high threes, that’s quite acceptable as well.” According to Reuters, J.P. Morgan Chase, Barclays, and TD Securities have estimated new issuance of T-bills to hit somewhere between $900 billion and $1.6 trillion over the next 18 months, a jump in forecast after the recent debt ceiling resolution. However, in a new CNBC Television interview, ex-Bridgewater Associates chief investment strategist Rebecca Patterson warned that the market for US debt will soon hit a rough spot. “I think there are three main things driving the dollar [devaluation]. One is slightly lower frontend rates, interest rates over this period because currencies trade on rate differentials. But I think more importantly and what’s different this time is that you’re seeing both re-allocation out of the US both by Americans diversifying and foreigners pulling back slightly. And then third and really importantly is hedging. So let’s say I’m a large overseas pension fund, and I have a tech equity exposure, and I want to keep it because I believe in the structural story, but I’m nervous about the dollar, I’m nervous about the Fed’s independence, I can hedge out that currency risk. So even if money stays in US equities, which helps explain where we are today, you can still see that dollar weakness.” Susan Hill, senior portfolio manager and head of the government liquidity group at Federated Hermes, said that while the expected T-bill issuance appears large, the firm welcomes it and “feel that we will have no trouble accommodating it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-14T18:40:49,"Sequans Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold Move Towards Digital Gold","BitcoinWorld Sequans Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold Move Towards Digital Gold The world of finance is constantly evolving, and at its forefront, we’re witnessing a fascinating trend: publicly traded companies embracing digital assets. This isn’t just about a few tech giants anymore; it’s a growing movement. Recently, Nasdaq-listed Sequans Communications made headlines with a significant Sequans Bitcoin acquisition, further solidifying its position in the crypto space. This bold move signals a deeper commitment to integrating digital assets into traditional corporate balance sheets, raising questions about the future of corporate finance. Why Are More Companies Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption ? In a landscape marked by economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets for value preservation and growth. Sequans Communications, a leader in 5G and IoT chipsets, recently announced the acquisition of an additional 683 BTC, bringing its total Bitcoin Holdings to an impressive 1,053 BTC. This substantial accumulation, initially reported by @btcNLNico on X, follows a strategic funding round where Sequans raised $384 million through the issuance of common stock and convertible bonds specifically to finance its Bitcoin investments. This isn’t an isolated incident. The motivations behind such Corporate Bitcoin Adoption are multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Store of Value: Often referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin offers a decentralized and censorship-resistant store of value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury assets, potentially enhancing returns. Strategic Positioning: Investing in Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and appeal to a new generation of investors. What Drives This Strategic BTC Investment ? Sequans’ decision to significantly increase its BTC Investment highlights a calculated strategic outlook. Unlike companies that might dabble in crypto with a small portion of their treasury, Sequans actively raised capital specifically for this purpose. This suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a strategic asset. For many corporations, the primary driver for a substantial BTC Investment stems from the desire to protect purchasing power and potentially generate non-operational income. As traditional interest rates remain low and quantitative easing continues globally, the yield on conventional cash reserves can be eroded by inflation. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, offers the potential for significant appreciation over time, making it an appealing alternative for companies seeking to optimize their treasury management. Consider the following aspects of a strategic BTC Investment : Long-Term Vision: Companies like Sequans are likely viewing Bitcoin as a multi-year asset, focusing on its potential for future growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Investor Confidence: For some investors, a company’s willingness to embrace innovative treasury strategies, including Bitcoin, can be a sign of robust and adaptable leadership. Market Leadership: Being an early or significant adopter of Bitcoin can position a company as a leader in digital innovation within its industry. Is Every Nasdaq Company Bitcoin Ready? While the trend of Nasdaq Company Bitcoin adoption is gaining traction, it’s not without its challenges and considerations. Not every company is prepared or willing to take on the risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin. Regulatory uncertainties, accounting complexities, and the need for robust security infrastructure are significant hurdles. However, Sequans is not alone. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a successful model for integrating substantial Bitcoin Holdings into a corporate structure. Other notable examples include Tesla, which briefly held significant Bitcoin before divesting a portion, and Block (formerly Square), which continues to be a strong proponent of Bitcoin. The key differences often lie in: Risk Appetite: Some companies are more comfortable with volatility than others. Shareholder Comfort: The reaction of shareholders can significantly influence a company’s treasury strategy. Operational Readiness: The ability to securely acquire, store, and manage significant Bitcoin Holdings requires specialized expertise and systems. Sequans’ decision to raise dedicated funds for its Nasdaq Company Bitcoin strategy suggests a methodical and well-planned approach, rather than simply allocating existing cash reserves. This level of commitment sets them apart and could serve as a blueprint for other companies contemplating similar moves. What Does This Mean for Your Bitcoin Holdings ? The increasing trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption by companies like Sequans has significant implications for individual investors and the broader crypto market. When a Nasdaq-listed company makes a substantial BTC Investment , it lends credibility and legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. This institutional validation can attract more traditional investors and further integrate Bitcoin into the global financial system. For those with existing Bitcoin Holdings , this trend can be viewed positively as it indicates growing demand and a maturing market. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond speculative retail interest and becoming a recognized component of sophisticated treasury management strategies. However, it’s also important to consider the potential for increased market sensitivity to corporate announcements and macroeconomic factors. Here are some actionable insights: Observe Institutional Trends: Keep an eye on other public companies and their stance on digital assets. Their moves can often signal broader market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: Corporate adoption often reinforces a long-term, HODL (Hold On for Dear Life) mentality, focusing on Bitcoin’s potential over years, not days. Diversification: While corporate interest is bullish, remember the importance of diversifying your own portfolio and not putting all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed: Understand the drivers behind corporate investments and the potential impact on market dynamics. The Future of Corporate Treasuries: A Digital Horizon Sequans Communications’ latest Sequans Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving nature of corporate finance. By actively raising capital to fund its BTC Investment and expanding its Bitcoin Holdings , Sequans joins a growing cohort of forward-thinking companies that recognize the strategic value of digital assets. This trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption by a Nasdaq Company Bitcoin is likely to continue, prompting more discussions in boardrooms worldwide about the merits of integrating cryptocurrencies into treasury strategies. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, we can expect to see further innovation in how companies manage their capital and engage with the decentralized economy, potentially ushering in a new era of corporate financial management.

OKX, a crypto exchange, directly partnered with payments behemoth PayPal on July 14 to enable users across the European Economic Area (EEA) to fund accounts and buy cryptocurrency using PayPal balances, linked bank accounts, or cards. The switch streamlines the on-ramp process by eliminating manual transfers and reducing friction, making PayPal a one-click gateway to digital assets for European consumers numbering in the millions. Sealing Trust Gaps with Trusty Financial Tools Europe’s a top-ranked cryptocurrency market in the world, representing 17.6% of worldwide transaction volume, yet adoption has too frequently lagged behind due to usability and trust issues. OKX’s partnership with PayPal now solves these problems instantly. PayPal, which is utilized by more than 100 million Europeans, provides immediate brand recognition and trust—two things most crypto exchanges do not possess. For new customers, the ability to fund crypto wallets through a familiar and secure interface eliminates significant psychological hurdles. “Having the capability to integrate with PayPal is a major stepping stone in our mission to bring crypto to the masses,” OKX Europe CEO Erald Ghoos added. “PayPal is a household name throughout Europe and globally, and integrating their secure payment solutions helps us deliver an easily integrated experience that adjusts to the evolving needs of users.” Seamless, Compliant, and Ready for the Market The connection extends to nearly 30 EEA countries and is done in accordance with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation—a fast-emerging driver of exchange legitimacy on the continent. Once linked, PayPal accounts may be used directly within OKX without re-authentication or further setup, lowering barriers to entry and yet another sign that OKX is aligned with nascent European standards. Beyond the Buy Button: Keeping New Users While this alliance makes purchasing crypto easier than ever, OKX’s true test will be retention. An on-ramp for new users made easier may get them to come, but sustained commitment will depend on if the platform can offer value beyond buying. In order to truly derive value from this alliance, OKX will need to convert PayPal-funded purchases into repeat use, offering education, portfolio capabilities, and value-added functions worth repeat use. As the European crypto market matures, exchanges that will survive will be ones that not only open the door—but also entice users to return.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/okx-and-paypal-partner-to-simplify-crypto-buying/,"MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|FIAT","Bitcoin|Regulation|Web3",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:40:00,"Crypto Week in US Congress: What to Expect From the Biggest Push Yet","Key Takeaways: House Republicans are advancing three major crypto bills this week, including one on stablecoins. The GENIUS Act may pass quickly, but the broader CLARITY Act faces resistance from House Democrats. Lawmakers opposing the package cite concerns over governance and potential conflicts tied to Trump-affiliated crypto interests. Congressional Republicans are preparing for “Crypto Week,” in what may be their most consequential push yet on digital asset legislation, according to a July 14 report by Politico. The House is set to vote this week on three separate bills addressing stablecoins with the GENIUS Act, crypto market structure with the CLARITY Act, and a potential ban on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act. Crypto Week Kicks Off with Tornado Cash Trial Crypto week is scheduled to start today with the U.S. v Roman Storm case that puts the founder of Tornado Cash on trial for money laundering. The next immediate step is the likely passage of the GENIUS Act , a Senate-originated bill focused on regulating stablecoins. Bitcoin Economic Calendar for the week of July 14th (""Crypto Week""): Monday: Start of the Tornado Cash Trial, U.S. House of Representatives meetings to review the ""Anti-CBDC Surveillance State"" Act, the ""Digital Asset Market Clarity"" Act of 2025, and the ""GENIUS"" Act Tuesday:… pic.twitter.com/SARipkbi80 — Ledn (@hodlwithLedn) July 13, 2025 House Republicans have indicated they will advance the Senate version without amendments to expedite its arrival at President Trump’s desk. This would mark the first major crypto legislation to clear both chambers of Congress. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, authored by Financial Services Chair French Hill, is also scheduled for a vote. Unlike the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY bill faces more uncertainty. GOP lawmakers are seeking bipartisan support to demonstrate viability in the Senate, where 60 votes are required. Last year, 71 Democrats supported a similar proposal. That number may shrink due to opposition tied to the Trump administration’s crypto involvement. House Democrats, including Maxine Waters, are expected to resist Hill’s bill unless additional governance provisions are added. “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” is the label some are using to push back against what they view as conflicts involving Trump-linked crypto ventures. Major Votes on Crypto Regulation Meanwhile, a third proposal seeks to prohibit a U.S. central bank digital currency. It is unlikely to advance in the Senate, according to lawmakers familiar with the process. Rep. Warren Davidson, a Republican who generally supports crypto policy, posted on X that he will vote against the GENIUS Act, calling the strategy to separate the bills “designed to ultimately fail.” “[The bills] will protect investors, consumers, and make America, as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation,” Hill said. The House Rules Committee meets today to set the voting schedule. Decisions this week will help determine whether the current legislative environment delivers long-standing industry priorities or stalls again due to political divisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What’s at stake beyond legislation? If passed, these bills could redefine the U.S. regulatory approach to crypto for years, influencing how stablecoins are issued, which agencies oversee tokens, and whether digital dollars are allowed to exist. How does this impact existing crypto firms? If the bills advance, exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and custodians may face streamlined federal compliance obligations, replacing the current patchwork of state-level requirements. Could this affect CBDC plans in other countries? If the U.S. formally rejects a CBDC through legislation, it could create divergence from international monetary authorities exploring central bank digital currencies.

2025-07-14T18:31:52,"Metaplanet’s Bold Investment: Unlocking New Frontiers with SGA’s $25M Rights Offering","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet’s Bold Investment: Unlocking New Frontiers with SGA’s $25M Rights Offering In a significant move poised to bridge the gap between traditional technology infrastructure and the burgeoning world of digital assets, Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company, has made a bold statement. Its CEO, Simon Gerovich, is spearheading a strategic Metaplanet Investment in South Korean system software developer SGA. This infusion of capital, part of a substantial rights offering, signals a growing trend of crypto-aligned entities extending their influence into diverse tech sectors, creating new avenues for growth and innovation. What Does the SGA Rights Offering Entail? South Korean system software developer SGA has announced a substantial SGA Rights Offering , making headlines across the tech and investment communities. This financial maneuver involves the issuance of over 58 million common shares, aiming to raise a total of 34.5 billion won, equivalent to approximately $25 million. A rights offering is a method companies use to raise capital by offering existing shareholders the right to purchase new shares, typically at a discount, proportional to their current holdings. In this instance, it’s a strategic move for SGA to secure significant funding for its future endeavors. The backing for this offering comes from a powerful consortium of investors: Simon Gerovich: The CEO of Metaplanet, bringing a strong strategic vision and financial backing from the Japanese firm. Sora Ventures: A prominent crypto-backed venture capital firm, indicating a clear alignment with the digital asset space. KCGI: A Japanese college, suggesting an interest in fostering technological development and potentially future talent pipelines. Asia Strategy Partners: An investment firm that, following the issuance, is set to become SGA’s largest shareholder, underscoring their long-term commitment to the company’s growth. This diverse group of investors highlights the multifaceted nature of modern capital raises, blending traditional investment firms with crypto-native entities and educational institutions. For SGA, a systems integrator, this capital injection could be transformative, enabling expansion, research and development, and perhaps even deeper integration of blockchain or AI technologies into its core offerings. Simon Gerovich’s Vision: Bridging Traditional Tech and Crypto? The involvement of Simon Gerovich , CEO of Metaplanet, is particularly noteworthy. Metaplanet has recently garnered attention for its strategic pivot towards Bitcoin and digital assets, positioning itself as a significant player in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency in Japan. Gerovich’s decision to back SGA’s rights offering suggests a broader vision that extends beyond direct crypto holdings. It implies a strategy to invest in foundational technology companies that can either benefit from the crypto ecosystem or serve as key infrastructure for future digital advancements. Why would a CEO deeply involved in Bitcoin adoption invest in a systems integrator? The answer likely lies in the critical role systems integrators play in connecting disparate software, hardware, and network components into a cohesive, functional system. As the world increasingly moves towards digital transformation, and as blockchain technology seeks broader enterprise adoption, companies like SGA become indispensable. They are the architects who build the bridges between legacy systems and emerging technologies, potentially including decentralized applications (dApps) or blockchain-based solutions. Gerovich’s investment could be a proactive step to ensure Metaplanet has a stake in the companies building the foundational layers of the next digital economy. The Role of Sora Ventures and Crypto Venture Capital in Mainstream Tech The participation of Sora Ventures , a crypto-backed venture capital firm, further solidifies the narrative of convergence between the crypto world and traditional tech. Crypto venture capital firms are increasingly looking beyond pure-play blockchain startups, identifying opportunities in established sectors where their unique insights and capital can drive innovation. Their investment in SGA is a prime example of this trend. What does a crypto VC bring to a systems integrator? Beyond just capital, Sora Ventures likely offers: Blockchain Expertise: Guidance on integrating blockchain solutions into SGA’s existing systems or developing new, blockchain-enabled services. Network Access: Connections within the broader Web3 and crypto ecosystem, opening doors for partnerships and new business opportunities. Future-Proofing: Helping SGA anticipate and adapt to the evolving digital landscape, ensuring its services remain relevant in an increasingly decentralized world. This investment underscores a growing confidence among crypto investors in the potential for blockchain technology to permeate and enhance traditional industries, moving beyond speculative assets to real-world applications and infrastructure. Strategic Implications for South Korean Tech and Beyond This multi-party investment has significant implications for the South Korean Tech landscape. South Korea is a global leader in technology, known for its innovation in areas like semiconductors, telecommunications, and software. An investment of this magnitude, particularly with international and crypto-backed participation, signals continued dynamism and attractiveness for foreign capital. For SGA, becoming a key player in this strategic alliance could mean: Accelerated Growth: The $25 million capital injection provides immediate resources for expansion, talent acquisition, and technological upgrades. Market Diversification: With the backing of Metaplanet and Sora Ventures, SGA might explore new markets or service offerings, particularly those related to blockchain and digital assets. Enhanced Credibility: Partnerships with reputable international firms like Metaplanet and specialized VCs like Sora Ventures can boost SGA’s reputation and attract further business. This deal also serves as a compelling example of cross-border collaboration in the tech sector, demonstrating how Japanese and South Korean entities, alongside global crypto capital, can unite to foster innovation. It sets a precedent for how traditional tech companies might increasingly look to the crypto space not just for funding, but for strategic partnerships that can unlock new growth vectors and competitive advantages. The Future is Integrated: A Compelling Outlook The investment by Simon Gerovich and Metaplanet, alongside Sora Ventures, KCGI, and Asia Strategy Partners, into SGA’s rights offering is more than just a financial transaction. It represents a strategic convergence of traditional tech infrastructure with the innovative spirit and capital of the crypto world. It highlights a future where digital assets are not merely speculative instruments but integral components of global investment strategies, funding the development of core technologies that power our digital lives. As Asia Strategy Partners assumes the role of SGA’s largest shareholder, the long-term vision for the South Korean systems integrator appears robust and ambitious. This partnership could well serve as a blueprint for future collaborations, showcasing how diverse investors can come together to propel technological advancements, particularly at the intersection of established industries and emerging digital frontiers. The stage is set for SGA to leverage this significant capital injection and strategic backing to innovate and expand its footprint in the ever-evolving global tech landscape.

The milestone points to the growing interest in Bitcoin ( BTC ) on Wall Street, with ETFs serving as a key gateway for institutions to gain exposure to the asset. Notably, the success of IBIT has helped fuel Bitcoin’s ongoing bull run, which recently culminated in a record high above $123,000. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $120,133, up over 1% in the past 24 hours. Since its launch in early 2024, IBIT has delivered returns of around 300% for investors, with demand surging amid Bitcoin’s rally, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

2025-07-14T18:26:52,"Bitcoin at $123K Makes Satoshi the 11th Richest Person – Will This Layer-2 Build the Next Round of BTC Wealth?","Bitcoin (BTC) has finally done it. After hovering just below its all-time high for weeks, it’s now shattered $123,000, setting a new record and making the legendary creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the 11th richest person in the world. But for anyone today to match that kind of stake in BTC, they’d need over $135 billion in capital. Realistically, only a handful of names like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos could actually pull it off. But what if there’s another path? One that doesn’t require billions – just vision, timing, and early conviction. That’s the case Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is making. As the first Layer-2 to combine Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana’s sub-second execution, the project aims to unlock programmability and performance, something earlier Bitcoin scaling attempts like Stacks and Rootstock struggled to achieve. Investors who see Bitcoin Hyper as a generational wealth opportunity – much like early Bitcoin itself – have already pushed it past $2.7 million in early-stage funding, with the $3 million milestone likely just hours away. The current presale price is $0.01225 per HYPER , but that will increase in six hours. With Bitcoin moving into uncharted territory, the chance to back its most promising high-speed Layer-2 at its current low price is slipping away just as fast. As BTC Reaches a New ATH, Eyes Turn to What Comes After For most of the past 30 days, Bitcoin had hovered below $110,000. But on July 10, it broke past its all-time high from May and kept climbing, surging over the weekend and peaking at $122,838 by Monday. The rally was driven by renewed regulatory optimism as the U.S. House launched “Crypto Week,” spotlighting bills like the Genius Act aimed at giving digital assets firmer legal ground. Next week, the House will deliver on @POTUS ' call to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. pic.twitter.com/T7lRm2Ux05 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) July 10, 2025 That boost in confidence, combined with institutional FOMO and over $1 billion in short liquidations, sent prices sharply higher. Once BTC breached the $118,000 zone, the melt-up was already underway. Now with Bitcoin at record highs, many market watchers believe attention could rotate to altcoins next – and then flow into newer, high-upside projects as Q3 progresses. As mentioned, Bitcoin Hyper is one of the standout new projects attracting early capital – especially now that the base-layer network it’s built on, Bitcoin, is pushing its native asset to unprecedented price levels. The reason? Many view Bitcoin Hyper as the catalyst that could transform Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a dynamic, utility-rich ecosystem. By making BTC programmable, scalable, and fast, it turns a traditionally static asset into something that can power the future of Web3. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Static BTC Into a Functional Force Suppose Bitcoin has already put Satoshi Nakamoto in the same wealth league as Musk and Bezos while being treated primarily as a static asset. What would be its potential if BTC could actively power high-performance dApps within an ecosystem that combines the industry’s fastest throughput and the most secure base layer? Bitcoin Hyper makes that possible by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for near-instant execution while remaining anchored to the Bitcoin network through a decentralized, non-custodial bridge. BTC is locked on the base layer, and a wrapped version is minted on Bitcoin Hyper for use across its ecosystem. Zero-knowledge proofs and native Bitcoin finality ensure trustless execution with no compromise to security. When users want to exit, they simply burn the wrapped BTC, and the bridge releases the original coins back on-chain. This setup temporarily reduces BTC’s active supply while increasing its functional utility – and it positions HYPER, the token that fuels this ecosystem, as a key beneficiary of growing adoption. What If Bitcoin Hyper Becomes Bitcoin’s Breakout Layer? Bitcoin proved that value can be stored on-chain. But what if the next leap is showing what that value can do? That’s the core of Bitcoin Hyper’s vision – unlocking a version of BTC that moves at real speed. Tradable, stakeable, usable. It expands Bitcoin’s role from a passive store of value into a functional layer for next-gen Web3 applications. And if Bitcoin Hyper lists towards the end of Q3, just as crypto enters its historically strongest season, and adoption clicks into place, who knows what its upside would be. For context, early belief in Bitcoin rewrote wealth trajectories. If Bitcoin Hyper delivers on its potential, early participants could find themselves at the center of a major shift in how BTC is used. How to be a HYPER Holder The next asset that could get the Bitcoin treatment is Bitcoin Hyper and if you want to be part of it, you can scoop up its native token HYPER during the presale to lock in the lowest price possible. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper website . You can purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL or even a credit card. Bitcoin Hyper’s integration with Solana (via the SVM) not only unlocks lightning-fast speed for the Bitcoin network – it also makes SOL one of the accepted currencies in the presale. Bringing Bitcoin into the Web3 era calls for a wallet built for Web3, and that’s Best Wallet . HYPER is already featured in the Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to track, manage, and claim. It also highlights the project as one recognized for its high potential by one of crypto’s most forward-looking platforms.

2025-07-14T18:16:18,"Top 3 Altcoins Ready to Explode After Bitcoin's Historic $120K Breakthrough","Bitcoin's recent surge to $120K has stirred the cryptocurrency market. As attention gravitates towards this monumental milestone, several altcoins are poised for a significant upswing. This article uncovers three promising digital currencies that are set to soar, inviting readers to explore these potential high-performers amidst the crypto frenzy. Ethereum Price Dynamics: Bullish Week, Mixed 6M Trends ETH prices over the last month show an 18.01% gain with a strong one-week advance of 18.40%. The six-month view reveals a -5.63% dip that points to earlier downward pressure and market corrections. The monthly rise signals a rebound from previous lows while the half-year performance highlights volatility often seen in Ethereum’s trading history. Indicators in this period have been mixed, reflecting both sharp recoveries and significant pullbacks. Current charts display price action bouncing between a support level near $1,735 and resistance around $3,254, with deeper caution signaled by a second support at $975 and a second resistance at $4,013. With the Relative Strength Index at 73.83, momentum at 535.70, and an Awesome Oscillator reading of 384.464, price action shows bulls pushing upward but facing clear barriers. Traders should monitor these zones closely; aggressive buyers might step in near lower support, while those holding profits could look to offload when encountering resistance. The lack of a distinct trend makes careful position management important, blending range-bound plays with breakout strategies for any bullish shift in sentiment. SOL Price Surge Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends SOL shows a sharp one-week gain of 10.23% and a solid monthly rise of 12.67% against a challenging six-month decline of 10.74%. This pattern reveals a strong short-term rebound that stands in contrast to a broader period of correction. Price movements have been volatile lately, with recent positive performance suggesting that traders are pushing the coin higher despite pressures from earlier market drops. Short-term gains capture renewed trader interest even while the six-month view paints a picture of lingering weakness. Current prices lie between $131 and $173.35, with immediate resistance at $191.79 and support found near $107.89; further out, a second resistance comes in at $233.74 and a second support at $65.94. Bulls appear to be taking a lead in the recent upswing, supported by significant weekly and monthly improvements. Lack of a clear long-term trend warrants caution. Traders might consider entering positions as the price nears lower bounds around the support levels, aiming for gains if the coin successfully tests resistance near $191.79. A break above this level could open the door to higher targets, while failure to sustain near support levels might invite selling pressure. The oscillators and momentum readings support a short-term boost while longer-term moves remain uneven. Cardano Market Insight: Recent Gains Versus Six-Month Correction Cardano showed short-term strength recently, rising about 30.15% over the last week and gaining another 19% in the past month. However, the coin lost approximately 23.45% of its value over the previous six months, revealing a stark contrast between the recent surge and ongoing long-term downturns. The price fluctuations indicate significant volatility; traders have had opportunities to adjust their entry and exit points amidst the mixed market conditions. Cardano currently trades within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, with this area becoming a battleground for bulls and bears. The nearest resistance sits at $0.83, followed by a second at $1.05. Support is found at $0.38, with stronger backing near $0.163. An RSI of 74.341 suggests overbought conditions, while moving averages provide mixed insights. Although bulls are driving short-term momentum, the prevailing long-term decline urges caution. Traders might explore breakout opportunities at the $0.83 resistance while maintaining stop-losses near support, as no clear uptrend signals further movement. Conclusion ETH , SOL , and ADA show strong potential following Bitcoin's impressive rise to $120K. ETH is gaining traction with its updates enhancing efficiency. SOL is attracting attention due to rapid growth and innovative projects. ADA stands out with its unique approach to solving current market challenges. These altcoins are poised for significant gains as investor interest peaks. This positions them as key players in the evolving market.

2025-07-14T18:10:41,"Crypto Markets Bifurcate With Institutions Focusing on BTC and ETH While Retail Chases Alts: Wintermute","The crypto market is splitting in two. Institutional and retail investors are taking increasingly different paths, with institutional players anchoring themselves in bitcoin BTC and Ethereum's ether ETH while retail investors pour into altcoins and memecoins, according to a mid-year report from crypto trading firm Wintermute. Analyzing over-the-counter spot trading volumes, institutional trading volumes with the two largest tokens held steady at 67%, likely backed by ETF inflows and structured accumulation vehicles, the report said. Meanwhile, retail investors dropped their BTC and ETH exposure from 46% to 37%, shifting capital toward newer, more speculative tokens. ""This divergence isn’t a temporary thing; It’s the sign that we are experiencing a more mature, sophisticated and specialized crypto market,"" said Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO and founder of Wintermute. ""Investors are no longer chasing the same trend,"" he added. ""Institutions are treating crypto as a macro asset, while retail traders continue to gravitate to innovation."" Overall, traditional finance (TradFi) firms were the fastest-growing cohort in OTC trading volumes, growing 32% year-over-year. That growth was being fueled by regulatory developments like the U.S. GENIUS Act and the EU’s ongoing MiCA rollout, which have given larger firms more confidence to participate, the report said. Retail brokers also saw strong activity, with a 21% rise in volume over the same period. Meanwhile, crypto-native firms dialed back, down 5%. OTC options volume jumped 412% compared to the first half of 2024, as institutions embraced derivatives for hedging and yield generation, the report noted. Meanwhile, Contracts for Difference (CFDs) doubled in variety, offering access to less liquid tokens in a more capital-efficient way. Wintermute said its own OTC desk saw spot trading volumes grow at more than twice the pace of centralized exchanges, signaling a shift toward more discreet, large-volume trading favored by traditional finance. The firm noted that memecoin activity has become more fragmented. While overall retail trading in memecoins declined, the number of tokens traded by individual users doubled, signaling a broadening appetite for micro-cap assets in the long tail of the market. With that, legacy names like dogecoin DOGE and shiba inu SHIB lost ground to a growing list of niche tokens such as bonk BONK, dogwifhat WIF and popcat POPCAT, the report noted. Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, Wintermute analysts said to keep an eye on spot dogecoin ETF filings with spot with a final regulatory decision expected by October. ""The outcome could significantly impact the retail market and set a precedent for other alternative assets,"" the report said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/14/crypto-markets-bifurcate-with-institutions-focusing-on-btc-and-eth-while-retail-chases-alts-wintermute,"MARKET|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS","Markets|Wintermute|Bitcoin|Market|Institutions|Memecoin|Altcoins|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:10:05,"K33’s Bold Move: Bitcoin Holdings Soar to 121 BTC","BitcoinWorld K33’s Bold Move: Bitcoin Holdings Soar to 121 BTC In a significant move that underscores the growing confidence in digital assets, Norwegian crypto brokerage and research firm K33 has substantially increased its Bitcoin holdings , cementing its position as a key institutional player in the cryptocurrency space. This latest accumulation highlights a powerful trend: the increasing institutional embrace of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class. What’s Driving K33’s Bold Bitcoin Holdings Growth? K33, a well-regarded entity in the Nordic crypto landscape, recently announced a significant addition to its digital asset portfolio. The firm added a substantial 36 BTC to its existing stash, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 121 BTC. This isn’t just a casual purchase; it reflects a calculated and strategic decision by the firm. According to information shared by @btcNLNico on X, this latest acquisition was made at an average price of approximately 1,119,121 Norwegian kroner, which translates to roughly $116,456 per Bitcoin at the time of the transaction. This expansion of K33’s Bitcoin treasury wasn’t a spontaneous act. The firm had previously raised a considerable $19.2 million through a stock offering, specifically earmarking these funds for Bitcoin investments. This proactive fundraising demonstrates a clear intent and a long-term vision for their K33 Bitcoin strategy. It signals that the firm views Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a core component of a modern investment portfolio, worthy of dedicated capital allocation. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Investments Surging? K33’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin is not an isolated incident. Across the globe, we are witnessing a growing wave of institutional Bitcoin adoption. What’s behind this surge of interest from traditional financial players and corporate treasuries? Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital alternative to gold, offering a potential hedge against currency debasement due to its fixed supply. Portfolio Diversification: For many institutions, adding Bitcoin provides diversification benefits. Its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can help reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth. Institutions are looking beyond short-term price fluctuations to capture the potential upside of this nascent asset class. Improved Infrastructure and Regulation: The development of robust custodial solutions, regulated Bitcoin ETFs, and clearer regulatory frameworks has made it safer and more feasible for institutions to engage with crypto. The commitment of firms like K33 to increasing their crypto investment showcases a broader shift in perception. What was once considered a niche or speculative asset is now moving into the mainstream, driven by a deeper understanding of its underlying technology and economic principles. Crafting a Robust Digital Asset Strategy: Lessons from K33 K33’s approach offers valuable insights into how institutions are building a sustainable digital asset strategy . Their method of raising dedicated capital for Bitcoin investments, coupled with their role as a research firm, suggests a meticulous and informed decision-making process. This isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it thoughtfully into a broader financial framework. For any entity considering venturing into the crypto space, K33’s actions highlight several key considerations: Dedicated Funding: Allocate specific capital that is prepared for the volatility inherent in digital assets. Research and Due Diligence: Understand the asset, its market dynamics, and potential risks thoroughly. K33, as a research firm, naturally excels here. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional success in crypto often comes from a long-term holding strategy, rather than short-term trading. Risk Management: Implement robust security measures and understand the regulatory landscape. The firm’s decision to expand its Bitcoin holdings serves as a strong signal to the market, particularly for other institutional players who might be on the fence. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is not just here to stay, but is increasingly becoming an indispensable part of forward-thinking investment strategies. K33’s latest move to boost its Bitcoin holdings to 121 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic asset. By actively investing and raising capital specifically for crypto, K33 is not only enhancing its own portfolio but also setting a precedent for other firms considering a deeper dive into the digital asset space. This trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption is a powerful indicator of Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial landscape, solidifying its position as a key component of a diversified and future-proof investment strategy.

2025-07-14T18:05:20,"Bitcoin and Crypto Markets Explode to New Highs As Avalanche of Treasury Companies Double Down on Digital Assets","Bitcoin ( BTC ) is leading crypto markets to uncharted territory as four crypto treasury companies announce the acquisition of even more digital assets. In a series of press releases on Monday, Strategy , BitMine Immersion , Sequans , Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Metaplanet all announced that they are increasing the amount of crypto in their respective treasuries. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, perhaps the most well-known of the crypto treasuries, added 4,225 BTC ($504,242,765), bringing the firm’s total holdings to 601,550 BTC ($71,793,428,470). Japanese Bitcoin hoarder MetaPlanet also added $93 million worth of BTC, according to its CEO Simon Gerovich. Sequans, a French communications company and provider of Internet of Things (IoT) semiconductors, announced the purchase of 683 BTC ($81,514,274), bringing its total to 1053 BTC ($125,672,812). But not all the treasuries are focused solely on BTC. BitMine Immersion announced that its newest Ethereum ( ETH ) purchase brought the firm’s total ETH holdings to about $500 million. Says Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, “We are pleased that we added significantly to our ETH treasury just 3 days after closing our private placement. Clearly, Wall Street is getting ‘ETH-pilled.'” And Sonnet BioTherapeutics, a New Jersey-based medical firm, announced the launch of a nearly $900 million Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) Crypto Treasury Reserve Strategy. Hyperliquid is a decentralized finance (DeFi) and trading-focused layer-1 blockchain. Says Raghu Rao, Sonnet’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, “Following a thorough review, we believe this proposed combination with Rorschach provides us with a unique and exciting opportunity. We will be able to capitalize on the recent advancements around digital assets and equip Sonnet with funding to potentially realize the future value of our existing biotech assets. We believe this transaction and the strategic options it provides offer Sonnet and our shareholders with an innovative path forward and the potential for significant value creation.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto markets are exploding. BTC, for its part, reached a new all-time high of $122,838 earlier today. The king crypto is going for $119,523 at time of writing.

2025-07-14T18:00:21,"BLOK: Maybe The Optimal Blockchain Strategy, But Volatility May Be Too Risky For Many","Summary Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF offers concentrated exposure to blockchain and bitcoin-related companies, with top holdings like Coinbase, Robinhood, and MicroStrategy driving performance. The BLOK ETF benefits from strong liquidity and recent outperformance versus peers, but charges a relatively high fee and is not ideal for income-focused investors due to variability from period-to-period. Significant risks include high concentration in top holdings, volatility tied to bitcoin prices, and industry-specific financial reporting challenges. Given these factors, I rate BLOK as a Hold and suggest a modest 2-4% portfolio allocation for investors seeking targeted blockchain exposure. The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ) is an investment strategy designed to invest in companies that engage in blockchain technology as leading innovators and infrastructure companies, as well as digital assets inclusive of bitcoin exchange-traded products [ETPs]. BLOK is a relatively concentrated portfolio strategy, with the top 10 holdings making up 41.26% of the total portfolio weight. The ETF’s top two holdings are Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) and Robinhood Markets, Inc. ( HOOD ), two brokerage platforms that heavily engage in cryptocurrency trading and other financial services. Coinbase is in a unique position as a financial services provider given its breadth of utilization for cryptocurrency transactions. The platform engages in brokerage services as well as asset-backed lending for bitcoin-related organizations like miners and developers. Given the growing interest in bitcoin across enterprises, asset-backed lending has grown in popularity, particularly amongst the bitcoin mining firms like CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) and Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ). Coinbase and Robinhood make up 5.74% and 5.67% of the portfolio weightings, respectively. MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), now known as Strategy, is also a major component of BLOK with a weight of 4.64%. Though Strategy doesn’t necessarily partake in the direct development of bitcoin as a component of its core operations, the organization has become a notorious investor in bitcoin, acting as a “leveraged bitcoin strategy” for investors. In short, Strategy issues debt and equity to raise capital for additional bitcoin investments, providing investors with a unique vehicle for indirectly investing in the cryptocurrency. Roughly 20% of the portfolio’s weight is across bitcoin mining companies. In general, many bitcoin miners have been pivoting into data center hosting operations while simultaneously operating as bitcoin miners given that mining bitcoin has become increasingly more expensive following the bitcoin halving event in 2024. These bitcoin mining stocks are directionally correlated to the price of bitcoin, with performance generally varying based on cost efficiency in mining operations. TradingView The bitcoin mining industry may pose certain risks to financial reporting as the price of bitcoin can vary substantially quarter-to-quarter as a result of the mark-to-market reporting of digital assets on the profit/loss statements. Though diversification into other data center-related markets may provide stability for the organizations partaking, these industries are relatively crowded and specialized depending on the target market. In addition to operating companies, BLOK also invests in blockchain ETPs, providing direct exposure to the price changes of Bitcoin. This can provide a certain degree of stability when considering that many of the holdings in the portfolio depend on the price of bitcoin to operate. ETF Details BLOK commands a relatively high fee of 73bps when compared to peer portfolios being in the range of 51-68bps. Seeking Alpha Performance can be relatively volatile in the industry and may provide investors with large price swings throughout a holding period. Comparing BLOK to peer portfolio performance, BLOK has experienced substantial upside in recent months following the strong bitcoin performance. BLOK has outperformed many of its peers by a wide margin net of the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ), which has performed closely to BLOK while offering a lower fee of 51bps. Seeking Alpha By comparison, BLOK may be a more appealing trading vehicle given its liquidity. BLOK has $1.11b in assets under management with an average of 312k shares trading hands daily, valued at $18.25mm. This can be a major asset to investors and traders seeking to actively manage a position in BLOK, potentially minimizing the cost-in/cost-out risk. BLOK also pays out an annual distribution with the most recent payout rate being $2.59/share, yielding 4.43%. Investors should consider the historical payout rate as distributions can significantly vary from year-to-year due to the performance of assets. Given this variability, I wouldn’t recommend BLOK to be utilized as an income ETF. Seeking Alpha Risks Related to BLOK BLOK is an industry-specific ETF, providing investors with a substantial concentration on the bitcoin ecosystem. This may pose a major risk to investors during periods of major bitcoin declines, potentially resulting in substantial losses in the portfolio strategy. BLOK may also exhibit substantial upside during periods of bitcoin value accumulation as the value of bitcoin directly impacts many of the portfolio’s holdings. Investors must also consider the financial risks related to operating companies in the ETF wrapper. The value of digital assets is reported on the profit/loss statement with large price swings substantially impacting quarterly reports. This can potentially impact the price performance of companies held within BLOK and may be reflected in the performance of the ETF. The portfolio also displays substantial concentration risk with the top 10 holdings making up 41.26%. The strategy is heavily dependent on the performance of the top 10 holdings, adding certain risks to diversification across holdings. Final Thoughts BLOK is a blockchain-oriented ETF designed to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin and operating companies that partake in bitcoin-related businesses. The strategy provides investors and traders with substantial depth for actively managing a position in the ETF, allowing them to enter and exit positions without the limitations of thin liquidity. Given the risks involved in trading bitcoin and related operating companies, I am recommending BLOK with a Hold rating with a 2-4% target allocation.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801130-blok-maybe-the-optimal-blockchain-strategy-but-volatility-may-be-too-risky-for-many?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING","COIN|HOOD|MSTR|BTC-USD|DAPP|BLOK",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:00:09,"Tether’s Grip On Stablecoin Market At Risk As Regulated Rivals Gain Momentum – Here’s Why","Amid the current tightening global oversight and a growing appetite for transparency in the crypto world, Tether ’s position as the leading stablecoin issuer in the sector is at risk from new and rising stablecoins. Fading Dominance Of The Stablecoin Issuer SMQKE, an observer and researcher, shared a report that shows that the firm could lose its robust grip in the stablecoin sector. According to the researcher, the leading stablecoin issuer “will lose market dominance to regulated stablecoins like the RLUSD in the future.” Presently, global regulations are being made that focus on the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. One of the assets that fits nicely into these regulations is Circle’s USDC, which has won approval from the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). However, Tether’s USDT appears to be evading regulators’ demands for transparency in the way it operates its underlying assets. As a result, regulated stablecoins will continue to overtake USDT as the market leader in the future. “Only time will tell whether Tether will continue to leak market share to rivals or continue to hold sway with cryptocurrency fans,” the report stated. Stablecoins such as USDP, PYUSD, USDG, and RLUSD steadily challenge USDT’s dominance as they reflect stronger institutional alignment. This is because official regulations govern each stablecoin and have reserves that are mainly made up of liquid, high-quality assets. A Major Shift From Tether Coming Soon As the stablecoin landscape evolves, Tether, the largest stablecoin firm, continues to make steps to provide a reliable network. A recent report shows that the leading platform plans to let go of some of the top chains in the sector in the upcoming months. In a significant move, Tether, the first blockchain-enabled platform, has announced it will discontinue USDT support on five key blockchains. Such a move is meant to streamline its operations and bolster the network’s efficiency. The announcement was shared by the Phoenix Group, a crypto media on the X platform, on Sunday. According to the report, the impending disconnection is scheduled to take place in the next two months, particularly in September 2025. This strategic shift by Tether tends to phase out chains that no longer meet the changing technical or community standards of the stablecoin issuer. In addition, it reflects the firm’s increased focus on preserving liquidity and security throughout its ecosystems. The list of blockchains mentioned in the company’s report includes Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash, Kusama Network, EOS Network, and Algorand. Tether will discontinue USDT redemptions and freeze remaining tokens on these chains starting from September 1, 2025.

2025-07-14T17:59:56,"XRP Price Prediction: XRP Explodes as Volume Surpasses BTC and ETH – Can XRP Overtake Bitcoin?","XRP has outpaced its competitors as the crypto of choice among retail investors, reclaiming $3 during Monday trading as $11.8 billion volume bolsters the near-term XRP price outlook . This growing momentum suggests the recent 25% weekly gain could just be the beginning, particularly as the altcoin continues to outpace BTC and ETH in daily returns. BTC and ETH lag as the lead continues to widen, seeing just 10.5% and 19% weekly gains, respectively. The South Korean Market is Behind XRP’s $3 Move According to a July 12 X post from popular analyst Dom, a net spot market buy pressure of 45 million XRP was behind the move from $2.60 to $3.00. Notably, this inflow has been largely driven by international interest. South Korean exchange Upbit accounted for over 70% of the total volume, pointing to a strong global appetite. XRP Cumulative Volume Delta on different exchanges. Source: X, @traderview2. By contrast, market leader Binance registered negative flows, while Coinbase (11%), Kraken (9%), and Bitstamp (6%) played smaller roles in fueling the rally. Many of these traders, having missed out on Bitcoin’s early growth, have turned to altcoins like XRP. While some question the sustainability of retail-driven price movements, Dom suggests that such dynamics reflect the evolving nature of regional markets. XRP Price Analysis: Can Bitcoin Really Be Flipped? South Korean influence has propelled XRP beyond the falling wedge that’s capped its price since late February, triggering a breakout that could redefine the altcoin’s trajectory. XRP / USDT 1-week chart, falling wedge breakout. Source: TradingView, Binance. While much of the initial momentum has been realized, XRP has yet to reach its technical target at the 2.618 Fibonacci extension near $4.365—a further 46% upside. However, a rejection at $3 in line with past peaks could see a healthy correction unfold, with a potential floor at the 1 Fibonacci level at $2.66 as volatility cools. Still, momentum signals suggest this rally may still have room to run. The weekly RSI remains below the overbought threshold at 65, suggesting that buyers have yet to reach exhaustion. More so, the MACD line has also surpassed the signal line in a golden cross after over four months of bearish dominance. On the weekly timeframe, this is often an early indication of a potential long-term trend reversal. While overtaking the leading cryptocurrency is a bold target, wider market-warming narratives continue to add merit to XRP as a legitimate contender in this cycle. This week, the U.S. House is expected to vote on major crypto legislation , including the GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. the week of July 14th, 2025 will be the most historic week in crypto, ever The House of Representatives will be voting on: -The Genius Act -The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act -The Clarity Act and most importantly, ISO20022 goes live (infrastructure) The generational… pic.twitter.com/2b3blpaKzo — danny (@defiphvntom) July 10, 2025 XRP stands to benefit more than most. With its longstanding SEC lawsuit nearing resolution and a spot ETF in the cards, retail interest may soon extend to global institutional investors. If that happens, XRP could form a new floor backed by serious capital inflows, supporting its long-term growth. XRP Misses The Highest-Gaining Cycle Narratives The truth is, XRP has been in the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives. On the speculative scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins,” the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come.

The cryptocurrency has now surpassed Amazon’s $2.3 trillion valuation, silver’s $2.2 trillion, and Google’s $2.19 trillion, positioning itself just $730 million shy of tech giant Apple. Source: Companiesmarketcap This remarkable ascent comes amid massive institutional adoption, with over 265 companies now holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5th. The latest surge liquidated $1.3 billion in short positions within 60 seconds as Bitcoin skipped past $120,000 and rocketed directly to $121,000. US spot Bitcoin ETFs maintained their seven-day buying streak, amassing over $1 billion in net positive inflows on Friday alone. Corporate treasuries now hold 3.5 million Bitcoin, with 853,000 BTC representing 4% of the total supply in public company coffers. Seven-Year Trendline Break Signals Historic Acceleration Bitcoin’s technical structure reveals a monumental shift as the cryptocurrency broke above a seven-year trendline on the monthly chart, representing resistance that contained every bull market top since 2018. This breakthrough coincides with Bitcoin achieving its highest daily and weekly closes simultaneously in history. Source: Crypto Rover on X The lack of significant upper wicks during recent rallies confirms sustained buying pressure across multiple timeframes. The weekly logarithmic chart maintains Bitcoin’s adherence to a powerful exponential growth curve intact since 2023. Current price action trades within an ascending channel with projections extending toward $200,000+ by December 2025. The mathematical progression has remained consistent across multiple cycles, with successive bull markets reaching exponentially higher peaks. Bitcoin Price Discovery Mode Targets $135,000-$140,000 Immediate resistance sits at $125,000, which market momentum suggests could be reached within days based on current trajectory. Above $120,000, liquidity maps show significant air gaps between current levels and $135,000-$140,000 targets. The 2024 breakout playbook indicates similar weekly moves historically opened doors for 50% rallies. Key support clusters around $115,500-$116,500 represent potential retest zones if profit-taking emerges. This cycle’s largest correction remains only 23.48%, well below previous bull market corrections ranging from 29-40%. Any dips would be structurally clean rather than trend-breaking events. BTC Hyper: Scaling Bitcoin for the $1 Million Era As Bitcoin approaches massive valuations, potentially reaching $1 million according to various models, transaction fees and network congestion become critical bottlenecks for widespread adoption. BTC Hyper addresses these limitations through an innovative Layer-2 architecture built on the Solana Virtual Machine. It enables instant, low-cost Bitcoin transactions while unlocking DeFi capabilities previously unavailable to BTC holders. The $HYPER token presale has raised over $2.7 million, offering early investors high APY staking rewards ahead of the Q3/Q4 2025 mainnet launch. Unlike holding static Bitcoin positions, BTC Hyper enables users to bridge their BTC holdings and access yield-generating opportunities through DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. As Bitcoin potentially reaches $200,000+ targets, network fees could price out smaller transactions, making Layer-2 solutions essential for everyday Bitcoin usage. Early HYPER adopters position themselves for both Bitcoin’s continued appreciation and the infrastructure layer enabling its mainstream adoption. With major exchange listings planned post-mainnet launch, the $HYPER presale targeting $11 million mark presents an opportunity for early accumulation.

Analysts now project a potential 2x–3x upside ($8–$10) during this cycle, driven by institutional interest and ecosystem growth. Source: CoinGecko Can ETF Momentum and Technical Upgrades Fuel a Rally to $10? The project reached a major institutional milestone when Nasdaq filed a 19b-4 application to list a spot SUI ETF in partnership with 21Shares. This development firmly puts Sui among a select group of alternative digital currencies being considered for such financial products. Although the SEC has yet to approve the filing, it has already contributed to positive market sentiment and increased visibility for the project. Additionally, Sui implemented important technical upgrades in March 2025 as a major layer-1 network challenging Solana . The Sui network integrated WebAuthn-based passkeys and zkLogin to streamline user authentication. These improvements allow users to access blockchain applications using familiar web login methods, lowering barriers to entry. The upgrades support Sui’s broader goal of making blockchain technology more accessible to mainstream users while maintaining robust security standards. Source: DefiLlama The network recently achieved a new peak in Total Value Locked (TVL) at $2.201 billion, representing an 8.74% increase that indicates growing ecosystem activity. Several strategic partnerships have also strengthened Sui’s position in the market. One example is the partnership with Threshold, which brought tBTC, a decentralized Bitcoin derivative, to Sui’s ecosystem, unlocking more than $500 million in Bitcoin liquidity. Sui also partnered with BTCfi to create a solution that combines Bitcoin’s liquidity with Sui’s efficient infrastructure. BTCFi lives on Sui.

SUI/USDT experienced a slight increase, climbing from $3.40 to approach the psychological $4.00 level in one move. This upward momentum was supported by a rounded base pattern, formed last week, and is typically indicative of accumulation before a bullish reversal. However, recent price action on the 1-hour timeframe suggests the rally may be entering a cooling-off phase. SUI/USDT price chart, July 14 (Source: TradingView) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits above 82, deep in overbought territory, indicating potential exhaustion in the near term. SUI’s price movement has begun to stabilize, accompanied by a slight decrease in trading volume from its recent peak, which is quite normal; however, developments like these point toward possible consolidation or a moderate pullback, particularly as traders may look to secure profits near the $4.00 resistance level.

While no crossover has occurred yet, this softening is consistent with a cooling phase. While technical indicators hint at short-term exhaustion, derivatives markets suggest traders remain overwhelmingly bullish. According to Coinglass derivatives data , 24-hour volume rose 135.98% to $8.60 billion, and open interest climbed 25.32% to $1.82 billion. These are massive inflows of speculative capital. The long/short ratio on Binance stands at 1.2056, while the top trader long/short ratio hits 2.2626, showing whales and top accounts remain heavily long-biased. SUI/USDT derivatives data, July 14 (Source: Coinglass) The market continues to punish overeager short sellers. According to Coinglass data, $864,000 worth of short positions were closed in just four hours, demonstrating how sustained buying pressure continues to dominate SUI’s price action. A measured pullback toward the $3.60–$3.70 support zone would represent the healthiest possible outcome for bulls. Such a retreat would serve multiple purposes—maintaining the integrity of the bullish structure while shaking out weaker hands and allowing for fresh accumulation before the next potential leg up. The key detail to watch for after this is the renewed buying volume when testing this zone, which, if positive, could set the stage for another move toward the $4.50–$5.50 resistance band. Conversely, confirmation of a bearish MACD crossover or the emergence of negative RSI divergence could indicate a more substantial correction, potentially leading to an extended cooldown period.

As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.2 and a maximum of $2.3, with an average of $1.8. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction July 2025 $1.2 $1.8 $2.3 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $1, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez says AVAX needs to stay above $20 to keep bulls alive. He argues that a sustained hold here could open the door to the next resistance zone near $26. Other analysts have a more aggressive take: reclaiming $24.27 would clear the way for a run past $54. Price Prediction Signals Mild Upside Based on current AVAX price forecast of CoinCodex, the token could rise by 6.54% to reach $23 by August 13, 2025.

According to the analysis, immediately following this historic peak, there was a significant increase in Bitcoin inflows to centralized exchanges.

2025-07-14T17:30:05,"Bitcoin Market Trends: Unlocking Crucial Opportunities This Week","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Market Trends: Unlocking Crucial Opportunities This Week In the fast-paced world of digital assets, staying ahead of the curve is not just an advantage—it’s a necessity. As we navigate another week in the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape, all eyes are on Bitcoin, the undisputed king of crypto. Its movements often dictate the broader market sentiment, and understanding the underlying forces at play is paramount for any investor. This week, several pivotal factors are shaping the Bitcoin Market Trends , offering both challenges and compelling opportunities. Let’s dive deep into the key insights that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming days and beyond. Decoding Bitcoin Market Trends : On-Chain Signals and the Path to $135,000? The first and perhaps most exciting trend highlighted by Cointelegraph points to robust momentum in Bitcoin’s on-chain and technical indicators. This isn’t just wishful thinking; these indicators provide a data-driven look into the health and direction of the network. On-chain metrics, for instance, analyze transactions, active addresses, miner behavior, and accumulation patterns directly on the blockchain. Technical indicators, on the other hand, use historical price and volume data to predict future movements. When both align to show strength, it paints a compelling picture. Strong on-chain signals might include a decrease in exchange reserves (suggesting holding over selling), an increase in long-term holder accumulation, or a rising hash rate (indicating miner confidence). Technically, a breakout above key resistance levels, sustained trading above significant moving averages (like the 200-day MA), or bullish divergence in oscillators (like RSI or MACD) can signal upward potential. The bold prediction of Bitcoin hitting $135,000 in Q3 is certainly ambitious, but it’s rooted in the idea that current underlying strength could translate into significant price appreciation once macro conditions align or institutional interest intensifies. For investors, this means closely monitoring these fundamental and technical signs. Are whales accumulating? Is network activity consistently growing? These are the questions that help confirm the bullish narrative. How US Fiscal Policy Shapes BTC Price Action Beyond the internal dynamics of the crypto market, external macroeconomic factors play a colossal role. This week, particular attention is being paid to fiscal turmoil in the United States. Historically, periods of economic uncertainty, high inflation, or concerns about government debt have often propelled investors towards alternative assets perceived as safe havens. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has increasingly fallen into this category. When traditional financial systems show cracks, or when confidence in fiat currencies wanes due to aggressive monetary policies or ballooning national debts, assets like Bitcoin become more attractive. Its decentralized nature and finite supply of 21 million coins offer a stark contrast to endlessly printed fiat money. Therefore, any news suggesting further fiscal instability or expansionary policies in the U.S. could serve as a tailwind for the BTC Price . Consider the recent discussions around the debt ceiling or the ongoing debate about government spending. These events, while seemingly distant from your crypto wallet, can directly influence investor sentiment towards risk assets and hedges. A weaker dollar, driven by fiscal concerns, often makes dollar-denominated assets like Bitcoin more appealing to international investors, further boosting demand. Navigating Volatility: The Impact of US Economic Data Closely tied to fiscal policy is the release of crucial US Economic Data , specifically the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) for June. These reports are paramount because they provide vital insights into inflation, which directly influences the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decisions, particularly regarding interest rates. Consumer Price Index (CPI): Measures the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. A higher-than-expected CPI indicates persistent inflation, which might prompt the Federal Reserve to maintain or increase interest rates. Higher interest rates can make traditional investments more attractive, potentially drawing capital away from riskier assets like Bitcoin. Producer Price Index (PPI): Measures the average change over time in the selling prices received by domestic producers for their output. It’s often seen as a leading indicator for consumer inflation, as producers’ costs eventually filter down to consumers. The market’s reaction to these figures can be swift and significant. If inflation comes in lower than anticipated, it could signal that the Fed might ease its hawkish stance, potentially leading to a rally in risk assets. Conversely, stubbornly high inflation could reinforce fears of continued tightening, leading to market corrections. Staying informed about these releases and understanding their potential implications is crucial for making timely investment decisions in the volatile crypto market. Is an Altcoin Rebound on the Horizon? Understanding Crypto Dominance Shifts While Bitcoin often leads the charge, its dominance in the overall cryptocurrency market capitalization is a key metric to watch. Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market cap as a percentage of the total crypto market cap. A waning Bitcoin dominance, as suggested by Cointelegraph, often signals a shift in investor focus towards altcoins (any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin). When Bitcoin dominance decreases, it typically means that altcoins are gaining market share, either by appreciating faster than Bitcoin or by holding their value better during a Bitcoin correction. This phenomenon is often referred to as ‘altcoin season’ or ‘alt season,’ where many altcoins experience significant price surges. Several factors can contribute to this: Bitcoin Consolidation: After a strong Bitcoin rally, investors might take profits and reallocate them into altcoins, seeking higher percentage gains. Technological Advancements: Specific altcoin ecosystems (e.g., Ethereum with its upgrades, Solana, Avalanche) might see renewed interest due to technological breakthroughs or increased adoption. Narrative Shifts: New trends like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or GameFi might drive interest and capital into specific altcoin sectors. The potential for an Altcoin Rebound means diversifying your portfolio might become a more attractive strategy. However, altcoins are inherently more volatile and carry higher risks than Bitcoin. Thorough research into specific projects, their utility, team, and community is essential before investing. A strategic approach during periods of shifting Crypto Dominance can unlock significant returns, but it also demands heightened vigilance. Here’s a simplified look at what Bitcoin dominance trends might imply: Bitcoin Dominance Level Market Implication Investor Strategy >50% and Rising Bitcoin is strong, altcoins may lag. Focus on BTC, accumulate altcoins cautiously. 40-50% (Stable) Balanced market, some altcoin rotation. Diversify carefully, look for strong narratives. Potential ‘Altcoin Season’ in full swing. Increased altcoin exposure, but manage risk. Seizing the Moment: Actionable Insights for the Week Ahead The coming week presents a fascinating interplay of internal crypto dynamics and external economic pressures. For those looking to navigate these waters effectively, here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Utilize tools and analytics platforms that provide real-time on-chain insights. Look for trends in accumulation, exchange flows, and network activity to gauge fundamental strength. Stay Tuned to Macro News: Keep a close eye on U.S. economic headlines, especially the CPI and PPI releases. Understand how different outcomes could impact the broader market and Bitcoin specifically. Diversify with Caution: If Bitcoin dominance continues to wane, research promising altcoin projects with strong fundamentals and real-world utility. Avoid impulsive decisions based solely on hype. Risk Management is Key: Given the inherent volatility, especially around economic data releases, always employ sound risk management strategies. Consider setting stop-loss orders and only investing what you can afford to lose. Educate Yourself Continuously: The crypto market evolves rapidly. Staying informed about new technologies, regulatory changes, and market narratives will always give you an edge. In conclusion, this week offers a compelling blend of bullish indicators for Bitcoin, alongside critical macroeconomic events that demand careful observation. The potential for a significant BTC Price surge to $135,000 in Q3, driven by strong on-chain signals and fiscal turbulence, paints an optimistic picture. Simultaneously, the shifting sands of Crypto Dominance hint at an exciting period for an Altcoin Rebound , presenting diversification opportunities for the astute investor. By understanding these pivotal Bitcoin Market Trends and their implications, you can position yourself to potentially capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead, transforming market uncertainty into informed decisions.

2025-07-14T17:30:00,"This Cardano (ADA) Rival Could Turn $2,000 Into Generational Wealth","New under-the-radar Cardano (ADA) rival, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is turning heads, just as crypto investors hunt for the best crypto to buy in 2025. With July ticking away and the market heating up, Mutuum Finance is being hailed as one of the top summer DeFi plays, and early adopters are eyeing massive upside. Stage 5 presale of MUTM is priced at $0.03. The phase have been sold over 70%. Mutuum Finance has so far been able to raise more than $12.3 million and more than 13200 investors are currently on board. Some are already calling it a potential generational wealth builder, and as the buzz grows louder, this could be your last shot before the crowd rushes in. Cardano at a Crossroads: Building on Momentum with Strategic Moves Cardano (ADA) is currently trading around $0.73, maintaining a solid uptrend as it rides the broader crypto market rally powered by Bitcoin’s resurgence. Earlier this month, ADA surged from roughly $0.54 to its current level, buoyed by a key technical setup, a rare weekly “golden cross” of its 50‑week and 200‑week moving averages, often seen as a bullish signal. Meanwhile, the Cardano Foundation has diversified its treasury, holding approximately 15% of its $659 million in Bitcoin, around $98 million, as part of a broader asset strategy. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds Fast More than 13200 investors have joined the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale that has raised above $12.3 million. There is a lot of hype concerning the project and it is so evident that it is indeed a very positive evidence of the project being on the right track. MUTM tokens stand at $0.03 in phase 5 and will increase by 16.67% in phase 6. This stage has already passed over 70% of its sales as investors are keen to buy at the lowest possible price. The demand is growing exponentially and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a DeFi disruptor is even more precious considering the fact that it will be one of the best crypto investments of 2025. Boosting Trust: Mutuum’s $50K Bug Bounty Verified by CertiK Security always comes first for Mutuum Finance. In collaboration with CertiK, the platform has now launched its Bug Bounty Program officially with a combined reward pool amounting to $50,000 USDT. The program has four severity levels, critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure that any potential vulnerability would be found and rewarded appropriately. This is in support of the team’s commitment to building a secure, transparent, and high-quality DeFi protocol. $100,000 Giveaway to Reward Early Supporters As a token of appreciation for its first community, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $100,000 giveaway campaign. Ten winners will be given $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. It is not only a gesture of appreciation but also an incentive to create a solid and active user base right from the start. Cardano may be advancing steadily, but Mutuum Finance is accelerating toward breakout status. At just $0.03 in Phase 5, and over 70% sold out, this presale window is quickly narrowing. More than 13,200 early investors have already contributed over $12.3 million, attracted by real utility, CertiK-audited smart contracts, a $50,000 bug bounty, and a $100,000 giveaway rewarding early adopters. Investors who get in now before the 16.67% price increase in Phase 6 are positioning themselves at the ground floor of what many are calling a once-in-a-cycle DeFi opportunity.

With the supply burn and Uniswap launch, AGNT is now positioned to lead the next wave of meme coin dominance. Price Is Rising. Supply Is Shrinking. Buy $AGNT Now Shiba Inu: From Meme Coin to Crypto Contender Shiba Inu (SHIB) began in 2020 as a meme coin inspired by Dogecoin. It gained fame with help from Vitalik Buterin and Elon Musk. Built on Ethereum, SHIB was initially meant for payments and investment. Creators expanded SHIB's use by launching a decentralized exchange and NFTs. They added a metaverse, games, a magazine, and merchandise. These projects set SHIB apart from other meme coins, giving it real utility. SHIB soared in 2020 and 2021, hitting a peak of $0.00008845 in October 2021. It then settled around $0.00001 to $0.00002 for months. This stability let its ecosystem grow and develop. In 2025, SHIB keeps building its ecosystem and community. New meme coins appear, but SHIB's strong base gives it an edge. Its growth may depend on outside events like a crypto bull market. Predictions say SHIB's price could rise. Changelly expects SHIB to reach up to $0.0000526 by 2025, and higher by 2030. Though uncertain, these forecasts show SHIB's potential as a long-term crypto player. Dogecoin’s Wild Ride: From Meme Origins to $1.36 Price Predictions by 2025 Dogecoin started as a joke in 2013, featuring the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme. Created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, it was meant to be a fun and friendly alternative to Bitcoin. Despite its humorous beginnings, Dogecoin has gained a loyal following and significant attention over the years. The coin operates on a peer-to-peer system using the Scrypt algorithm, which allows for faster transaction times compared to Bitcoin. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has an uncapped supply, meaning there is no limit to how many coins can exist. This makes it more accessible but also raises questions about its long-term value. Dogecoin's price history has been a roller coaster. In May 2021, it reached an all-time high of $0.7376 during a major rally driven by social media buzz and celebrity endorsements. However, it lost over half of that value afterward, reflecting its volatile nature. By 2023, it remained a topic of interest but with cautious optimism. Looking ahead, some predictions suggested moderate growth. Forecasts ranged from Dogecoin reaching $0.28 to $1.36 by 2025. While some experts saw potential due to its strong community and widespread recognition, others were skeptical about it surpassing previous highs, citing competition and limited utility. In the current market cycle, Dogecoin's appeal lies in its community and meme culture. It may still attract attention and experience price swings. For those considering it, understanding its history and being mindful of its volatility is important. As always, thorough research is key before making any investment decisions. Conclusion With the bull run underway, holders of SHIB and DOGE are reconsidering their positions. These popular coins may offer less short-term potential compared to emerging opportunities in the market. Codename:Pepe crypto is capturing attention as a promising alternative. By harnessing true intelligence to maximize profits, it stands out in the crowded crypto landscape. Its community-driven model and advanced AI tools position it for significant growth, appealing to investors seeking better returns.

2025-07-14T17:20:57,"Bitcoin rally disrupted by US–Russia tariff fears as top altcoins erase daily gains","Bitcoin extended its bull run on Monday, briefly hitting a new all-time high before losing momentum as bearish macro developments emerged. For the first time since December, the total crypto market cap broke back above $3.8 trillion, hitting an intraday high of $3.89 trillion before receding. Throughout the day, investors maintained a strong risk-on stance, with the Fear & Greed Index anchored at 74 and flashing “Greed.” Much of the day’s liquidity chased Bitcoin’s breakout, leaving altcoins trailing with only modest gains, which had mostly faded after the tariff tensions emerged. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin surged above $123,000 for the first time ever, hitting a new all-time high of $123,091.61 earlier in the day. A number of bullish catalysts are currently driving Bitcoin’s rally. This week, the focus has shifted to Capitol Hill, where US lawmakers are set to consider three pivotal crypto-related bills. A key bullish catalyst is driving the current rally. The GENIUS Act, a bipartisan measure aimed at establishing stablecoin oversight, has already cleared the Senate and is widely expected to pass in the House. If signed into law, it would mark one of the first major regulatory frameworks for stablecoins and confirm political willingness to integrate digital assets into the broader financial system. The CLARITY Act is also on the table. It seeks to define jurisdictional boundaries between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which could offer long-awaited legal clarity for crypto projects. In parallel, a separate bill aiming to prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency is under consideration, reinforcing pro-crypto sentiment among investors who view CBDCs as potential threats to decentralised finance. Bulls are also leaning on optimism around a potential policy shift from the Federal Reserve and improving macroeconomic conditions. While no rate cuts have been confirmed, all eyes are on this week’s US inflation data. A softer-than-expected report would strengthen the case for the Federal Reserve to cut rates as early as July, a scenario already priced in by many traders. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley now expect at least two cuts this year, followed by multiple reductions in 2026. Historically, Bitcoin has shown strength during rate-cutting cycles as investors rotate into risk assets. Lastly, Institutional flows into crypto ETFs are also playing a key role in driving prices higher. Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $2.72 billion in net inflows last week, a surge of roughly 250% from $769 million recorded the week before. With total inflows surpassing $52 billion, these ETFs have become a clear barometer of institutional appetite for digital assets. What’s next for Bitcoin? Looking at commentary on X, most market analysts seemed convinced that Bitcoin’s current rally is far from over. See below.

Current leg is far from done yet.. 12:03 AM · Jul 14, 2025 369 Reply Copy link Read 31 replies However, the momentum seems to have lost some steam with the US threatening fresh tariffs on Russia unless the Ukraine conflict is resolved within the next 50 days. The warning sparked caution across global markets, triggering a brief risk-off pullback that saw Bitcoin dropped over 2% from its intraday high. When writing, the asset was trading just above $120,000, with traders trimming positions amid renewed geopolitical uncertainty. While the broader macro backdrop remains supportive, the tariff threat adds a layer of volatility in the short term. Market participants will be closely watching for further developments out of Washington, as any escalation could pressure risk assets further, even as rate cut expectations and ETF inflows continue to underpin longer-term bullish sentiment. Looking at the 24-hour Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Heatmap, bears were already eating into stacked long positions clustered between the $121,000 and $120,000 range, triggering a cascade of liquidations as the price broke below key intraday levels.

On the downside, liquidity remains dense between $117,000 and $118,000, marking a critical support area where aggressive buying interest could emerge if the correction deepens. If Bitcoin breaks below this zone, the next cluster of liquidations appears near $115,500, which could act as a final line of defence before the trend structure is meaningfully challenged. Upside pressure, meanwhile, faces stiff resistance around $122,000 and again near $123,500, where multiple short liquidations are positioned. A clean move above these thresholds could reignite bullish momentum and potentially open the door for a rally towards $130,000. From here, Bitcoin’s next move will likely hinge on macro cues and whether dip-buyers can defend the $117,000–$118,000 range. A rebound off that zone, paired with easing geopolitical tensions, could set the stage for a sharp recovery and another test of record highs. When looking at the long-term picture, analysts are pointing to structural similarities with previous breakout phases, particularly the early 2024 rally that preceded a 50% move. BTC/USDT weekly chart. Source: Edward on X. According to pseudonymous market commentator Edward, the current setup mirrors that earlier breakout, with $135,000 to $140,000 no longer viewed as speculative, but simply one clean breakout away. However, the flagged a key cluster of interest around $115,500 to $116,500, a zone that could serve as a structurally sound retest if the $120,000 level fails to hold. “If $BTC fails to hold above $120K, a dip to $114K–115K would be structurally clean. That doesn’t mean the uptrend breaks. It’s part of the expansion–contraction rhythm in every strong leg,” Edward said. Altcoin market recedes The altcoin market cap fell by 11% to $1.44 trillion over the past 24 hours, as $779.74 million worth of assets were liquidated across the total crypto market, as renewed macroeconomic concerns weighed on investor sentiment. Investors showed a mixed sentiment towards the top 100 altcoins by market cap. While Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP (XRP) held onto minute gains of 1%, 1.2% and 5.3% respectively, Tron (TRX), Cardano (ADA), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) saw losses between 1-2%. Sui (SUI) led the highest gains among them, holding up 11.9% over the day, while XDC Network (XDC) and Uniswap (UNI) were up 9% and 7.6% respectively. Source: CoinMarketCap Sui : SUI’s rally may have been driven by its DeFi total value locked (TVL) hitting a new all-time high of $2.20 billion. A rise in TVL usually points to growing activity on the network, which often supports price growth. XDC Network: No particular catalyst was identified at press time, though XDC may still be riding residual momentum from 21Shares’ launch of a dedicated exchange-traded product earlier this month. The ETP, listed under the ticker XDCN on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam, offers institutional investors direct exposure to the XDC Network. Uniswap: Whale accumulation is driving Uniswap’s gains today, supported by data from Nansen, which shows that these large holders currently hold 5.25 million UNI tokens, up 56% over the last 30 days. Such a surge in whale activity often boosts market confidence in the related asset, prompting retail investors to follow suit.

2025-07-14T17:20:05,"Korean Crypto Trends: Unveiling the Dominant Surge in XRP and Bitcoin","BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Trends: Unveiling the Dominant Surge in XRP and Bitcoin The vibrant world of cryptocurrency never sleeps, and nowhere is this more evident than in the dynamic South Korean market. Known for its highly engaged and tech-savvy participants, the Korean crypto community often sets unique trends that can offer valuable insights into broader market sentiment. What were the hottest topics and most sought-after digital assets last week? We delve into the data from Bitcoin World’s K-Community to uncover the dominant cryptocurrencies capturing attention between July 4 and 10. Decoding Korean Crypto Trends – What’s Driving the Buzz? Understanding the pulse of a specific crypto community like South Korea’s can provide a strategic advantage. The K-Community, a significant player in the global crypto landscape, often exhibits distinct patterns of interest compared to Western markets. Our analysis focuses on two key metrics: “searched tokens” – indicating active curiosity and potential new interest – and “mentioned tokens” – reflecting ongoing discussions and established relevance within the Korean crypto community . The period from July 4 to 10 offered a fascinating snapshot of these dynamics, revealing which digital assets were top-of-mind for thousands of users. This data helps us not just identify popular coins, but also to infer underlying market sentiment and emerging narratives within this influential region, highlighting the evolving Korean crypto trends . XRP Popularity Explodes in Searches – Why the Fascination? When it comes to active exploration, one token clearly stood head and shoulders above the rest. XRP popularity in searches was undeniable, with a staggering 62,793 queries. This figure dwarfs the interest in even Bitcoin and Ethereum, prompting us to ask: what fueled this intense curiosity? Here’s a look at the top 10 most searched tokens: Token Search Count XRP 62,793 ETH 18,377 BTC 13,021 ONDO 10,088 SOL 9,480 UXLINK 7,735 ADA 7,360 SEI 5,189 BONK 4,750 HYPER 4,690 The overwhelming interest in XRP likely stems from a combination of factors, contributing to its soaring XRP popularity : Legal Developments: Ongoing legal clarity surrounding Ripple and the SEC has been a major driver, with every court update generating significant speculation and renewed interest. Price Volatility: XRP often experiences sharp price movements, attracting traders looking for quick gains and opportunities. Strong Community: The “XRP Army” is known for its passionate and vocal support, which can amplify search trends and keep the token in the spotlight. While XRP dominated searches, established giants ETH and BTC still commanded substantial attention, indicating their foundational role in the market. Newer or less common tokens like ONDO, UXLINK, SEI, BONK, and HYPER also made the list, suggesting emerging interests or specific news events impacting their communities within the broader Korean crypto trends . Bitcoin Analysis: The Unshakeable Foundation of Discussions While searches indicate curiosity, mentions reflect ongoing dialogue and established relevance. In this arena, Bitcoin analysis firmly secured the top spot, demonstrating its enduring status as the benchmark cryptocurrency. Despite being out-searched by XRP, BTC was mentioned 1,590 times, nearly double that of Ethereum, highlighting its constant presence in meaningful conversations. Here’s a look at the top 10 most mentioned tokens: Token Mention Count BTC 1,590 ETH 800 XRP 395 SOL 210 TRUMP 155 BONK 82 ADA 76 HYPER 63 SAND 61 DOGE 57 The strong presence of Bitcoin analysis in discussions highlights several key points: Market Bellwether: Bitcoin’s price movements and fundamental developments often dictate the broader crypto market’s direction, making it a constant topic of discussion and the subject of deep dives in Bitcoin analysis . Institutional Interest: Continued institutional adoption and ETF developments keep Bitcoin at the forefront of serious market conversations, reflecting its growing mainstream acceptance. Long-Term Store of Value: Many in the K-community view Bitcoin as a long-term investment, leading to consistent dialogue about its future trajectory and role in diversified portfolios. Ethereum and XRP also featured prominently in mentions, albeit with fewer counts than their search volumes, indicating a more focused discussion among those already familiar with them. The appearance of TRUMP, BONK, and DOGE in the mention list underscores the influence of meme coins and political tokens in community chatter, adding another layer to Korean crypto trends . Ethereum Market Dynamics – Beyond the Buzzwords Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, consistently appears high on both lists, reflecting its critical role in the broader Ethereum market and ecosystem. With 18,377 searches and 800 mentions, ETH remains a cornerstone of interest and discussion within the K-Community, solidifying its position as a vital asset. What makes Ethereum market dynamics so compelling for Korean users? Smart Contract Dominance: Ethereum’s foundational role in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications ensures its continuous relevance as the backbone of Web3 innovation. Ecosystem Developments: Ongoing upgrades, such as the Dencun upgrade, and the proliferation of layer-2 solutions within the Ethereum ecosystem provide constant material for discussion and analysis, promising scalability and efficiency. Developer Activity: A thriving developer community means new projects and innovations are always emerging on Ethereum, keeping it fresh in the minds of users and reinforcing its long-term potential. Its consistent performance across both metrics signifies that Ethereum is not just a passing fad but a deeply integrated part of the crypto investment and technological landscape for the K-Community, driving significant portions of the Ethereum market ‘s growth and innovation. Actionable Insights from Crypto Community Insights Analyzing these trends offers more than just a snapshot of popularity; it provides valuable crypto community insights for investors, traders, and project developers looking to understand the nuanced dynamics of the Korean market. Here are some key takeaways: Search vs. Mention: High search volume for a token like XRP suggests a broad, perhaps newer, interest base often driven by recent news or price movements. High mention volume for BTC indicates deep, ongoing engagement from established participants who view it as a core asset for discussion and long-term strategy. Regional Nuances: The K-Community’s unique interest in specific tokens (e.g., the pronounced XRP popularity ) highlights regional preferences and investment theses that global analyses might miss. These localized interests can sometimes precede broader market shifts. Emerging Narratives: The presence of newer or niche tokens (ONDO, UXLINK, SEI, TRUMP, HYPER) in either list can signal emerging trends or specific local events driving their interest. Monitoring these can offer early indicators of broader shifts in investor sentiment or technological adoption. Market Sentiment Indicators: A sudden surge in searches for a particular token might precede a price movement, offering a potential trading signal. Conversely, consistent mentions can indicate strong underlying fundamentals, community belief, or sustained development, providing confidence for long-term holders. For those looking to navigate the crypto space, paying attention to these crypto community insights can help refine strategies, identify potential opportunities, and understand the diverse motivations driving market participants, ensuring a more informed approach to investing and trading. Conclusion: The Dynamic Pulse of the K-Community The latest data from Bitcoin World’s K-Community vividly illustrates the dynamic and diverse interests of South Korean crypto enthusiasts. While XRP popularity surged in searches, driven by ongoing developments and speculative interest, Bitcoin analysis remained the bedrock of discussions, affirming its status as the market’s enduring foundation. Ethereum consistently proved its indispensable role, bridging the gap between broad curiosity and sustained dialogue within the robust Ethereum market . These Korean crypto trends offer a compelling glimpse into how different digital assets capture attention and maintain relevance. By understanding the distinction between what people are searching for versus what they are actively discussing, we gain a richer perspective on market sentiment and potential future movements. The K-Community continues to be a crucial barometer for crypto trends, providing invaluable crypto community insights for anyone serious about understanding the global digital asset landscape.

2025-07-14T17:10:05,"Korean Crypto Investors Reveal Powerful Optimism: 36% See Musk’s America Party as Bitcoin Catalyst","BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Investors Reveal Powerful Optimism: 36% See Musk’s America Party as Bitcoin Catalyst Are you curious about the pulse of the crypto market, especially from a region known for its fervent adoption? A recent survey offers fascinating insights into how Korean crypto investors are viewing the future of digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, amidst significant global events. Get ready to dive deep into their sentiment, price predictions, and their intriguing reactions to Elon Musk’s latest political venture. Understanding Korean Crypto Investors’ Pulse The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and understanding investor sentiment is crucial. A weekly survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos, tracking trends among South Korean cryptocurrency investors from June 7 to 11, has unveiled some compelling data. The findings paint a picture of cautious optimism, with a significant portion of respondents anticipating an upward trajectory for Bitcoin. Here’s a quick look at their immediate expectations for Bitcoin’s value: Expected Increase: 45.0% of respondents believe Bitcoin’s (BTC) value will increase or significantly jump this week. This marks a slight uptick from the previous week’s 44.2%. Stable Market: 28.9% predict a stable market, showing a marginal rise from 27.9% last week. Anticipated Decline: 26.1% foresee a decline or sharp drop, a decrease from 27.9% previously, indicating waning bearish sentiment. These figures highlight a growing confidence among Korean crypto investors , suggesting that many are positioning themselves for potential gains in the near term. Elon Musk’s America Party: A Bitcoin Catalyst? One of the most intriguing aspects of the survey delves into the impact of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s announcement of the America Party, which he explicitly stated would accept Bitcoin. Musk’s influence in the crypto space is undeniable, and his political foray has clearly resonated with a significant portion of the investor base. The survey asked respondents to gauge their reactions to this development, revealing a diverse range of opinions on how this could affect the market and, specifically, Bitcoin . The results underscore the polarizing, yet often positive, effect Musk has on market perception: Clear Positive for Bitcoin: The largest group, a substantial 36% of respondents, viewed Musk’s new political initiative as a clear positive for Bitcoin . This sentiment likely stems from the potential for increased mainstream adoption and political legitimacy that such an endorsement could bring. Market Gainers Continue: Another 27.6% believed that market gainers would continue their upward trend regardless of Musk’s political moves. This group likely focuses on fundamental market drivers rather than individual endorsements. Potential Negative Impact: 18.8% expressed concern that the development could have a negative impact, primarily fearing it might provoke tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump. This highlights the awareness of geopolitical factors among investors. Insignificant Action: The remaining 17.6% dismissed Musk’s actions as insignificant, suggesting a segment of investors who are unfazed by celebrity endorsements or political affiliations. This division of opinion on Elon Musk’s America Party reflects the complex interplay between celebrity influence, political developments, and cryptocurrency market dynamics. For many, Musk’s embrace of Bitcoin through his party is seen as a significant step towards broader acceptance. Navigating Bitcoin Price Expectations Beyond the immediate weekly outlook, the survey provides deeper insights into the general sentiment surrounding Bitcoin price movements. The continuous tracking of these trends allows for a more nuanced understanding of investor confidence and potential market shifts. The slight increase in optimism from the previous week suggests a resilient belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, even amidst short-term volatility. The fact that nearly half of the respondents anticipate an increase or significant jump in Bitcoin’s value is a strong indicator. This confidence could be fueled by various factors, including anticipation of regulatory clarity, ongoing institutional adoption, or the belief that Bitcoin is entering a new bull cycle. Conversely, the shrinking percentage of those expecting a decline points to diminishing bearish pressure, which is often a precursor to upward price action. Understanding these Bitcoin price expectations is crucial for both individual investors and market analysts, as collective sentiment often plays a significant role in market behavior. The prevailing positive outlook among South Korean investors could serve as a bellwether for broader Asian market trends. Gauging Overall Crypto Market Sentiment Beyond specific price predictions, the survey also delved into the broader emotional landscape of investors, asking them to describe their overall crypto market sentiment . This psychological aspect is vital, as fear and greed often drive significant market movements. The findings reveal a predominantly optimistic outlook, reinforcing the positive trend seen in price expectations. When asked about their overall market sentiment, here’s how Korean crypto investors responded: Optimism Reigns: A significant 46% indicated optimism or extreme optimism. This strong positive sentiment suggests a belief in the market’s fundamental strength and future growth potential. Neutral Stance: 30.6% felt neutral, indicating a wait-and-see approach or a balanced view of current market conditions. Fear Subsides: Only 23.4% expressed feelings of fear or extreme fear. This relatively low percentage of fearful investors is a positive sign, as widespread fear often precedes market bottoms. The dominant optimistic sentiment provides a crucial insight into the psychological state of the market. A positive crypto market sentiment can encourage greater participation, investment, and ultimately, contribute to upward price momentum across various digital assets. What This Means for Bitcoin Value The confluence of these survey findings – positive weekly price predictions, strong overall market optimism, and a significant portion viewing Elon Musk’s America Party as beneficial – paints a compelling picture for the future of Bitcoin value . While no single survey can predict market movements with certainty, these insights from South Korean investors offer valuable directional cues. For investors, these findings suggest a potential for continued upward momentum, driven by strong underlying sentiment. It highlights the importance of staying informed about both market fundamentals and external influences, such as high-profile endorsements. While Musk’s political venture introduces a new layer of complexity, the immediate reaction from a key investor demographic appears to be largely positive, potentially bolstering confidence in Bitcoin’s value . As the cryptocurrency market matures, understanding regional investor behaviors and their reactions to global events becomes increasingly important. The insights from this survey underscore the dynamic nature of crypto markets and the diverse factors that influence investor decisions, ultimately impacting the perceived and actual Bitcoin value . In conclusion, the latest survey from Bitcoin World and Cratos offers a valuable snapshot of South Korean cryptocurrency investor sentiment. It reveals a prevailing optimism regarding Bitcoin’s future, with a significant portion anticipating price increases and viewing Elon Musk’s political party as a positive catalyst. While diverse opinions exist, the overall mood is one of confidence and anticipation for continued growth. These insights are crucial for anyone looking to understand the forces shaping the global crypto landscape and the potential trajectory of digital assets.

He labels this as a Ponzi scheme or “ Ponzi built on a pyramid ”, to quote his direct words. Schiff warns that the model may collapse if new inflows stop, since without mainstream use or real economic backing, he sees the setup as fragile and speculative. In Q2 of 2025, public companies added 159,000 BTC, which brings total holdings to approximately 847,000 BTC (roughly 4% of the total supply). More and more firms joined the trend (over 46, to be more precise), including GameStop, Figma, Sequans, and even Trump Media.
