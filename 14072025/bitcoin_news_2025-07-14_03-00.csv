2025-07-14T00:02:19,"XRP Hits $2.79 — What’s Driving Its Outperformance Against ETH and BTC?","Ripple’s XRP has surged to $2.79, outpacing both Ethereum and Bitcoin. This unexpected rise has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market watchers. What factors are fueling this dramatic climb? Understanding the elements behind this performance could provide insights into other coins poised for similar growth. XRP Price Stays Strong with Recent Gains and Promising Future Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.17 and $2.35, reflecting a significant boost of over 25% in the past month. The coin shows stability, inching closer to its nearest hurdle at $2.43. If it breaches this, it could aim for $2.61, in line with its 100-day average, which represents a rise of about 8% from the current range. Trades show moderate momentum with an RSI around 54, indicating room for potential growth. With recent upward moves, XRP continues to capture interest, though it must navigate near-term resistance to unlock more gains. Such movement could mark a brighter path forward for this cryptocurrency. Ethereum Holds Steady, Eyes on Breaking Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Ethereum hovers between $2420 and $2679, showing signs of cautious optimism. Over the past week, the price jumped over 17%, and this month it's up by almost 12%. Despite a dip of about 6% over the past six months, Ethereum's current stance near the $2679 mark keeps traders watchful. The next hurdle sits at $2787, and if the momentum continues, it could challenge the $3047 level. Such a move would mean a rise of around 13.75% from its latest bounds. However, support at $2268 and $2009 should keep it stable if it faces downward pressure. The path forward looks intriguing as traders monitor these pivots closely. Bitcoin on the Rise: What's Next for the Leading Cryptocurrency? Source: tradingview Bitcoin's price is moving steadily, ranging from around $106,000 to just above $111,000. It's showing a solid upward trend with a weekly gain of over 8% and about 24% growth over six months. The coin is approaching its nearest resistance level, around $114,000. If it breaks this, it could head towards $119,000, reflecting potential growth of nearly 7%. Support levels sit at roughly $103,000 and $97,500, providing cushions if the price drops. The recent upward movement hints at positive momentum, suggesting Bitcoin still has room to grow in the coming months. Conclusion BTC and ETH remain strong players in the crypto market. Recent moves have seen XRP leap to $2.79, showcasing its significant upward momentum. This growth can be attributed to increased adoption, favorable legal developments, and growing investor interest. While BTC and ETH retain their established dominance, XRP shines through its unique attributes. The crypto market continues to evolve, highlighting the competitive landscape among top coins.

Pseudonymous analyst Pentoshi tells his 870,600 followers on the social media platform X that XRP’s chart looks bullish and that the altcoin might see new all-time high prices in the coming weeks. But for now, Pentoshi thinks that XRP will take a breather before sparking the next leg up. “XRP: This is probably going to do price discovery in the next two weeks as well, in my opinion… XRP looks disgustingly good even on the BTC pair, to be honest… Also, one with quite a few tailwinds and held up very well for the past several months.” Source: Pentoshi/X As for XRP’s tailwinds, Pentoshi says the altcoin may benefit from Ripple’s push to obtain a banking license and the potential passing of stablecoin regulations into law. Looking at the broader altcoin market, the trader says he’s now seeing the possibility of rotation from large-cap to mid-cap coins. “Mostly been in large caps. So far, they’ve done ver,y very well. Will probably look out for a few mid-caps for [this] week. (Have not looked at those in a while). A lot of the charts structurally look great, and I hope we can get a good few weeks out of it and then go from there.” Mid-cap altcoins are crypto assets with a market cap of $1 billion to $10 billion.

2025-07-13T23:02:17,"Bitcoin Hits Record Highs, But Where Are the Retail Investors?","The first cryptocurrency has reached all-time highs, soaring above $118,000, but retail investors are ”barely visible.” This was stated by André Dragosz, Bitwise's head of research in Europe. Dragosz pointed to a decline in interest for the search term ”Bitcoin” on Google. According to Google Trends , during the week of July 6–12, the metric reached a level of 40. Although this figure rose amid the rally, it remains far from the peak of 100 points recorded in November 2024, just before bitcoin surpassed $100,000. Dragosz emphasized, ”The recent rebound is mainly driven by institutional investors.” His words are supported by significant inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in recent trading days. On July 10 and 11, U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.18 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, bringing cumulative inflows to a record $52.36 billion, according to SoSoValue. Ethereum funds also recorded substantial inflows, with the all-time total now exceeding $5.3 billion, as reported by SoSoValue Some participants in the crypto industry have suggested that the price of ”digital gold” has become too high for regular investors. Digital asset advocate Lindsey Stamp noted, ”I guess a lot of retail traders find out that one bitcoin is worth $117,000 and think, 'No, I missed my chance,' and don't even consider buying it.” Discussing the topic, Cedric Yangelman, host of the Bitcoin Matrix podcast, expressed confidence that bitcoin ”won't revive for retail investors for a long time.” About Market Cycles According to Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca, market cycles of new all-time highs followed by deep corrections remain consistent, contrary to popular belief. He believes the risk of a prolonged bear market is very real and does not require a ”catastrophic” event to trigger it. Simple factors such as a general slowdown in news, negative developments, or planned rebalancing of portfolios could spark the next downturn. ”We all want to think bitcoin is an inflation-protection tool, and I believe it will be one day. But I'm not sure if we've already achieved that. I still see it as a very risky asset. At least the correlation between bitcoin, the S&P 500 index, and stocks is still very strong,” Rocca explained. According to Rocca, the ”contagion effect” could simply drain all the news from the market, leading the crypto sector to ”exhaust its potential” in a natural and lengthy process. ”A lot of people say, 'Oh, institutionalization exists, therefore bitcoin's cyclical nature is dead.' I don't really agree with that,” Rocca emphasized.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9917/bitcoin-hits-record-highs-but-where-are-the-retail-investors,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare
2025-07-13T22:45:26,"Crypto Bull Says the Wealthy Are Quietly Stacking XRP to Recreate This Bitcoin Action","In a recent X post, crypto analyst Edo Farina claimed that while the masses are being lured into buying fractional amounts of Bitcoin, the wealthy are quietly accumulating XRP, positioning themselves to replicate the kind of life-changing returns seen during Bitcoin’s early years. Farina’s argument underscores a growing sentiment among XRP proponents: that history is rhyming, not repeating, and this time, XRP could be the next major wealth transfer event. The Bitcoin Parallel: Then vs. Now Farina draws a clear line between Bitcoin’s early adopters and today’s XRP accumulators. Back in 2012, savvy investors were buying entire Bitcoins for under $20. These individuals, who are now millionaires, recognized a transformative asset before it gained mass attention. Today, the mainstream narrative encourages the average person to invest in 0.01 BTC, hoping for similar results, despite Bitcoin already trading above $118,000. This, Farina argues, is a psychological trap. “The poor are buying 0.01 BTC hoping it’ll make them rich,” he said, “brainwashed by mainstream media and influencers.” Meanwhile, the smart money is investing in XRP, not because it’s trendy, but because it’s early. Today’s millionaires bought Bitcoin back in 2012. Now the poor are buying 0.01 BTC, hoping it’ll make them rich, brainwashed by mainstream media and influencers. Meanwhile, the wealthy are telling the masses to buy BTC… while quietly stacking $XRP behind the scenes. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) July 13, 2025 XRP: The New Wealth Transfer Vehicle? Farina believes XRP presents a similar opportunity to what Bitcoin offered a decade ago . With its price still relatively low and strong potential for institutional adoption, XRP remains accessible to everyday investors. According to recent data, owning just 2,486 XRP places you in the top 10% of global XRP holders, a staggering insight when compared to Bitcoin’s elite thresholds. He’s frequently stated that holding just 1,000 XRP could be “the best financial decision of your life.” If XRP reaches $100 per coin, that stack becomes $100,000. At $1,000, it’s life-changing. And if XRP were to reach a speculative $10,000 per coin, those 1,000 tokens would be worth $10 million. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Potential Unlike many altcoins, XRP has gained significant legal ground. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP is not a security when sold to the public, providing regulatory clarity that few cryptocurrencies enjoy. This decision has paved the way for institutional confidence, renewed partnerships, and potential exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the future . Institutional sentiment appears to be shifting in XRP’s favor. Several macro analysts have forecasted XRP price targets ranging from $27 to $250, citing regulatory wins, Ripple’s enterprise partnerships, and the token’s growing use in cross-border payments as key catalysts. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Quiet Accumulation and Missed Opportunities Edo Farina’s thesis is echoed in recent accumulation trends. Influential figures, including the once-famous “Dogecoin Millionaire,” have quietly pivoted to XRP, accumulating while attention remains fixed on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Farina warns against falling into the trap of buying what’s already run its course. “Don’t be the person who sold Bitcoin at $500 and missed $90,000,” he cautioned, implying that selling XRP early could mirror that same regret . He emphasizes the importance of patience and conviction, especially when the crowd is looking elsewhere. XRP’s Moment May Be Now While mainstream narratives fixate on Bitcoin, Farina’s insight suggests the true opportunity lies in XRP. The combination of legal clarity, early-stage pricing, institutional potential, and concentrated accumulation by wealthy investors paints a compelling picture. For those willing to look beyond the noise, XRP may very well be the digital asset that echoes Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, and rewards those who recognized it early.

2025-07-13T22:00:12,"Mike Novogratz Reacts To Peter Schiff’s Bitcoin Criticism","The world’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has hit a new record , crossing $118,000, but not everyone is cheering. Peter Schiff, a long-time critic of Bitcoin, took another shot at the digital currency. In a recent X post , Schiff called the top coin meaningless and pushed investors to move their money into silver instead. This time, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz had enough and responded directly to Schiff. Peter Schiff Doubles Down on His Anti-Bitcoin Views Peter Schiff, a well-known supporter of gold and silver, has spent over a decade warning people about Bitcoin. He claims the flagship crypto has no real value and that its limited supply is arbitrary. Even as Bitcoin continues to rise, Schiff insists it is nothing more than “digital fool’s gold.” As Bitcoin crossed all-time highs, Schiff told investors it was a good time to sell and buy silver. He said silver had more room to grow and less risk of crashing. Schiff believes silver could soon break above $40 and go even higher. At the same time, he warned that Bitcoin could easily crash. Mike Novogratz Fires Back at Schiff Mike Novogratz, a strong supporter of Bitcoin , quickly responded to Schiff’s latest comments. He criticized Schiff for ignoring Bitcoin’s growth and holding onto outdated views. Novogratz and many others in the crypto world believe Schiff refuses to accept how far Bitcoin has come. Novogratz pointed out that despite all of Schiff’s warnings over the years, Bitcoin has continued to grow in price and popularity. For over ten years, Schiff has warned that Bitcoin would fail. However, at the same time, Bitcoin has gone from a niche project to a global financial asset with a market value of over $2.2 trillion, larger than silver. While silver has seen some gains, its performance has not matched the top coin’s rise. Bitcoin has become more widely accepted by investors, companies, and even governments. Meanwhile, Schiff’s repeated warnings have become something of a joke online, with some calling him the best “contrarian indicator.” This means that whenever he says Bitcoin will fall, it usually rises instead. Peter Schiff Shows No Signs of Changing His Mind Even when asked what would make him admit he was wrong, Schiff has said only a world where Bitcoin replaces all fiat money would convince him. He believes that the outcome is still far away, if not impossible. Mike Novogratz and other crypto supporters continue to call out Schiff’s missed predictions, saying it is time to accept the facts. They argue that Bitcoin’s record speaks for itself.

2025-07-13T22:00:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction below $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.4664 Price Change 24h -1% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.4664 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis PIUSDT is consolidating near $0.4665, showing indecision ahead of the key announcement. PIUSDT support is forming near $0.4900, holding despite minor day declines. Resistance is around $0.5123, holding upside momentum in current trading range. As of July 13th 2025 PIUSDT is trading within a tight range, showing limited volatility. The price briefly touched a high of $0.4900 before pulling back. It closed near $0.4665, marking a small decrease. Trading volume remained moderate, reflecting cautious sentiment among traders. Pi 1-day price chart stalls as traders watch for a breakout PIUSDT is priced at $0.4664, showing a small upward movement on the daily chart. The RSI on the 24hour chart stands between 36.95 and 39.17, indicating weakening bullish strength. MACD values are at -0.00354, -0.032250, and -0.0361, pointing to sustained bearish momentum. These signals reflect a cautious market awaiting a clear directional shift. PiUsdt 1day chart by trading view Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network (PI) is currently priced at $0.4660 on the 4-hour chart, reflecting a narrow trading range. The pair has shown minimal movement, with slight fluctuations failing to break key levels. RSI remains neutral around 44.94, indicating a balanced momentum between buyers and sellers. MACD values of -0.0023 and -0.0001 suggest low volatility and indecision in the short term. Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. Pi Network has announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the main net, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility. Creating apps through Pi App Studio means anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, is able to own and run an online product and business built around their expertise and ideas. https://t.co/Vv88Jsqv8v This is made possible through the use of AI and supported by the blockchain… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) July 3, 2025 Pi Price Prediction July 2025 Heading into July 2025, the price of Pi is predicted to reach an average price of $0.5110, while the coin could trade between a maximum of $0.5256 and a minimum of $0.4672.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. As of July 13 PIUSDT is trading sideways, holding near $0.4665 with minimal price movement.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pi-network-price-prediction/,"BTC|MINING|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN","Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network",cryptocompare

2025-07-13T21:30:58,"Ripple CEO Dubbed ‘Steve Jobs Of Crypto’ By Top XRP Lawyer","Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has just received another major compliment from one of his most vocal allies. Crypto attorney John Deaton, known for backing XRP holders during Ripple’s legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has called Garlinghouse a top candidate for the title of “crypto’s Steve Jobs .” The statement came in response to a social media question asking who in the crypto industry could be compared to the late Apple founder. Deaton named both Garlinghouse and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong as leading figures worthy of that label. He didn’t explain his criteria, but the implication is clear: both men have shown strong leadership in tough legal environments and have pushed for more clarity in crypto regulation. Legal Ties And Political Backing Run Deep Deaton’s support for Garlinghouse goes back to the early days of the Ripple lawsuit. In 2021, he filed an amicus brief on behalf of XRP holders, defending the community’s interests in court. That legal fight helped solidify their alliance, and it’s continued since. Garlinghouse, in turn, publicly backed Deaton’s Senate run against Senator Elizabeth Warren. I think it comes down to either @brian_armstrong or @bgarlinghouse . https://t.co/j2XE37Ar40 — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 12, 2025 Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, also threw his support behind Deaton’s political campaign. It’s worth noting that both Garlinghouse and Armstrong have squared off against the SEC in high-profile cases and are now working to influence crypto policy through both business and political efforts. Their companies also contributed to US President Donald Trump’s recent campaign, a sign of their growing involvement in Washington. Robinhood CEO Also Mentioned In The Conversation In a follow-up post, Deaton added a third name to his shortlist: Vlad Tenev, the CEO of Robinhood. He admitted that Tenev should have been included from the start. That addition came after a crypto user named Dave criticized Deaton’s original pick. According to Dave, Ripple hasn’t delivered a strong product-market fit and lacks the clear direction needed to compete with top fintech players. Dave claimed that although Ripple has promising pieces, it hasn’t yet connected them. His remarks repeated old doubts regarding Ripple’s business model, even as the company keeps moving ahead with its payment services. Ripple Advances With RLUSD And Cross-Border Payments Ripple is not stopped by the criticism, though. The company is busy expanding its services. The company recently put out plans for RLUSD , a stablecoin designed to enhance worldwide remittances. The market size for that is approximately $685 billion, and Ripple believes this is a big chance for it to move further into international payments.

Here is the Latest Situation in Altcoin Season Index","In the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to attract the attention of investors with its performance in the last 90 days. However, the volatility in altcoins, overshadowed by this rise, is not to be ignored. According to CoinMarketCap's (CMC) “Altcoin Season Index,” the market is still in a Bitcoin-heavy period. With a score of 31 out of 100, we are still in “Bitcoin Season.” However, it's noteworthy that some altcoins are significantly outperforming Bitcoin, generating substantial returns for investors. In order to call it an altcoin season, the value must rise above 75 in the index. Related News: How Much Profit Would You Make If You Regularly Bought Bitcoin Every Day Since 2022?

2025-07-13T21:00:40,"BlockDAG Redefines Layer 1 Infrastructure with PoW-DAG Hybrid as DAG Tech Surpasses Legacy Chains","Since Bitcoin’s debut in 2009, blockchain has been the go-to infrastructure for crypto projects. But after fifteen years, its limitations are hard to ignore. High fees, congestion, and slow confirmations still impact even billion-dollar chains. That’s where DAGs, or Directed Acyclic Graphs, come in as a powerful alternative. Unlike traditional blockchains, DAG systems use a structure that enables transactions to process in parallel. Instead of linear blocks, data is stored as interconnected nodes across a graph, allowing faster confirmations, greater throughput, and scalability. While earlier projects like IOTA and Kaspa explored this concept, one newer platform is making real progress, BlockDAG . It’s a hybrid Layer 1 chain combining Proof-of-Work security with DAG’s parallel architecture. With momentum building fast, it’s clear the crypto community is taking notice. What Makes DAG Different, & Why It Solves Blockchain’s Bottlenecks One of blockchain’s core limitations is transaction bottlenecking. Every transfer must be included in a sequential block, which limits how many can be processed at a time. Even top networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum still struggle with throughput. DAG removes this constraint by eliminating the need for blocks altogether. Transactions instead verify each other directly, forming a branching graph. That lets the network confirm multiple transfers at once, delivering major benefits: Faster transaction confirmations Lower transaction fees Greater scalability and throughput More efficient energy usage This model is especially useful for real-world applications. Whether it’s retail payments, smart cities, IoT, or enterprise use, DAG systems offer the speed, cost-efficiency, and scale that standard blockchains may never fully deliver. BlockDAG’s Hybrid Architecture Combines Speed & Proof-of-Work Security BlockDAG isn’t just another DAG project, it brings something extra to the table. By layering DAG transaction structure with a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism, it creates a unique hybrid that balances both performance and security. Here’s how it works: miners still validate and secure transactions like Bitcoin, but instead of being packed into blocks, those transactions flow across a DAG network. This setup allows BlockDAG to stay decentralized and permissionless while improving efficiency and speed. It’s a step beyond what Kaspa offers, and BlockDAG is pushing forward even faster. Developer tools, an active testnet, and user-friendly mining apps are already live, helping to build a strong foundation for adoption. Live Testnet, Over $338M Raised, & a User Base in the Millions BlockDAG isn’t just promising on paper. Its ecosystem is already expanding. The public testnet is live, supporting node creation, smart contract development, and dApp testing. More than 2 million users are currently mining BDAG through the X1 Miner app, and 18,000+ ASIC miners have been distributed in preparation for the mainnet launch. The presale has crossed $338 million, with over 23.8 billion BDAG coins sold. This makes it one of the largest decentralized crypto fundraising efforts since projects like Filecoin and Tezos. With its GLOBAL LAUNCH release scheduled for August 11 , time is running out for early entry. But it’s not just about tech. BlockDAG has also made major moves in marketing. It’s now the Official Blockchain Partner of the Seattle Seawolves (Major League Rugby) and Seattle Orcas (Major League Cricket), bringing BDAG to wide-reaching sports audiences through NFT rewards and fan engagement tools. Add to that previous campaigns featuring UFC star Alex Pereira and European football club Inter Milan, and you get a clear view of how seriously BlockDAG is working to go mainstream. Final Price: $0.0016 Until August 11, Then It Moves At the moment, BDAG is priced at just $0.0016, a valuation that stands out among early-stage Layer 1 platforms. But this won’t last. BlockDAG is offering a special promotion: 80% of coins unlocked on Day 1. That’s a significant upgrade over standard vesting models, and the deal only runs for a short time. Once the presale closes and mainnet goes live, pricing is expected to shift upward fast. With a projected listing price of $0.05 and a max presale goal of $600 million, buyers today are eyeing a 3,025% potential ROI. Whether it follows in Kaspa’s footsteps or creates its own path, BlockDAG is clearly positioned as a top contender in the next wave of scalable, secure crypto infrastructure.

2025-07-13T21:00:00,"Bitcoin price prediction 2025-2031: Will BTC hit $150k soon?","Key takeaways: Bitcoin price faces volatility around $120K. Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $116,412, beginning a bearish trend to $112,323. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in bullish pressure as buyers accumulated heavily around recent lows. This pushed the BTC price toward $120K. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $110K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Bitcoin ETF volume is on a rising trend, recording $102.14 million in daily total net inflows on June 30, marking day 15 of a gigantic inflow streak that now totals $4.73 billion. It also marks the third consecutive month of total net inflows totaling $12.8 billion since April. Bitcoin price prediction July 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $109,000, making Q2 its best quarter since 2020. In the second quarter of 2025 alone, it went up by 31%, showing strong market activity and growing investor trust. This rise is partly because, in the past, Bitcoin has often grown a lot after its “halving” events. Analysts think the current market is following the same pattern, which could mean we’ll see a peak around September 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $105,000 and be pushed further, at least $113,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $101,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 $101,000 $105,000 $113,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-price-prediction/,"REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|UNI|BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT","Crypto Price Predictions|BTC",cryptocompare

This comes after Strategy raised $4.2 billion in capital, an indication of sustained trust in BTC during short-term accumulation pauses. “Some weeks, you don’t just HODL,” Saylor tweeted Sunday, referencing the return of aggressive buying since the record 12-week buying spree in BTC ran out last week. Largest Corporate BTC Holder Vouches for Its Commitment Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase was on June 30, when 4,980 BTC were purchased at a cost of $532 million. The corporation’s holdings were then at 597,325 BTC, which is now worth over $70.9 billion. The firm remains the largest corporate owner of Bitcoin and still finances purchases with debt and equity instruments – a bold strategy that makes it the leader of Bitcoin treasury companies. Treasury Demand Outstrips BTC Mining Supply BitcoinTreasuries data shows that BTC treasury companies bought 159,107 BTC in Q2 2025 – more than double the approximately 13,500 per month mined. Strategy alone has accumulated 379,800 BTC in the past six months, or about 2,087 BTC per day. “The company is effectively halving Bitcoin,” wrote Adam Livingston, author of The Great Harvest. “Strategy is rapidly passing miners and may become an economic superpower soon.” Market Impact and Sustainability Concerns Strategy’s speed of rapid acquisitions is reshaping the Bitcoin market. With miners taking out about 450 BTC every day, and big firms buying at a higher rate, experts warn of a potential supply shock. While this would drive prices up, the debt-financed nature of such purchases raises long-term sustainability concerns. Nevertheless, investor demand is still present. Strategy stocks are up more than 16% this month, trading at about $434 – though still well short of the November 2024 peak of $543.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/michael-saylor-hints-at-new-bitcoin-buy-as/,"BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING","Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-07-13T20:00:14,"Macro Guru Luke Gromen Predicts US Dollar Devaluation, Says Government Will ‘Sacrifice’ USD Amid High Debt Levels","Macro strategist Luke Gromen warns that the US dollar will keep losing value amid a ballooning $36.60 trillion national debt. In a new YouTube update, Gromen says the US, with its record-level national debt, is now forced to choose between sacrificing the bond market or letting the dollar fall to maintain financial and economic stability. According to the macro expert, the US government will ultimately resort to debasing the dollar by printing more money to manage its debt, rather than allowing Treasury yields to soar in an effort to attract investors. “What we’re seeing in these bond markets, US and more importantly for the moment Japan and the UK, is a choice. You got to sacrifice your currency or you to sacrifice your bond market. And our view, really the base underpinning of our view why gold and Bitcoin are trading where they are trading, is they always choose to sacrifice the currency… Because if they sacrifice the bond market and let rates just go up and up and up, given their debt levels, they ultimately end up sacrificing both: the currency and the bond market because higher rates drive receipts down and interest up and that means interest quickly goes above your receipts. And when that happens, that drives essentially hyperinflation of the currency. Either they can’t pay the bonds and the bonds back the currency or more likely, they print the money just to pay the interest and drive a version of hyperinflation. So they always choose to sacrifice the currency over sacrificing the bond market when debt levels are high as they are and that’s why, because sacrificing the bond market only buys them a little bit of time, and they ultimately end up sacrificing both.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-13T19:49:40,"STELLAR PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (July 12) – XLM Advances Bullishly Despite Slight Pause in Buying, Adds Another 30% Daily Gain","While buying pressure slowed down across the crypto space since yesterday, XLM defied odds and continued to explode daily. It has seen a slight rejection today, but remains highly bullish on the day. This month started relatively calm for XLM after undergoing a major retracement for straight five weeks. But things later turned out positive as the price began to increase at the start of the week. Although few altcoins have taken a brief break in bullish as Bitcoin tapped a new all-time high on Thursday. Instead, it continues to gain traction and even exploded to a new multi-week high today. Facing twice rejections on the way up, it slowly approaches a key monthly resistance level, where a major rally is likely to take place. A clear break there should set the stage for a huge upward movement in the short term. Technically, the bears are currently off the market as demand outweighs supply. An increase in the supply level could lure the bears back in the market. But for now, there’s no sign of a drop. Having mirrored XRP’s price movement in the past few days, XLM is now looking super bullish again as it signals a trend shift with a double-bottom formation on the daily chart. XLM’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price approaches the $0.444 resistance level, we can anticipate a surge to the $0.51 level, followed by the $0.647 level in the future. A strong rejection under the mentioned resistance level could trigger a pull back to the $0.334 level before resuming the rally. Lower pullback levels to watch are $0.285 and $0.25. Holding the monthly $0.217 low as support, $0.15 is the next level to Watch in case of a dip. Key Resistance Levels: $0.444, $0.51, $0.647 Key Support Levels: $0.334, $0.285, $0.25 Spot Price: $0.4 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-13T19:49:05,"GameSquare to Launch $100M Ethereum Treasury Targeting 14% Yields","GameSquare has unveiled plans for a $100 million Ethereum treasury targeting a 14% yield through a decentralized finance (DeFi) strategy. Following the news, its shares surged by nearly 60%. GameSquare’s Offering In a July 8 press release , the company announced it has priced an underwritten public offering of 8,421,054 shares of its common stock at $0.95 per share. The offering is expected to raise approximately $8 million in gross proceeds before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and other offering expenses. The Minneapolis-based firm said the funds will be used to kickstart a $100 million Ethereum treasury strategy. The initiative is aiming for yields between 8% and 14%, which is higher than the current 3% to 4% returns offered by regular ETH staking. “Today’s announcement reflects the confidence of a proven group of high-quality investors and leaders in decentralized finance,” said GameSquare CEO Justin Kenna. He expounded that the plan will increase the company’s financial flexibility and support a clear capital allocation plan focused on acquiring more ETH, funding potential share repurchases, and reinvesting in growth initiatives. GameSquare’s ETH treasury will be supported by a strategic alliance with Dialectic, a crypto-native capital management firm. This platform uses machine learning, strong risk controls, and automated optimization to deliver better risk-adjusted returns. Lucid Capital Markets is also serving as the sole underwriter for the plan. “We’ve partnered with one of the world’s top crypto investment firms to generate real, on-chain yield while deepening our expertise in decentralized finance, pursuing new revenue streams, and strengthening our balance sheet,” explained Kenna. The next-gen media and entertainment platform also said that its treasury may include other yield-generating strategies in the Ethereum ecosystem, including using stablecoins and NFTs to increase and diversify returns. Following the announcement, its share price jumped by nearly 60%. According to Google Finance data , the stock opened at $0.99, surged to a year-high of $1.69, before closing at $1.54. More Firms Shift to Ethereum The GameSquare news came as SharpLink Gaming, the largest corporate holder of ETH, added 7,689 ETH worth $19.2 million to its portfolio. The company now has a total of 205,634 ETH in its reserves, which it previously said is committed to staking and restaking protocols. Sharplink has also introduced a new performance metric, ETH Concentration, which increased by 19% over the past three weeks. Several other companies are now adopting Ethereum-based strategies. Bit Digital recently revealed it had transitioned its treasury to Ethereum, accumulating over 100,000 ETH. This move followed a $172 million public equity raise and the sale of 280 BTC. CEO Sam Tabar said the move shows a long-term belief in the cryptocurrency’s programmable features and staking yield model, calling it the future of digital assets.

2025-07-13T19:30:25,"Bitcoin Stalls After Rally: Will It Blast Through $125,000 Or Slip Back To $110K?","After a powerful breakout last week that pushed Bitcoin into a new all-time high of $118,667, the world’s leading cryptocurrency appears to be taking a breather. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $117,953, slightly below its recent peak. The move followed a string of consecutive daily gains as bullish momentum swept across the crypto industry. In a technical analysis shared on the TradingView platform, crypto analyst RLinda pointed out two scenarios that may play out over the coming days and weeks, depending on how Bitcoin reacts to nearby resistance and support levels. Related Reading: Don’t Hold Back—Expert Recommends Full Stake In XRP Support Zones Could Affect Bitcoin’s Next Big Move RLinda’s technical analysis begins with identifying the significance of Bitcoin’s recent all-time high. Although Bitcoin has entered what seems to be a consolidation phase, there’s no confirmed top just yet. The market structure still favors bullish continuation, especially considering Bitcoin is just coming out of a prolonged two-month consolidation zone and entering a realization phase. According to the 1-hour candlestick price chart, Bitcoin is currently trading just above a support area below $117,500. If Bitcoin fails to hold this zone, the leading cryptocurrency could kick off a cascade of corrections that could drive the price to $115,500, then potentially to $114,300, and even back to the previous all-time high of $111,800. Below that, the 0.5 and 0.705 Fibonacci levels around $113,031 and $111,960 respectively may act as temporary cushions. The last major defensive buy zone is around $110,400, where bulls may step in for a bounce. Basically, what this means is that if Bitcoin loses the support level at $115,500, it could slip back to $110,000 before encountering another strong buy support zone. Image From TradingView: RLinda Bitcoin To $125K, But It Must Breach Resistance First On the other hand, Bitcoin can still push above $118,000 and increase to $125,000, but only under certain conditions. The condition of the rally’s continuation depends primarily on Bitcoin registering a decisive daily close above $118,400 and $118,900. In her words, a daily close above these price levels would hint at a “breakout of structure.” This, in turn, would confirm a transition from consolidation into another impulsive phase upward. In essence, both the bearish and bullish outlooks depend on how Bitcoin reacts at any of the important zones, either support at $116,700 or resistance above $118,400 before making a directional move. However, it is important to note that the consolidation after last week’s rally could last for weeks or even months, much like we’ve seen in previous rallies this cycle. According to the Long-Term Holder Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) metric from Glassnode, Bitcoin’s current level of long-term profitability sentiment is at 0.69. This is notably below the 0.75 mark associated with euphoric market conditions, despite Bitcoin having just printed a new all-time high. Image From X: Glassnode Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Bitcoin spent around 228 days above the 0.75 euphoria threshold in the previous bull market cycle. In contrast, this current cycle has only seen about 30 days above that level, which suggests long-term holders have not yet fully exited into profit and the leading cryptocurrency hasn’t reached overheated conditions.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150. In May the price continued to rise and ended the month above the $165 price level, a trend that could not extend through June as the month saw a decline falling below the $150 price level to end the month.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-price-prediction/,"SOL|TRADING|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET","Crypto Price Predictions|Solana",cryptocompare
2025-07-13T18:45:20,"Interactive Brokers Leads Funding for $1,000,000,000 Stablecoin Startup Zero Hash: Report","The brokerage firm that operates the largest US electronic trading platform by daily average revenue is reportedly leading a funding round for the crypto and stablecoin infrastructure startup Zero Hash. Zero Hash provides the backend infrastructure that enables banks, brokerages and fintech companies offer cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other digital assets to their customers. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Fortune reports that Zero Hash is poised to raise about $100 million at a nearly $1 billion valuation in a new funding round spearheaded by Interactive Brokers. In 2022, the startup raised $105 million in a Series D round that saw the participation of the private investment firm Bain Capital, American hedge fund Point72 Ventures and fintech venture capital firm Nyca. Citing data from PitchBook, Fortune reports that Zero Hash was valued at $340 million after the Series D capital raise. The latest push to raise additional capital comes amid the growing popularity of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies which are pegged to another asset such as the US dollar or commodities. In 2022, the payment processing company Stripe tapped Zero Hash’s infrastructure to launch an embeddable and customizable fiat-to-crypto on-ramp solution. And in 2024, Zero Hash teamed up with Securitize, a real-world asset tokenization platform, to allow qualified institutions to convert the USDC stablecoin into US dollars.

2025-07-13T18:24:27,"Chart of the Week: 'Hyperbitcoinization' May Not Be Just Maximalist Fantasy Anymore",""" Hyperbitcoinization "" — an almost apocalyptic term evoking end-of-days fiat collapse and bitcoin’s parabolic rise to global reserve status — is increasingly being discussed in more serious circles. For hardcore bitcoin maximalists, it's long been the ultimate scenario: a financial utopia where individuals, institutions and even nations are all-in on a bitcoin-only system as the fiat-based economy collapses. While we aren't there yet, the recent events might suggest something is brewing. Bitcoin is trading at record highs above $119,000 . The market cap of bitcoin is near that of the tech giants . The U.S. dollar is continuing its slow bleed in real purchasing power. Major institutions are allocating capital to BTC with the same risk-adjusted lens they apply to traditional assets. If hyperbitcoinization once sounded like ideological fiction, it’s now likely approaching early-stage reality. ""In prior BTC bull markets, the hyperbitcoinization thesis would have been limited to crypto enthusiasts. More recently, hyperbitcoinization-adjacent conversations have become much more palatable for the broader public,"" FRNT Capital said in an emailed note. From trenches to the front line Just a few years ago, no one thought the likes of BlackRock would be creating an exchange-traded fund for the masses to buy billions in bitcoin. Today, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is a juggernaut with 706,008 bitcoin under its belt, worth $82 billion, according to BitcoinTreasuries.Net data . Large companies are raising funds to buy bitcoin for their balance sheets. Political leaders, including a pro-crypto U.S. president, are floating the idea of national bitcoin reserves (whether that will come to fruition is still up for debate). Even a U.S. housing regulator is considering whether crypto holdings could be considered for mortgage applications — a potential signal that digital assets are becoming part of core financial infrastructure, or at least that those currently in power would like to see that happen. And of course, Wall Street has already claimed bitcoin with ""Tradification"" of the digital assets. The ownership shift The chart below makes an interesting observation about a potential ""hyperbitcoinization"" that may already be well underway. From 2014 till at least 2020, bitcoin has been held by mostly individuals. But fast forward to today, a massive number of companies, funds and even governments, as opposed to individual crypto enthusiasts, are holders of bitcoin while prices continue to rally to new highs. This shift in wallet distribution suggests that hyperbitcoinization, while not fully realized, is progressing from an ideological thesis to a potential observable market behavior. In a market that is increasingly driven by narrative momentum and liquidity rotation, hyperbitcoinization may not just be a theme — it might become the trade. ""Conceivably, as the hyperbitcoinization thesis is validated in practice and gains further mainstream attention, more BTC investors will be motivated to HODL. This does not apply just to individuals, but to institutions and nations alike,"" said FRNT.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/13/chart-of-the-week-hyperbitcoinization-may-not-be-just-maximalist-fantasy-anymore,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS","Markets|Bitcoin|Maximalist|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

Since November 18, 2022, the government has purchased 1 BTC a day, bringing the total to 969 Bitcoin. The $54.15 million investment is now worth $115.18 million. BTC purchased at an average price of $55,886 currently represents an unrealized profit of 113%. The government's total Bitcoin holdings have reached 6,236 BTC, worth approximately $740 million. El Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele continues to defend his country's cryptocurrency policies and downplay criticism. He has recently targeted the “El Salvador Accountability Act of 2025,” a bill introduced by US Democratic Senators Tim Kaine, Chris Van Hollen, and Alex Padilla. Related News: Bitcoin's Weekend Breakout: Price Breaks All-Time High Record Again - Here's What We Know The bill aims to investigate whether the Salvadoran government is using cryptocurrencies as a “tool of regime corruption” and freeze the country's assets if necessary. Bukele responded to the proposal with a sarcastic post on the social media platform X. Bukele has previously targeted numerous authorities on social media, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Venezuelan government. This time, he targeted US senators and didn't hold back from belittling those who criticized his policies. Bukele's responses aren't limited to social media. His recent rapprochement with former US President Donald Trump is also noteworthy. Trump supported the detention of some deportees from the US in El Salvador's mega-prison. This development suggests a new shift in Bukele's foreign policy stance. *This is not investment advice.

According to his tweet on July 11, he purchased another Bitcoin at $110,000. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm: Shiba Inu Primed For Over 1,500% Breakout Based on reports, he’s betting that today’s price will look cheap if Bitcoin ever hits $1 million. His choice puts him in what analyst Raoul Pal calls the “Banana Zone,” where fear of missing out drives latecomers to buy at the top and then suffer losses. Bitcoin Betting At High Prices Kiyosaki used his “PIGs Get Fat. HOGs Get Slaughtered” rule to explain why he bought at such a high level. He plans to hold until less disciplined investors push prices even higher and then sell when they panic. He warned that FOMO is like a disease that spreads fast through crowded markets.

He said he waited too long to learn about modern money before jumping in. That lesson stuck. He’s open about past mistakes and uses them to guide current moves. He figures that if Bitcoin reaches $1 million, he’ll regret not adding more at $110,000. Learning From Past Mistakes Kiyosaki recognized he “could be wrong and a sucker” after buying another Bitcoin, yet he added that he’d “rather be a sucker than a LOSER if Bitcoin does go to $1 million.” He noted that he can handle a $100,000 loss thanks to his past work and savings. That safety net gives him room to ride out sharp drops—dips of 30–50% happen in crypto all the time. Advice For Small Investors He urged readers to pick up bits of Bitcoin however they can. “Even if you can afford only one Satoshi today, buy it,” he said. A Satoshi is one hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. Based on those remarks, he expects newcomers to look back and wish they’d snapped up every chance to buy.

2025-07-13T17:57:20,"AI predicts XLM price for July 31 after 85% spike","Stellar ( XLM ) is breaking out alongside the broader cryptocurrency market , with an artificial intelligence (AI) model forecasting a potential push past the $0.50 resistance level by the end of July. As of press time, XLM was trading at $0.46, up 20% in the past 24 hours and 86% over the last week. XLM one-week price chart. Source: Finbold Amid the rally, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT model, which outlined several possible price scenarios for the cross-border payment token. In a bullish case, driven by continued market strength or positive project developments, XLM could climb to between $0.55 and $0.62. A neutral scenario might see the price consolidate between $0.42 and $0.48, potentially retesting the support level. However, ChatGPT noted that if momentum fades due to a Bitcoin ( BTC ) cooldown or profit-taking, XLM could retreat to the $0.35 and $0.40 range. The AI model’s base case assumes Bitcoin remains above the $115,000 to $119,000 range and that altcoin sentiment stays strong. Under these conditions, XLM could reach $0.55 to $0.58 by the end of the month. If Bitcoin’s dominance rises or investor risk appetite weakens, XLM may struggle to maintain its current levels and drop toward $0.40. Technically, the AI model noted that support lies between $0.35 and $0.38, a zone that previously acted as resistance. On the upside, $0.50 remains a key psychological barrier, with further resistance at $0.60 to $0.65 levels last seen in early 2022. ChatGPT XLM price prediction for July 31. Source: ChatGPT Drivers of XLM rally Overall, XLM’s ongoing strength has been fueled by Bitcoin’s record-breaking surge above $119,000 and renewed interest in altcoins. Beyond the broader rally, a key catalyst was PayPal’s announcement to integrate its stablecoin PYUSD on the Stellar network, pending regulatory approval. The July 11 announcement triggered a 20.5% intraday volatility spike, pushing XLM from $0.345 to $0.416 as traders priced in future demand and liquidity. Despite the bullish momentum, the AI model cautions that XLM’s sharp 86% weekly gain could prompt a short-term correction if not supported by strong fundamentals and sustained volume.

2025-07-13T17:12:53,"Expert Says XRP Is Peeking Out of the Bull Flag. Here’s the Significance","XRP is once again commanding attention as it flashes a powerful bullish signal on the 4-hour chart. Prominent analyst XRPunkie pointed out that XRP is “peeking out of the bull flag”—a classic continuation pattern often seen just before a major upward move. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83, marking a significant push higher after a brief period of consolidation. Bull Flag Breakout Suggests a Strong Continuation The bull flag is one of the most reliable chart patterns in technical analysis. It forms when an asset rallies sharply, then enters a downward-sloping consolidation range, creating the “flag”, before breaking out in the direction of the initial trend. XRP has followed this exact structure. After surging from below $2.50 earlier this month, the price entered a tight flag pattern. Now, as XRP breaks above the upper boundary of this flag around $2.78, momentum is clearly shifting back in favor of the bulls. Ooooooo……. $XRP on the 4hourly candle is peeking out of the bull flag…. pic.twitter.com/nOZtrHWqyq — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 13, 2025 This breakout is more than just a technical nuance, it reflects growing market strength. As noted by XRPunkie, the breakout signals that buyers are stepping back in, likely setting the stage for another leg up. If momentum continues, XRP could soon retest the upper resistance zone between $2.90 and $3.00. Key Levels to Watch XRP’s climb from below $2.50 to its current price of $2.83 represents a rally of more than 13% in under two weeks. This latest breakout places XRP in a critical zone. The immediate resistance lies near $2.90, followed by the psychologically important $3.00 mark. A strong close above $3.00 could open the door to a longer-term breakout and much higher targets. On the downside, the $2.78 level, where the flag breakout occurred—now acts as near-term support. If XRP remains above this level, it would further validate the bullish setup. However, if the price slips back below $2.70, it could signal a failed breakout and further consolidation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Conditions Support the Rally XRP’s breakout isn’t happening in isolation. The broader crypto market is flashing strength, with Bitcoin trading above $118,000 and altcoins showing renewed momentum. XRP’s bullish structure is also backed by positive fundamentals. Whale accumulation is growing, exchange balances are dropping, and wallet activity is on the rise , all pointing to increased demand and long-term holding. Additionally, excitement is building around the upcoming ProShares XRP Futures ETF, which is scheduled to launch on July 18. This development could drive further institutional interest, adding fuel to XRP’s recent rally. XRP’s breakout from the bull flag pattern is a strong technical signal that the uptrend is likely to continue. As emphasized by XRPunkie, the move out of consolidation marks a turning point for XRP on the lower timeframes. With the price now holding at $2.83 and momentum building, all eyes are on the key resistance zone between $2.90 and $3.00. If this level is cleared, XRP could be on the verge of a major breakout, one that finally propels it beyond the shadow of past highs and into a new bullish phase.

Cuban national Michel Duarte Suarez has pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud and mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft after stealing about $803,000 from his victim’s bank account over a four-month period. Court documents show that Suarez told a confidential informant in March 2022 that he had access to the account of an 82-year-old victim. While living in Panama at the time, the scammer wrote and sent checks to South Florida with instructions to his co-conspirators to encash the checks and wire 50% of the funds to Suarez’s Miami-based firm, Online Electronics. Authorities say that Suarez forged the checks to resemble the signature of the victim displayed on their signature card for the same bank account. Suarez was arrested in January 2025 in Panama and was extradited to South Florida to face the charges. For his crimes, he could spend 30 years behind bars plus a mandatory consecutive two-year sentence to any imprisonment term handed down by a judge. The fraudster is slated for sentencing on September 29th, 2025, in Miami before United States District Court Judge Kathleen M. Williams.
