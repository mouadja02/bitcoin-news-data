2025-07-14T19:55:31,"Bitcoin Gearing Up for ‘Big Move’ After Reaching True Price Discovery Phase: ProCap’s Anthony Pompliano","Professional Capital Management founder and CEO Anthony Pompliano says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) has become the “greatest show on Wall Street.” In a new interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Pompliano gives three reasons why BTC is leading the crypto markets to new all-time highs. “First of all, welcome to The Greatest Show on Wall Street. I think Wall Street’s full, undivided attention is now on Bitcoin. And really, there are three things that drove this move. The first is that there have been record inflows into the ETFs (exchange-traded funds). Last Thursday alone saw $1.2 billion—the second-highest day ever. Those ETFs now collectively have over $140 billion. BlackRock’s fund alone is now almost $90 billion. In about a year, they went from not having a Bitcoin ETF to having one of the top 20 largest ETFs in the world. So there’s a lot of inflows there. The second thing is that the options expired at the end of Q2. So all that downward pressure on Bitcoin went away. That helps—kind of like a beach ball being pushed underwater. Obviously, it can pop back up. And then the third thing is that there were a lot of short sellers. You started to see that build up, and as they got blown out as Bitcoin ran, you entered this price discovery phase. If you go back to November, we went from $70,000 to $90,000 in about two to three weeks. And $70,000 was a new all-time high.” While not giving explicit price targets, Pompliano says that BTC is in for a “big move” now that’s broken the previous all-time high of $110,000. “Well, what we’re watching now is that we’ve broken through that $110,000 range, which was the previous all-time high. I don’t know if it goes to $140,000, but it sure is going to make a big move here—because we are in a true price discovery phase.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-14T19:50:32,"BlackRock IBIT Soars: Bitcoin ETF Hits Astounding $88 Billion AUM Milestone","BitcoinWorld BlackRock IBIT Soars: Bitcoin ETF Hits Astounding $88 Billion AUM Milestone The world of finance is buzzing with a groundbreaking development that underscores the accelerating mainstream acceptance of digital assets. BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, known by its ticker IBIT, has achieved a remarkable feat, amassing an astounding $88 billion in assets under management (AUM). This milestone positions IBIT as a formidable player in the financial landscape, signaling a pivotal moment for crypto investment and the broader digital asset ecosystem. BlackRock IBIT’s Meteoric Rise: What’s Driving This Phenomenal AUM Growth? Just 1.5 years after its launch, BlackRock’s IBIT has not only captured significant market share but is also on track to potentially hit the $100 billion mark this month, a projection that surpasses earlier expectations. Bloomberg senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted this impressive trajectory on X, noting IBIT’s ascent to the 20th largest ETF in the U.S. Furthermore, it has become BlackRock’s seventh-largest and most profitable ETF, a testament to its unprecedented success. Rapid Accumulation: IBIT’s ability to attract such a vast sum in a relatively short period speaks volumes about investor confidence in both BlackRock’s management capabilities and Bitcoin as an asset class. Institutional Trust: BlackRock’s reputation as one of the world’s largest asset managers provides a significant level of comfort and legitimacy for institutional and retail investors wary of the historically volatile crypto market. Accessibility: The ETF structure simplifies the process of investing in Bitcoin, removing the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership, such as setting up wallets, managing private keys, or navigating crypto exchanges. This rapid AUM growth is not merely a number; it represents a significant shift in how traditional finance views and interacts with digital assets. It validates the demand for regulated, accessible avenues into the crypto space. Unpacking the Power of Bitcoin ETF: How Does it Impact Crypto Investment? The introduction of a spot Bitcoin ETF has been a game-changer for the entire cryptocurrency market. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track Bitcoin’s price through derivatives, a spot ETF directly holds Bitcoin, providing a more direct exposure to the asset’s price movements. This distinction is crucial for investors seeking authentic exposure without the complexities of direct ownership. The impact on crypto investment is multifaceted: Broader Investor Base: ETFs open the doors for a vast pool of traditional investors, including financial advisors, pension funds, and institutional clients, who were previously hesitant or unable to invest directly in Bitcoin due to regulatory or operational hurdles. Enhanced Liquidity: As more capital flows into these ETFs, the underlying Bitcoin market benefits from increased liquidity, potentially leading to more stable price discovery. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC has provided a much-needed layer of regulatory clarity, fostering greater confidence among mainstream investors. This institutional embrace, spearheaded by products like IBIT, is transforming Bitcoin from a niche digital asset into a recognized and investable component of diversified portfolios. Beyond IBIT: The Broader Landscape of Institutional Adoption in Crypto While BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack, its success is part of a larger narrative of increasing institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency space. Several other asset managers have also launched spot Bitcoin ETFs, collectively drawing billions of dollars into the market. This competitive landscape further validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and signals a growing acceptance among traditional financial giants. Consider the broader trends indicating this shift: Diverse Product Offerings: Beyond Bitcoin, institutions are exploring and launching products for other cryptocurrencies, signaling a diversification of interest. Integration into Traditional Portfolios: Financial advisors are increasingly considering allocations to digital assets within their clients’ portfolios, moving beyond speculative interest to strategic investment. Technological Infrastructure: Major financial players are investing in blockchain technology and digital asset infrastructure, indicating a long-term commitment to the space. The move by financial behemoths like BlackRock into crypto is not just about new products; it’s about legitimizing a nascent industry and integrating it into the global financial framework. This trend is set to redefine investment strategies for years to come. Actionable Insights: What Does IBIT’s Success Mean for Your Crypto Investment Strategy? The impressive performance of BlackRock’s IBIT and the broader trend of institutional adoption offer several key takeaways for investors, both seasoned and new to the crypto market. For individuals considering or already involved in crypto investment : Diversify Your Approach: While ETFs offer easy access, consider a diversified approach that might include direct crypto holdings for long-term HODLing, alongside ETF exposure for portfolio rebalancing and liquidity. Research Beyond AUM: While AUM is a strong indicator, also look at expense ratios, liquidity, and the reputation of the ETF provider when choosing an investment vehicle. Stay Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keep abreast of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors that could influence digital asset prices. For institutions and financial advisors, IBIT’s success underscores the imperative to: Educate Clients: Proactively educate clients about the opportunities and risks associated with digital assets and how ETFs fit into a balanced portfolio. Explore Broader Offerings: Look beyond just Bitcoin ETFs to understand the potential of other digital assets and blockchain-based investment opportunities. Adapt Investment Models: Integrate digital assets into existing investment models and risk management frameworks to cater to evolving client demands and market trends. The robust growth of ETFs like IBIT signifies a maturing market where institutional capital is increasingly playing a pivotal role. This shift could lead to greater stability and broader acceptance for Bitcoin and the wider crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Assets BlackRock’s IBIT reaching $88 billion in AUM is more than just a financial statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of Bitcoin’s undeniable ascent into mainstream finance. This rapid accumulation of assets, coupled with its status as one of BlackRock’s most profitable ventures, highlights the immense demand for accessible, regulated crypto investment products. The success of IBIT and other spot Bitcoin ETFs marks a significant turning point, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets. As institutional adoption continues to accelerate, we can expect a more integrated and mature crypto market, poised for further growth and evolution.

2025-07-14T19:40:34,"Bitcoin’s Vigilant Ascent: BTC Hits Record High, Caution Urged Amidst Soaring Prices","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Vigilant Ascent: BTC Hits Record High, Caution Urged Amidst Soaring Prices The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin price recently shattered previous ceilings, surging to an astonishing new record above $122,000. This remarkable achievement has ignited a wave of optimism, with some prominent analysts boldly projecting future price targets that could see BTC climbing even higher, potentially reaching $130,000 to $140,000. For many, this signals a triumphant return for the world’s leading digital asset, solidifying its position in the global financial landscape. But beneath the euphoria, a crucial question emerges: is this surge sustainable, or are we on the cusp of a significant market adjustment? As we navigate these thrilling yet uncertain times, understanding the nuances of the market becomes paramount. Understanding the BTC Record High : What’s Driving the Surge? The journey to this latest BTC record high has been nothing short of spectacular. Bitcoin’s ascent above the $122,000 mark is not merely a number; it represents a confluence of factors that have bolstered investor confidence and driven significant capital inflows into the digital asset space. What exactly is fueling this impressive rally? Institutional Adoption: A growing number of institutional players, from hedge funds to major corporations, are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions has provided a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional finance to engage with cryptocurrency, bringing in billions in new capital. Halving Narrative: The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving event continues to be a powerful narrative. Historically, halvings, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, have preceded significant bull runs. While the immediate impact might be debated, the long-term supply shock narrative remains compelling for investors. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to seek alternative assets. Bitcoin, sometimes dubbed ‘digital gold,’ is increasingly viewed as a hedge against traditional financial instability, attracting those looking to diversify away from conventional markets. Growing Retail Interest: While institutional money is significant, renewed retail interest, often fueled by positive price action and mainstream media coverage, also plays a vital role. As prices climb, more individual investors are drawn into the market, creating a positive feedback loop. These drivers collectively paint a picture of a maturing asset class gaining broader acceptance. However, as the old adage goes, what goes up must eventually come down, or at least take a breather. Navigating the Crypto Market Analysis : A Call for Professional Discipline Amidst the excitement of new highs, a voice of caution emerges, reminding us of the market’s inherent volatility. Marcin Kazmierczak, a co-founder of blockchain oracle Redstone, offers a poignant perspective that resonates deeply with seasoned investors. “While some analysts project $130-140,000 targets, history teaches us that parabolic moves often invite sharp corrections,” he stated. This isn’t a call for pessimism, but rather a plea for professional discipline in our approach to the current crypto market analysis . Kazmierczak emphasizes that the industry’s maturation is undeniably real. We are witnessing tangible progress across several fronts: Institutional Infrastructure: The development of robust custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and derivatives markets has created a more secure and reliable ecosystem for large-scale investors. Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, many jurisdictions are making strides in establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for digital assets, reducing uncertainty and fostering a more predictable environment for businesses and investors. Advancing Use Cases: Beyond speculative trading, blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are finding practical applications in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, supply chain management, and cross-border payments, demonstrating their utility and long-term potential. Yet, this very maturation demands a shift from speculative euphoria to a more measured, professional outlook. It’s about recognizing the fundamental growth while remaining acutely aware of market dynamics. “This very maturation demands we approach these milestones with professional discipline rather than euphoria,” Kazmierczak added, highlighting the need for a balanced perspective. The Looming Shadow: Why a Bitcoin Correction Might Be Inevitable One of the most striking observations from Kazmierczak is the remarkable duration of Bitcoin’s current upward trajectory without a significant pullback. He pointed out that BTC has not faced a correction in over 47 days. While this streak is impressive, it also serves as a flashing red light for those who understand market cycles. History is replete with examples where extended periods of uninterrupted growth, often termed ‘parabolic moves,’ eventually give way to sharp and often brutal Bitcoin correction phases. Why is a correction considered a potential risk, even after such strong performance? Overheated Market Indicators: Prolonged rallies without corrections can lead to an overheated market, where technical indicators signal overbought conditions. This often precedes a period of consolidation or decline as investors take profits. Profit-Taking Pressure: As prices climb, early investors and long-term holders may decide to realize their gains, leading to selling pressure that can trigger a cascade effect. Liquidation Cascades: In highly leveraged markets, a sudden drop in price can trigger a wave of liquidations for traders with insufficient collateral, exacerbating the downward movement. Psychological Factors: Excessive optimism can lead to irrational exuberance, where new investors jump in at the peak, only to panic sell at the first sign of a downturn, amplifying volatility. Understanding these risks is not about predicting the exact timing or magnitude of a correction, but about preparing for its possibility. It’s about having a robust risk management strategy in place, rather than being swept away by the tide of collective optimism. Beyond the Hype: Cultivating Healthy Crypto Optimism While caution is warranted, it’s equally important not to confuse prudence with pessimism. The long-term trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space remains robust, driven by innovation, increasing utility, and growing adoption. The key lies in cultivating a healthy form of crypto optimism – one that is grounded in fundamentals and realistic expectations, rather than speculative hype. Consider the difference between healthy optimism and excessive euphoria: Aspect Healthy Optimism Excessive Euphoria Basis Fundamental analysis, technological progress, adoption rates. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), price predictions, herd mentality. Mindset Long-term vision, patience, risk management. Short-term gains, ignoring risks, over-leveraging. Action Dollar-cost averaging, portfolio diversification, continuous learning. All-in investments, chasing pumps, emotional trading. Outcome (typically) Sustainable growth, resilience through volatility. Significant losses during downturns, burnout. For investors, this means maintaining a disciplined approach. It involves: Diversification: Not putting all your eggs in one basket. Risk Management: Only investing what you can afford to lose and setting clear stop-loss orders or profit targets. Continuous Learning: Staying informed about market developments, technological advancements, and regulatory changes. Long-Term Perspective: Focusing on the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, rather than getting caught up in short-term price swings. The current market environment presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges. By embracing a balanced perspective, combining enthusiasm for innovation with a healthy dose of caution, investors can navigate the exciting, yet often volatile, world of cryptocurrency with greater confidence and resilience. Conclusion: Balancing Excitement with Prudence Bitcoin’s ascent to a new record high is undoubtedly a milestone worth celebrating, underscoring the growing acceptance and strength of the cryptocurrency market. The projections of even higher price targets fuel an exciting narrative of continued growth and mainstream adoption. However, as experts like Marcin Kazmierczak wisely remind us, history has a way of repeating itself, and periods of parabolic growth are often followed by sharp corrections. The industry’s maturation, marked by robust institutional infrastructure, increasing regulatory clarity, and expanding real-world use cases, demands a more professional and disciplined approach from all participants. Instead of succumbing to euphoria, investors are encouraged to exercise caution, manage risks, and cultivate an optimism rooted in fundamental understanding rather than speculative fervor. By embracing this balanced perspective, we can better position ourselves to thrive in the dynamic and evolving world of digital assets, ensuring that we celebrate milestones not just with excitement, but with enduring financial wisdom.

2025-07-14T19:30:36,"Bitcoin Treasury: Matador Technologies Unleashes CAD $900M Funding Ambition","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: Matador Technologies Unleashes CAD $900M Funding Ambition The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a seismic shift is underway as more traditional companies embrace the power of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just about small startups anymore; we’re witnessing established players making bold moves that could redefine corporate finance. One such groundbreaking development comes from Matador Technologies , which is making headlines with its ambitious plan to establish a substantial Bitcoin treasury . This move isn’t just a ripple; it’s a significant wave in the ocean of institutional crypto adoption, signaling a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a core asset. What’s Behind Matador Technologies’ Ambitious Crypto Funding? Matador Technologies (TSXV: MATA) has officially signaled its intent to make a monumental splash in the digital asset space. The company recently filed a preliminary short form base shelf prospectus with Canadian securities regulators, outlining its plan to raise up to CAD $900 million (approximately $658.2 million USD). This isn’t a small sum; it’s a strategic financial maneuver designed to secure significant capital over the next 25 months. The funds will be acquired through a diverse range of securities, including common shares, debt securities, and warrants, providing Matador with flexible options for its capital-raising efforts. The primary stated purpose for this massive crypto funding initiative is multifaceted: Bitcoin (BTC) Accumulation: A significant portion of the raised capital is earmarked for acquiring Bitcoin, solidifying its position as a key asset on Matador’s balance sheet. Business Expansion: Beyond crypto, the funds will fuel the company’s broader operational growth and market reach. Strategic Acquisitions: Matador aims to leverage this capital to pursue M&A opportunities that align with its long-term vision and strengthen its market position. This comprehensive approach suggests that Matador Technologies isn’t just dipping its toes into the crypto waters; it’s diving in with a well-thought-out strategy that integrates digital assets into its core business model. The sheer scale of this potential raise underscores the company’s belief in Bitcoin’s future and its role in modern corporate finance. The Growing Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Treasuries Matador Technologies’ move isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger, undeniable trend. The concept of an institutional Bitcoin treasury has gained considerable momentum over the past few years, with companies like MicroStrategy leading the charge. These pioneering firms recognized Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, a store of value, and a high-growth asset in an increasingly digital world. The decision to establish a Bitcoin treasury reflects a strategic shift from traditional cash reserves to a more dynamic, potentially appreciating asset. Why are more institutions looking at Bitcoin? Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies that can lose purchasing power. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate balance sheet offers diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering the potential for substantial returns on investment. Technological Adoption: Embracing Bitcoin aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology, appealing to a new generation of investors and consumers. Matador Technologies is positioning itself among these forward-thinking entities, signaling its confidence not just in Bitcoin, but in the broader digital economy. This strategic allocation of capital could set a precedent for other Canadian companies considering similar moves. Unpacking the Vision: Beyond Just Bitcoin for TSXV MATA While the headlines rightly focus on the Bitcoin accumulation aspect, it’s crucial to understand that Matador Technologies’ plan for its CAD $900 million raise extends beyond just purchasing BTC. The prospectus clearly states that funds will also be directed towards “business expansion and strategic acquisitions.” For investors tracking TSXV MATA , this indicates a holistic growth strategy where Bitcoin acts as a significant financial pillar, supporting broader corporate ambitions. Consider the implications of this multi-pronged approach: Enhanced Financial Strength: A robust Bitcoin treasury can provide a strong asset base, potentially improving Matador’s balance sheet and financial stability. Strategic Market Positioning: By integrating Bitcoin and pursuing acquisitions, Matador can solidify its position in emerging tech sectors or expand into new markets. Increased Investor Appeal: The combination of a traditional business model with a forward-thinking crypto strategy could attract a wider range of investors, including those interested in both traditional equities and digital assets. This comprehensive vision suggests that Matador Technologies is not merely speculating on Bitcoin’s price, but rather integrating it into a long-term strategy for corporate growth and market leadership. It’s a testament to how digital assets are becoming increasingly intertwined with mainstream corporate finance. What Does This Mean for the Future of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? The ambitious plan by Matador Technologies to raise CAD $900 million for a Bitcoin treasury , alongside business expansion and acquisitions, serves as a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of corporate finance. This move could inspire other companies, particularly within Canada and North America, to seriously consider Bitcoin as a viable treasury asset. As more entities embrace institutional Bitcoin , we might see: Increased Market Liquidity: More corporate demand could contribute to deeper liquidity in the Bitcoin market. Reduced Volatility: As more long-term holders enter the market, it could potentially lead to more stable price action over time. Regulatory Clarity: Growing institutional adoption often spurs regulators to provide clearer guidelines, which benefits the entire crypto ecosystem. Innovation in Financial Products: The demand for corporate Bitcoin solutions could drive the development of new financial instruments and services. While the journey of raising CAD $900 million and deploying it effectively will undoubtedly come with its own set of challenges, including market volatility and regulatory uncertainties, Matador Technologies’ proactive approach highlights a growing confidence in the long-term value proposition of digital assets. This is a story of foresight, ambition, and a clear signal that Bitcoin is cementing its place not just in individual portfolios, but in the strategic reserves of major corporations. Concluding Thoughts: A Bold Step Forward Matador Technologies’ preliminary prospectus to raise up to CAD $900 million for a Bitcoin treasury , business expansion, and strategic acquisitions marks a significant milestone. It underscores the accelerating trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies and positions Matador as a forward-thinking player in both traditional and digital economies. This move is a testament to the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic asset, capable of enhancing corporate value and driving future growth. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, we can expect more companies to follow suit, further integrating digital assets into the fabric of global finance. Matador Technologies is not just raising capital; it’s making a statement about the future of corporate treasuries.

2025-07-14T19:20:54,"Retail investors account for $135 billion in assets under management tied to spot Bitcoin ETFs","Bloomberg Exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas has disclosed that retail investors hold most of the assets in the spot Bitcoin ETFs. In a post on X, Balchunas noted that around $135 billion of $158 billion in assets under management (AUM) for the spot Bitcoin ETFs are held by retail. According to Balchunas , hedge funds only own around 10% of the AUM while market makers and institutions hold another 5%. This means that retail holders directly and indirectly hold around 85% of all Bitcoin ETFs, showing that retail remains the dominant force behind ETF adoption. The ETF expert comments come in light of Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high above $123,o00 and the belief by some people that the flagship asset achieved this without retail investors. Those holding those views rely on the Google search data for Bitcoin compared to the BTC price. BTC price versus Google search for Bitcoin (Source: TFTC) Per the data, there has been a plunge in Google searches for Bitcoin for most of 2025, even as Bitcoin continues to climb higher. Experts have quickly debunked this claim with Bitcoin adviser to the El Salvador President, Max Keiser , noting that ETF is of retail interest. Meanwhile, Balchunas clarified that the retail interest in Bitcoin through ETFs is not the classic dumb money retail where investors’ strategy is based on celebrity endorsements or degenerate traders’ behavior. He said: “This ‘retail interest’ is not dumdum GameStop YOLO retail or ‘I saw Tom Brady in a commercial’ FOMO retail (I think those investors got burned and are not taking second bite apple till at least $150k).” Instead, these are smart money retail investors who are familiar with the market and fully focused on the fundamentals of Bitcoin. Balchunas noted that this might be why BTC price is stable, as the current retail interest is not the kind to dump due to any major uncertainty. Investors opting for Bitcoin ETFs over spot assets Meanwhile, Balchunas’s statement highlights the role of retail investors in driving inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs as the crypto industry experiences a shift in how retail investors gain exposure to Bitcoin. Rather than using crypto exchanges or digital wallets, many now opt to buy through regulated ETFs tied to their existing TradFi portfolios. The ETF model removes the need to manage private keys or rely on crypto-native custodians, making Bitcoin more accessible to older investors and traditional account holders. This also eliminates the risks of losing assets due to hacks or scams. A few months ago, Bitcoin analyst Plan B announced that he had moved all his Bitcoin from self-custody to ETFs, noting that the hassle of managing his private keys is too much. Although the decision generated criticisms from several Bitcoin maxis, it highlights how Bitcoin investors change how they hold the asset. Bitcoin ETFs post strong inflows with BlackRock IBIT dominating Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs have posted consistent inflows throughout 2025, helping to solidify their position as a new core asset class for U.S. investors. According to CoinMarketCap data, spot Bitcoin ETFs have had seven days of consecutive inflows up until July 11. Of those days, two consecutive days had more than $1 billion in inflows each. The top three products offered by BlackRock IBIT , Fidelity FBTC, and Ark Invest & 21Shares ARKB collectively hold most of these assets. However, BlackRock IBIT continues to dominate the category, with the product now being the 20th largest ETF despite being less than two years old. Balchunas predicted last week that IBIT could hit $100 billion in AUM this summer, while adding later that recent inflows suggest that it could even happen this month. The product already has $88 billion and has been the third most traded ETF today. Interestingly, IBIT has emerged as BlackRock’s most profitable ETF and its seventh largest, showing its massive overperformance in only 18 months.

2025-07-14T19:00:21,"Ethereum Supply Locked Hits New ATH: Smart Money Bets On Long-Term Growth","Ethereum has broken out above the $3,000 level, reaching its highest price since late January and signaling a strong resurgence in momentum. The move comes as Bitcoin continues to set new all-time highs, injecting renewed optimism into the broader crypto market. This week could prove pivotal, with the arrival of “Crypto Week” in the US Congress, when lawmakers will debate and potentially vote on critical legislation shaping the future of digital assets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm Amid this renewed bullish backdrop, on-chain fundamentals are strengthening. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared data showing that the supply of ETH staked has just reached a new all-time high. This milestone reflects growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects, with more investors locking up their assets to secure the network and earn yield, rather than sell into strength. The surge in price and staking activity suggests a shift in sentiment as Ethereum regains its position as a core asset in institutional and retail portfolios. With macro and regulatory catalysts converging this week, ETH could be on the verge of a major breakout, especially if legislative clarity and Bitcoin’s momentum continue to drive capital into high-conviction assets like Ethereum. Ethereum Leads Altcoin Revival: Strong Fundamentals And Technical Momentum Ethereum is showing renewed bullish strength, acting as a key driver in the broader altcoin market recovery. After a prolonged consolidation phase that lasted several months, ETH has finally broken above the critical $3,000 mark, setting a new bullish structure and signaling the start of a potential macro uptrend. The recent price action has energized sentiment across the market, with many altcoins beginning to follow Ethereum’s lead. Fundamentally, Ethereum remains one of the strongest assets in the space. According to on-chain data by Ted Pillows, the percentage of ETH supply staked has reached a new all-time high of 29.44%. This metric is critical, as it reflects growing long-term conviction from large holders and smart money. When ETH is staked, it is locked up and cannot be sold, suggesting that investors expect higher prices and are committed to holding through volatility. All eyes are now on the key resistance zone between $3,500 and $3,600. If Ethereum manages to push through this area with conviction, it could trigger a broader breakout across the altcoin market. Many traders are closely watching this level as a catalyst for an explosive altcoin rally, fueled by increased capital rotation and technical momentum. A decisive break above resistance could validate the new bullish structure and mark the beginning of the next major expansion phase for ETH and the altcoin market at large.

This breakout confirms a shift in trend structure following months of accumulation between $2,200 and $2,800. The recent surge has pushed ETH to its highest level since late January and sets the stage for a potential push toward the next major resistance at $3,500–$3,600. The chart also reveals a bullish crossover as ETH trades above its 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs), now at $2,241, $2,658, and $2,801, respectively. This alignment indicates increasing buyer control and reinforces the strength of the uptrend. Notably, the breakout was supported by a spike in volume, adding further conviction to the move.

The flagship coin has since opened the third week of July in a robust bullish momentum, especially after hitting its all-time high (ATH) of about $122,838 on Monday, during the early European trading session. The Bitcoin pump into the price discovery phase is heavily bolstered by the high demand in the spot market amid record peaks in futures and derivatives trading. According to market data from Coinglass, Bitcoin’s Open Interest (OI) surged to a new ATH of $85 billion amid heavy liquidation of short traders. Vanguard Joins the Bitcoin Wagon For the past years, Vanguard Group Inc., has given pessimistic views on Bitcoin and the wider crypto market. The Pennsylvania-based asset manager, with around $10 trillion in assets under management, referred to Bitcoin as inappropriate for long-term investors. However, recent U.S. SEC filings show a different picture. The Vanguard Group owns more than 20 million shares, nearly 8 percent of Strategy Inc., a top-holder of Bitcoin with 601,550 coins at the time of this writing. Remarkably, Vanguard has possibly surpassed Capital Group as the top investor of Strategy. What’s Next for BTC Price? As Coinpedia has pointed out , BTC price is now in the euphoric phase of the 2024/2025 crypto bull market catalyzed by the rising demand from institutional investors and clear regulatory frameworks. From a technical analysis standpoint, BTC ’s bullish sentiment is bolstered by the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) that recently surged above the 70 level for the first time year to date. Additionally, the weekly MACD indicator shows an increasing bullish histogram with the MACD line above the zero line. In the 2-hour timeframe, the bullish sentiment is visible through higher highs and higher lows, an established characteristic of a rising trend. As a result, it is safe to say that a rally towards $150k is much more likely to happen than a drop below $100k in the near term.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/10t-asset-manager-vanguard-goes-hard-into-bitcoin-what-next-on-btc-price/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:45:16,"Anti-Bitcoin Vanguard Might Be the Largest Institutional Holder of MSTR Stock","Vanguard, the $10 trillion asset manager known in crypto circles for blocking client access to bitcoin ETFs, has emerged as the largest institutional shareholder of Strategy (MSTR), a company whose business model is built around buying and holding bitcoin. According to Bloomberg , Vanguard now owns more than 20 million shares of MSTR — over 8% of the company — surpassing Capital Group as the top institutional holder. The stake is worth about $9.26 billion. ""God has a sense of humor,"" said Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas, who has also written The Bolge Effect. ""Vanguard chose this life. When you have an index fund, you have to own all the stocks, for better or worse, and that includes stocks that you may not like or approve of personally."" ""Institutional dementia,"" said a somewhat less diplomatic Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck. “Indexing into $9 billion of what you openly mock isn't strategy,” he wrote in a post on X. Vanguard's exposure comes from passively managed index funds, not a deliberate bet on bitcoin or Strategy’s strategy. MSTR is included in several of Vanguard’s funds, such as the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX), the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund (VIEIX) and the Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG). These funds mirror the composition of broad stock indices and automatically include companies like Strategy when they meet certain criteria. Strategy, led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, has converted itself into a bitcoin holding vehicle, acquiring more than 600,000 BTC worth now about $72 billion since 2020. The company’s shares have become a proxy for bitcoin exposure, especially in the years before the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs. Still, Vanguard remains opposed to the asset class. The firm has refused to offer clients access to bitcoin ETFs, even as competitors like BlackRock launched the wildly successful iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which became the fastest ETF to manage over $80 billion in assets. Even the arrival of supposedly crypto-friendly CEO Salim Ramji in May last year hasn't shifted the firm’s position. “I think it’s important for firms to have consistency in terms of what they stand for and the products and services they offer,” Ramji said after his appointment.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/14/vanguard-accidentally-becomes-largest-holder-of-strategy-stock-despite-anti-bitcoin-stance,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|RESEARCH","Finance|Vanguard|Strategy|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:41:28,"$1,000,000,000,000 in T-Bills About To Flood Money Markets As Treasury Looks To Replenish Cash Balance: Report","Money market funds are reportedly gearing up for a big wave of new Treasuries to hit the market as the US government looks to stock up on cash. Over a trillion dollars worth of T-bills are expected to be issued in the next one to one and a half years as the Treasury positions itself to address a massive fiscal deficit, Reuters reports . On the demand side, money market funds reached a record $7.4 trillion in assets last month as investors looked to lock in higher returns before a potential rate cut from the Federal Reserve later this year or next year. As Deborah Cunningham, CIO for global liquidity markets at Federated Hermes told Bloomberg, “Five-percent-plus rates were nirvana, four-percent-plus is still very good — and if we dip down into the high threes, that’s quite acceptable as well.” According to Reuters, J.P. Morgan Chase, Barclays, and TD Securities have estimated new issuance of T-bills to hit somewhere between $900 billion and $1.6 trillion over the next 18 months, a jump in forecast after the recent debt ceiling resolution. However, in a new CNBC Television interview, ex-Bridgewater Associates chief investment strategist Rebecca Patterson warned that the market for US debt will soon hit a rough spot. “I think there are three main things driving the dollar [devaluation]. One is slightly lower frontend rates, interest rates over this period because currencies trade on rate differentials. But I think more importantly and what’s different this time is that you’re seeing both re-allocation out of the US both by Americans diversifying and foreigners pulling back slightly. And then third and really importantly is hedging. So let’s say I’m a large overseas pension fund, and I have a tech equity exposure, and I want to keep it because I believe in the structural story, but I’m nervous about the dollar, I’m nervous about the Fed’s independence, I can hedge out that currency risk. So even if money stays in US equities, which helps explain where we are today, you can still see that dollar weakness.” Susan Hill, senior portfolio manager and head of the government liquidity group at Federated Hermes, said that while the expected T-bill issuance appears large, the firm welcomes it and “feel that we will have no trouble accommodating it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-14T18:40:49,"Sequans Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold Move Towards Digital Gold","BitcoinWorld Sequans Bitcoin Strategy: A Bold Move Towards Digital Gold The world of finance is constantly evolving, and at its forefront, we’re witnessing a fascinating trend: publicly traded companies embracing digital assets. This isn’t just about a few tech giants anymore; it’s a growing movement. Recently, Nasdaq-listed Sequans Communications made headlines with a significant Sequans Bitcoin acquisition, further solidifying its position in the crypto space. This bold move signals a deeper commitment to integrating digital assets into traditional corporate balance sheets, raising questions about the future of corporate finance. Why Are More Companies Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption ? In a landscape marked by economic uncertainties and inflationary pressures, companies are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets for value preservation and growth. Sequans Communications, a leader in 5G and IoT chipsets, recently announced the acquisition of an additional 683 BTC, bringing its total Bitcoin Holdings to an impressive 1,053 BTC. This substantial accumulation, initially reported by @btcNLNico on X, follows a strategic funding round where Sequans raised $384 million through the issuance of common stock and convertible bonds specifically to finance its Bitcoin investments. This isn’t an isolated incident. The motivations behind such Corporate Bitcoin Adoption are multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Store of Value: Often referred to as “digital gold,” Bitcoin offers a decentralized and censorship-resistant store of value. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a company’s treasury assets, potentially enhancing returns. Strategic Positioning: Investing in Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and appeal to a new generation of investors. What Drives This Strategic BTC Investment ? Sequans’ decision to significantly increase its BTC Investment highlights a calculated strategic outlook. Unlike companies that might dabble in crypto with a small portion of their treasury, Sequans actively raised capital specifically for this purpose. This suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a strategic asset. For many corporations, the primary driver for a substantial BTC Investment stems from the desire to protect purchasing power and potentially generate non-operational income. As traditional interest rates remain low and quantitative easing continues globally, the yield on conventional cash reserves can be eroded by inflation. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, offers the potential for significant appreciation over time, making it an appealing alternative for companies seeking to optimize their treasury management. Consider the following aspects of a strategic BTC Investment : Long-Term Vision: Companies like Sequans are likely viewing Bitcoin as a multi-year asset, focusing on its potential for future growth rather than short-term price fluctuations. Investor Confidence: For some investors, a company’s willingness to embrace innovative treasury strategies, including Bitcoin, can be a sign of robust and adaptable leadership. Market Leadership: Being an early or significant adopter of Bitcoin can position a company as a leader in digital innovation within its industry. Is Every Nasdaq Company Bitcoin Ready? While the trend of Nasdaq Company Bitcoin adoption is gaining traction, it’s not without its challenges and considerations. Not every company is prepared or willing to take on the risks associated with holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin. Regulatory uncertainties, accounting complexities, and the need for robust security infrastructure are significant hurdles. However, Sequans is not alone. Pioneers like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a successful model for integrating substantial Bitcoin Holdings into a corporate structure. Other notable examples include Tesla, which briefly held significant Bitcoin before divesting a portion, and Block (formerly Square), which continues to be a strong proponent of Bitcoin. The key differences often lie in: Risk Appetite: Some companies are more comfortable with volatility than others. Shareholder Comfort: The reaction of shareholders can significantly influence a company’s treasury strategy. Operational Readiness: The ability to securely acquire, store, and manage significant Bitcoin Holdings requires specialized expertise and systems. Sequans’ decision to raise dedicated funds for its Nasdaq Company Bitcoin strategy suggests a methodical and well-planned approach, rather than simply allocating existing cash reserves. This level of commitment sets them apart and could serve as a blueprint for other companies contemplating similar moves. What Does This Mean for Your Bitcoin Holdings ? The increasing trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption by companies like Sequans has significant implications for individual investors and the broader crypto market. When a Nasdaq-listed company makes a substantial BTC Investment , it lends credibility and legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. This institutional validation can attract more traditional investors and further integrate Bitcoin into the global financial system. For those with existing Bitcoin Holdings , this trend can be viewed positively as it indicates growing demand and a maturing market. It suggests that Bitcoin is moving beyond speculative retail interest and becoming a recognized component of sophisticated treasury management strategies. However, it’s also important to consider the potential for increased market sensitivity to corporate announcements and macroeconomic factors. Here are some actionable insights: Observe Institutional Trends: Keep an eye on other public companies and their stance on digital assets. Their moves can often signal broader market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: Corporate adoption often reinforces a long-term, HODL (Hold On for Dear Life) mentality, focusing on Bitcoin’s potential over years, not days. Diversification: While corporate interest is bullish, remember the importance of diversifying your own portfolio and not putting all your eggs in one basket. Stay Informed: Understand the drivers behind corporate investments and the potential impact on market dynamics. The Future of Corporate Treasuries: A Digital Horizon Sequans Communications’ latest Sequans Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving nature of corporate finance. By actively raising capital to fund its BTC Investment and expanding its Bitcoin Holdings , Sequans joins a growing cohort of forward-thinking companies that recognize the strategic value of digital assets. This trend of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption by a Nasdaq Company Bitcoin is likely to continue, prompting more discussions in boardrooms worldwide about the merits of integrating cryptocurrencies into treasury strategies. As the digital asset ecosystem matures, we can expect to see further innovation in how companies manage their capital and engage with the decentralized economy, potentially ushering in a new era of corporate financial management.

OKX, a crypto exchange, directly partnered with payments behemoth PayPal on July 14 to enable users across the European Economic Area (EEA) to fund accounts and buy cryptocurrency using PayPal balances, linked bank accounts, or cards. The switch streamlines the on-ramp process by eliminating manual transfers and reducing friction, making PayPal a one-click gateway to digital assets for European consumers numbering in the millions. Sealing Trust Gaps with Trusty Financial Tools Europe’s a top-ranked cryptocurrency market in the world, representing 17.6% of worldwide transaction volume, yet adoption has too frequently lagged behind due to usability and trust issues. OKX’s partnership with PayPal now solves these problems instantly. PayPal, which is utilized by more than 100 million Europeans, provides immediate brand recognition and trust—two things most crypto exchanges do not possess. For new customers, the ability to fund crypto wallets through a familiar and secure interface eliminates significant psychological hurdles. “Having the capability to integrate with PayPal is a major stepping stone in our mission to bring crypto to the masses,” OKX Europe CEO Erald Ghoos added. “PayPal is a household name throughout Europe and globally, and integrating their secure payment solutions helps us deliver an easily integrated experience that adjusts to the evolving needs of users.” Seamless, Compliant, and Ready for the Market The connection extends to nearly 30 EEA countries and is done in accordance with the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation—a fast-emerging driver of exchange legitimacy on the continent. Once linked, PayPal accounts may be used directly within OKX without re-authentication or further setup, lowering barriers to entry and yet another sign that OKX is aligned with nascent European standards. Beyond the Buy Button: Keeping New Users While this alliance makes purchasing crypto easier than ever, OKX’s true test will be retention. An on-ramp for new users made easier may get them to come, but sustained commitment will depend on if the platform can offer value beyond buying. In order to truly derive value from this alliance, OKX will need to convert PayPal-funded purchases into repeat use, offering education, portfolio capabilities, and value-added functions worth repeat use. As the European crypto market matures, exchanges that will survive will be ones that not only open the door—but also entice users to return.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/okx-and-paypal-partner-to-simplify-crypto-buying/,"MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|FIAT","Bitcoin|Regulation|Web3",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:40:00,"Crypto Week in US Congress: What to Expect From the Biggest Push Yet","Key Takeaways: House Republicans are advancing three major crypto bills this week, including one on stablecoins. The GENIUS Act may pass quickly, but the broader CLARITY Act faces resistance from House Democrats. Lawmakers opposing the package cite concerns over governance and potential conflicts tied to Trump-affiliated crypto interests. Congressional Republicans are preparing for “Crypto Week,” in what may be their most consequential push yet on digital asset legislation, according to a July 14 report by Politico. The House is set to vote this week on three separate bills addressing stablecoins with the GENIUS Act, crypto market structure with the CLARITY Act, and a potential ban on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) with the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act. Crypto Week Kicks Off with Tornado Cash Trial Crypto week is scheduled to start today with the U.S. v Roman Storm case that puts the founder of Tornado Cash on trial for money laundering. The next immediate step is the likely passage of the GENIUS Act , a Senate-originated bill focused on regulating stablecoins. Bitcoin Economic Calendar for the week of July 14th (""Crypto Week""): Monday: Start of the Tornado Cash Trial, U.S. House of Representatives meetings to review the ""Anti-CBDC Surveillance State"" Act, the ""Digital Asset Market Clarity"" Act of 2025, and the ""GENIUS"" Act Tuesday:… pic.twitter.com/SARipkbi80 — Ledn (@hodlwithLedn) July 13, 2025 House Republicans have indicated they will advance the Senate version without amendments to expedite its arrival at President Trump’s desk. This would mark the first major crypto legislation to clear both chambers of Congress. A broader market structure bill, the CLARITY Act, authored by Financial Services Chair French Hill, is also scheduled for a vote. Unlike the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY bill faces more uncertainty. GOP lawmakers are seeking bipartisan support to demonstrate viability in the Senate, where 60 votes are required. Last year, 71 Democrats supported a similar proposal. That number may shrink due to opposition tied to the Trump administration’s crypto involvement. House Democrats, including Maxine Waters, are expected to resist Hill’s bill unless additional governance provisions are added. “Anti-Crypto Corruption Week” is the label some are using to push back against what they view as conflicts involving Trump-linked crypto ventures. Major Votes on Crypto Regulation Meanwhile, a third proposal seeks to prohibit a U.S. central bank digital currency. It is unlikely to advance in the Senate, according to lawmakers familiar with the process. Rep. Warren Davidson, a Republican who generally supports crypto policy, posted on X that he will vote against the GENIUS Act, calling the strategy to separate the bills “designed to ultimately fail.” “[The bills] will protect investors, consumers, and make America, as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation,” Hill said. The House Rules Committee meets today to set the voting schedule. Decisions this week will help determine whether the current legislative environment delivers long-standing industry priorities or stalls again due to political divisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What’s at stake beyond legislation? If passed, these bills could redefine the U.S. regulatory approach to crypto for years, influencing how stablecoins are issued, which agencies oversee tokens, and whether digital dollars are allowed to exist. How does this impact existing crypto firms? If the bills advance, exchanges, stablecoin issuers, and custodians may face streamlined federal compliance obligations, replacing the current patchwork of state-level requirements. Could this affect CBDC plans in other countries? If the U.S. formally rejects a CBDC through legislation, it could create divergence from international monetary authorities exploring central bank digital currencies.

2025-07-14T18:31:52,"Metaplanet’s Bold Investment: Unlocking New Frontiers with SGA’s $25M Rights Offering","BitcoinWorld Metaplanet’s Bold Investment: Unlocking New Frontiers with SGA’s $25M Rights Offering In a significant move poised to bridge the gap between traditional technology infrastructure and the burgeoning world of digital assets, Metaplanet, a publicly traded Japanese company, has made a bold statement. Its CEO, Simon Gerovich, is spearheading a strategic Metaplanet Investment in South Korean system software developer SGA. This infusion of capital, part of a substantial rights offering, signals a growing trend of crypto-aligned entities extending their influence into diverse tech sectors, creating new avenues for growth and innovation. What Does the SGA Rights Offering Entail? South Korean system software developer SGA has announced a substantial SGA Rights Offering , making headlines across the tech and investment communities. This financial maneuver involves the issuance of over 58 million common shares, aiming to raise a total of 34.5 billion won, equivalent to approximately $25 million. A rights offering is a method companies use to raise capital by offering existing shareholders the right to purchase new shares, typically at a discount, proportional to their current holdings. In this instance, it’s a strategic move for SGA to secure significant funding for its future endeavors. The backing for this offering comes from a powerful consortium of investors: Simon Gerovich: The CEO of Metaplanet, bringing a strong strategic vision and financial backing from the Japanese firm. Sora Ventures: A prominent crypto-backed venture capital firm, indicating a clear alignment with the digital asset space. KCGI: A Japanese college, suggesting an interest in fostering technological development and potentially future talent pipelines. Asia Strategy Partners: An investment firm that, following the issuance, is set to become SGA’s largest shareholder, underscoring their long-term commitment to the company’s growth. This diverse group of investors highlights the multifaceted nature of modern capital raises, blending traditional investment firms with crypto-native entities and educational institutions. For SGA, a systems integrator, this capital injection could be transformative, enabling expansion, research and development, and perhaps even deeper integration of blockchain or AI technologies into its core offerings. Simon Gerovich’s Vision: Bridging Traditional Tech and Crypto? The involvement of Simon Gerovich , CEO of Metaplanet, is particularly noteworthy. Metaplanet has recently garnered attention for its strategic pivot towards Bitcoin and digital assets, positioning itself as a significant player in the institutional adoption of cryptocurrency in Japan. Gerovich’s decision to back SGA’s rights offering suggests a broader vision that extends beyond direct crypto holdings. It implies a strategy to invest in foundational technology companies that can either benefit from the crypto ecosystem or serve as key infrastructure for future digital advancements. Why would a CEO deeply involved in Bitcoin adoption invest in a systems integrator? The answer likely lies in the critical role systems integrators play in connecting disparate software, hardware, and network components into a cohesive, functional system. As the world increasingly moves towards digital transformation, and as blockchain technology seeks broader enterprise adoption, companies like SGA become indispensable. They are the architects who build the bridges between legacy systems and emerging technologies, potentially including decentralized applications (dApps) or blockchain-based solutions. Gerovich’s investment could be a proactive step to ensure Metaplanet has a stake in the companies building the foundational layers of the next digital economy. The Role of Sora Ventures and Crypto Venture Capital in Mainstream Tech The participation of Sora Ventures , a crypto-backed venture capital firm, further solidifies the narrative of convergence between the crypto world and traditional tech. Crypto venture capital firms are increasingly looking beyond pure-play blockchain startups, identifying opportunities in established sectors where their unique insights and capital can drive innovation. Their investment in SGA is a prime example of this trend. What does a crypto VC bring to a systems integrator? Beyond just capital, Sora Ventures likely offers: Blockchain Expertise: Guidance on integrating blockchain solutions into SGA’s existing systems or developing new, blockchain-enabled services. Network Access: Connections within the broader Web3 and crypto ecosystem, opening doors for partnerships and new business opportunities. Future-Proofing: Helping SGA anticipate and adapt to the evolving digital landscape, ensuring its services remain relevant in an increasingly decentralized world. This investment underscores a growing confidence among crypto investors in the potential for blockchain technology to permeate and enhance traditional industries, moving beyond speculative assets to real-world applications and infrastructure. Strategic Implications for South Korean Tech and Beyond This multi-party investment has significant implications for the South Korean Tech landscape. South Korea is a global leader in technology, known for its innovation in areas like semiconductors, telecommunications, and software. An investment of this magnitude, particularly with international and crypto-backed participation, signals continued dynamism and attractiveness for foreign capital. For SGA, becoming a key player in this strategic alliance could mean: Accelerated Growth: The $25 million capital injection provides immediate resources for expansion, talent acquisition, and technological upgrades.

2025-07-14T18:29:02,"BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF just became its most profitable in under 2 years","BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (NASDAQ: IBIT ) has officially become the firm’s most profitable exchange-traded fund ( ETF ), less than two years after its debut. The milestone points to the growing interest in Bitcoin ( BTC ) on Wall Street, with ETFs serving as a key gateway for institutions to gain exposure to the asset. Notably, the success of IBIT has helped fuel Bitcoin’s ongoing bull run, which recently culminated in a record high above $123,000. As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $120,133, up over 1% in the past 24 hours. Since its launch in early 2024, IBIT has delivered returns of around 300% for investors, with demand surging amid Bitcoin’s rally, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. JUST IN: BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF is now the company's most profitable ETF, Bloomberg reports. pic.twitter.com/3YkmdWCUMw — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 14, 2025 IBIT assets surge to $88 billion In an X post on July 14, Balchunas called the growth “un-freaking-believable,” noting that IBIT’s assets have exploded to $88 billion. He added that IBIT is now the 20th-largest ETF overall in the United States and the seventh-largest in BlackRock’s entire lineup. I wrote last wk that $IBIT could hit $100b this summer, but hell, could be this month. Thx to recent flows + overnight rally it's already at $88b.

Most-traded ETFs chart for July 14. Source: Bloomberg The Bitcoin rally has been a major catalyst for this momentum. With the world’s largest cryptocurrency setting new record highs, flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have ballooned.

2025-07-14T18:26:52,"Bitcoin at $123K Makes Satoshi the 11th Richest Person – Will This Layer-2 Build the Next Round of BTC Wealth?","Bitcoin (BTC) has finally done it. After hovering just below its all-time high for weeks, it’s now shattered $123,000, setting a new record and making the legendary creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, the 11th richest person in the world. But for anyone today to match that kind of stake in BTC, they’d need over $135 billion in capital. Realistically, only a handful of names like Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos could actually pull it off. But what if there’s another path? One that doesn’t require billions – just vision, timing, and early conviction. That’s the case Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is making. As the first Layer-2 to combine Bitcoin’s base-layer security with Solana’s sub-second execution, the project aims to unlock programmability and performance, something earlier Bitcoin scaling attempts like Stacks and Rootstock struggled to achieve. Investors who see Bitcoin Hyper as a generational wealth opportunity – much like early Bitcoin itself – have already pushed it past $2.7 million in early-stage funding, with the $3 million milestone likely just hours away. The current presale price is $0.01225 per HYPER , but that will increase in six hours. With Bitcoin moving into uncharted territory, the chance to back its most promising high-speed Layer-2 at its current low price is slipping away just as fast. As BTC Reaches a New ATH, Eyes Turn to What Comes After For most of the past 30 days, Bitcoin had hovered below $110,000. But on July 10, it broke past its all-time high from May and kept climbing, surging over the weekend and peaking at $122,838 by Monday. The rally was driven by renewed regulatory optimism as the U.S. House launched “Crypto Week,” spotlighting bills like the Genius Act aimed at giving digital assets firmer legal ground. Next week, the House will deliver on @POTUS ' call to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. pic.twitter.com/T7lRm2Ux05 — Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) July 10, 2025 That boost in confidence, combined with institutional FOMO and over $1 billion in short liquidations, sent prices sharply higher. Once BTC breached the $118,000 zone, the melt-up was already underway. Now with Bitcoin at record highs, many market watchers believe attention could rotate to altcoins next – and then flow into newer, high-upside projects as Q3 progresses. As mentioned, Bitcoin Hyper is one of the standout new projects attracting early capital – especially now that the base-layer network it’s built on, Bitcoin, is pushing its native asset to unprecedented price levels. The reason? Many view Bitcoin Hyper as the catalyst that could transform Bitcoin from a passive store of value into a dynamic, utility-rich ecosystem. By making BTC programmable, scalable, and fast, it turns a traditionally static asset into something that can power the future of Web3. Bitcoin Hyper Turns Static BTC Into a Functional Force Suppose Bitcoin has already put Satoshi Nakamoto in the same wealth league as Musk and Bezos while being treated primarily as a static asset. What would be its potential if BTC could actively power high-performance dApps within an ecosystem that combines the industry’s fastest throughput and the most secure base layer? Bitcoin Hyper makes that possible by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) for near-instant execution while remaining anchored to the Bitcoin network through a decentralized, non-custodial bridge. BTC is locked on the base layer, and a wrapped version is minted on Bitcoin Hyper for use across its ecosystem. Zero-knowledge proofs and native Bitcoin finality ensure trustless execution with no compromise to security. When users want to exit, they simply burn the wrapped BTC, and the bridge releases the original coins back on-chain. This setup temporarily reduces BTC’s active supply while increasing its functional utility – and it positions HYPER, the token that fuels this ecosystem, as a key beneficiary of growing adoption. What If Bitcoin Hyper Becomes Bitcoin’s Breakout Layer? Bitcoin proved that value can be stored on-chain. But what if the next leap is showing what that value can do? That’s the core of Bitcoin Hyper’s vision – unlocking a version of BTC that moves at real speed. Tradable, stakeable, usable. It expands Bitcoin’s role from a passive store of value into a functional layer for next-gen Web3 applications. And if Bitcoin Hyper lists towards the end of Q3, just as crypto enters its historically strongest season, and adoption clicks into place, who knows what its upside would be. For context, early belief in Bitcoin rewrote wealth trajectories. If Bitcoin Hyper delivers on its potential, early participants could find themselves at the center of a major shift in how BTC is used. How to be a HYPER Holder The next asset that could get the Bitcoin treatment is Bitcoin Hyper and if you want to be part of it, you can scoop up its native token HYPER during the presale to lock in the lowest price possible. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper website . You can purchase using ETH, USDT, BNB, SOL or even a credit card. Bitcoin Hyper’s integration with Solana (via the SVM) not only unlocks lightning-fast speed for the Bitcoin network – it also makes SOL one of the accepted currencies in the presale. Bringing Bitcoin into the Web3 era calls for a wallet built for Web3, and that’s Best Wallet . HYPER is already featured in the Upcoming Tokens section, making it simple to track, manage, and claim. It also highlights the project as one recognized for its high potential by one of crypto’s most forward-looking platforms.

2025-07-14T18:16:18,"Top 3 Altcoins Ready to Explode After Bitcoin's Historic $120K Breakthrough","Bitcoin's recent surge to $120K has stirred the cryptocurrency market. As attention gravitates towards this monumental milestone, several altcoins are poised for a significant upswing. This article uncovers three promising digital currencies that are set to soar, inviting readers to explore these potential high-performers amidst the crypto frenzy. Ethereum Price Dynamics: Bullish Week, Mixed 6M Trends ETH prices over the last month show an 18.01% gain with a strong one-week advance of 18.40%. The six-month view reveals a -5.63% dip that points to earlier downward pressure and market corrections. The monthly rise signals a rebound from previous lows while the half-year performance highlights volatility often seen in Ethereum’s trading history. Indicators in this period have been mixed, reflecting both sharp recoveries and significant pullbacks. Current charts display price action bouncing between a support level near $1,735 and resistance around $3,254, with deeper caution signaled by a second support at $975 and a second resistance at $4,013. With the Relative Strength Index at 73.83, momentum at 535.70, and an Awesome Oscillator reading of 384.464, price action shows bulls pushing upward but facing clear barriers. Traders should monitor these zones closely; aggressive buyers might step in near lower support, while those holding profits could look to offload when encountering resistance. The lack of a distinct trend makes careful position management important, blending range-bound plays with breakout strategies for any bullish shift in sentiment. SOL Price Surge Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends SOL shows a sharp one-week gain of 10.23% and a solid monthly rise of 12.67% against a challenging six-month decline of 10.74%. This pattern reveals a strong short-term rebound that stands in contrast to a broader period of correction. Price movements have been volatile lately, with recent positive performance suggesting that traders are pushing the coin higher despite pressures from earlier market drops. Short-term gains capture renewed trader interest even while the six-month view paints a picture of lingering weakness. Current prices lie between $131 and $173.35, with immediate resistance at $191.79 and support found near $107.89; further out, a second resistance comes in at $233.74 and a second support at $65.94. Bulls appear to be taking a lead in the recent upswing, supported by significant weekly and monthly improvements. Lack of a clear long-term trend warrants caution. Traders might consider entering positions as the price nears lower bounds around the support levels, aiming for gains if the coin successfully tests resistance near $191.79. A break above this level could open the door to higher targets, while failure to sustain near support levels might invite selling pressure. The oscillators and momentum readings support a short-term boost while longer-term moves remain uneven. Cardano Market Insight: Recent Gains Versus Six-Month Correction Cardano showed short-term strength recently, rising about 30.15% over the last week and gaining another 19% in the past month. However, the coin lost approximately 23.45% of its value over the previous six months, revealing a stark contrast between the recent surge and ongoing long-term downturns. The price fluctuations indicate significant volatility; traders have had opportunities to adjust their entry and exit points amidst the mixed market conditions. Cardano currently trades within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, with this area becoming a battleground for bulls and bears. The nearest resistance sits at $0.83, followed by a second at $1.05. Support is found at $0.38, with stronger backing near $0.163. An RSI of 74.341 suggests overbought conditions, while moving averages provide mixed insights. Although bulls are driving short-term momentum, the prevailing long-term decline urges caution. Traders might explore breakout opportunities at the $0.83 resistance while maintaining stop-losses near support, as no clear uptrend signals further movement. Conclusion ETH , SOL , and ADA show strong potential following Bitcoin's impressive rise to $120K. ETH is gaining traction with its updates enhancing efficiency. SOL is attracting attention due to rapid growth and innovative projects. ADA stands out with its unique approach to solving current market challenges. These altcoins are poised for significant gains as investor interest peaks. This positions them as key players in the evolving market.

2025-07-14T18:10:41,"Crypto Markets Bifurcate With Institutions Focusing on BTC and ETH While Retail Chases Alts: Wintermute","The crypto market is splitting in two. Institutional and retail investors are taking increasingly different paths, with institutional players anchoring themselves in bitcoin BTC and Ethereum's ether ETH while retail investors pour into altcoins and memecoins, according to a mid-year report from crypto trading firm Wintermute. Analyzing over-the-counter spot trading volumes, institutional trading volumes with the two largest tokens held steady at 67%, likely backed by ETF inflows and structured accumulation vehicles, the report said. Meanwhile, retail investors dropped their BTC and ETH exposure from 46% to 37%, shifting capital toward newer, more speculative tokens. ""This divergence isn’t a temporary thing; It’s the sign that we are experiencing a more mature, sophisticated and specialized crypto market,"" said Evgeny Gaevoy, CEO and founder of Wintermute. ""Investors are no longer chasing the same trend,"" he added. ""Institutions are treating crypto as a macro asset, while retail traders continue to gravitate to innovation."" Overall, traditional finance (TradFi) firms were the fastest-growing cohort in OTC trading volumes, growing 32% year-over-year. That growth was being fueled by regulatory developments like the U.S. GENIUS Act and the EU’s ongoing MiCA rollout, which have given larger firms more confidence to participate, the report said. Retail brokers also saw strong activity, with a 21% rise in volume over the same period. Meanwhile, crypto-native firms dialed back, down 5%. OTC options volume jumped 412% compared to the first half of 2024, as institutions embraced derivatives for hedging and yield generation, the report noted. Meanwhile, Contracts for Difference (CFDs) doubled in variety, offering access to less liquid tokens in a more capital-efficient way. Wintermute said its own OTC desk saw spot trading volumes grow at more than twice the pace of centralized exchanges, signaling a shift toward more discreet, large-volume trading favored by traditional finance. The firm noted that memecoin activity has become more fragmented. While overall retail trading in memecoins declined, the number of tokens traded by individual users doubled, signaling a broadening appetite for micro-cap assets in the long tail of the market. With that, legacy names like dogecoin DOGE and shiba inu SHIB lost ground to a growing list of niche tokens such as bonk BONK, dogwifhat WIF and popcat POPCAT, the report noted. Looking ahead to the second half of 2025, Wintermute analysts said to keep an eye on spot dogecoin ETF filings with spot with a final regulatory decision expected by October. ""The outcome could significantly impact the retail market and set a precedent for other alternative assets,"" the report said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/14/crypto-markets-bifurcate-with-institutions-focusing-on-btc-and-eth-while-retail-chases-alts-wintermute,"MARKET|BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS","Markets|Wintermute|Bitcoin|Market|Institutions|Memecoin|Altcoins|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:10:05,"K33’s Bold Move: Bitcoin Holdings Soar to 121 BTC","BitcoinWorld K33’s Bold Move: Bitcoin Holdings Soar to 121 BTC In a significant move that underscores the growing confidence in digital assets, Norwegian crypto brokerage and research firm K33 has substantially increased its Bitcoin holdings , cementing its position as a key institutional player in the cryptocurrency space. This latest accumulation highlights a powerful trend: the increasing institutional embrace of Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable asset class. What’s Driving K33’s Bold Bitcoin Holdings Growth? K33, a well-regarded entity in the Nordic crypto landscape, recently announced a significant addition to its digital asset portfolio. The firm added a substantial 36 BTC to its existing stash, bringing its total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 121 BTC. This isn’t just a casual purchase; it reflects a calculated and strategic decision by the firm. According to information shared by @btcNLNico on X, this latest acquisition was made at an average price of approximately 1,119,121 Norwegian kroner, which translates to roughly $116,456 per Bitcoin at the time of the transaction. This expansion of K33’s Bitcoin treasury wasn’t a spontaneous act. The firm had previously raised a considerable $19.2 million through a stock offering, specifically earmarking these funds for Bitcoin investments. This proactive fundraising demonstrates a clear intent and a long-term vision for their K33 Bitcoin strategy. It signals that the firm views Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a core component of a modern investment portfolio, worthy of dedicated capital allocation. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Investments Surging? K33’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin is not an isolated incident. Across the globe, we are witnessing a growing wave of institutional Bitcoin adoption. What’s behind this surge of interest from traditional financial players and corporate treasuries? Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital alternative to gold, offering a potential hedge against currency debasement due to its fixed supply. Portfolio Diversification: For many institutions, adding Bitcoin provides diversification benefits. Its low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds can help reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth. Institutions are looking beyond short-term price fluctuations to capture the potential upside of this nascent asset class. Improved Infrastructure and Regulation: The development of robust custodial solutions, regulated Bitcoin ETFs, and clearer regulatory frameworks has made it safer and more feasible for institutions to engage with crypto. The commitment of firms like K33 to increasing their crypto investment showcases a broader shift in perception. What was once considered a niche or speculative asset is now moving into the mainstream, driven by a deeper understanding of its underlying technology and economic principles. Crafting a Robust Digital Asset Strategy: Lessons from K33 K33’s approach offers valuable insights into how institutions are building a sustainable digital asset strategy . Their method of raising dedicated capital for Bitcoin investments, coupled with their role as a research firm, suggests a meticulous and informed decision-making process. This isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it thoughtfully into a broader financial framework. For any entity considering venturing into the crypto space, K33’s actions highlight several key considerations: Dedicated Funding: Allocate specific capital that is prepared for the volatility inherent in digital assets. Research and Due Diligence: Understand the asset, its market dynamics, and potential risks thoroughly. K33, as a research firm, naturally excels here. Long-Term Perspective: Institutional success in crypto often comes from a long-term holding strategy, rather than short-term trading. Risk Management: Implement robust security measures and understand the regulatory landscape. The firm’s decision to expand its Bitcoin holdings serves as a strong signal to the market, particularly for other institutional players who might be on the fence. It reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is not just here to stay, but is increasingly becoming an indispensable part of forward-thinking investment strategies. K33’s latest move to boost its Bitcoin holdings to 121 BTC is more than just a transaction; it’s a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a strategic asset. By actively investing and raising capital specifically for crypto, K33 is not only enhancing its own portfolio but also setting a precedent for other firms considering a deeper dive into the digital asset space. This trend of increasing institutional Bitcoin adoption is a powerful indicator of Bitcoin’s evolving role in the global financial landscape, solidifying its position as a key component of a diversified and future-proof investment strategy.

In a series of press releases on Monday, Strategy , BitMine Immersion , Sequans , Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Metaplanet all announced that they are increasing the amount of crypto in their respective treasuries. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, perhaps the most well-known of the crypto treasuries, added 4,225 BTC ($504,242,765), bringing the firm’s total holdings to 601,550 BTC ($71,793,428,470). Japanese Bitcoin hoarder MetaPlanet also added $93 million worth of BTC, according to its CEO Simon Gerovich. Sequans, a French communications company and provider of Internet of Things (IoT) semiconductors, announced the purchase of 683 BTC ($81,514,274), bringing its total to 1053 BTC ($125,672,812). But not all the treasuries are focused solely on BTC. BitMine Immersion announced that its newest Ethereum ( ETH ) purchase brought the firm’s total ETH holdings to about $500 million. Says Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, “We are pleased that we added significantly to our ETH treasury just 3 days after closing our private placement. Clearly, Wall Street is getting ‘ETH-pilled.'” And Sonnet BioTherapeutics, a New Jersey-based medical firm, announced the launch of a nearly $900 million Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) Crypto Treasury Reserve Strategy. Hyperliquid is a decentralized finance (DeFi) and trading-focused layer-1 blockchain. Says Raghu Rao, Sonnet’s Interim Chief Executive Officer, “Following a thorough review, we believe this proposed combination with Rorschach provides us with a unique and exciting opportunity. We will be able to capitalize on the recent advancements around digital assets and equip Sonnet with funding to potentially realize the future value of our existing biotech assets. We believe this transaction and the strategic options it provides offer Sonnet and our shareholders with an innovative path forward and the potential for significant value creation.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto markets are exploding. BTC, for its part, reached a new all-time high of $122,838 earlier today. The king crypto is going for $119,523 at time of writing.

2025-07-14T18:00:21,"BLOK: Maybe The Optimal Blockchain Strategy, But Volatility May Be Too Risky For Many","Summary Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF offers concentrated exposure to blockchain and bitcoin-related companies, with top holdings like Coinbase, Robinhood, and MicroStrategy driving performance. The BLOK ETF benefits from strong liquidity and recent outperformance versus peers, but charges a relatively high fee and is not ideal for income-focused investors due to variability from period-to-period. Significant risks include high concentration in top holdings, volatility tied to bitcoin prices, and industry-specific financial reporting challenges. Given these factors, I rate BLOK as a Hold and suggest a modest 2-4% portfolio allocation for investors seeking targeted blockchain exposure. The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF ( BLOK ) is an investment strategy designed to invest in companies that engage in blockchain technology as leading innovators and infrastructure companies, as well as digital assets inclusive of bitcoin exchange-traded products [ETPs]. BLOK is a relatively concentrated portfolio strategy, with the top 10 holdings making up 41.26% of the total portfolio weight. The ETF’s top two holdings are Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ) and Robinhood Markets, Inc. ( HOOD ), two brokerage platforms that heavily engage in cryptocurrency trading and other financial services. Coinbase is in a unique position as a financial services provider given its breadth of utilization for cryptocurrency transactions. The platform engages in brokerage services as well as asset-backed lending for bitcoin-related organizations like miners and developers. Given the growing interest in bitcoin across enterprises, asset-backed lending has grown in popularity, particularly amongst the bitcoin mining firms like CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) and Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ). Coinbase and Robinhood make up 5.74% and 5.67% of the portfolio weightings, respectively. MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), now known as Strategy, is also a major component of BLOK with a weight of 4.64%. Though Strategy doesn’t necessarily partake in the direct development of bitcoin as a component of its core operations, the organization has become a notorious investor in bitcoin, acting as a “leveraged bitcoin strategy” for investors. In short, Strategy issues debt and equity to raise capital for additional bitcoin investments, providing investors with a unique vehicle for indirectly investing in the cryptocurrency. Roughly 20% of the portfolio’s weight is across bitcoin mining companies. In general, many bitcoin miners have been pivoting into data center hosting operations while simultaneously operating as bitcoin miners given that mining bitcoin has become increasingly more expensive following the bitcoin halving event in 2024. These bitcoin mining stocks are directionally correlated to the price of bitcoin, with performance generally varying based on cost efficiency in mining operations. TradingView The bitcoin mining industry may pose certain risks to financial reporting as the price of bitcoin can vary substantially quarter-to-quarter as a result of the mark-to-market reporting of digital assets on the profit/loss statements. Though diversification into other data center-related markets may provide stability for the organizations partaking, these industries are relatively crowded and specialized depending on the target market. In addition to operating companies, BLOK also invests in blockchain ETPs, providing direct exposure to the price changes of Bitcoin. This can provide a certain degree of stability when considering that many of the holdings in the portfolio depend on the price of bitcoin to operate. ETF Details BLOK commands a relatively high fee of 73bps when compared to peer portfolios being in the range of 51-68bps. Seeking Alpha Performance can be relatively volatile in the industry and may provide investors with large price swings throughout a holding period. Comparing BLOK to peer portfolio performance, BLOK has experienced substantial upside in recent months following the strong bitcoin performance. BLOK has outperformed many of its peers by a wide margin net of the VanEck Digital Transformation ETF ( DAPP ), which has performed closely to BLOK while offering a lower fee of 51bps. Seeking Alpha By comparison, BLOK may be a more appealing trading vehicle given its liquidity. BLOK has $1.11b in assets under management with an average of 312k shares trading hands daily, valued at $18.25mm. This can be a major asset to investors and traders seeking to actively manage a position in BLOK, potentially minimizing the cost-in/cost-out risk. BLOK also pays out an annual distribution with the most recent payout rate being $2.59/share, yielding 4.43%. Investors should consider the historical payout rate as distributions can significantly vary from year-to-year due to the performance of assets. Given this variability, I wouldn’t recommend BLOK to be utilized as an income ETF. Seeking Alpha Risks Related to BLOK BLOK is an industry-specific ETF, providing investors with a substantial concentration on the bitcoin ecosystem. This may pose a major risk to investors during periods of major bitcoin declines, potentially resulting in substantial losses in the portfolio strategy. BLOK may also exhibit substantial upside during periods of bitcoin value accumulation as the value of bitcoin directly impacts many of the portfolio’s holdings. Investors must also consider the financial risks related to operating companies in the ETF wrapper. The value of digital assets is reported on the profit/loss statement with large price swings substantially impacting quarterly reports. This can potentially impact the price performance of companies held within BLOK and may be reflected in the performance of the ETF. The portfolio also displays substantial concentration risk with the top 10 holdings making up 41.26%. The strategy is heavily dependent on the performance of the top 10 holdings, adding certain risks to diversification across holdings. Final Thoughts BLOK is a blockchain-oriented ETF designed to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin and operating companies that partake in bitcoin-related businesses. The strategy provides investors and traders with substantial depth for actively managing a position in the ETF, allowing them to enter and exit positions without the limitations of thin liquidity. Given the risks involved in trading bitcoin and related operating companies, I am recommending BLOK with a Hold rating with a 2-4% target allocation.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801130-blok-maybe-the-optimal-blockchain-strategy-but-volatility-may-be-too-risky-for-many?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING","COIN|HOOD|MSTR|BTC-USD|DAPP|BLOK",cryptocompare
2025-07-14T18:00:09,"Tether’s Grip On Stablecoin Market At Risk As Regulated Rivals Gain Momentum – Here’s Why","Amid the current tightening global oversight and a growing appetite for transparency in the crypto world, Tether ’s position as the leading stablecoin issuer in the sector is at risk from new and rising stablecoins. Fading Dominance Of The Stablecoin Issuer SMQKE, an observer and researcher, shared a report that shows that the firm could lose its robust grip in the stablecoin sector. According to the researcher, the leading stablecoin issuer “will lose market dominance to regulated stablecoins like the RLUSD in the future.” Presently, global regulations are being made that focus on the intersection of digital assets and traditional finance. One of the assets that fits nicely into these regulations is Circle’s USDC, which has won approval from the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). However, Tether’s USDT appears to be evading regulators’ demands for transparency in the way it operates its underlying assets. As a result, regulated stablecoins will continue to overtake USDT as the market leader in the future. “Only time will tell whether Tether will continue to leak market share to rivals or continue to hold sway with cryptocurrency fans,” the report stated. Stablecoins such as USDP, PYUSD, USDG, and RLUSD steadily challenge USDT’s dominance as they reflect stronger institutional alignment. This is because official regulations govern each stablecoin and have reserves that are mainly made up of liquid, high-quality assets. A Major Shift From Tether Coming Soon As the stablecoin landscape evolves, Tether, the largest stablecoin firm, continues to make steps to provide a reliable network. A recent report shows that the leading platform plans to let go of some of the top chains in the sector in the upcoming months. In a significant move, Tether, the first blockchain-enabled platform, has announced it will discontinue USDT support on five key blockchains. Such a move is meant to streamline its operations and bolster the network’s efficiency. The announcement was shared by the Phoenix Group, a crypto media on the X platform, on Sunday. According to the report, the impending disconnection is scheduled to take place in the next two months, particularly in September 2025. This strategic shift by Tether tends to phase out chains that no longer meet the changing technical or community standards of the stablecoin issuer. In addition, it reflects the firm’s increased focus on preserving liquidity and security throughout its ecosystems. The list of blockchains mentioned in the company’s report includes Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash, Kusama Network, EOS Network, and Algorand. Tether will discontinue USDT redemptions and freeze remaining tokens on these chains starting from September 1, 2025. As stated in the report, Tether’s decision to cut ties with these key chains comes after a strategic infrastructure evaluation and represents a move toward more utilized and scalable networks. Prior to the September deadline, the firm has urged users holding USDT on the affected chains to redeem or migrate their tokens to other supported chains. Failure to do so before then is likely to lead to loss of funds and assets.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/tethers-market-grip-at-risk/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX","Tether (USDT)|Algorand|bitcoin cash|Circle|EOS Network|Kusama Network|Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation|MiCA|Omni Layer|Phoenix Group|PYUSD|RLUSD|SMQKE|stablecoin|Stablecoins|Tether|USDC|USDG|USDP|USDT",cryptocompare

2025-07-14T17:59:56,"XRP Price Prediction: XRP Explodes as Volume Surpasses BTC and ETH – Can XRP Overtake Bitcoin?","XRP has outpaced its competitors as the crypto of choice among retail investors, reclaiming $3 during Monday trading as $11.8 billion volume bolsters the near-term XRP price outlook . This growing momentum suggests the recent 25% weekly gain could just be the beginning, particularly as the altcoin continues to outpace BTC and ETH in daily returns. BTC and ETH lag as the lead continues to widen, seeing just 10.5% and 19% weekly gains, respectively. The South Korean Market is Behind XRP’s $3 Move According to a July 12 X post from popular analyst Dom, a net spot market buy pressure of 45 million XRP was behind the move from $2.60 to $3.00. Notably, this inflow has been largely driven by international interest. South Korean exchange Upbit accounted for over 70% of the total volume, pointing to a strong global appetite. XRP Cumulative Volume Delta on different exchanges. Source: X, @traderview2. By contrast, market leader Binance registered negative flows, while Coinbase (11%), Kraken (9%), and Bitstamp (6%) played smaller roles in fueling the rally. Many of these traders, having missed out on Bitcoin’s early growth, have turned to altcoins like XRP. While some question the sustainability of retail-driven price movements, Dom suggests that such dynamics reflect the evolving nature of regional markets. XRP Price Analysis: Can Bitcoin Really Be Flipped? South Korean influence has propelled XRP beyond the falling wedge that’s capped its price since late February, triggering a breakout that could redefine the altcoin’s trajectory. XRP / USDT 1-week chart, falling wedge breakout. Source: TradingView, Binance. While much of the initial momentum has been realized, XRP has yet to reach its technical target at the 2.618 Fibonacci extension near $4.365—a further 46% upside. However, a rejection at $3 in line with past peaks could see a healthy correction unfold, with a potential floor at the 1 Fibonacci level at $2.66 as volatility cools. Still, momentum signals suggest this rally may still have room to run. The weekly RSI remains below the overbought threshold at 65, suggesting that buyers have yet to reach exhaustion. More so, the MACD line has also surpassed the signal line in a golden cross after over four months of bearish dominance. On the weekly timeframe, this is often an early indication of a potential long-term trend reversal. While overtaking the leading cryptocurrency is a bold target, wider market-warming narratives continue to add merit to XRP as a legitimate contender in this cycle.

With its longstanding SEC lawsuit nearing resolution and a spot ETF in the cards, retail interest may soon extend to global institutional investors. If that happens, XRP could form a new floor backed by serious capital inflows, supporting its long-term growth. XRP Misses The Highest-Gaining Cycle Narratives The truth is, XRP has been in the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives. On the speculative scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins,” the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come.

The cryptocurrency has now surpassed Amazon’s $2.3 trillion valuation, silver’s $2.2 trillion, and Google’s $2.19 trillion, positioning itself just $730 million shy of tech giant Apple. Source: Companiesmarketcap This remarkable ascent comes amid massive institutional adoption, with over 265 companies now holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5th. The latest surge liquidated $1.3 billion in short positions within 60 seconds as Bitcoin skipped past $120,000 and rocketed directly to $121,000. US spot Bitcoin ETFs maintained their seven-day buying streak, amassing over $1 billion in net positive inflows on Friday alone. Corporate treasuries now hold 3.5 million Bitcoin, with 853,000 BTC representing 4% of the total supply in public company coffers. Seven-Year Trendline Break Signals Historic Acceleration Bitcoin’s technical structure reveals a monumental shift as the cryptocurrency broke above a seven-year trendline on the monthly chart, representing resistance that contained every bull market top since 2018. This breakthrough coincides with Bitcoin achieving its highest daily and weekly closes simultaneously in history. Source: Crypto Rover on X The lack of significant upper wicks during recent rallies confirms sustained buying pressure across multiple timeframes. The weekly logarithmic chart maintains Bitcoin’s adherence to a powerful exponential growth curve intact since 2023. Current price action trades within an ascending channel with projections extending toward $200,000+ by December 2025. The mathematical progression has remained consistent across multiple cycles, with successive bull markets reaching exponentially higher peaks. Bitcoin Price Discovery Mode Targets $135,000-$140,000 Immediate resistance sits at $125,000, which market momentum suggests could be reached within days based on current trajectory. Above $120,000, liquidity maps show significant air gaps between current levels and $135,000-$140,000 targets. The 2024 breakout playbook indicates similar weekly moves historically opened doors for 50% rallies. Key support clusters around $115,500-$116,500 represent potential retest zones if profit-taking emerges. This cycle’s largest correction remains only 23.48%, well below previous bull market corrections ranging from 29-40%. Any dips would be structurally clean rather than trend-breaking events. BTC Hyper: Scaling Bitcoin for the $1 Million Era As Bitcoin approaches massive valuations, potentially reaching $1 million according to various models, transaction fees and network congestion become critical bottlenecks for widespread adoption. BTC Hyper addresses these limitations through an innovative Layer-2 architecture built on the Solana Virtual Machine. It enables instant, low-cost Bitcoin transactions while unlocking DeFi capabilities previously unavailable to BTC holders. The $HYPER token presale has raised over $2.7 million, offering early investors high APY staking rewards ahead of the Q3/Q4 2025 mainnet launch. Unlike holding static Bitcoin positions, BTC Hyper enables users to bridge their BTC holdings and access yield-generating opportunities through DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. As Bitcoin potentially reaches $200,000+ targets, network fees could price out smaller transactions, making Layer-2 solutions essential for everyday Bitcoin usage. Early HYPER adopters position themselves for both Bitcoin’s continued appreciation and the infrastructure layer enabling its mainstream adoption. With major exchange listings planned post-mainnet launch, the $HYPER presale targeting $11 million mark presents an opportunity for early accumulation.

The project reached a major institutional milestone when Nasdaq filed a 19b-4 application to list a spot SUI ETF in partnership with 21Shares. This development firmly puts Sui among a select group of alternative digital currencies being considered for such financial products. Although the SEC has yet to approve the filing, it has already contributed to positive market sentiment and increased visibility for the project. Additionally, Sui implemented important technical upgrades in March 2025 as a major layer-1 network challenging Solana . The Sui network integrated WebAuthn-based passkeys and zkLogin to streamline user authentication. These improvements allow users to access blockchain applications using familiar web login methods, lowering barriers to entry.

SUI/USDT experienced a slight increase, climbing from $3.40 to approach the psychological $4.00 level in one move. This upward momentum was supported by a rounded base pattern, formed last week, and is typically indicative of accumulation before a bullish reversal. However, recent price action on the 1-hour timeframe suggests the rally may be entering a cooling-off phase. SUI/USDT price chart, July 14 (Source: TradingView) The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently sits above 82, deep in overbought territory, indicating potential exhaustion in the near term. SUI’s price movement has begun to stabilize, accompanied by a slight decrease in trading volume from its recent peak, which is quite normal; however, developments like these point toward possible consolidation or a moderate pullback, particularly as traders may look to secure profits near the $4.00 resistance level.

While no crossover has occurred yet, this softening is consistent with a cooling phase. While technical indicators hint at short-term exhaustion, derivatives markets suggest traders remain overwhelmingly bullish. According to Coinglass derivatives data , 24-hour volume rose 135.98% to $8.60 billion, and open interest climbed 25.32% to $1.82 billion. These are massive inflows of speculative capital. The long/short ratio on Binance stands at 1.2056, while the top trader long/short ratio hits 2.2626, showing whales and top accounts remain heavily long-biased. SUI/USDT derivatives data, July 14 (Source: Coinglass) The market continues to punish overeager short sellers. According to Coinglass data, $864,000 worth of short positions were closed in just four hours, demonstrating how sustained buying pressure continues to dominate SUI’s price action. A measured pullback toward the $3.60–$3.70 support zone would represent the healthiest possible outcome for bulls. Such a retreat would serve multiple purposes—maintaining the integrity of the bullish structure while shaking out weaker hands and allowing for fresh accumulation before the next potential leg up. The key detail to watch for after this is the renewed buying volume when testing this zone, which, if positive, could set the stage for another move toward the $4.50–$5.50 resistance band.
