2025-07-15T08:54:24,"S&P 500 hits a new all time of 6,300 for the first time ever","The S&P 500 broke through 6,300 for the first time in history on Tuesday, as rising demand for crypto stocks and tech names sent U.S. markets higher across the board. This happened just a day after Wall Street posted small gains even with President Donald Trump threatening 30% tariffs on Mexico and the European Union, starting August 1. According to CNBC, stock futures were already flashing green before the open. S&P 500 futures rose 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.55%, and Dow Jones futures moved up just 13 points, or 0.03%. Monday’s session had already closed in the green. The Dow added 88 points (0.2%), the S&P 500 ticked up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite pushed 0.3% higher. With earnings from big banks coming soon and a fresh inflation reading around the corner, investors are loading up on risk. Bitcoin breakout pulls COIN and MSTR higher The rally in the S&P 500 is closely tied to a breakout in bitcoin , which surged above $123,000 last week and cleared its previous ceiling. With that resistance now flipped into support near $108,300, analysts are watching for a climb toward $134,500. The MACD is trending positive, and stochastics are turning higher, giving bulls reason to stay in. That breakout is fueling rallies in crypto-linked stocks. Coinbase (COIN) confirmed a move above $346, a price level that hadn’t been breached since 2021. The pattern is forming a long-term cup-and-handle, and if it plays out, COIN could run to around $460. Momentum is also building, with a Golden Cross—the 50-day average crossing above the 200-day, adding technical support. The last time bitcoin showed that same crossover in November 2024, the market consolidated for a few weeks before heading higher again. MicroStrategy (MSTR) is following a similar path, as per usual, riding bitcoin’s wave. Analysts have noted that COIN and MSTR tend to hold a 60% or higher correlation with bitcoin’s price, making them top bets for traders looking to gain exposure. The strength in these stocks comes just as retail interest spikes again, partly fueled by social media and a surge in attention on platforms like X. On Tuesday, Jim Cramer joked about the trend, calling Palantir, Applovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase the new “PARC” stocks in a post. “A new acronym for the meme stocks that just won’t quit!!! PARC!” he wrote . Although he referred to them as meme stocks, HOOD and COIN are heavily tied to crypto, and the market clearly isn’t laughing. Asia markets jump on China GDP and Nvidia chip sales Meanwhile, Asian stocks opened higher on Tuesday, with a boost from stronger-than-expected growth in China. The country’s economy grew 5.2% in the second quarter, beating the 5.1% estimate. But it still slowed compared to the 5.4% growth recorded in Q1. The data was released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics. The Hang Seng Tech index in Hong Kong rallied 2.14% late in the day. Traders bought up companies that import Nvidia’s H20 chips, after the company said it would resume sales to China. The top three gainers on the index jumped 6.83%, 6.41%, and 5.53%, though their names weren’t included in the report. Elsewhere in Asia , the Straits Times Index in Singapore climbed to a fresh high of 4,128.18, before settling at 4,124.71. That marked the seventh straight gain, led by stocks in industrials, consumer non-cyclicals, and utilities. In Japan, long-dated bonds saw heavy selling. The 30-year government bond yield rose 14.5 basis points to 3.191%, setting a new record. The move comes ahead of the upper house elections scheduled for July 20. 10-year JGBs reached 1.594%, the highest level since 2008, while 20-year yields moved to 2.634%, last seen in 1999.

2025-07-15T08:50:12,"SharpLink Gaming’s Bold Ethereum Bet: A Strategic Masterstroke?","BitcoinWorld SharpLink Gaming’s Bold Ethereum Bet: A Strategic Masterstroke? In a move that has sent ripples across both the gaming and cryptocurrency sectors, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming has significantly expanded its digital asset holdings. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a profound statement from a traditional company embracing the future of finance. The acquisition of an additional 24,371 Ethereum ETH , valued at an impressive $73.21 million, signals a deeper commitment to its innovative Crypto Treasury Strategy . What does this mean for the company, and more broadly, for the burgeoning trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption ? What’s Behind SharpLink Gaming’s Massive Ethereum ETH Acquisition? Just five hours ago, as reported by EmberCN on X, citing data from Arkham, SharpLink Gaming finalized its latest substantial purchase of Ethereum. This isn’t their first foray into digital assets, but the sheer scale of this particular acquisition underscores a growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value and its role in a diversified corporate treasury. For a Nasdaq-listed entity, such a public and significant commitment to a volatile asset like Ethereum speaks volumes. SharpLink Gaming, primarily known for its sports betting and iGaming technology, is now making headlines in the crypto world. Their decision to pour tens of millions into Ethereum suggests more than just speculation. It points towards a deliberate and evolving strategy to integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. This bold step positions them as a pioneer among traditional companies exploring the vast potential of the crypto economy, moving beyond mere curiosity to tangible Digital Asset Investment . Decoding SharpLink Gaming’s Strategic Crypto Treasury Strategy Why would a gaming company, operating in a regulated and established industry, pivot so strongly towards cryptocurrency? The answer lies in the evolving landscape of corporate finance and the increasing recognition of digital assets as legitimate stores of value and strategic tools. A Crypto Treasury Strategy involves a company holding cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet, much like it would hold fiat currencies, gold, or other traditional investments. Benefits of a Crypto Treasury Strategy: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, cryptocurrencies, particularly those with deflationary mechanisms like Ethereum, are seen by some as a hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets like crypto can diversify a company’s treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Potential Appreciation: Companies like SharpLink Gaming may believe in the long-term growth potential of Ethereum, viewing it as an appreciating asset that could significantly boost their balance sheet over time. Innovation and Brand Positioning: Embracing digital assets can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach, attracting talent and customers interested in Web3 and decentralized technologies. Operational Utility: For a gaming company, holding Ethereum could also be strategic for future Web3 gaming initiatives, NFT integrations, or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications within their ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. SharpLink Gaming’s substantial Ethereum ETH holding means they are exposed to significant price swings, which could impact their quarterly earnings and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies holding digital assets must navigate complex and often unclear rules regarding accounting, taxation, and compliance. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to protect against hacks, phishing, and other digital threats. SharpLink’s focus on Ethereum, specifically, is notable. Ethereum is not just a digital currency; it’s the backbone of a vast ecosystem encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications. Its ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) and upgrades like Dencun aim to enhance its scalability and efficiency, potentially increasing its utility and value. This makes Ethereum ETH a compelling choice for companies looking beyond simple price speculation towards foundational blockchain technology. The Accelerating Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption SharpLink Gaming’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a potent symbol of a broader, accelerating trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through Institutional Crypto Adoption . What was once considered a fringe asset class is now firmly on the radar of corporate treasurers, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds. For years, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has been the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption, accumulating billions of dollars worth of BTC on its balance sheet. Tesla also famously made a significant Bitcoin purchase, albeit with some subsequent adjustments. Now, with companies like SharpLink Gaming making substantial commitments to Ethereum, the narrative is shifting from just Bitcoin to a broader acceptance of leading altcoins as legitimate treasury assets. This trend has several profound implications: Market Legitimacy: When publicly traded companies invest heavily in crypto, it lends an air of legitimacy and maturity to the market, attracting more conservative investors. Increased Liquidity: Institutional participation brings significant capital, which can enhance market liquidity and potentially stabilize prices over the long term. Infrastructure Development: The growing demand from institutions spurs the development of more robust and secure custodial solutions, trading platforms, and regulatory frameworks. Shifting Perceptions: It challenges the traditional view of crypto as purely speculative, repositioning it as a viable asset class for strategic corporate finance. The fact that a gaming company is leading this charge with Ethereum is particularly interesting. The gaming industry is at the forefront of exploring Web3 technologies, including NFTs and blockchain-based gaming. SharpLink’s investment could be seen as a strategic alignment with the future direction of interactive entertainment, where Digital Asset Investment might become commonplace for developers and publishers. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Investment for Corporations As more companies consider integrating cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies, the experience of pioneers like SharpLink Gaming provides valuable lessons. The journey into Digital Asset Investment requires careful planning, robust risk management, and a clear understanding of the underlying technology and market dynamics. Actionable Insights for Companies Considering Crypto: Define Clear Objectives: Is the goal capital appreciation, diversification, hedging, or operational integration? Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the specific cryptocurrencies, their technology, market capitalization, and regulatory status. Develop a Robust Security Framework: Partner with reputable custodians and implement best practices for digital asset security. Engage Legal and Tax Experts: Navigate the complex legal and tax implications of holding and transacting in cryptocurrencies. Communicate Transparently: Inform shareholders and the public about the rationale and risks involved in a crypto treasury strategy. For individual investors, the increasing Institutional Crypto Adoption by companies like SharpLink Gaming can be seen as a bullish signal. It suggests a growing conviction among sophisticated financial players that digital assets, particularly Ethereum, are here to stay and will play a significant role in the global economy. It reinforces the idea that the crypto market is maturing beyond its early, speculative phase. The future promises a deeper convergence of traditional corporate finance with the decentralized world of blockchain. SharpLink Gaming’s strategic move with Ethereum ETH is a testament to this evolving landscape, setting a precedent for how other companies might approach their own digital asset journeys. SharpLink Gaming’s substantial investment in Ethereum is far more than a simple purchase; it’s a strategic declaration of intent. It highlights the growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem, validates the concept of a corporate Crypto Treasury Strategy , and underscores the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption . As companies continue to explore the vast potential of Digital Asset Investment , SharpLink Gaming stands out as a bold innovator, charting a course that many others may soon follow in the exciting intersection of gaming and blockchain technology. This masterstroke could well be a blueprint for the corporate treasuries of tomorrow.

2025-07-15T08:47:25,"Bitcoin Price Slips Over 5% After Hitting New All-Time High","The post Bitcoin Price Slips Over 5% After Hitting New All-Time High appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price rally cooled off in the last 24 hours, with the price dropping more than 5% after reaching a new all-time high of $123,231. This pullback comes as many investors decided to lock in profits at record levels that pushed to $116,700, when writing. While the market still appears structurally bullish, recent data and insights suggest a short-term consolidation might be underway before continuing another leg up. Profit-Taking Drives Market Pullback In Bitcoin Price Chart According to on-chain data from Glassnode, the correction strongly aligns with a significant spike in the realized profits. In total, investors realized over $3.5 billion in profits. Notably, long-term holders (LTHs) accounted for $1.96 billion, while short-term holders (STHs) contributed $1.54 billion. This level of profit realization by LTHs suggests a maturity in market participation instead of a newbie move. These kinds of investors are identified as those individuals or institutions who typically accumulate during bear phases and selectively offload during high volatility or market peaks. The current wave of profit booking shows that many LTHs saw the $123K milestone as a strategic exit point for partial gains. Over the past 24 hours, #Bitcoin investors realized $3.5B in profits. Long-term holders took $1.96B (~56%) Short-term holders took $1.54B (~44%) One of the largest $BTC profit realization days this year – driven mostly by long-term holders. pic.twitter.com/GK8Tww7JP2 — glassnode (@glassnode) July 15, 2025 Key Support at $110K May Trigger Next Bounce in BTC Price Despite the correction, some analysts remain constructive on Bitcoin crypto’s outlook. According to Mister Crypto, the recent decline could be healthy in the broader uptrend. In his view, if Bitcoin price revisits the EMA ribbons, which are aligned near the $110K level, which is also June’s previous high, it could create an ideal bounce scenario. TradingView He also hinted that in strong bullish trends, the EMA ribbons tend to act as dynamic support. If Bitcoin tests this zone and holds, it may quickly reverse higher, potentially targeting $135K in the next leg up. Institutional Holdings Reflect Long-Term Optimism In BTC Adding to the longer-term bullish backdrop, Mister Crypto also highlighted that Bitcoin Treasury companies, which include public firms holding BTC on their balance sheets, now collectively hold more than half the amount of Bitcoin currently held by all ETFs combined. This indicates that long-term institutional interest is not only growing but may be more influential than Bitcoin ETF flows alone. Such holdings often reflect strategic positioning rather than short-term speculation, suggesting that large players still view Bitcoin as a viable long-term store of value.

Bloomberg analysts now place the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval in the US at 95% The fund, listed as XRPQ and XRPQ.U on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is attracting investors with its zero management fees during the introductory six-month period, according to a Monday press release by 3IQ . The ETF provides direct exposure to XRP, with holdings sourced exclusively from regulated trading platforms and over-the-counter counterparties. One of North America’s First Publicly Traded XRP Investment Vehicles 3IQ’s XRP ETH stands out as one of the first publicly traded vehicles in North America to offer such access to XRP. As reported, the fund also amassed CAD 23 million ($16.7 million) in assets under management within just 72 hours of its launch. XRPQ entered the market with momentum, supported by a six-month 0% management fee and direct investment from Ripple itself. 3IQ President and CEO Pascal St-Jean noted the milestone as a sign of growing investor sophistication. “Retail and institutional investors are becoming increasingly discerning with their allocations, selecting this asset which offers a combination of the flexibility that comes with exchange-traded funds, combined with the 0% management fee at launch that contrasts with the higher premiums which were the hallmark of earlier digital asset ETFs.” Assets in the XRPQ fund are secured in fully segregated cold storage, ensuring robust security for investors. The ETF is also available for registered accounts across Canada and accessible to international investors where compliant.

This recent pullback is being viewed by market participants as a natural part of its price cycle, often following extended bullish momentum. Rather than signaling a trend reversal, the consolidation reflects typical market behavior as traders reassess positioning. With strong underlying structure and buying interest at lower levels, the correction appears more like a healthy breather than a sign of weakness. What’s Behind the Latest Dip? The BTC price shocked everyone, recording the highest weekly close, followed by a new ATH at the beginning of the week. Meanwhile, the price saw a surge in the bearish pressure soon after marking highs with a drop in bull dominance. Here are a few reasons that caused the latest Bitcoin drop. Profit-taking was triggered after the price marked a new ATH, which is a typical pattern after a strong rally The long-to-short ratio flipped negative , showing a clear drop in bull dominance as traders started shorting aggressively The Fear & Greed Index is hovering around 70 , which is a signal that sentiment is greedy and ripe for short-term pullbacks. Why is this Bitcoin price correction healthy? After a massive rally, the bulls have drained their strength, which has paved the way for the bears to ramp up their activity. Despite this, the current BTC correction appears to be a healthy one, and here are a few reasons: Corrective phases reset overheated signals: Corrections cool off overbought market structures—important for sustaining long-term uptrends. On-chain behaviour shows limited profit-taking : Short-term holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) remains subdued, implying most investors are not selling, suggesting this is not a capitulation phase. Strong institutional and legislative tailwinds : Ongoing U.S. regulatory progress (e.g., GENIUS, CLARITY Acts) and institutional Bitcoin accumulation continue to underpin long-term confidence. Macro backdrop remains supportive: Expectations of interest rate cuts later this year and broader investor appetite for crypto-assets continue to favour upside over time. Here are the Crucial Levels to Monitor The Bitcoin price witnessed a steep drop over the past few hours, causing a pullback of over 5% from the highs. Meanwhile, the price is trying to find a base around the local support zone between $116,594 and $116,892. The buying pressure has dropped as the selling volume has decreased. As a result, the price is primed to test the crucial support in a short while, which may further trigger a rebound. The short-term price action shows the price plunging heavily, which has dragged the stochRSI into the oversold range. The levels are preparing for a rebound, and if this materializes, then the price may experience a notable shift. Until then, both the possibility of a rebound to $118,500 or a drop to $115,260 could be in place. These are the crucial levels to monitor, as a rise or drop from these levels could impact the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally accordingly.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/btc-price-live-today-dont-panic-bitcoins-correction-could-be-the-setup-for-the-next-leg-up/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

We’ve just witnessed a truly remarkable moment as Coinbase, one of the leading names in digital assets, achieved a monumental feat: its Coinbase market capitalization soared past the $100 billion mark. This incredible milestone coincided perfectly with Bitcoin hitting a fresh Bitcoin all-time-high unit price, signaling a powerful bull run across the entire crypto ecosystem. Understanding Coinbase’s Historic Achievement It’s not every day a company crosses the $100 billion valuation threshold, especially one rooted in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. As reported by The Block, Coinbase officially closed with a market capitalization of $100.36 billion. This was driven by its Coinbase stock price reaching $394.01, up a solid 1.8%, marking its highest close since going public in April 2021. The stock even touched an intraday high of $398.50, showcasing immense investor confidence. So, what exactly does a $100 billion market capitalization signify for Coinbase? Legitimacy: It solidifies Coinbase’s position as a major financial institution, bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning digital asset space. Investor Confidence: Such a valuation reflects strong belief from both retail and institutional investors in Coinbase’s business model and the future of crypto. Industry Benchmark: It sets a new standard for crypto-native companies, paving the way for others to follow suit in terms of growth and public market acceptance. What Fueled This Explosive Crypto Market Growth? Coinbase’s ascent isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s intrinsically linked to the broader bullish sentiment engulfing the crypto market growth . Several key factors have converged to create this perfect storm of positive momentum: Bitcoin’s Dominance: As the pioneering cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s rally often sets the tone for the entire market. Its sustained climb to new record highs has injected optimism and capital into altcoins and crypto-related businesses. Institutional Adoption: More and more institutional players, from hedge funds to major corporations, are allocating significant capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets. This influx of ‘smart money’ adds stability and credibility. Increased Retail Participation: The narrative around crypto has shifted from niche to mainstream. With easier access through platforms like Coinbase, millions of new retail investors are entering the space, driving demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Concerns over inflation and traditional asset performance have led many to view Bitcoin as a store of value or a hedge, similar to digital gold.

2025-07-15T08:19:56,"AI predicts XRP price for August 1, 2025","Two artificial intelligence (AI) models are predicting that XRP’s current momentum is likely to push the asset above $3 on August 1. Notably, XRP has broken through key resistance zones in recent sessions, aligning with the broader market rally fueled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) new record high above $123,000. The surge saw XRP briefly touch $3 before retracing to $2.86 at press time. That price marks a 3.5% drop over the past 24 hours, though the asset remains up 26% on the week. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold For its price forecast, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which offered several scenarios for XRP. ChatGPT predicts XRP price ChatGPT, analyzing technical patterns and market sentiment, predicts that XRP will trade between $2.95 and $3.15 by August 1. Its single-point prediction puts the token at $3.08, an 8% increase from current levels. The AI model noted that XRP has already broken past key resistance near $2.50 and is now consolidating just below the psychologically important $3 mark, a setup that is often bullish in the short term. However, the model cautioned that resistance between $3 and $3.10 remains strong and may be hard to break without a major catalyst. To this end, XRP’s history suggests 5% to 15% moves when consolidating near resistance. Still, the current market environment, described as “greedy but not euphoric”, might support moderate gains rather than explosive rallies. AI price reduction for XRP. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts XRP price On the other hand, Grok, another AI model, also predicts further upside for XRP, with a target slightly higher at $3.10 by August 1. Its estimate factors in continued bullish momentum, improved regulatory clarity, and strong trading volume. Grok also sees the potential for XRP to test $3.20, though it warned of a possible dip to $2.90 if overbought conditions trigger a pullback. Ultimately, XRP’s ability to hit the expected $3 level will depend on how Bitcoin performs, as the asset has closely mirrored the leading cryptocurrency’s trading patterns. At the same time, if profit-taking accelerates in the coming days, XRP risks losing its $2.50 support, making it harder to reclaim the $3 mark.

2025-07-15T08:09:26,"YNE surges 80% after Yesnoerror integrates Grok 4, partners with Anthropic","Digital assets traded in the red on Tuesday as Bitcoin corrected from yesterday’s ATHs near $123,000 to press time’s $117,430. While most altcoins display substantial bearishness, Yesnoerror’s YNE decoupled with massive gains. It has surged over 80% over the past 24 hours, driven by AI-related ecosystem developments. Yesnoerror creator Matt Schlicht has hinted at revamping the platform using Elon Musk’s Grok 4. Also, behind-the-scenes moves involving artificial intelligence giant Anthropic added to YNE’s bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the altcoin turned bullish after a flurry of intriguing posts from the project. On July 10, Matt revealed plans to integrate Grok 4 “to scan research papers for errors.” What followed is a series of posts featuring phrases like “YNE summer” and “alpha-detection initializing,” revealing how Yesnoerror will leverage artificial intelligence to democratize decentralized science (DeSci). Meanwhile, today’s explosive gains came after the project’s creator confirmed late-night developments aimed at building tools that Anthropic’s co-founder, Jack Clark, requested. These advanced tools help uncover “AI alpha” in research papers or arXiv, a platform where experts first publish scientific work. “Last night, the co-founder of $60B+ Anthropic told me the 4 tools he needs in order to improve how he finds AI alpha in arXiv research papers. I am sitting down to build 3/4 of the tools requested.

Notably, Jack Clack outlined four tools that will enhance his ability to identify cherished insights in AI research. Meanwhile, the YNE creator started working immediately, building three of the four requested tools overnight. He promises to finalize the last one and share all with the Anthropic co-founder in the next 24 hours. Tomorrow, I will send Jack Clark early access so that he can start using Yesnoerror to accelerate AnthropicAI and provide us with his next requests. YNE price outlook The native token exhibits robust bullishness after gaining over 80% in the past 24 hours. YNE changed hands at $0.007328, with a 250% increase in daily trading volume signaling a renewed interest in the altcoin. Chart by Coinmarketcap The digital token appears ready for extended upsurges. Moreover, AI utility positions YNE for steady long-term performance. The project will token-gate access to its advanced research tools using the native coin. That means increased opportunities for YNE holders. Furthermore, the Yesnoerror community can expect access to resources previously reserved for insiders. Matt affirmed: We’re democratizing the research intelligence tools that billion-dollar AI companies use to stay ahead. Access the same AI alpha-detection methods used by top VCs and AI executives. YNE’s rally appears organic and not highly speculative. Thus, the digital currency will possibly gain more in the coming hours. However, continued broad market dips and potential profit-booking by YNE investors could limit the upside.

2025-07-15T08:04:02,"Gemini Predicts Ripple Price Surge: Here’s How High XRP Could Go","With Bitcoin hitting new all-time highs, investors are closely watching major altcoins like Ripple’s XRP, which could potentially follow in $BTC’s footsteps and post record-breaking gains of its own. Interestingly, when we asked Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot, for its 2025 price prediction for $XRP, it gave an initial technical target of $6.27. That would be more than 100% returns from the token’s current price of $2.85 . Keep reading to find out just how far and fast $XRP could run in the next few months, the key reasons behind this bullish outlook, and why investors are also backing SUBBD Token . This new project combines utility, innovation, and early-mover potential (just like XRP) and might become the next breakout winner. $XRP Holding Strong After a Breakout $XRP mirrored $BTC’s bullish momentum and broke out itself last week, surging out of a classic descending triangle pattern , which typically represents a period of consolidating prices. It’s worth noting that $XRP had been in this consolidation phase since the second week of January, which makes this breakout all the more significant and rally-worthy. At the time of writing, the token is trading just shy of the $3 mark, which is a strong psychological resistance level. If $XRP can sustain its newfound momentum, the next target is $3.3991, the previous ATH. Beyond that, it could climb to $4.2607, as projected by the blue box in the image above. We calculated this target by measuring the breadth (width) of the descending triangle and mapping it onto the breakout move, as per textbook technical analysis. Top Reasons Behind XRP’s Potential Growth XRP could well and truly exceed our projections thanks to several factors playing out in its favor. XRP Ledger’s built-in compliance features make it particularly appealing to financial institutions looking to join the growing momentum of tokenizing real-world assets like stocks and bonds. The network is actively working on integrating smart contract functionality, including an Ethereum-compatible sidechain , which could significantly expand its utility and developer adoption. According to analysts at Standard Chartered, $XRP is uniquely positioned to benefit from the increasing regulatory clarity around stablecoins. All in all, XRP’s recent surge is a strong signal that investors are now targeting utility-driven altcoins that could become the next crypto to explode . If you’re also looking to benefit from an early-stage but high-potential crypto project, we highly recommend checking out SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) . What Is SUBBD? SUBBD is a brand-new content platform that stands out from the competition in two key ways. First, it’s powered by cryptocurrency ( $SUBBD , the platform’s native token). Second, it’s among the first to integrate powerful and actually useful AI tools for creators. It’s worth highlighting that online creators currently have to put up with platforms that are, for lack of a better word, leeches that demand an arm and a leg while providing very little in return. Creators often pay exorbitant fees (sometimes upward of 70% of their total revenue) and don’t receive the kind of support, let alone help with content creation, that they should. Enter SUBBD Token, a new cryptocurrency project that aims to change that. SUBBD flips the script by offering creators a suite of AI-powered tools, including voice, image, video, and profile generators, which automates both the content production and management process. As a result, creators will get more time to organically engage with their fans. And that’s really the whole point of supporting homegrown creators in the first place: they’re relatable, authentic, and worth connecting with. $SUBBD Token Holders Get the Most Out of the Platform Creators who hold the $SUBBD token will enjoy early access to beta features, new creator tools, launchpads, and other creator-specific perks. And while SUBBD is undoubtedly a godsend for creators, it’s equally rewarding for the fans – so long as you hold the platform’s native cryptocurrency, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) . For starters, you can use $SUBBD to access premium content from your favorite creators. You’ll be able to tip and subscribe without paying a single penny in bank fees. Beyond that, $SUBBD holders unlock exclusive discounts on creator content and subscriptions, voting rights, one-on-one chat access with creators, and the ability to send personalized content requests. Staking $SUBBD also comes with serious perks, including a 20% fixed APY, daily behind-the-scenes (BTS) drops, exclusive creator livestreams, and in-house content from SUBBD’s top talent. SUBBD Token Is Currently in Presale Buying and holding $SUBBD won’t just unlock a variety of in-platform benefits, but it’ll also put you in a unique position to ride the platform’s growth. Our $SUBBD price prediction suggests the token could reach $2.50 by 2030, meaning you could see a brain-melting 4,400% return if you buy $SUBBD now . The best part? The token is currently in presale, so prices are among the lowest they’ll ever be. One $SUBBD is available for just $0.055925, and the project has in total raised over $800K so far. And here’s a detailed guide on how to buy SUBBD Token . For more information about SUBBD, read through its official whitepaper .

2025-07-15T08:01:57,"Crypto Might Be “Next-Gen” and “State of The Art”, But Mass Adoption Means Serving Today’s Customers","Crypto is one of the most innovative technologies of our time. This nascent area of innovation has proven to be capable of challenging the traditional monetary system status quo where central banks and large financial institutions run the show. Today, you don’t have to go through the likes of Western Union or Paypal to send money across the world; there are several cryptocurrencies, including BTC and stablecoins like USDT and USDC that can be sent within minutes through reputable crypto exchanges such as XBO.com , Coinbase, Binance and Crypto.com . But despite the value proposition, it is evident that crypto is yet to get the traction it deserves. Some of the most recent statistics indicate there are around 560 million crypto owners globally, this figure is a drop in the ocean compared to the number of people who use banks or other forms of electronic money transfers. So, what exactly does it mean to serve today’s customers? Before answering this question, let’s first highlight some of the reasons why crypto might be the big thing in money and finance. The Future of Money and Finance When Satoshi launched Bitcoin in 2009, the main goal was to introduce a peer-to-peer electronic cash system based on these fundamental principles; decentralization, trustlessness and resistance to censorship. Fast forward to 2025, Bitcoin is not the only crypto in the market, there are more types of digital assets that serving key purposes in the global money exchange and finance system; Access to Global Markets and Cross-Border Transfers One of the reasons crypto has stood out as a state of the art tech is the seamless facilitation of capital transfer without boundaries. Thanks to this technology, a freelancer in Africa can get paid in dollars through stablecoins; this makes it possible to not only receive fast and cheap cross-border payments but also access global markets, starting with the green buck to more sophisticated assets such as tokenized market instruments and commodities. Unlocking Liquidity for Real-World Assets (RWAs) The RWA sector is another crypto niche that is making waves across several markets. Imagine being able to purchase a fraction of a piece of property located in Manhattan or getting access to U.S. treasuries and bonds. That’s the main purpose of RWA’s – unlocking liquidity for such assets by making them more accessible through tokenization. According to a report by Standard Chartered, this sector has grown by 380% over the past 3 years, with projections showing it could eclipse $30 trillion by 2034. Transparency and Censorship-resistance The transparent and censorship -resistant nature of cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH is a feature that certainly belongs in the future. Instead of pushing for centralized financial institutions to be more transparent on important details such as fees, portfolio allocations and interest rate payments, why not have it all on the blockchain where anyone can audit the operations? What’s more is that crypto transactions on a blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum are censorship-resistant; this means no intermediary has the capacity to prevent a crypto owner from sending their funds. What it Means to Serve Today’s Customer For a long time, crypto innovators have been building amazing tech, but with one major caveat – it’s not seamless for the average person to navigate or onboard. Save for a few exchanges like Binance, Coinbase and XBO.com which have hacked the needs of today’s crypto consumer, the rest are still juggling between product-market-fit (PMF) and simplifying their UI/UX experience. But what exactly is the average crypto user looking for? At the core is a simple onboarding process and user experience. I don’t have to understand whether my funds are on Ethereum, Solana, Optimism or Arbitrum, all that most crypto users care for is if they can send and receive funds seamlessly. Luckily, for the exchanges that understand the importance of simplicity, we’ve seen considerate features such as XBO’s mobile app solution which is designed for crypto use on the go. Some of the features that support this type of functionality include a smartphone-optimized trading environment and customizable analytics with intuitive controls. XBO is also leaning into user-focused innovation through its ongoing rollout of its native token by offering benefits like trading discounts, cashback, and staking rewards—making participation in the platform beneficial for everyday users and encouraging full adoption throughout its ecosystem. Serving today’s customers also means providing them with more flexible ways of spending their crypto; Binance and Coinbase, for instance, both feature crypto debit cards as part of their offerings. This allows users to easily spend their digital assets without having to convert back to fiat. As much as may be controversial, it is imperative to acknowledge the fact that traditional payment rails also play a major role in enhancing the experience of crypto users. This calls for crypto innovators to partner or build more solutions that are not only compliant but also cheap and fast. In fact, this is one of the features touted by ‘advanced’ crypto service providers in the market today. Want to purchase crypto through a bank? Fine, a fintech? That also cuts it. Conclusion As mentioned in the introduction, crypto has earned its position in the fourth industrial revolution. But as things stand, the levels of adoption are still wanting; it is now time for stakeholders to focus on making it easier for the average person to acquire, use and sell crypto assets. After all, the technical infrastructure is already set and can support more user-friendly UI/UX without serious upgrades or modifications. However, the fundamentals of crypto (transparency, decentralization and immutability) ought not to be overlooked in the quest of making it ‘simple’.

2025-07-15T08:00:41,"Strategy Grabs Another $472M In Bitcoin—Even With Price At ATH","Bitcoin has been exploring new all-time highs (ATHs) recently, but Strategy still seems to be in accumulation mode as it has announced another large purchase. Strategy Has Bought 4,225 Bitcoin In Latest Acquisition As announced by Strategy Chairman Michael Saylor in an X post, the company has made a fresh Bitcoin acquisition, continuing its chain of 2025 buys. With the latest purchase, the firm has added 4,225 BTC to its holdings. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, the buy occurred between July 7th and July 13th, and involved an average BTC cost basis of $111,827. This means the 4,225 tokens were acquired for about $472.5 million. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $123,000—But Inflows Are Just A Fraction Of 2024’s Peak In the same period as the acquisition, BTC witnessed a breakout to new ATHs. If the purchase is to go by, it seems Strategy is still interested in buying even at these high prices. “Short Bitcoin if you hate money,” said Saylor in an earlier X post. After the latest buy, the total holding of the firm has hit 601,550 BTC. The company spent around $42.87 billion to assemble this stack and today, its value stands at $72.25 billion, implying a significant profit of 68.5%. Earlier in the day, another Bitcoin treasury company added to its holdings: Metaplanet. According to the X post by CEO Simon Gerovich, the company has added 797 BTC to its reserve, taking the total to 16,352 BTC. Unlike Strategy, though, the firm’s average coin cost basis is on the higher side, standing at $100,191 right now. In some other news, while the big players in the market have been buying BTC for a while now, data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode suggests retail investors have finally joined in. In the chart, the data of the Accumulation Trend Score is shown for the different segments of the Bitcoin userbase. The “Accumulation Trend Score” is an indicator that tells us about whether the BTC investors are accumulating or distributing. From the graph, it’s visible that the score has recently been pretty close to 1 for the 1,000 to 10,000 BTC cohort. This means that these large hands, popularly known as the whales, have been showing a near-perfect accumulation trend. The latest rally in the cryptocurrency may be a product of this conviction. While the whales have been buying, the rest of the Bitcoin market has been showing behavior that tends more toward distribution. The mega whales, carrying more than 10,000 BTC, have remained in selling mode with an Accumulation Trend Score around 0.3. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $118,000—But Liquidity Still Thin, Glassnode Warns Until recently, the hands with less than 1 BTC, the retail, were in a phase of distribution, but it seems the latest rally has caused them to change their tune, as they have started buying.

2025-07-15T07:52:19,"Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today? Whale Dump and Liquidations Rock Crypto Market","The post Why Is Bitcoin Price Down Today? Whale Dump and Liquidations Rock Crypto Market appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price today is facing fresh turbulence during a dramatic “crypto week, ” as a Satoshi-era whale triggered a major sell-off, sending prices tumbling below $117K. The sudden move spooked the market, erased over $400 million in long positions, and dragged the entire crypto sector down sharply. Bitcoin Crashes to $116K Amid Whale Activity Bitcoin price surged toward $123,000 earlier today but swiftly reversed course after an ancient whale wallet moved a massive amount of BTC. The flagship cryptocurrency hit an intraday low of $116,218 , marking a sharp downturn of nearly 6% . According to on-chain tracker Lookonchain , a wallet linked to the early days of Bitcoin transferred 9,000 BTC (worth over $1 billion) to Galaxy Digital , followed by another transfer of 7,843 BTC . This sudden movement ignited widespread fears of a broader dump. The Whale That Shook the Market What spooked investors even more was Galaxy’s subsequent activity—over $236 million worth of BTC from the stash was sent to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit , suggesting distribution was already underway. This led many to believe a large-scale sell-off was in progress. Adding to the concern, the wallet reportedly holds over 80,000 BTC , leaving the market vulnerable to further dumps. “The timing couldn’t be worse. Traders were already booking profits, and this whale just blew the lid off,” said one analyst monitoring the whale movement. $400 Million Liquidated as Market Sentiment Turns Bearish The whale’s action caused a cascade of liquidations . According to CoinGlass , more than $400 million in long positions were wiped out within just four hours, triggering a market-wide panic. CryptoQuant also confirmed a spike in profit-taking before the whale’s move, signaling that many traders were already skeptical of Bitcoin sustaining the $120K+ rally. The shift in sentiment was quick and brutal. Many large players flipped their positions from long to short , reflecting a defensive mood in the market. Altcoins Follow Suit — Ethereum, XRP, Solana Drop Bitcoin’s plunge had a ripple effect across the crypto market: Ethereum (ETH) dropped by 1.4% XRP and Solana (SOL) fell nearly 2% each Total crypto market cap declined over 3.2% , the largest one-day drop in more than three weeks. Also Read : US CPI Data Release Could Trigger Massive Crypto Rally—Here’s Why What Analysts Are Saying Crypto experts believe this sell-off could mark a local top , especially as Bitcoin failed to sustain above key resistance levels. The current move is also testing a crucial order block , a zone where buyers previously stepped in to support prices. “This kind of whale activity rarely happens without consequences,” one analyst said. “If distribution continues, we may see a retest of lower levels like $112K or even $108K.” Also Read : Fact Check: Will the SEC Drop the XRP Lawsuit During “Crypto Week”? Macro Factors Adding Fuel to the Fire Adding to the market’s fragility is the broader macro uncertainty: Regulatory tension in Washington over new crypto legislation Uncertainty around the Federal Reserve’s rate-cut trajectory Investors securing profits ahead of potential CPI surprises this week While bulls were hoping for a push toward $150,000 , this whale-triggered correction is a reminder of how fragile market sentiment can be—especially when old wallets start moving. Conclusion: Why Bitcoin Is Down Today To summarize, Bitcoin’s sharp drop today is primarily due to: A Satoshi-era whale moving 17,000 BTC Galaxy Digital distributing coins to exchanges A liquidation cascade wiping out $400M A sudden shift in sentiment and profit-taking by traders For now, all eyes are on whether more of the whale’s stash enters the market—and if other large holders follow suit. The next few days could decide whether this is a healthy pullback or the start of a deeper correction. FAQ Why did Bitcoin crash today? A massive transfer of 17,000 BTC by a Satoshi-era whale to Galaxy Digital triggered panic selling and liquidations. Will Bitcoin crash further? If more of the whale’s BTC is sold or if market sentiment stays weak, a retest of lower support levels is likely. How much Crypto liquidated today?

2025-07-15T07:48:10,"StanChart Rolls Out Spot Bitcoin, Ether Trading for Institutions","StanChart has launched spot trading services for Bitcoin and Ether through its UK branch, marking a notable milestone as it becomes the first global systemically important bank to offer institutional clients direct access to these digital assets in a regulated manner. The move allows corporates, asset managers and institutional investors to trade Bitcoin and Ether through familiar foreign exchange trading interfaces. The bank added that non-deliverable forwards would also be available soon as it expands its crypto product suite. “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements,” said group chief executive Bill Winters said in a statement seen by Cryptonews. StanChart launches bitcoin, ether spot trading for institutional clients https://t.co/veX75jJLgh — Reuters Asia (@ReutersAsia) July 15, 2025 Building on Collateral and Stablecoin Moves Across Asia The rollout reflects growing appetite among institutional investors to integrate digital assets into traditional portfolios. It also positions StanChart as a frontrunner among mainstream banks adapting to the maturing crypto market. StanChart has been quietly building its crypto footprint through a series of targeted initiatives. In April 2025, the bank partnered with OKX and Franklin Templeton to introduce a digital collateral mirroring program, aimed at bridging traditional finance and digital asset management. Earlier this year, in February, its Hong Kong subsidiary joined forces with Animoca Brands and HKT to launch a new stablecoin venture. The group plans to issue a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin under the city’s new regulatory framework and has submitted an application to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority for a license. StanChart Breaks New Ground as Traditional Banks Tiptoe Toward Real-Time Crypto Trading The UK-based lender, known for its focus on emerging markets and institutional clients, has been cautiously optimistic about crypto. The Wall Street Journal reported in April that both StanChart and Deutsche Bank were exploring new avenues to grow their crypto businesses in the United States, following years of regulatory pushback. StanChart’s entry into spot trading marks a significant evolution in how traditional banks interact with digital assets. Until now, most large financial institutions have limited themselves to offering custody or indirect exposure through structured products and funds. With spot trading now on the table, institutional clients can execute real-time transactions in bitcoin and ether, two of the most widely held and liquid cryptocurrencies, while staying within the bounds of UK regulation. The offering also serves a strategic purpose. By integrating crypto capabilities into its core financial infrastructure, StanChart can better manage client risk, deepen relationships with forward-looking asset managers and expand its services in a market that is increasingly moving on-chain. While competitors are still navigating internal policies and regulatory uncertainty, StanChart’s latest move shows it is betting on crypto becoming a permanent fixture in institutional finance.

2025-07-15T07:44:49,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Hitting $135K Amid Breakout Rally This Month","Katie Stockton, a renowned crypto analyst and founder at Fairlead Strategies, has predicted that Bitcoin will reach $135,000 in the medium term, indicating a strong bullish trend. Speaking to CNBC on Monday , she said that BTC would surge prior to the ‘corrective phase.’ Before this big breakout, there were almost 8 weeks of consolidation, which feels like “ancient history right now.” From the breakouts, the company has created “measured move projections,” assuming that the trajectory of the prevailing trend that had a corrective phase maintains itself. “That puts Bitcoin at around $135,000 as an intermediate-term objective,” Stockton said. “It seemed pretty aggressive a few days ago, maybe now a little less so.” Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091 on Monday , following massive institutional adoption. Over 265 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5th. Stocks Tracking BTC Would See Possible Surge: Stockton According to Stockton, Coinbase and Michael Saylor’s Strategy stocks that track BTC markets are also likely to perform well. Besides, she also cited Ether and XRP movements, adding that there is “positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies.” “From a technical perspective, we are seeing some pretty actionable breakouts, where some are major breakouts, some are minor breakouts,” she told CNBC’s “Closing Bell” team. Individual stocks that have performed alongside these cryptos have really benefited too, she added. The analyst identified a cup-and-handle pattern on Coinbase stocks, which further supports this optimistic outlook. Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has also maintained a long-term uptrend with highs and lows and now has a short-term breakout of its own. “So, there does seem to be positive action across the board,” she noted. Jamie Elkaleh, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitget Wallet, attributed Bitcoin’s growth to growing institutional adoption. He told Cryptonews that the sheer scale of ETF demand suggests continued upside. “A short-term pullback looks unlikely, with Bitcoin more likely to test higher levels in the weeks ahead,” he said. Further, despite ETF-driven inflows into Ethereum and tokenization narratives, Bitcoin dominance remains high. “Until BTC dominance decisively breaks below 62% and ETH/BTC strengthens further, Bitcoin will likely continue capping alternative layer growth.” The post Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Hitting $135K Amid Breakout Rally This Month appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/analyst-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-135k-amid-breakout-rally-this-month/,"BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin ATH",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T07:27:08,"A Bitcoin Whale, Dormant for 14 Years, Moved Thousands of Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital! Is He Preparing for a Sale? Here Are the Details","In a development that has caused a stir in the crypto world, a Bitcoin whale who has been dormant for 14 years has transferred his assets worth approximately 20,000 BTC (approximately $2.34 billion) to Galaxy Digital. After 14 Years of Silence: Bitcoin Whale Transfers $2.3 Billion in BTC to Galaxy Digital According to on-chain analysis companies, this is the first time the whale in question has sold Bitcoin. According to Nansen data, transfers from the wallet named “bc1qq…atjty” began at 9:34 PM on Monday night and were completed in seven separate transactions. Transaction sizes ranged from 500 BTC to 4,500 BTC. The final transfer occurred at 1:28 AM on Tuesday morning, completely emptying the wallet with a transaction of 3,160 BTC. On-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens confirmed that the sending address belonged to the whale that moved 80,000 BTC in 14 years last week. The platform noted that this was “the whale's first cash-out.” Analysts interpret the whale's decision to sell just as Bitcoin reached a record high of $123,000 as a strategic decision. The decision to cash out through an institutional broker like Galaxy Digital may indicate that the whale is now entering a profit-taking phase. Coinbase executive Conor Grogan suggested that this massive 80,000 BTC balance might belong to a single miner operating in 2011. On the other hand, analytics firm Arkham also stated that these transfers could simply be address upgrades. Bitcoin retreated to $116,600 on Monday after reaching a record high of $123,000. This represents a 3.53% drop in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: A Bitcoin Whale, Dormant for 14 Years, Moved Thousands of Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital!

2025-07-15T07:12:43,"US CPI Data Release Could Trigger Massive Crypto Rally—Here’s Why","The post US CPI Data Release Could Trigger Massive Crypto Rally—Here’s Why appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is facing one of his toughest weeks of his career. President Trump is demanding big rate cuts and even talking about replacing him. At the same time, the Fed is facing heat over a $2.5 billion renovation project, though it’s not using taxpayer money. Meanwhile, financial analyst Paul Barron says all this could turn out to be bullish news for crypto, especially Bitcoin. CPI Data Expectations The tension is set to peak as new Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be released today for June. However, last month, May’s CPI came in at 2.4%, slightly higher than April’s figure. Now, experts predict June’s CPI might rise to 2.6% . However, if inflation surprises to the downside, falling below 2.4%, it could give the Federal Reserve the green light to cut interest rates sooner. Lower interest rates would likely pump more liquidity into the markets, giving a strong boost to risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Recently, Bitcoin just broke the $120,000 mark, reaching as high as $123,000 . Analysts’ optimistic forecasts suggest Bitcoin could reach $130,000 before the end of July. Powell’s $2.5 Billion Renovation Scandal Intensifies On top of it Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is dealing with mounting controversy as the cost of renovating the Fed’s historic Washington D.C. headquarters has soared to $2.5 billion , nearly $700 million above earlier expectations. Crypto Week: Big Decisions Ahead It’s not just the CPI data release or the Fed drama giving crypto a boost. This week, the U.S. House of Representatives is calling it “Crypto Week” as lawmakers vote on key crypto bills. One of them is the CLARITY Act, which aims to set clear rules for digital assets and cryptocurrency markets and decide which agencies will regulate it. Another is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which wants to block the launch of a government digital dollar due to privacy concerns. The GENIUS Act is also on the table. It sets the first clear rules for stablecoins, helping both safety and innovation. Why This Matters for Crypto According to analyst Paul Barron, the stakes are huge. If tomorrow’s CPI numbers come in below 2.4%, the Fed might cut interest rates soon. That could bring fresh money into the market and push risk assets like crypto higher.

2025-07-15T07:11:00,"Top 4 reasons why the Pi Coin price value could go parabolic soon","The Pi Coin price value has plummeted by double digits from its all-time high as many pioneers capitulated and sold their coins. The token has plunged from nearly $3 in February to the current $0.4512. This article explores the top four reasons the Pi Network price is on the verge of surging. Pi Coin price value has strong technicals The first main reason why the value of the Pi coin is on the verge of a major breakout is that it has some of the best contrarian technicals. First, its sideways movement and low volatility is a sign that it has moved into the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. Wyckoff is a concept started many years ago that explains how asset prices move. The accumulation phase is characterized by low volatility and volume and sideways movement. It is characterized by slow buying or accumulation by smart money investors. The next stage is known as markup and is characterized by high volume and parabolic moves. It also happens when there is more demand than the available supply. There are signs that the Pi Network is now in the accumulation phase and will then enter the markup in the next few weeks or months. Further, the Pi Coin price has formed a giant double-bottom pattern at $0.4087 and a neckline at $1.6693. This pattern could trigger the next Pi coin short squeeze as it did with most altcoins this week. Pi Network token price has also formed a falling wedge pattern, which comprises of two descending and converging trendlines. It is also a highly popular bullish reversal sign in technical analysis. These patterns will become invalid if the Pi Coin price crashes below the lower side of the double-bottom chart pattern. Pi coin price chart | Source: TradingView Pi Network exchange listings The other potential catalyst that may push the Pi coin price higher is the slim chance that there will be exchange listings this year. Pi Network is now listed on just a handful of exchanges like OKX, Gate, and MEXC. While no major exchange has signaled that it will list it soon, at least one tier-1 exchange will likely do that. Some of the most notable companies that may do this are Binance, HTX, Kraken, and Upbit. Such a listing will push the token much higher immediately it happens. Crypto market rally The other key aspect that may push the Pi Coin price up is the ongoing crypto market rally . Bitcoin price surged to over $123,000 today, while most tokens like Cardano and Solana soared. Historically, a crypto market rally leads to gains across most altcoins as investors embrace the concept of fear of missing out (FOMO). There are odds that this rally will last for a while as Bitcoin and Ethereum rallies at a time when their supply in exchanges is falling. Ecosystem growth Furthermore, the Pi Coin price is expected to rally due to its ecosystem growth. Pi Network developers launched the $100 million Pi Network Ventures in May. This program will invest these funds to companies building products in the ecosystem. The developers also launched the Pi AI Studio recently. This studio will provide a platform for users to build AI applications, which is a notable thing because of the ongoing hype. Pi AI Studio will also be powered by tools in its ecosystem, like its .pi domains and the a network. Therefore, a combination of factors, including its strong contrarian technicals, ecosystem growth, and the potential for a crypto market rally will push the Pi Coin price higher.

The offering, rolled out through the bank’s UK branches, is available initially via our U.K. entity, during Asia and Europe trading hours, with 24/5 access under consideration as client demand evolves, said Rene Michau, global head of digital assets. “Standard Chartered is the first global systemically important bank to be offering cryptoasset trading.” Michau said in an email. “We define institutional clients as financial institutions such as asset managers and investors, and large multinational companies who are clients of our corporate and investment banking division.” Standard Chartered has been involved in crypto and digital assets for some time. The bank now offers digital assets custody and trading through its corporate and investment bank, and through the companies StanChart invested in, such as Zodia Custody and Zodia Markets. It also offers digital asset tokenization services, through its portfolio company Libeara. The new service is integrated into Standard Chartered’s existing trading platforms, allowing corporates, asset managers and institutional investors to access crypto markets through familiar FX interfaces. Clients can settle trades to a custodian of their choice, including Standard Chartered’s in-house custody service.

JPMorgan analysts say several big-named stocks appear overvalued and may be smart shorting plays for investors, reports Barron’s. JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman says Tesla (TSLA) currently has a “sky-high valuation” and expects earnings to plummet after President Trump reduced government subsidies for electric vehicle (EV) purchases. Brinkman also predicts that Tesla’s robo-taxi initiative is “likely to disappoint.” He is also bearish on Tesla’s rival Rivian Automotive (RIVN). According to Brinkman, the firm’s efforts to improve its balance sheet “will likely [be] hampered by reduced EV subsidies and tariffs.” Next up, JPMorgan analyst Kenneth Worthington says Circle Internet Group (CRCL), the stablecoin issuer, is due for a correction. “Circle is a market leader in stablecoins with amazing technology, we view competition emerging and its current valuation as excessive.” Moving on to the social media sector, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth says Snapchat (SNAP) faces continual hurdles, including big brand advertisers’ “volatile” spending as well as the firm’s “poor track record on execution.” Bumble (BMBL) is also earning a bearish outlook as JPMorgan analyst Cory Carpenter says the dating app stock faces a “structurally challenged” online dating sector, and the firm “is early in its turnaround effort.” Other stocks JPMorgan analysts say are among the best candidates for investors to look for corrections include the restaurant chain Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), chipmaker Intel (INTC) and fast-food chain Shake Shack (SHAK).

Key Takeaways: Abacus Market, the largest Bitcoin-based darknet marketplace, has gone offline in a suspected exit scam. Withdrawal issues blamed on a DDoS attack matched typical exit scam patterns. In June, US law enforcement seized crypto tied to BidenCash, dismantling 145 darknet and web domains. TRM Labs reported on Monday that the site, along with its clearnet mirror and infrastructure, is no longer accessible, leading to suspicions that the operators “have likely conducted an exit scam, shutting down operations and disappearing with users’ funds.” The closure may be linked to law enforcement pressure, as Abacus saw a record monthly volume following the June shutdown of Archetyp Market , one of the longest-running darknet marketplaces. Abacus Admin Attributes Withdrawal Issues to DDoS Attack Reports of withdrawal problems began circulating in late June, prompting Abacus’s admin, known as “Vito,” to blame the issues on a surge of new users and a distributed denial-of-service attack. TRM Labs noted that “this behavior was consistent with known exit scam patterns seen across other darknet markets.” Despite reassurances, users rapidly withdrew from the platform. Daily deposits plummeted from around $230,000 in June to just $13,000 between June 28 and July 10. Abacus specialized in the sale of illicit drugs, including stimulants and psychedelics, and operated a central deposit wallet supporting Bitcoin and Monero. After Europol shuttered Archetyp Market on June 16, many users migrated to Abacus, driving the platform’s sales to a June high of $6.3 million. Similar growth spikes followed the voluntary closure of ASAP Market last year, with Abacus’s share of the Bitcoin-based Western darknet market rising above 70%. TRM Labs explained, “Marketplaces that reach the top of the ecosystem… often become priority targets for law enforcement.” Over its four years of operation, Abacus generated nearly $100 million in Bitcoin sales, though the actual volume may be $300-400 million due to Monero transactions. Abacus Market is either fedded or exit scamming, take your choice… you would be a fool to continue using this market if it comes back up. pic.twitter.com/blw04aaZNZ — Dark Web Informer – Cyber Threat Intelligence (@DarkWebInformer) July 1, 2025 TRM Labs suggests the admins may have “lost motivation” or prioritized “self-preservation” over profit following Archetyp’s seizure and increased scrutiny. There is also speculation that law enforcement may have quietly seized the marketplace, gathering evidence while withholding public statements. However, the admin of the darknet forum Dread, closely linked to Abacus, expressed skepticism about this theory, noting that “official seizure notices have appeared months after a DNM has gone offline” in previous cases. US Takes Down 145 Darknet Domains In June, the US law enforcement seized crypto linked to BidenCash , the infamous dark web marketplace, accused of selling over 15 million stolen credit cards and personal data. The international operation took down around 145 darknet and traditional internet domains associated with the marketplace. Additionally, the DOJ recently seized over $24 million in cryptocurrency from a Russian national accused of developing and operating the Qakbot malware.

2025-07-15T06:50:35,"Transformative Cloud Seeding: Rainmaker and Atmo Forge Strategic AI Partnership for Enhanced Precipitation","BitcoinWorld Transformative Cloud Seeding: Rainmaker and Atmo Forge Strategic AI Partnership for Enhanced Precipitation In a world increasingly impacted by climate variability, the quest for innovative solutions is more urgent than ever. While many in the crypto space are familiar with disruptive financial technologies, the same spirit of innovation is now profoundly reshaping how we interact with our environment. A groundbreaking development in this arena sees cloud seeding startup Rainmaker forging a strategic partnership with Atmo, an AI-powered meteorology startup. This collaboration, exclusively revealed to Bitcoin World, marks a significant leap forward in the field of weather modification , aiming to enhance natural precipitation and address critical water challenges. Unlocking Potential: The Strategic Alliance for Enhanced Precipitation The partnership between Rainmaker and Atmo represents a synergistic blend of cutting-edge technology and environmental science. Both companies operate on complementary ends of the atmospheric spectrum, creating a powerful ecosystem for precipitation enhancement . Atmo specializes in meticulously studying complex atmospheric patterns, leveraging advanced deep learning models to forecast weather events with unprecedented accuracy. Their expertise lies in deciphering the subtle cues within the atmosphere that indicate potential for rain or snow. Rainmaker, on the other hand, takes this invaluable data and translates it into actionable interventions. Their mission is to “squeeze more precipitation” out of existing weather systems, utilizing sophisticated cloud seeding techniques. This involves deploying specialized agents, often silver iodide particles, into clouds to encourage the formation of ice crystals, which then fall as rain or snow. Traditionally, cloud seeding has relied on extensive human analysis and less precise forecasting, but this new alliance promises to revolutionize the process. Under the terms of this pivotal partnership, Atmo will deploy its formidable AI capabilities to assist Rainmaker in a crucial first step: identifying clouds that possess the optimal conditions and greatest potential for successful seeding. This precision targeting is paramount, as not all clouds are suitable candidates for modification. Atmo’s deep learning models can analyze vast datasets of atmospheric conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind patterns, and cloud composition, to pinpoint the most promising targets. Furthermore, Atmo will expand its service offerings by providing Rainmaker’s drone-deployed cloud seeding services directly to its customer base, creating a seamless solution for those seeking to augment water resources. For its part, Rainmaker will contribute invaluable post-seeding data from its proprietary radar systems. This data is critical for validating the effectiveness of their operations, allowing both companies to accurately determine how much additional rain or snow was produced. This feedback loop is essential for continuous improvement, refining Atmo’s predictive models and optimizing Rainmaker’s deployment strategies. It’s a true collaborative effort, where data drives decision-making and innovation fuels environmental impact. The Science of Cloud Seeding: Demystifying Weather Modification Cloud seeding , a form of intentional weather modification, has been around for decades, with its roots tracing back to the 1940s. The basic principle involves introducing tiny particles, known as “seeding agents,” into clouds. These agents act as nuclei around which water vapor can condense or freeze, accelerating the natural process of precipitation formation. Common seeding agents include silver iodide, dry ice (solid carbon dioxide), and liquid propane. There are generally two main types of cloud seeding: Cold Cloud Seeding: This method targets clouds where temperatures are below freezing. Agents like silver iodide, which has a crystal structure similar to ice, encourage supercooled water droplets (liquid water below freezing point) to freeze and grow into ice crystals. These crystals then become heavy enough to fall as snow or melt into rain as they descend. This is commonly used to enhance snowpack in mountainous regions. Warm Cloud Seeding: This method is less common and targets clouds that are above freezing temperatures. Hygroscopic materials, like salt, are dispersed to promote the growth of water droplets through collision and coalescence, leading to rain. Rainmaker’s use of small drones for deployment represents a significant advancement. Drones offer precision, flexibility, and reduced operational costs compared to traditional methods like aircraft or ground-based generators. This allows for more targeted and efficient seeding operations, directly impacting the efficacy of precipitation enhancement efforts. AI Meteorology: Revolutionizing Forecasts and Interventions The integration of AI meteorology is where Atmo truly shines, transforming the speculative art of weather prediction into a data-driven science. Traditional meteorological models rely on complex physical equations and vast computational power. While effective, they can be limited by the sheer volume and complexity of atmospheric data, often leading to uncertainties in localized or short-term forecasts. Atmo’s deep learning models, a subset of artificial intelligence, excel at identifying intricate patterns and correlations within massive datasets that might be invisible to human analysis or traditional algorithms. These models can process: Satellite Imagery: Analyzing cloud formations, movements, and characteristics over time. Radar Data: Detecting precipitation intensity, type, and movement. Ground-Based Sensors: Collecting real-time data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. Historical Weather Records: Learning from past events to predict future outcomes with greater accuracy. By leveraging AI, Atmo can provide Rainmaker with highly precise, localized forecasts on cloud conditions, predicting not just if a cloud will rain, but also its potential to respond to seeding. This intelligent targeting ensures that resources are deployed efficiently, maximizing the impact of each seeding operation and making weather modification efforts far more effective than ever before. Addressing the Storm: Separating Fact from Fiction in Climate Technology The rise of innovative climate technology , while promising, often comes with its share of public scrutiny and misinformation. Rainmaker has recently found itself at the center of a storm of conspiracy theories, with some individuals alleging that their cloud seeding operations in Texas contributed to recent floods in the state. Such claims highlight a broader public misunderstanding of how weather modification truly works and its actual scale of impact. However, leading scientists and atmospheric experts vehemently refute these claims. “Somebody is looking for somebody to blame,” stated Bob Rauber, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Illinois, in an interview with Bitcoin World. He emphasized that while cloud seeding can indeed “nudge” clouds to release more precipitation, the amount is minuscule when compared to the colossal scale of a natural storm system. For context, one well-documented cloud seeding case in Idaho resulted in an additional 186 million gallons of precipitation. While seemingly large, this pales in comparison to the “trillions of gallons of water” that a major storm naturally processes. It’s crucial to understand that cloud seeding is not about “creating” rain or manipulating entire weather systems. Instead, it’s about optimizing existing conditions within a cloud to enhance its natural precipitation efficiency by a small percentage. Attributing large-scale natural disasters like floods to targeted, localized cloud seeding operations is simply not scientifically plausible. These operations are designed to augment, not overwhelm, natural processes. Regional Effectiveness: Where Does Precipitation Enhancement Truly Shine? The efficacy of precipitation enhancement through cloud seeding varies significantly depending on geographical location and the type of cloud system targeted. Cloud seeding is widely employed across the Western United States, primarily to augment snowpack. The goal here is to increase the amount of snow that accumulates in mountain ranges during winter, which then melts in the spring and summer, replenishing vital reservoirs and supporting agriculture and urban water supplies. In these cold, mountainous regions, cloud seeding has shown demonstrable, albeit modest, success. However, the results are often less pronounced in other areas, such as West Texas, where Rainmaker has previously operated and where the focus is on coaxing more rain from summer storms. The West Texas Weather Modification Association, an entity Rainmaker has collaborated with, reports that cloud seeding in the region has historically boosted precipitation by approximately 15%, equating to about two additional inches per year. While beneficial, this is a relatively modest gain. Professor Rauber explains the likely reason for this disparity: the types of clouds prevalent over West Texas respond differently to seeding agents compared to the cloud formations found in mountainous regions. Rainstorms, especially those already primed to drop significant precipitation, are generally less responsive to seeding interventions. This highlights the importance of precise targeting, which Atmo’s AI meteorology is designed to improve, by identifying those specific cloud types and conditions most amenable to successful seeding. The Broader Horizon: Climate Technology and Water Security The partnership between Rainmaker and Atmo underscores a growing trend in the innovation landscape: the increasing convergence of advanced technologies like AI with critical environmental challenges. As climate change continues to impact global water resources, solutions like targeted weather modification become increasingly relevant. While not a silver bullet, such technologies can play a role in a broader strategy for water security, alongside conservation, improved infrastructure, and sustainable water management practices. The collaboration also highlights the vital role of startups in pioneering these solutions. Companies like Rainmaker and Atmo are agile, innovative, and capable of rapid development and deployment of technologies that traditional institutions might struggle to implement quickly. Their work contributes to a diverse portfolio of climate tech solutions, ranging from carbon capture and renewable energy to precision agriculture and water management. The future of climate technology will undoubtedly see more such partnerships, where specialized expertise in AI, data science, and environmental engineering combine to tackle complex problems. The challenges are immense, but the potential for impactful innovation, driven by strategic alliances and scientific rigor, offers a beacon of hope. Conclusion: A New Era for Precipitation Enhancement The strategic alliance between Rainmaker and Atmo marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of weather modification . By combining Rainmaker’s advanced cloud seeding capabilities with Atmo’s cutting-edge AI meteorology , this partnership promises to bring unprecedented precision and effectiveness to precipitation enhancement efforts. While the technology faces public scrutiny and requires careful scientific validation, the potential benefits for water security and climate resilience are undeniable. This collaboration exemplifies how innovative startups are leveraging advanced technologies to address some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the realm of climate technology and offering a glimpse into a future where human ingenuity helps us adapt to a changing planet.

(Analyst)","TL;DR Ripple’s native token skyrocketed to just over $3 yesterday, reaching its highest price tag in over four months. Although it was stopped there, at least for now, one popular analyst believes a new all-time high could be just around the corner. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView It has been a fantastic period for the entire cryptocurrency market, which started last Wednesday and culminated (at least for now) yesterday when bitcoin soared by over $15,000 and charted a new all-time high at just over $123,000. XRP also benefited from the market revival and shot up from its consolidation range of around $2.2-$2.3 to $3.05 (on Bitstamp), thus exceeding that level for the first time since early March. Ripple’s token broke out of the consolidation phase by confirming an inverse head and shoulders pattern. Now, the same analyst who predicted the price surge from $2.3 to $2.6 and beyond is making even bolder claims. “XRP is testing the top of the channel at $3. A weekly close above the $3 resistance could trigger a breakout to $4.80,” Martinez said , which would automatically mean uncharted territory, since the asset’s current peak stands at $3.4, according to CoinGecko. Consequently, Martinez, who has roughly 140,000 followers on X, asked, “XRP is screaming all-time highs – are you seeing this?” The cross-border token, which became the third-largest in the cryptocurrency market after its rally last week, was stopped at the $3 resistance and now sits below $2.9. However, the overall market sentiment remains highly bullish, and today’s correction has been perceived as a healthy one following several days of “up only” trading action. History is also on XRP’s side. As reported recently, the asset’s latest performance has mirrored a 2017 pattern, which resulted in a massive triple-digit price surge. As such, another analyst predicted a 250% pump that could drive XRP toward $10. Meanwhile, the CEO of SBI Global Asset Management praised the third-largest cryptocurrency due to its growing role in global remittance and claimed that it represents “the wealth transfer of our generation.” The post XRP Is Screaming for New All-Time Highs: Are You Seeing This?

2025-07-15T06:35:10,"Corporate Ethereum Treasuries Expand Rapidly as Institutions Pour In","Over the past month, corporate Ethereum treasuries have significantly expanded, collectively acquiring more than $1.6 billion in Ether (ETH). Recent disclosures show that top firms have accumulated over 545,000 ETH in just 30 days, amid a surge in institutional interest driven by market optimism around Ethereum’s long-term utility. One of the most notable disclosures came from BitMine Immersion Technologies. The company, chaired by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, reported total Ether holdings of 163,142 ETH. At the current market valuation, this stash is worth approximately $480 million. Lee compared this buying behavior to that of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy, suggesting that firms acquiring even 5% of Ethereum’s total supply may benefit from what he termed a “Wall Street put.” He believes Ethereum is gaining similar institutional traction to what Bitcoin previously enjoyed. SharpLink Leads Ethereum Accumulation At the forefront of this Ethereum buying spree is SharpLink, a gaming platform founded by Joseph Lubin. SharpLink purchased 10,000 ETH on July 11, followed by 16,370 ETH on July 13, and an additional 24,371 ETH worth $73.2 million on July 15. These acquisitions bring its total ETH holdings to more than 255,000, making it the largest corporate holder of Ether to date. Lubin, who is also the founder of Consensys, jokingly referred to himself as a “self-appointed representative of The League of Extraordinary ETH Accumulator Gentlemen,” acknowledging BitMine and others for ramping up their acquisitions. Broader Corporate Interest in Ethereum The Ethereum accumulation trend isn’t limited to just two firms. Bit Digital, a digital asset platform, holds over 100,000 ETH. Blockchain Technology Consensus Solutions (BTCS) has also moved aggressively, raising $62.4 million to grow its Ethereum reserves to 29,122 ETH. Meanwhile, GameSquare announced on July 8 that it plans to build a $100 million Ethereum treasury as part of a broader strategic investment. These moves reflect a growing belief in Ethereum’s role as a critical asset in the evolving digital economy. ETH Funds See Record Inflows This surge in corporate ETH acquisitions coincides with a strong performance in Ethereum-based digital investment funds. CoinShares reported that these funds posted $990 million in inflows last week, marking their twelfth consecutive week of positive flows. It was also the fourth-largest weekly inflow on record. Year-to-date, Ethereum funds have attracted more than $4 billion in capital. Nearly 30% of that came in the past two weeks alone, signaling a steep rise in institutional appetite. According to CoinShares, Ethereum inflows now represent 19.5% of all assets under management for global Ether funds, compared to just 9.8% for Bitcoin funds. ETH Price Action Reflects Growing Demand Ethereum’s price climbed above $3,000 for the first time since February on July 11, though it later dipped slightly below that mark. Despite the pullback, ETH still posted a 17% gain for the week, underlining renewed market confidence driven in part by these large-scale corporate and institutional investments.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/corporate-ethereum-treasuries-expand-rapidly-as-institutions-pour-in/,"ETH|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN","Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
