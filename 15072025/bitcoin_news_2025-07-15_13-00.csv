2025-07-15T10:57:47,"Ripple News : Is It the Right Time to Buy XRP?","The post Ripple News : Is It the Right Time to Buy XRP? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Search interest in “Buy XRP” is rising sharply, just as the XRP community gears up for the launch of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 18 . With the token already up more than 445% over the past year, many are wondering if now is the right time to get in. But looking at past trends, spikes in search volume have often followed big rallies, not preceded them, raising doubts about whether this is a good entry point. Why XRP Price Is Down Today Despite Proshares ETF Launch ? Google Trends Spike: “Buy XRP” Back on the Radar According to Google Trends, global searches for “Buy XRP” have climbed to a score of 32 out of 100 on a five-year scale the highest level in recent months. However, this is still far below the December 2024 peak , when search interest was near its highest levels ever. Interestingly, back in November 2024 , the XRP price delivered an explosive 281.7% monthly return . But by the time search interest peaked in December, the price gains had slowed to just 6.94% . This illustrates a classic pattern in crypto markets: retail interest often surges after the rally, not before . So while search spikes may indicate increased curiosity, they don’t necessarily confirm a fresh breakout. Should You Buy XRP Now? This is the most searched question right now: Is this the right time to buy XRP? Historical data suggests that when fewer people were searching “Buy XRP,” the best gains occurred . Between mid-2022 and late 2023, search activity remained low, yet XRP quietly delivered outsized returns. In Q3 2022, XRP gained 44.5% . The first quarter of 2023 saw a dramatic turnaround, with the token jumping from -29.2% to +58.8% . By the end of 2023, XRP had delivered 82.5% growth , and in 2024, it added another +235.7% . These figures suggest that the best opportunities often appear when the crowd is quiet , not when search interest is peaking. XRP Price Performance: What’s Happening Right Now? At the start of July, XRP traded around $2.17 . It has since surged nearly 33% , hitting a high of $3.02 on July 14. Over the past 7 days, the price is up 26.5% , but a modest 2.7% dip in the last 24 hours shows that institutional investors may be taking profits ahead of the ETF launch . Still, there are signs of stability and possible re-entry from larger players, especially in the $2.82 to $2.87 price zone . This could hint at accumulation, or just temporary relief buying. How XRP Stacks Up Against Top Cryptos XRP’s 445.8% growth over the past year stands out sharply when compared to its peers. Bitcoin gained 86.3% , BNB rose 21.1% , and Ethereum declined by 10.9% . Even Solana, often seen as a strong altcoin, only posted a 4.5% gain in the same period. This outperformance highlights XRP’s unique momentum, which may be fueled by ongoing institutional interest, legal clarity, and upcoming ETF exposure. Is XRP A Good Investment ? Search spikes don’t always lead to price spikes. When retail FOMO kicks in, smart money is often already taking profits. So, the current rise in “Buy XRP” searches may reflect growing interest, but not necessarily signal a fresh rally. That said, if you’re buying for the long term, not just chasing short-term gains, this could still be a reasonable time to enter, especially with the ETF launch approaching and strong institutional momentum behind XRP.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-it-the-right-time-to-buy-xrp-ripple/,"XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BNB|BTC","News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T10:57:36,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 15, 2025","After several days of significant increases and new all-time highs, the crypto market is down today. The vast majority of the top 100 coins per market cap have dropped over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 6.7% to $3.74 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $217 billion, nearly double that of yesterday. TLDR: The crypto market sees a pullback; 95 of the top 100 coins dropped today; BTC fell below $117,000, while ETH dropped below $3,000 mark; Market sentiment sits firmly in the greed zone; Both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs recorded inflows, with the latter performing better; ”In terms of juice in the Bitcoin tank, it feels like there’s still plenty left”; ”This isn’t hype, it’s confirmation that Bitcoin is here to stay.” Crypto Winners & Losers As the market experiences a pullback, all top 10 coins per market cap have dropped since this time yesterday. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.4%, decreasing back below the $117,000, now trading at $116,999. This is also the second-highest drop in this category. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 1.4% and below the $3,000 mark. It’s currently changing hands at $2,986. The highest decrease in this category is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s is 7.6%. It now trades at $0.1919. Tron (TRX) fell the least. It’s down 1.2% to $0.2992. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find that five are green. Pump.fun (PUMP) appreciated the most among these: 9.2% to $0.005976. It’s followed by Bonk (BONK) , which increased by 8.3% to $0.00002974. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) fell the most. It’s down 9.3% to $1.63. XDC Network (XDC) is in the second place, having dropped 8.9% to the price of $0.07409. This drop is neither surprising nor exceptional. Decreases tend to follow market surges, particularly those that lead to new ATHs. Pullbacks are typical, which is why investors are not panicking. Meanwhile, coinciding with the drop in prices, a long-dormant wallet linked to a “Satoshi-era whale” transferred a whopping 17,000 BTC to Galaxy Digital .

Despite geopolitical instability, inflation, and financial uncertainty, it has remained unfazed, acting as a kind of economic anomaly.” We are seeing its core use case as a store of value and hedge during uncertain times playing out in real time, he adds. “So, in terms of juice in the Bitcoin tank, it feels like there’s still plenty left. That said, while [the latest] sharp upward momentum isn’t likely to last forever, it might still continue for a while longer.” Meanwhile, the US provided most of the favourable fuel for this latest run. This included bipartisan support, ETF inflows, increasing institutional adoption, and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Despite pullbacks or consolidation near ATH levels, “macro headwinds like rising debt, sticky inflation, and geopolitical tension continue to erode confidence in TradFi. From my perspective, Bitcoin’s role as a scarce, maturing, and in-demand asset has never been clearer,” Toledano says. Moreover, Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, commented that BTC surged 14.65% over the past week, hitting a fresh ATH, while investors poured more than $2.7 billion into Bitcoin ETFs, marking the fifth-largest weekly inflow since their launch in January 2024. “This isn’t hype, it’s confirmation that Bitcoin is here to stay.” Rocca continued. BTC surpassed Amazon to become the world’s fifth-largest asset by market cap. “A structural six-figure bottom looks as though it is starting to take shape, and the asset is now firmly positioned alongside the giants of traditional finance. With inflows like we’ve seen in the last week, Bitcoin is no longer on the fringe; it’s part of the global financial system, and the question now is what role it will play in shaping its future.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $116,999. In comparison, at this time yesterday, it stood at $122,273. The day’s highest point was $122,838, with the price dropping since. Notably, this daily high was also the latest all-time high for the coin. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Katie Stockton, a crypto analyst and founder at Fairlead Strategies , argues that Bitcoin will reach $135,000 in the medium term . This “seemed pretty aggressive a few days ago, maybe now a little less so.” Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,986. The coin rose to the intra-day high of $3,074 nearly 24 hours ago, then decreasing to $2,942, before recovering slightly to the current level. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed crypto infrastructure firm Bit Digital announced plans to raise $67.3 million through a direct offering of 22 million ordinary shares aimed at institutional investors. The goal is to use the proceeds to buy Ethereum and expand the company’s growing ETH treasury. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment did not move since yesterday, still sitting in greed territory. The Fear and Greed Index is again 70 today , the highest it’s been in more than a month. Unsurprisingly, given today’s pullback, this greed may signal that the market is overheated and ready for a correction.

They saw inflows of $297.4 million , significantly lower than $1.03 billion and $1.18 billion recorded on the two prior trading days. BlackRock saw the highest share of this amount, taking in $394.71 million. While Grayscale , Bitwise , and VanEck saw minnow inflows, Fidelity and Ark & 21Shares saw outflows. US ETH ETFs also saw inflows for the seventh days in a row, with $259.04 million on 14 July. This is higher than $204 million seen on Friday. Seven of the nine funds saw positive flows, while none saw outflows. BlackRock recorded the majority of this amount again: $151.45 million. Grayscale follows with $43.79 million. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered launched spot trading services for Bitcoin and Ether through its UK branch. “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements,” said group chief executive Bill Winters.

The crypto market has seen a decrease over the past 24 hours. However, the US stock market closed on Monday with some uptick. For example, the S&P 500 is up by 0.14%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.33%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.2%. The stocks went up as investors had some time to digest the latest tariff threats coming from the US. Additionally, they are awaiting earnings reports and economic data set to be published this week. Is this dip sustainable? A dip is both expected and typical following a significant market surge and new all-time highs. Analysts argue that there is still room for additional growth this year.

2025-07-15T10:56:28,"10 firms bought 550k ETH worth over $1.6 billion in 30 days","The race to accumulate Ether as a treasury asset is heating up with more than ten companies buying 550,000 ETH worth $1.65 billion in the last 30 days. Crypto entrepreneur Kyle Reidhead disclosed this on X. According to Reidhead , who is co-owner of crypto newsletter Milk Road, this highlights the massive demand for Ether as more companies continue to pivot to the ETH treasury playbook. The move to adopt ETH as a treasury asset is inspired by what Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has done with Bitcoin. While over 100 companies have bought BTC for their treasury, others are turning to other crypto assets, including ETH. Reidhead noted that this is still in the early stages, with more companies looking to get involved, while those involved also want to buy more ETH. Thus, he expects the accumulation rate to only increase in the coming months. He said: “There are new $ETH treasury companies launching every week (sounds like the biggest is yet to come), and each company is looking to buy more $ETH than they did the previous week. So if the last 30 days is $1.65 billion, then will the next month be $2B and then $3B after that?” However, he acknowledged that demand will eventually slow down, but added that that will not come anytime soon, given that ETH treasury companies are still in their early stages. Reidhead also noted that ETH treasury companies do not sell, unlike exchange-traded funds, at least for now, and expect their accumulation to impact ETH performance. Sharplink is now the biggest ETH holder after accumulation spree Interestingly, the Milk Road founder highlighted Sharplink Gaming as one of the biggest buyers of ETH, noting that the company has bought 75,000 ETH in the past five days alone. Sharplink’s most recent purchases only continue a trend that has seen it become the biggest ETH holder. The company, which became an ETH treasury company in early June, has already spent over $700 million on buying Ether in less than two months. Its latest purchase was 24,371 ETH bought from Coinbase Prime less than 24 hours ago for $73 million. Sharplink latest ETH purchase (Source: Onchain Lens). With its accumulation, Sharplink ETH holdings are now above 290,000 ETH, more than enough to flip the Ethereum Foundation as the biggest Ether holder. The Foundation holds around 242,000 ETH and recently sold 10,000 ETH to Sharplink. Meanwhile, Sharplink is not the only company on an ETH accumulation spree. Bitmine Immersion has also been buying, with the company holding over 163,000 in ETH, while former Bitcoin miner BitDigital has more than 100,000 ETH after converting its Bitcoin to ETH. Interestingly, there appears to be a healthy competition between the top ETH treasury companies, with executives of those companies praising the accumulation rate of one another. Sharplink chairman Joe Lubin described the group as “The League of Extraordinary ETH Accumulator Gentlemen” and praised Tom Lee of Bitmine, San Tabar of Bit Digital, and Charles Allen of BTCS. He added that competition and coordination between the companies will strengthen and improve them. ETH slips 2% to fall below $3k again Meanwhile, the massive accumulation rate of ETH, coupled with a market-wide rally, is impacting Ether performance, with the token going above $3,000 twice in the past few days. Although it has fallen below $3,000 on both occasions, with a recent 2% drop that saw it trade $2,972, there are positive signs that it would soon recover and find its support above that price level. Over the past seven days, ETH has climbed up more than 16% and the turnaround is more evident in the long term, with a 90% gain in the past 3 months. However, it is still trading 11% below its price at the start of the year.

2025-07-15T10:50:57,"Unveiling a Colossal Bitcoin Transfer: $472M Moves to Galaxy Digital","BitcoinWorld Unveiling a Colossal Bitcoin Transfer: $472M Moves to Galaxy Digital A ripple of intrigue has swept through the cryptocurrency world, as a significant movement of digital assets caught the attention of market observers. We’re talking about a massive Bitcoin transfer , specifically 4,000 BTC, which has been tracked from an unknown wallet directly to Galaxy Digital. This isn’t just any transfer; at an approximate value of $472 million, it represents a substantial sum that warrants a closer look into its potential ramifications for the broader market. What Did Whale Alert Uncover? The cryptocurrency tracking service, Whale Alert, is renowned for its vigilance in monitoring large movements of digital assets across various blockchains. Their recent report highlighted this particular BTC transaction , signaling its movement from an unidentified source to a well-known institutional player. Whale Alert’s timely notifications often serve as an early warning system, drawing attention to significant shifts in supply or demand dynamics that could influence market sentiment. The Transaction: 4,000 BTC moved. Recipient: Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management firm in the digital asset space. Value: Approximately $472 million, making it one of the more notable transfers in recent times. Origin: An unknown wallet, which adds a layer of mystery and fuels speculation about the sender’s identity and motives. Why Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer to Galaxy Digital Matter? When an institutional entity like Galaxy Digital receives such a substantial amount of Bitcoin, it rarely goes unnoticed. These movements are often indicative of deeper market trends or strategic plays. Galaxy Digital, founded by Mike Novogratz, is a key player in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the nascent digital asset economy. Their activities often reflect institutional interest and sophisticated investment strategies. Several reasons could underpin such a large Bitcoin transfer : Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading: Large institutional trades often occur off-exchange to minimize market impact. Galaxy Digital could be facilitating an OTC deal for a high-net-worth individual or another institution. Custody Solutions: The BTC might be moving into Galaxy Digital’s custody services for safekeeping on behalf of a client. This indicates long-term holding intentions rather than immediate selling. Portfolio Rebalancing: Galaxy Digital manages various funds and investment vehicles. This transfer could be part of a larger portfolio rebalancing act, adjusting their Bitcoin exposure. Proprietary Trading: The firm might be acquiring Bitcoin for its own balance sheet or for use in its trading operations, signaling a bullish or bearish stance depending on subsequent actions. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact ? The immediate reaction to such a large BTC transaction is often speculation about its potential impact on price. While 4,000 BTC is a significant sum, its direct market impact depends heavily on whether these funds are intended for sale on an open exchange or for long-term holding/OTC operations. If the Bitcoin is destined for an exchange, it could increase selling pressure; however, if it’s for custody or OTC, the market impact would be minimal or even positive as it signals growing institutional adoption. Key Considerations for the Market: Liquidity: Such large movements can test the market’s liquidity, especially if a portion of the BTC is eventually sold. Sentiment: The transfer, particularly to a reputable firm like Galaxy Digital, can bolster institutional confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially attracting more traditional investors. Transparency vs. Opacity: The ‘unknown wallet’ origin adds an element of opacity, which can sometimes lead to uncertainty, but the known destination (Galaxy Digital) provides a degree of reassurance regarding institutional involvement. This event underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market, where large institutional players are actively involved in moving substantial amounts of digital assets. It highlights the increasing integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial structures, moving beyond retail speculation to serious institutional investment. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors keeping an eye on the market, large transfers like this offer valuable insights: Stay Informed: Services like Whale Alert are crucial for real-time data on significant movements. Look Beyond the Headlines: A large transfer isn’t automatically a sell signal. Consider the recipient and their typical operations. Observe Follow-Up Actions: What Galaxy Digital does with this Bitcoin next will be key. Does it sit in cold storage, or is it distributed to various addresses? Institutional Adoption: View these transfers as a sign of continued institutional interest, which is generally a positive long-term indicator for Bitcoin’s price and stability. In conclusion, the 4,000 BTC transfer to Galaxy Digital is more than just a large number; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the increasing involvement of institutional players, the growing sophistication of digital asset management, and the ongoing shift towards Bitcoin’s broader acceptance. While the ‘unknown wallet’ adds a touch of mystery, the known destination to a reputable firm like Galaxy Digital suggests a calculated move within the institutional crypto ecosystem, rather than a cause for immediate alarm.

2025-07-15T10:41:40,"Samson Mow Says Bitcoin Bull Market Is Just Starting as BTC Hits $123K","The post Samson Mow Says Bitcoin Bull Market Is Just Starting as BTC Hits $123K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin just shattered its previous all-time high, briefly reaching $123,091.61 on Monday. This explosive move has reignited bold predictions across the crypto world, especially from Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3 and a well-known Bitcoin advocate. Mow believes this is only the beginning. “The Bitcoin bull market hasn’t even started yet,” he said, signaling that the real rally may still be ahead. His recent comments also highlight a powerful milestone – Bitcoin has now outpaced inflation by 19%, proving itself as a strong hedge against long-term financial uncertainty. If you take a real inflation rate of say 11% (eggs) and apply it to the ATH price in November 2021 ($68,789), that gives us an inflation adjusted 2021 high of $0.1M. $0.12M is just beating inflation by 19%, or 4.8% annually. The Bitcoin bull market hasn’t even started yet. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 14, 2025 Bitcoin vs Inflation: How BTC Holds Its Value Over Time Samson Mow compared the current price action to Bitcoin’s peak of $68,789 in November 2021. Adjusted for a real inflation rate of 11%, based on everyday items like eggs, this would bring the inflation-adjusted high to around $100,000. However, Mow argues that the true inflation rate is likely even higher, possibly between 15% and 20%. This makes Bitcoin’s recent climb to $116,778 even more impressive, showing a 4.8% annual gain above inflation. Mow, who famously predicts Bitcoin will reach $1 million through what he calls “Omega candles” (massive price surges), sees this moment as an early sign of a much larger rally to come. Strategy’s Massive Bitcoin Purchase Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), made headlines again with another huge Bitcoin buy. On Monday, the company added 4,225 BTC to its holdings, spending $472.5 million. This brings Strategy’s total stash to 601,550 BTC, now worth over $70.2 billion. The purchase was funded through a $330.9 million sale of MSTR shares, along with the sale of Bitcoin-backed convertible stocks – STRK, STRF, and STRD. Saylor reported a 20.2% return on Bitcoin year-to-date and continues to push the idea that Bitcoin is not just an investment but the future of money. He repeated his now-iconic line that Bitcoin is “going up forever.” JAN3 also commented on the transaction, pointing out how these strategic moves are helping drive broader market activity. Price Correction Is a Positive Sign, Says Rochard Not everyone sees the pullbacks as negative. Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, shared his thoughts on the recent dip after Bitcoin briefly touched its new highs. Bitcoin’s retracement is healthy: it slows leverage, resets funding rates and implied volatility, and moves open interest from speculative upside calls into fresh strikes and maturities, giving the next leg of the bull market a sturdier foundation. — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) July 15, 2025 He described the correction as “healthy,” explaining that it reduces excessive leverage, resets funding rates and implied volatility, and helps move open interest into new strike prices and maturities. In his view, these shifts lay a stronger foundation for the next phase of the bull run. Momentum Builds as Institutions Double Down With Bitcoin now trading above its inflation-adjusted all-time high and institutional interest continuing to grow, the momentum is clearly building. Voices like Mow and Saylor remain confident that Bitcoin’s best days are still ahead. Whether the price continues to rise in the short term or takes a breather, Bitcoin’s growing dominance, inflation resistance, and increasing adoption are signs of a deeper shift taking place in global finance.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/samson-mow-says-bitcoin-bull-market-is-just-starting-as-btc-hits-123k/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|STRK","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T10:40:52,"Bitcoin-Backed Loans Soar: Coinbase Achieves Remarkable $1 Billion Collateral Milestone","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin-Backed Loans Soar: Coinbase Achieves Remarkable $1 Billion Collateral Milestone Imagine having significant wealth tied up in Bitcoin, but needing immediate cash without wanting to sell your precious digital assets. This common dilemma is precisely what Bitcoin-backed loans aim to solve, and a recent announcement from Coinbase has truly underscored their growing importance in the crypto ecosystem. The leading crypto exchange has now seen the total collateral for its Bitcoin-backed loans surge past a staggering $1 billion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the evolving utility of Bitcoin beyond a mere speculative asset, showcasing its increasing role as a financial instrument for liquidity. Understanding the Phenomenon of Bitcoin-Backed Loans So, what exactly are Bitcoin-backed loans ? In simple terms, they allow Bitcoin holders to borrow traditional currency (like USD or USDC) by using their BTC as collateral. This means you don’t have to sell your Bitcoin, potentially incurring capital gains taxes or losing out on future price appreciation. Instead, your Bitcoin is temporarily held by a lender (in this case, Coinbase), and you receive a loan based on a percentage of its value. The concept is similar to a traditional secured loan, where you might use your house or car as collateral. For crypto, it provides a crucial bridge between the volatile world of digital assets and the stable needs of everyday finance. Borrowers typically receive loans at a specific Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which determines how much they can borrow relative to their collateral’s value. For instance, a 50% LTV on $100,000 worth of Bitcoin would allow you to borrow $50,000. Coinbase’s Strategic Play in Crypto Loans Coinbase , one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, launched its Bitcoin-backed USDC loans on January 16. This move was a strategic expansion of its services, aiming to cater to a demographic of long-term Bitcoin holders who prefer to ‘hodl’ rather than sell. The initial offering came with certain caps, but the rapid demand quickly led to adjustments. On April 30, Coinbase reportedly raised its loan cap from $100,000 to an impressive $1 million, signaling strong confidence in the product and the market’s appetite for such offerings. The platform’s reputation for security and regulatory compliance makes it an attractive option for users seeking crypto loans . Unlike some decentralized alternatives, Coinbase offers a centralized and user-friendly experience, often preferred by those new to crypto lending or who prioritize institutional-grade security. The seamless integration within their existing exchange platform makes the process of obtaining a loan straightforward for their vast user base. The Power of BTC Collateral: Unlocking Your Bitcoin’s Potential The core appeal of these loans lies in the ability to leverage your BTC collateral without liquidating your holdings. This is particularly appealing for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value appreciation. Consider these key advantages: Accessing Liquidity Without Selling: Need cash for an emergency, a down payment, or an investment? Instead of selling your Bitcoin and potentially missing out on future gains, you can borrow against it. Maintaining Bitcoin Exposure: You continue to own your Bitcoin (albeit pledged as collateral), meaning you benefit if its price increases. Potential Tax Advantages: In many jurisdictions, a loan is not considered a taxable event, unlike selling an asset. This can offer significant tax efficiencies for long-term holders. However, it’s crucial to understand the risks associated with using BTC collateral . Bitcoin’s price volatility means that if its value drops significantly, you might face a ‘margin call,’ requiring you to add more collateral or risk liquidation of your pledged Bitcoin to cover the loan. Centralized vs. Decentralized Finance: Where Do Coinbase Crypto Loans Stand? The world of crypto loans broadly divides into two main categories: Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Coinbase’s offering falls squarely into the CeFi camp. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Centralized Finance (CeFi – e.g., Coinbase) Decentralized Finance (DeFi – e.g., Aave, Compound) Custody of Collateral Held by the platform (e.g., Coinbase) Managed by smart contracts (non-custodial) Counterparty Risk Present (you trust the platform) Minimal (you trust the code) KYC/AML Requirements Mandatory Often not required User Experience Generally more user-friendly, traditional interface Can be complex for newcomers, requires self-custody knowledge Interest Rates/Fees Set by the platform, can be competitive Determined by supply/demand in protocols, can be volatile Transparency Internal operations are private All transactions and code are public on the blockchain Coinbase’s success with its loan product highlights that a significant portion of the market prefers the simplicity, regulation, and perceived security of a centralized entity, even as the decentralized finance space continues to innovate. This doesn’t mean one is inherently better than the other; rather, they serve different user preferences and risk appetites. Actionable Insights: Navigating the World of BTC Collateral For anyone considering leveraging their BTC collateral for a loan, here are some actionable insights: Understand the Terms: Always read the fine print. Pay close attention to interest rates, LTV ratios, liquidation thresholds, and any fees involved. Manage Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be dramatic. Have a clear strategy for managing potential margin calls. This might involve keeping extra collateral ready or setting stop-loss limits if possible. Purpose of the Loan: Borrow responsibly. A loan should ideally be for productive purposes or to cover short-term liquidity needs, not for speculative trading, especially with volatile collateral. Tax Implications: While borrowing isn’t typically a taxable event, what you do with the borrowed funds might be. Consult a tax professional regarding your specific situation. Compare Providers: Even within CeFi, different platforms offer varying terms. Shop around before committing. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin’s Utility The remarkable achievement of Coinbase surpassing $1 billion in collateral for its Bitcoin-backed loans marks a significant milestone for the broader cryptocurrency market. It solidifies Bitcoin’s position not just as ‘digital gold’ but as a versatile financial asset capable of unlocking liquidity for its holders. As the crypto space matures, we can expect to see even more innovative financial products emerge, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This trend underscores a growing demand for sophisticated financial tools that allow users to maximize the utility of their crypto holdings, paving the way for a more integrated and dynamic financial future.

2025-07-15T10:36:27,"Strategy: Still Sticking With Series A Preferreds","Summary Strategy now holds over 600,000 BTC, but MSTR still trades at a significant premium to its Bitcoin holdings. I continue to like the STRF preferred shares far better than the common. STRF has an 8.4% effective yield and has outperformed MSTR since my last article. STRF is less risky than MSTR in both bull and bear Bitcoin scenarios, as dividends are realized returns and not dependent on BTC price appreciation. With potential rate cuts ahead, STRF may gain favor with income investors. I see it as the best way to gain exposure to Strategy at this time. Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF )( STRK )( STRD ) has officially surpassed the 600,000 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) threshold after announcing the purchase of another 4,225 BTC between July 7th and July 14th. The exact number of coins that the company now holds is 601,550. It's a staggering number of coins and Strategy currently owns over 3% of Bitcoin's 19.9 million circulating supply and 2.8% of the total supply that will ever be in existence. Data by YCharts It's been an absolutely incredible run for both MSTR shareholders and BTC-USD holders with each seeing intense rallies from the 'tariff tantrum' in early-April. The relationship between Strategy and Bitcoin itself has become quite symbiotic over the last year; with Strategy's ability to raise capital benefiting from the ever-increasing valuation of its Bitcoin collateral and Bitcoin's price rising, in part, due to Strategy's seemingly never-ending bid. I've actually been bullish MSTR in the past but flipped to a more cautious view when the shares started trading at a significant premium to the value of the BTC on the balance sheet last year. More recently, I've taken a liking to the preferred offerings, specifically the senior STRF shares, and have opined that the existence of the preferred stocks may even be to the long term detriment of the common stock. I closed my May Strategy piece with this: I won't pay a premium for BTC through MSTR when I can just buy an ETF instead. But I have no problem letting Saylor pay me 10% while he dilutes his common stockholders. I'm long STRF. 5/3//25-7/14/25 (Seeking Alpha) Long STRF rather than MSTR has worked out considerably well since that early-May piece with the senior preferred stock generating a 35% total return in a little over two months. In this update, I'll get into why I'm increasingly of the opinion that the common stock is the wrong way to play Strategy's Bitcoin flywheel at this point in time. Lackluster STRD ATM Demand? In that same article I referenced from May, I compared the three different preferred shares currently offered by Strategy. At that time, I came to the conclusion that even though it was an interesting capital appreciation play, STRD was the inferior investment of the three senior shares for long term income-minded investors. I won't re-write that entire piece, but my primary argument against STRD was that the dividends are not mandatory and not cumulative. Thus, Strategy could simply opt to not pay STRD shareholders at all if it felt it benefited the company. Subsequent to that May piece, Strategy announced a $4.2 billion ATM for STRD shares and had what I think is an alarming addition to the 'use of proceeds' section from the prospectus . The bold text below is my emphasis: We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital, and may also use the net proceeds for the payment of cash dividends on our STRF Stock and STRK Stock . Higher yields aside, the idea that proceeds could be raised from a tranche of preferred shares lacking mandatory dividend payments and then used to pay the dividends of an entirely different shareholder group had to give potential STRD buyers at least a little bit of pause. One week following the announced ATM, I think we have some possible signals from Strategy's first July 2025 BTC purchases: ATM Program Used Shares Sold Notional Proceeds MSTR 797,008 - $330.9m STRK 573,976 $57.4m $71.1m STRF 444,005 $44.4m $55.3m STRD 158,278 $15.8m $15.0m Source: Strategy, July 7th-14th ATM sales In the first week following the announced STRD ATM, Strategy was able to bring in just $15 million through that offering and $101.8 million from the mandatory payment preferred tranches. I think there are two ways to look at this: Demand for Strategy's junk tranche has diminished Strategy would rather raise capital from the products where proceeds exceed notional Number two is probably only true if the company believes the share prices of STRK and STRF are too high. I don't think that is the case and I'll get into why in the next section. Thus, I believe the lack of STRD issuance is likely more indicative of a demand problem. By itself, this is potentially concerning since the company intends to raise up to $4.2 billion with this product for the expressed purpose of paying previous investors. But perhaps the bigger signal in Strategy's ATM use through the first half of July 2025 is that 70% of the capital used to buy Bitcoin this month has come from the MSTR ATM. Currently, there is $17.8 billion remaining on the MSTR ATM and a combined $26.2 billion left on the preferred share ATMs. Between the shares issued already from the ATMs and the initial offerings, Strategy owes $326.5 million in annualized dividend payments. Most of which is through the mandatory products. ATM Product MSTR STRK STRF STRD Remaining Availability $17,779.8 $20,450.9 $1,881.3 $4,185.0 Total ATM $21,000.0 $21,000.0 $2,100.0 $4,200.0 % Used 15.33% 2.61% 10.41% 0.36% Dividend % - 8% 10% 10% Annualized Payments of Remaining - $1,636.1 $188.1 $418.5 Source: Strategy, dollars in millions Importantly, if the company were to fully raise through all three preferred share product ATMs, the annual liability to those stock holders from the available shares would be an additional $2.24 billion - or a total of $2.56 billion counting the shares that have already been issued. Since these are annual payments in perpetuity, they pose a significant long term risk to Strategy's BTC stack if the company can't continue to dilute the common stock or raise capital through additional means. Of course, the rebuttal to this is the expectation that Bitcoin's price will continue rising at a faster annualized rate than the 10% payments. Yet, even if we take that as a base case, it might still make more sense to long STRF over MSTR. Valuation Considerations It's been mentioned many times before through Seeking Alpha pieces - my own included - that MSTR continues to trade at a sizable premium to the market valuation of the Bitcoin that Strategy holds. At a mNAV rate of 1.96, MSTR trades at nearly double the value of the company's BTC: MSTR mNAV (StrategyTracker) While well below mNAV highs, some believe 1.96 is a rich valuation for the common; I'm clearly in that camp. Others see no issue with the premium. To each their own. I'm not going to dwell on it because readers likely already know where I stand and it's a simple difference in philosophy. Rather, let's explore the capital appreciation potential of STRF. STRF Appreciation Potential At $10 Annual Dividends Share Price Share Price at 7% Effective Yield $143 Share Price at 6.6% Effective Yield $152 Share Price at 6% Effective Yield $167 Share Price at 5% Effective Yield $200 Share Price at 4.44% Effective Yield $227 Share Price at 4% Effective Yield $250 Source: Author's Calculations The table above shows the potential share price appreciation for STRF under different effective yield scenarios. At a 7% effective yield, the stock is worth $143. If STRF were to trade in line with the 12 month trailing yield of the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF ( PFF ), the stock would be worth $152. The US 10-year is currently yielding 4.44%. At par with the US 10-yr, STRF is worth $227 per share. And if we actually see rates go down in longer term US debt, the price of STRF could potentially re-rate even higher if income investors view BTC-collateral as a viable alternative to government bonds. But let's just assume STRF can grow the stock price to an effective yield of 6.6%. I think this would be reasonable as it is in-line with other preferred stocks. At a closing share price of $118.5, STRF would see price appreciation of 28.3% before dividends at a 6.6% effective yield. If the mNAV of MSTR remains constant, Bitcoin would have to get to $154k per coin to justify MSTR over STRF on price appreciation. This is admittedly a hypothetical situation. However, I think STRF is misunderstood. Unlike MSTR, STRF can work in both Bitcoin bear and Bitcoin bull scenarios. Closing Takeaways One of the criticisms that I've seen online from MSTR longs who don't hold Strategy's preferred shares is the claim that 10% in fiat yield is trumped by the presumed 'BTC Yield' of the common stock equity. I don't actually think that's the correct way to compare the common with the preferred stock. First, dividends paid to STRF stockholders are realized returns. The 'BTC yield' of the common stock could actually go negative if Strategy is ultimately forced by the market to sell BTC to raise the capital for preferred share dividend payments. Second, BTC Yield is fundamentally an argument for assessing MSTR relative to the Bitcoin backing of each share. If that truly has any significance, why should the market pay double for the BTC held by the company through the common when the BTC is unproductive? Many expect the MSTR mNAV to go much higher. My base case is that it won't. In a truly bearish Bitcoin scenario , mNAV could realistically go negative as it did in the past. And Strategy would still have to pay the STRF dividends with a preferred to BTC NAV collateral ratio of 5%. Finally, the market is expecting no less than two rate cuts through the remainder of the year by the Federal Reserve. If short term rates go down, investors may begin to get bullish longer duration debt. I would imagine a strong bid for STRF in such an environment. At this point, STRF is my only exposure to Strategy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801274-strategy-still-sticking-with-series-a-preferreds?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|STRK","MSTR|STRF",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T10:32:38,"Bitcoin dips as dormant whale moves 16,843 BTC","Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after notching new all-time highs above $123,000. This pullback comes in as an “OG” whale wallet, dormant for over a decade, moved $2 billion worth of BTC to Galaxy Digital. This move has sparked speculation that a major sell-off may be underway. The world’s largest crypto is down by almost 5% in the last 24 hours, trading around $116K zone. This has been seen as its steepest drop over the last month. The recede follows Bitcoin’s massive breakout on Monday, basically fueled by optimism around US crypto legislation expected to advance this week. However, growing institutional demand for BTC is another key trend. Whale awakens after 14 years An OG Bitcoin whale that had remained inactive for over 14 years transferred 16,843 BTC (approx. worth $2 billion) to Galaxy Digital across several transactions. The transfers to Galaxy Digital were made in seven separate transactions, beginning on Monday. Different batch sizes ranging from 500 to 4,500 BTC were moved. The final tranche of 3,160 BTC was sent out on Tuesday. This looks to be the first cash-out in the whale wallet’s BTC history. Some analysts initially suggested these movements might be linked to address management or security upgrades. Meanwhile, the latest transfers to Galaxy Digital indicate that the whale may now be preparing to sell. This Bitcoin OG with 80,009 $BTC ($9.46B) transferred another 7,843 $BTC ($927M) to #GalaxyDigital , for a total of 16,843 $BTC ($2B). Galaxy Digital is depositing $BTC to exchanges, and 2,000 $BTC ($236M) has been directly deposited to #Bybit and #Binance . https://t.co/Sm9UBYboIN pic.twitter.com/rwxHtrV0DQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 15, 2025 The whale’s decision to cash out into Galaxy Digital may not necessarily signal a bearish move. Instead, it reflects well-planned portfolio rebalancing after Bitcoin’s more than 100% year-to-date rally. On the other side, institutional inflows continue to outpace miner issuance. On Monday alone, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $297 million in net inflows. The cumulative net inflow now stands at $52.66 billion. BlackRock’s IBIT led the inflow run with $394 million while ARK’s ARKB lost $99.5 million in withdrawals. Lookonchain reported that after seeing the Bitcoin OG whale start selling, another whale 0x960B instantly closed his long position and flipped short on BTC. CoinGlass data shows that around $160 million worth of long and short bets set on Bitcoin price have been liquidated over the last 24 hours. $144 million (90%) of the liquidated positions turn out to be long bets. Crypto week begins with a pullback Bitcoin briefly touched a record $123,000 over growing expectations that the US House of Representatives will pass key crypto legislation this week. However, Republicans are calling it the “ Crypto Week .” These bills are seen as a gateway to long-awaited regulatory clarity. As of now, BTC is hovering between $116K-$117K with a 24-hour trading volume of $147 billion. The global digital asset market cap saw a decline of more than 4% over the last day to stand at $3.66 trillion. The biggest altcoins like Ethereum, Solana and XRP are also bleeding. The meme crypto category looks to be most affected in the fresh pullback. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu prices dropped by 8% and 6%, respectively, over the last 24 hours. The cumulative meme crypto market cap is down by 6% to stand at $64.5 billion. Trump’s meme coin has struggled to maintain momentum despite celebrity backers and investor buzz. The coin, which soared to $75 shortly after its debut, slipped 6% to trade around $9.12. Last week saw crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun revealed a fresh $100 million investment into the Trump coin project. Still, investor sentiment appears to be cooling off as speculative assets take a backseat to blue-chip cryptos. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-15T10:30:48,"US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Explosive $297 Million Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Witness Explosive $297 Million Inflow Surge The world of digital assets is buzzing with exciting news! On July 14, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant milestone, recording a remarkable $297.47 million in total net inflows. This impressive figure marks the eighth consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling growing confidence and sustained interest in Bitcoin as an investment vehicle. What does this consistent influx of capital mean for the broader crypto market trends and the future of institutional investment in digital assets? For investors and enthusiasts alike, this string of positive performance from Bitcoin ETF Inflows is a strong indicator of shifting tides in the financial landscape. It highlights a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class within traditional investment portfolios. Let’s delve deeper into the numbers and explore the implications of this powerful momentum. Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Who’s Leading the Charge? The July 14th data, as reported by Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of which funds are attracting the most capital. While the overall net inflow was substantial, the performance varied significantly among the different US Spot Bitcoin ETFs . This divergence showcases the preferences of institutional and retail investors, and the varying strategies employed by the fund managers. Here’s a breakdown of the inflows and outflows for the day: ETF Ticker Fund Manager Net Flow (July 14) IBIT BlackRock +$394.78 million GBTC Grayscale +$12.75 million HODL VanEck +$8.47 million BITB Bitwise +$7.17 million ARKB ARK Invest -$99.57 million FBTC Fidelity -$26.13 million Others Various No Change BlackRock’s IBIT continues to dominate the landscape, demonstrating its powerful appeal to investors. Its substantial inflows underscore the trust and capital it commands in the market. Grayscale’s GBTC, despite its initial outflows post-conversion, is now consistently seeing positive flows, indicating a stabilization and renewed interest from its investor base. The fact that other significant players like VanEck and Bitwise also recorded positive inflows further solidifies the positive sentiment surrounding these investment vehicles. However, it’s important to note that not all ETFs experienced the same success. ARK Invest’s ARKB and Fidelity’s FBTC saw net outflows. This could be due to various factors, including portfolio rebalancing by large investors, profit-taking, or strategic shifts. Analyzing these individual fund performances provides a more nuanced understanding of the broader Bitcoin ETF Inflows narrative. Why Are US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Attracting Such Momentum? The consistent positive flows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not merely a fleeting trend; they represent a fundamental shift in how investors access and perceive Bitcoin. Several key factors contribute to this growing momentum: Accessibility and Familiarity: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to a wide range of investors who are already familiar with brokerage accounts and conventional investment products. This eliminates the complexities of direct Bitcoin ownership, such as setting up digital wallets or understanding blockchain technology. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the SEC provided a stamp of regulatory legitimacy. This significantly reduced perceived risks for institutional investors and financial advisors who are often bound by strict compliance guidelines. Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: These ETFs serve as a crucial bridge for large financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers to gain exposure to Bitcoin. They can now allocate capital to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset, integrating it into diversified portfolios alongside traditional assets. This ease of entry is accelerating Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . Liquidity: Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer enhanced liquidity compared to direct crypto exchanges, especially for larger trades. This makes it easier for institutions to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting market prices. Diversification Benefits: Many investors view Bitcoin as a potential diversifier within their portfolios, offering exposure to a nascent asset class that may behave differently from traditional stocks and bonds. The ETF structure makes this diversification simpler to achieve. The combination of these factors creates a compelling proposition for a broad spectrum of investors, from seasoned institutional players to retail individuals looking for a regulated and straightforward way to participate in the digital asset revolution. Analyzing BTC ETF Performance: A Look Beyond the Numbers The cumulative effect of eight consecutive days of positive inflows into BTC ETF Performance goes beyond just the dollar figures. It signifies a robust and sustained demand for Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. This consistent buying pressure can have several implications for the broader crypto ecosystem: Price Stability: While not a direct cause-and-effect, sustained inflows can contribute to price stability and potentially upward price pressure for Bitcoin, as more capital is locked into these investment vehicles. Market Maturation: The increasing volume and consistency of ETF flows indicate a maturing market where Bitcoin is being treated more like a mainstream asset. This institutional validation can attract even more conservative investors. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): As more institutional money flows in, it can potentially reduce some of the extreme volatility often associated with the crypto market, although Bitcoin remains a volatile asset. Increased Transparency: ETF holdings are regularly disclosed, providing greater transparency into institutional interest and accumulation of Bitcoin, which can build investor confidence. This positive BTC ETF Performance is a testament to the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into the traditional financial system. It’s a powerful signal that Bitcoin is here to stay and is increasingly becoming a staple in diversified investment strategies. What Do These Crypto Market Trends Signal for the Future? The sustained inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not just a daily headline; they are indicative of significant long-term crypto market trends . These trends suggest a future where digital assets play an increasingly prominent role in global finance. Here are some key signals and actionable insights: Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: While institutional adoption adds stability, the crypto market remains inherently volatile. Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Future regulations could impact ETF operations or the broader market. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, interest rates, and inflation can still influence investor sentiment and capital flows into risk assets like Bitcoin. Actionable Insights for Investors: Long-Term Perspective: Consider Bitcoin ETF investments with a long-term horizon, focusing on the asset’s potential for growth rather than short-term price movements. Diversification: While attractive, Bitcoin should be part of a well-diversified portfolio, not the sole investment. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and ETF performance metrics to make informed decisions. Understand the Product: Recognize that investing in a spot Bitcoin ETF is different from direct Bitcoin ownership. It offers exposure to price movements without the complexities of self-custody. The continuous flow of capital into these ETFs is a powerful vote of confidence from the traditional financial world, paving the way for further Institutional Bitcoin Adoption and potentially more innovative crypto-backed financial products in the future. A New Era of Investment: The Unstoppable Rise of Bitcoin ETFs The recent surge of $297.47 million in net inflows into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 14, marking eight consecutive days of positive flows, is more than just a statistic; it’s a resounding affirmation of Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and appeal within mainstream finance. Led by BlackRock’s impressive performance, these consistent Bitcoin ETF Inflows are reshaping crypto market trends and accelerating Institutional Bitcoin Adoption at an unprecedented pace. The strong BTC ETF Performance highlights a clear path for traditional investors to gain exposure to digital assets with regulatory clarity and ease. As this momentum continues, we are witnessing a pivotal moment in the integration of digital and traditional finance, promising a more accessible and mature future for Bitcoin investment.

2025-07-15T10:26:56,"Standard Chartered Launches Institutional Spot BTC, ETH Trading","Standard Chartered has become the first internationally recognized financial heavyweight to launch direct spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The offering positions the UK-based institution at the forefront of regulated digital asset integration within traditional finance. Launch Mechanics and Client Access According to reports, the new service will allow institutional clients, including asset managers, corporations, and large investors, to trade BTC and ETH directly using FX trading interfaces established by the bank. Standard Chartered stressed that the trades are “deliverable,” meaning that customers will receive actual crypto assets upon settlement rather than mere exposure via derivatives. Additionally, users can choose their own custodian, including Standard Chartered’s in-house service. At first, the offering will be available during Asian and European trading hours, with potential demand determining whether there will be 24/5 access in the future. The bank also plans to introduce non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) trading for the two largest crypto assets by market cap. This will further expand risk management tools amid growing institutional appetite for digital assets. Traditional banks are under increasing pressure to bridge the gap between legacy finance and crypto infrastructure, and Standard Chartered hopes to eliminate a major point of friction for institutional players who were previously forced to navigate a fragmented and often unregulated crypto sector. A Broader Crypto Strategy The UK spot trading launch is just one piece of Standard Chartered’s growing arsenal of digital asset solutions. At the beginning of the year, the bank established a dedicated Luxembourg entity to offer regulated crypto custody services within the EU. Around the same time, it also dipped its feet into stablecoins and tokenization, partnering with Animoca Brands and HKT to develop a Hong Kong dollar-pegged stablecoin. Compteitors like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have taken a more conservative approach to direct crypto spot trading, with Nate Geraci, co-founder of The ETF Institute, decrying this cautious stance. Recently, while referencing Vanguard, another heavyweight player in the financial management space, he suggested that the refusal by such institutions to offer crypto products could alienate investors seeking exposure to such assets. “What Vanguard is missing (*huge* miss IMO)…” Geraci posted. “Is there are tons of investors who love Vanguard’s low cost approach to stock & bond investing AND they want to own some btc & crypto.” Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Group CEO Bill Winters has consistently stated that “digital assets are here to stay.” The company’s aggressive positioning grants it an early-mover advantage in a market where deep-pocketed investors are increasingly demanding secure, compliant crypto exposure amid a shifting regulatory environment and rising BTC adoption.

2025-07-15T10:24:08,"US CPI Data Release Today LIVE – Inflation Report, CPI Count Down, JUNE CPI Report Today","The post US CPI Data Release Today LIVE – Inflation Report, CPI Count Down, JUNE CPI Report Today appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News July 15, 2025 10:33:28 UTC CPI Data Today Could Decide Market’s Next Move The biggest event this week is the release of the US CPI and Core CPI data on July 15. Markets expect a 2.7% CPI and 3% Core CPI YoY—about 0.3% higher than last month, reflecting tariff pressures. However, the Truflation index shows a 0.6% inflation drop since June and has historically tracked CPI accurately. If the data aligns with Truflation, markets could surge. But if inflation runs hot, a brief correction might hit before the next leg up. July 15, 2025 10:33:28 UTC CPI Data Release Today: Will It Fuel a Market Rally? The U.S. CPI report is set for release today at 8:30 AM ET—one of the month’s most anticipated market-moving events. Expectations are at 2.7% YoY, up from last month’s 2.4%. Truflation data hints inflation may be cooling, but will CPI confirm it? A lower print could strengthen the case for Fed rate cuts, boosting risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Even a slight surprise could spark major market moves. July 15, 2025 10:31:57 UTC CPI Data Set to Spark Market Volatility Today Markets are bracing for potential volatility as the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data drops today at 10:30 AM EST (14:30 UTC). The previous CPI came in at 2.4%, while the forecast stands at 2.6%. A reading below expectations could fuel bullish momentum, while a higher print may trigger bearish pressure. If the data meets the forecast, markets may remain steady. Traders are advised to stay cautious as major moves could follow. July 15, 2025 10:29:27 UTC All Eyes on US CPI Report : A Market-Moving Moment Markets are laser-focused on today’s US CPI release. A softer-than-expected print could revive hopes for Fed rate cuts. But a hotter surprise may crush those expectations fast. This isn’t just inflation data—it’s the market’s next cue. Current futures pricing reflects a cautious stance, with traders bracing for volatility across equities, crypto, and bonds. July 15, 2025 10:29:27 UTC Bitcoin Price Ahead of US CPI Report Today Another pivotal day looms as CPI data is expected to stir volatility across markets. Early sell-offs suggest traders are positioning cautiously ahead of the release. Bitcoin ($BTC) is nearing the key 0.618 Fibonacci level and CME gap support around $114K. With 2-hour and 4-hour oscillators nearing reversal zones, a short-term bounce could be in play. Watch for divergence signals—this could offer strong long setups later in the day. July 15, 2025 10:17:08 UTC US CPI Report Expectations The June Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to show a 0.25% rise in core prices, pushing the annual rate to 2.9%, up from 2.8% in May. Headline inflation is projected to rise by 0.27%, bringing the 12-month figure to 2.6%, compared to 2.4% last month. These increases suggest persistent inflation pressure, keeping the spotlight on the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates.

2025-07-15T10:21:00,"$150 Billion Wiped Out From Crypto Markets as Bitcoin Drops Below $117K: Market Watch","After several consecutive days of almost constant gains and a $15,000 run higher, bitcoin has finally started to correct and has dropped by over six grand since yesterday’s all-time high. The altcoins have followed suit, with substantial price declines from the likes of DOGE, BCH, SOL, SHIB, CRO, APT, and many others. BTC Slips Below $117K What a week it has been in the cryptocurrency world. Less than seven days ago, bitcoin’s price was stuck between $105,000 and $110,000 with little to no fluctuations and a lack of a clear future direction. However, the landscape quickly changed on Wednesday evening when BTC pumped above the upper boundary and tapped a new all-time high at $112,000. The gains continued in the following couple of days, and BTC peaked at almost $119,000 on Friday. The weekend went mostly quietly, with BTC standing a few grand below its record. The bulls went back on the offensive on Sunday evening and especially on Monday, when it surged past $120,000 and tapped a new ATH at just over $123,000 . This meant that the cryptocurrency had added roughly $15,000 in about five days, and here are some of the possible reasons behind that impressive run. However, some warning signs started to appear. Additionally, Trump gave Russia a 50-day deadline to reach a peace deal with Ukraine, and BTC began losing traction. Earlier today, the asset fell below $117,000 and has remained there ever since. Its market cap has retreated to $2.320 trillion on CG, and its dominance over the alts is at 62.1%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts in Retreat Many altcoins experienced exponential gains over the past few days but have slipped on a daily scale. Dogecoin is among the poorest performers since yesterday, having lost almost 7% and trading close to $0.19. However, that could actually be good news for the largest meme coin. BNB, SOL, HYPE, BCH, SHIB, LINK, and HBAR are also in the red with losses of up to 5.5%. ETH is below $3,000 after a 2% daily decline, while XRP has retreated to $2.9 following a similar decrease. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has dropped by roughly $150 billion since yesterday’s peak to under $3.750 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-15T10:20:43,"Bit Digital’s Strategic Shift: Unlocking Ethereum Investment Opportunities","BitcoinWorld Bit Digital’s Strategic Shift: Unlocking Ethereum Investment Opportunities The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to rapid evolution, but few moves signal a strategic pivot as clearly as Bit Digital’s recent announcement. This U.S.-based Bitcoin miner, known for its significant presence in the Proof-of-Work (PoW) landscape, is now making a bold leap. Imagine a company built on one foundation, suddenly investing heavily in another, completely different, yet equally revolutionary, technology. That’s precisely what Bit Digital is doing, as it gears up to raise a substantial $67.3 million, not to expand its Bitcoin mining operations, but to accelerate a fundamental shift toward Ethereum investment . Bit Digital’s Bold Move: A Strategic Shift Towards Ethereum In a move that has captured the attention of the entire digital asset industry, Bit Digital revealed its plans to secure approximately $67.3 million in gross proceeds. This capital raise is facilitated through a registered direct offering of 22 million shares at $3.06 each, orchestrated via a placement agency agreement with B. Riley Securities. The key takeaway here isn’t just the dollar amount, but its designated purpose: the net proceeds are earmarked for the acquisition of Ethereum (ETH). This isn’t merely an allocation; it represents a significant strategic realignment for a company traditionally entrenched in Bitcoin mining . For years, Bit Digital has been a prominent player in the competitive Bitcoin mining arena, deploying fleets of specialized hardware to secure the Bitcoin network and earn block rewards. Their business model was intrinsically linked to the economics of Proof-of-Work consensus. However, the crypto landscape is dynamic, and successful companies often adapt. This shift indicates a proactive approach by Bit Digital to diversify its holdings and capitalize on the burgeoning Ethereum ecosystem, which operates on a different consensus mechanism and offers a broader array of applications. Why the Pivot? Understanding Bit Digital’s Ethereum Investment Strategy Why would an established Bitcoin miner make such a profound change? The decision to prioritize Ethereum investment is multi-faceted, reflecting both the evolving crypto market and a calculated bet on future growth areas. Ethereum, with its transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and its role as the foundational layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps), presents a compelling case for strategic capital allocation. Here are some of the driving forces behind Bit Digital’s pivot: Evolving Consensus Mechanism: Ethereum’s move to PoS (Eth2/Merge) significantly reduces its energy consumption and shifts its security model. For miners accustomed to high energy costs and hardware depreciation, investing in ETH itself, rather than mining it, offers a different risk-reward profile. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum boasts the largest and most vibrant developer ecosystem in the blockchain space. The sheer volume of innovation, user adoption, and total value locked (TVL) within its DeFi protocols suggests substantial long-term potential. Yield Opportunities: Holding ETH can open doors to various yield-generating opportunities within the DeFi ecosystem, such as staking, lending, and liquidity provision, potentially offering returns that complement or even surpass traditional mining profits. Diversification: Relying solely on Bitcoin mining exposes a company to specific market dynamics, regulatory changes affecting PoW, and hardware obsolescence. Diversifying into ETH provides a hedge and broadens exposure to the wider digital assets market. This strategic move is not just about accumulating ETH; it’s about positioning Bit Digital to participate more directly in the growth of Web3, moving beyond pure infrastructure provision to becoming a direct beneficiary of decentralized applications and services built on Ethereum. The Mechanics of the Raise: How Bit Digital Secures Capital for Digital Assets The $67.3 million capital raise is structured as a registered direct offering, a common method for public companies to raise funds without the extensive process of a traditional public offering. By issuing 22 million shares at $3.06 each, Bit Digital aims to quickly bolster its balance sheet. While the gross proceeds are $67.3 million, it’s important to note that the net proceeds will be slightly less after accounting for fees and expenses associated with the offering. Understanding the financial implications: Direct Offering: This typically involves selling securities directly to institutional investors or a small group of accredited investors, often at a discount to the market price. It allows for quicker fundraising compared to a full public offering. Share Dilution: Issuing 22 million new shares will dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. This is a common trade-off when companies raise capital through equity, balancing immediate financial needs with potential long-term growth. Strategic Allocation: The explicit declaration that net proceeds will be used for ETH purchases provides clarity to investors and signals a clear direction for the company’s capital deployment strategy. This transparency can be a positive signal, indicating a well-thought-out plan for leveraging the capital to acquire digital assets with high growth potential. This fundraising effort underscores Bit Digital’s commitment to its new direction. It’s not a small, tentative step, but a significant financial commitment to back their strategic pivot, demonstrating confidence in Ethereum’s future trajectory. Impact on the Crypto Mining Landscape: What This Means for the Industry Bit Digital’s decision sends ripples through the broader crypto mining industry. For years, the narrative has been dominated by Bitcoin mining’s energy consumption, hardware arms races, and geographical shifts. This pivot, while specific to Bit Digital, could foreshadow a broader trend among miners looking to adapt to a changing market. Consider the potential implications: Diversification Pressure: Other Bitcoin miners might feel pressure to diversify their revenue streams or asset holdings, especially as Bitcoin’s halving events continue to reduce block rewards and competition intensifies. Shifting Investment Focus: If more companies follow suit, we could see a broader shift in institutional capital within the crypto space, moving beyond pure PoW infrastructure to embrace a wider array of blockchain technologies and assets. Innovation and Adaptation: The industry thrives on innovation. Bit Digital’s move highlights that success in crypto isn’t just about mining efficiency but also about strategic foresight and adaptability to new technological paradigms. Ethereum’s Growing Appeal: This move further validates Ethereum’s position as a critical asset in the digital economy, attracting capital from entities that previously focused solely on Bitcoin. While Bitcoin mining remains a vital component of the crypto ecosystem, Bit Digital’s strategic shift underscores the increasing maturity and complexity of the market, where different blockchains offer distinct value propositions and investment opportunities. Navigating the Future: Bit Digital’s Vision and Blockchain Strategy Bit Digital’s move represents more than just an asset purchase; it’s a redefinition of its core blockchain strategy . By accumulating Ethereum, the company is positioning itself to benefit directly from the network’s growth, rather than indirectly through mining. This strategic foresight could allow Bit Digital to tap into new revenue streams beyond traditional mining, such as staking rewards (once they accumulate sufficient ETH and participate in PoS validation) or engaging with DeFi protocols. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: Ethereum, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to significant price volatility. A large ETH holding means Bit Digital’s balance sheet will be more exposed to these fluctuations. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for digital assets is still evolving globally. Changes in how cryptocurrencies are classified or regulated could impact the value of Bit Digital’s ETH holdings. Execution Risk: Successfully executing a large-scale ETH acquisition and managing a substantial digital asset portfolio requires expertise in trading, security, and treasury management. Despite these challenges, Bit Digital’s bold step signals a proactive and forward-thinking approach. It’s a testament to the idea that in the fast-paced world of blockchain, adaptability is paramount. Their new blockchain strategy aims to ensure the company remains competitive and relevant, leveraging the full potential of the decentralized economy. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Bit Digital and Beyond Bit Digital’s announcement to raise $67.3 million for a significant pivot towards Ethereum investment marks a truly pivotal moment for the company and potentially for the wider crypto mining sector. By shifting its focus from solely extracting value through Bitcoin mining to directly participating in the Ethereum ecosystem, Bit Digital is demonstrating a remarkable capacity for strategic evolution. This bold move highlights the growing maturity of the digital asset market, where companies are increasingly seeking diverse avenues for growth and value creation beyond traditional models. This strategic realignment isn’t just a financial transaction; it’s a statement about the future direction of a key player in the blockchain space. It underscores the belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a foundational technology for the decentralized web. As the crypto landscape continues to transform, Bit Digital’s audacious step serves as a compelling case study in corporate agility, demonstrating how established entities can reinvent themselves to seize new opportunities in the ever-expanding universe of digital assets.

2025-07-15T10:10:41,"South Korean NHIS Manager’s Shocking Downfall: 15 Years for Embezzling Millions in Crypto Futures Debacle","BitcoinWorld South Korean NHIS Manager’s Shocking Downfall: 15 Years for Embezzling Millions in Crypto Futures Debacle The financial world often sees its share of dramatic stories, but few are as stark and cautionary as the recent ruling involving a former manager at South Korea’s National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). This isn’t just a tale of lost money; it’s a profound narrative about trust, severe financial misconduct, and the perilous nature of high-stakes crypto futures trading. The individual’s actions have resulted in a staggering 15-year prison sentence, sending a clear message about accountability when public funds are at stake. The Startling Details of the South Korean NHIS Embezzlement Case In a case that has gripped the nation, a former finance team manager at South Korea’s National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) found himself at the center of a monumental scandal. The manager was convicted for embezzling an astounding 4.6 billion won, which translates to approximately $3.32 million USD. This wasn’t a small slip-up; it was a significant breach of trust under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes, highlighting the severe legal repercussions for those who misuse their positions. The Supreme Court recently upheld the lower court’s stringent ruling, dismissing appeals from both sides and solidifying the 15-year prison term. How Risky Crypto Futures Trading Led to Disaster What happened to the vast sum of embezzled money? The answer reveals a stark warning about the volatility of speculative investments. After a mere 720 million won (about $520,000) was recovered through diligent civil lawsuits and account seizures, the remaining 3.9 billion won (approximately $2.82 million) vanished almost entirely. The culprit? High-risk crypto futures trading. For those unfamiliar, crypto futures allow traders to speculate on the future price of cryptocurrencies without owning the underlying asset. While offering the potential for high returns, they come with equally high, if not higher, risks. This individual’s foray into this volatile market proved catastrophic, turning a monumental theft into an almost complete loss, leaving behind a trail of public funds squandered. The Severe Consequences: What Does a 15-Year Embezzlement Sentence Mean? The 15-year embezzlement sentence handed down to the former NHIS manager underscores the gravity with which South Korean courts view financial crimes, especially those involving public funds. This isn’t merely a slap on the wrist; it’s a significant period of incarceration that reflects the scale of the theft and the profound breach of public trust. The legal system’s firm stance serves as a deterrent, signaling that such financial misconduct will be met with severe penalties. The public’s faith in institutions like the NHIS is paramount, and this ruling aims to restore some of that trust by demonstrating that justice will be served. Understanding Financial Misconduct: A Blow to Public Funds? This incident is a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities that can exist within even well-regulated public institutions. Financial misconduct, particularly when it involves public funds, erodes the very foundation of societal trust. It impacts not only the financial health of an organization but also the public’s confidence in its ability to manage vital services. In the case of the South Korean NHIS, an entity responsible for the health insurance of millions, such an act is particularly egregious. It highlights the critical need for robust internal controls, rigorous oversight, and ethical frameworks to prevent individuals from exploiting their positions for personal gain. This case should prompt all public bodies to review and strengthen their financial safeguards. Safeguarding Public Funds: Essential Lessons Learned The tragic outcome of this embezzlement case offers crucial lessons for financial management and oversight, particularly concerning public funds. Firstly, the incident underscores the inherent dangers of speculative investments like crypto futures, especially when illicitly acquired money is involved. Secondly, it highlights the absolute necessity of stringent internal audit mechanisms and regular financial reviews within public service organizations. Thirdly, fostering a culture of accountability and transparency is paramount. Employees must understand the severe consequences of financial misconduct, and reporting mechanisms should be robust and accessible. Ultimately, protecting public funds requires a multi-layered approach, combining legal deterrence with proactive preventive measures and continuous vigilance. In conclusion, the sentencing of the former South Korean NHIS manager serves as a potent, sobering reminder of the devastating consequences of financial misconduct and the perilous allure of high-risk investments like crypto futures. While the funds may be largely unrecoverable, the judicial outcome sends a clear, uncompromising message: the misuse of public trust for personal gain, particularly when involving such volatile ventures, will be met with the full force of the law. This case stands as a powerful cautionary tale for individuals in positions of trust and a call to action for institutions to fortify their defenses against such breaches.

2025-07-15T10:08:49,"Cardano Price Pauses After Breakout, But Bullish Structure Holds","The post Cardano Price Pauses After Breakout, But Bullish Structure Holds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Cardano price (ADA) recently broke above its long-standing descending channel, closing above the 200-day EMA for the first time in several months. Although the rally has recently slowed around the $0.72-$0.73 level, showing that upward momentum has momentarily cooled, yet the overall technical setup still remains entirely positive. Despite the recent ongoing consolidation, especially when viewed in the context of profit-taking across the crypto space. This sideways momentum in ADA seems more like a pause than a reversal. Also, the underlying indicators also point to more bullish momentum ahead, while the structure built in July remains intact, with support holding firm and accumulation patterns forming. ADA price may still have more upside to explore in the near term. Breakout In Cardano Price Chart Above Key Averages Signals Strength As it is evident that the ADA price has handled strong bearishness for months, being trapped inside this downward wedge. But, this time, ADA crypto breaching above its declining wedges was the biggest feat seen in a month on the daily chart. This breach has relieved many investors who were waiting for this moment in ADA. This move on the ADA price chart isn’t any ordinary move; it’s combined with multiple key factors, which have resulted in developing a crossover in its short-term EMA bands, specifically the 20-day EMA rising above the 50-day EMA. This signals the beginning of a sustained upward phase. Furthermore, the ADA price breakout and sustaining above the 200-day EMA is itself a key long-term indicator of a northward trend. As in the past 3 months, it struggled to hold above this dynamic level, but it is not the case anymore, and recent performance is evident, which clearly suggests a higher degree of resilience. Consolidation Near $0.72 Amid Market-Wide Sell-Off Despite the bullish signals, the ADA price is currently consolidating around $0.72. This pause aligns with a broader pullback in the cryptocurrency market, and Cardano has not been immune to this sentiment. As long-term investors began to realize profits, the Bitcoin, which recently hit an all-time high of $123.2K, dropped more than 5% to $116.7K. Nevertheless, this appears to be a healthy consolidation rather than a worrisome reversal, and it has not broken any critical support levels, yet. It is firmly suggesting that the uptrend remains structurally sound. Accumulation Phase Could Drive Next Leg Higher From a technical perspective, the current price zone between $0.70–$0.72 could act as a re-accumulation zone. Market participants may use this phase to regain strength before making another push toward $1.10, a psychological and technical resistance level. Moreover, another post offers further insight. A recent chart shared by Wyckoff Insider comparing ADA/BTC indicates that Cardano is currently pressing against a strong resistance level. According to the analysis, if accumulation continues and strength rises, ADA/BTC could flip the resistance level into support. Doing so would likely open the door to test the next resistance range in the ADA/BTC pair, which could indirectly support ADA/USD as well. $ADA / $BTC pic.twitter.com/LxLG4ZnrLe — Wyckoff Insider (@Wyckoff_Insider) July 15, 2025",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/cardano-price-pauses-after-breakout-but-bullish-structure-holds/,"TRADING|ADA|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T10:05:01,"Bitcoin Boom And Bust: Getting Ready For The Market Top","Summary Bitcoin has surged 39% in three months, and the market suggests further gains, which prompts investors to plan for profit-taking. Personal wealth management, special life events, and a flight to less volatile assets are all valid reasons to sell. The 500-day Bitcoin halving model, Pi Cycle Top Indicator, Crypto Fear and Greed Index, and RSI all assist in forecasting the market top. Proactively move crypto to exchanges, unstake any assets, understand fees and taxes, set partial profit targets, and monitor for blow-off tops. Introduction If you are a Hodler of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), congratulations! It's been on a great run lately, up 39% over the past 3 months. Bitcoin 3-month chart (Coingecko.com) Most cryptocurrencies have also enjoyed bullish trends recently, and the market appears poised for further gains. So, if the market continues to surge, what’s your plan? Will you hold forever or take profits? When’s the right time to sell? What groundwork should you lay now? This article offers practical insights on spotting a potential market peak and preparing accordingly. Having a plan before the market overheats is critical. To sell or not to sell, that is the question Why would anyone consider selling their Bitcoin? Michael Saylor has famously said , “Never sell your Bitcoin.” To Mr. Saylor, I'd say, ""You do you."" For the rest of us, personal circumstances should guide our decisions. Finance is an area of life where we should seek as much guidance as possible but never abdicate our final authority. I’m not here to push anyone to sell, but there are three compelling reasons to consider liquidating Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies this cycle. The first is wealth management . Five years ago, BTC traded around $10,000 per coin. An investment then is now nearly worth 12X. Those courageous enough to buy during the COVID market dip in March 2020 would now see gains of almost 24X. For some, crypto holdings have grown to dominate their entire portfolio. There is nothing wrong with rebalancing holdings to diversify into metals, quality real estate, and yield-bearing investments. The second reason is various life events, the chief of which is buying a home. Purchasing real estate triggers the immediate need for large amounts of capital, at least for a down payment. Some may prefer to sell enough assets to avoid a mortgage altogether, eliminating the long-term interest costs and providing the wonderful security of outright ownership. Some other important life events could be educational expenses, sudden medical bills, starting a business, or just to cash in your chips for normal or early retirement. The last is what I call crypto fatigue . Some of us have weathered multiple crypto cycles. When I first bought a substantial amount of Bitcoin, the price plummeted 66% in a few months and languished there for two years. Now I'm in my fourth crypto cycle, and I've seen it all. Bitcoin crashes of up to 80%, alt coins soaring and then going to zero, the ICO boom, the NFT craze, the Terra Luna crash, the collapse of FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital, and too many scammers to count. Crypto offers high rewards but comes with extreme risk, volatility, and wild events. The emotional pain of drawdowns, scams, and crashes drives many to seek calmer, safer investments. Market top indicators A rookie crypto mistake is relying on gut feelings to take profits. Formulate an exit strategy well in advance and start by identifying when to sell. There are many models useful to forecast the potential price peak of the Bitcoin cycle. Here are summaries of some popular ones. I recommend using several methods in tandem because, as the old saying goes, there is wisdom in a multitude of counselors. The 500-day Bitcoin halving model This ties the price of Bitcoin to its halving events, which occur roughly every four years. The strategy, in a nutshell, is to buy 500 days before the halving and sell 500 days afterwards. Bitcoin prices 500 days before and after halvings Halving Date 500 Days Before Price 500 Days Before 500 Days After Price 500 Days After Approx. Return July 9, 2016 February 25, 2015 ~$238 November 25, 2017 ~$8,200 ~3,345% May 11, 2020 December 28, 2018 ~$3,800 September 26, 2021 ~$43,000 ~1,032% Note: the 500-day post-halving price target is not exact to the day. In 2017, the BTC cycle high was actually in December; in 2021, it was in October. But this model serves as a great ""two-minute warning"" for the end of the game. The last Bitcoin halving occurred on April 20, 2024, and 500 days after is September 1, 2025. Historical trends would suggest a cycle high slightly after that date, somewhere in September or October 2025. Bonus: Given that the next Bitcoin halving is estimated to occur in March or April 2028, the next cycle low buying opportunity would be October or November 2026. Pi Cycle Top Indicator This technical analysis tool identifies potential market inflection points. It's based on the relationship between two moving BTC averages, the 111-day (111DMA) and the 350-day multiplied by 2 (350DMA x 2). When the 111MDA crosses above the 350DMA x 2, it indicates the start of a bull run. When the 111DMA crosses below the 350DMA × 2, the charts tell the story of a price peak and subsequent correction. The Pi Cycle Indicator complements the 500-day halving model by providing a more precise signal for when to sell within the 500-day post-halving window. Pi Cycle Top Indicator (Bitbo.io) The Pi Cycle Indicator has predicted Bitcoin market tops in past cycles: 2013: It signaled tops during Bitcoin’s run to $1,000 2017: Flagged the peak near $20,000 in December 2021: Indicated a top around $69,000 in November 2025: As of July 2025, the crossover has not yet been confirmed Crypto Fear and Greed Index Crypto Fear and Greed Index (Coinmarketcap.com) This is an interesting, proprietary tool from the folks at CoinMarketCap. It measures and displays investor sentiment, which is often another clue for buying and selling. From their website : This index ranges from 0 to 100, where a lower value indicates extreme fear, and a higher value indicates extreme greed. It helps investors understand the emotional state of the market, which can influence buying and selling behaviors. The index provides insights into whether the market may be undervalued (extreme fear) or overvalued (extreme greed). By observing the current value of the index, you can gauge the overall mood of the cryptocurrency market. For example, a high value suggests that investors are overly greedy, which may indicate that the market is overheated and due for a correction. Conversely, a low value may suggest that fear is driving prices down, potentially creating buying opportunities. This Fear and Greed Index has only been in existence since mid-2023, so historical data is not available for the previous cycle peaks. However, the all-time high was 92, set in March of 2024, when Bitcoin was at $72,125. The price subsequently slumped for about 6 months and bottomed around $52,000. Despite its limited historical data for past cycles, this tool can still be very valuable. I suggest closely monitoring when it surpasses its all-time high. When used alongside other tools, values above 92 may indicate an approaching market peak. The Fear and Greed Index's current value of 70 suggests we are still early in the final market cycle. Relative Strength Index, or RSI RSI is one of the most commonly used top and bottom indicators. It's a momentum oscillator tracking the closing prices over a given time period. Most charting platforms automatically calculate and display it. Traditionally, when the RSI value is over 70, the asset is considered overbought (sell signal), and those under 30 indicate the asset is oversold (buy signal). But these values are not set in stone, and Bitcoin can stay in the overbought territory for a while before the price actually decreases. Bitcoin's RSI recently surpassed 70, signaling entry into the overbought area and a potential short-term price correction. As an isolated metric, this does not indicate a market top. It highlights the need to combine multiple tools for a comprehensive macro perspective. Final note: These are all tools, not guarantees. Bitcoin’s volatility, market risks, and unpredictable events require extra vigilance during critical periods. Other indicators of market sentiment Watch for signs of retail FOMO (fear of missing out), such as friends and family asking, “What should I buy?” Spikes in downloads of the Coinbase app will signal mass market entry. You'll have experts on CNBC talking non-stop about their latest picks, and crypto will grace national magazine covers. These are signs the bull market is nearing its end. Preparing to sell As the bull market nears its peak, is your crypto 100% ready to sell? If you’re self-custodying, do you have a plan to transfer to an exchange before the end-stage market frenzy hits? Many platforms still struggle with operational issues during times of peak usage, and delays in transferring assets could mean missing your optimal selling window. Have you completed all unstaking of crypto assets well in advance? Polkadot ( DOT-USD ) offers great yield rates for staking but requires a 28-day unbonding period. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) may require weeks to free coins for transfer, depending on the platform. Understand the rules for your staking situation and unbond your coins appropriately before the sale. Do you know the commission your exchange will charge for the sale of your coins? These rules can vary greatly and can erode profit if not anticipated ahead of time and managed. Does your exchange offer an OTC desk with advantageous commission rates for larger transactions? Are you prequalified and familiar with the process? Have you linked your bank to your preferred exchange? Have you made successful test transfers of cash out of your trading platform? What are your withdrawal limits? Many exchanges use a tiered verification system that determines user limits for deposits and withdrawals. Imagine a substantial profit stuck on an exchange but limited by low daily or monthly withdrawal thresholds. Have you planned for taxes? Will your sales be classified as short-term or long-term gains? Are the purchase dates accurately recorded, and will that make a difference for short-term (less than 1 year) versus long-term (1 year or longer) gains? Short-term gains are treated as ordinary income. In 2025, they will remain at seven levels: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%. Long-term gains have tax rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%, depending on taxable income and filing status, excluding the NIIT. See the chart below: Capital gains tax rate 2025 (Nerdwallet.com) The net investment income tax (NIIT) is an additional 2.8% tax that kicks in if your income reaches certain thresholds. Investors taking large profits should plan for this as well. Here's a calculator from SmartAsset to use as a guide for what could be owed to the IRS. Exit strategies Take partial profits at price milestones Just as DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is often used to build an investment position, setting specific price targets can guide scaling out when selling. What if you wait for Bitcoin to hit $150,000, but it peaks at $149,000 and then rapidly declines? Missing a price target triggers an intense emotional sense of loss, discouraging you from selling during a further decline. Avoid this psychological trap by setting sell orders while the asset value is still increasing. In the example above, targets could be set and triggered for partial lots at $1,000 price increments from $140,000 to $150,000. Trailing stop orders A trailing stop order automatically adjusts the sell price to lock in profits should the asset's price fall. This also removes the emotion from the sales process by automating the transaction, but requires careful setup to avoid premature triggers. Watch for the blow-off top A blow-off top is a sharp, rapid surge in price driven by intense buying pressure, retail FOMO, and speculative media hype. It often marks the peak of a bull market before a significant correction or an outright crash. Look for parabolic price increases, high trading volume, and extreme greed (> 90) in market sentiment. My price targets and timelines Since Bitcoin is currently at all-time highs, we are entering uncharted territory for the next cycle peak. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, forecasts that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by the end of 2025. In my view, that's possible but not probable. Many analysts favor a $150,000 target, which seems more realistic to me. In my view, timing the selling window is more crucial than predicting an exact price. Historical trends indicate the most significant price action will likely occur after early September, through October, and possibly into November. If we enter September and Bitcoin is already at $150,000, I will begin taking partial profits but allow the bull run to continue. If Bitcoin prints a massive green candle within this predetermined window, I'll take additional profits, as this may signal the blow-off top. Conclusion Congratulations on riding Bitcoin’s impressive 39% surge over the past three months, but as the market heats up, further preparation is necessary. Now is the time to craft a clear exit strategy, use every tool available to diligently monitor the market, and make sure all the prep work for selling is tested and completed. The process of planning when to take crypto profits not only prepares you for market peaks but also has the additional benefit of clarifying your investment strategies and objectives. Here's to a successful rest of the year, upcoming profits, and progression towards your overall financial goals.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801261-bitcoin-boom-and-bust-getting-ready-for-the-market-top?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","BTC-USD",cryptocompare

Here's what to expect next for $ETH , $SOL , $XRP , and… — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 14, 2025 Bitcoin Breaks Out to $123K Bitcoin’s bullish momentum continues, marking a 15.9% gain between June 23 and July 15 . This rally pushed BTC from $107K to $123K , a 14.95% jump , making it the biggest breakout of Q3 so far. In Q2 2025, Bitcoin recorded an impressive 29.9% return , supported by: April: +14.2% May: +11.1% June: +2.40% So far in Q3, Bitcoin is already up 9.69% —and counting.

Popular analyst VirtualBacon shared a detailed thread on X, analyzing BTC’s current breakout and what it means for altcoins. According to him, this may not be a full-blown altseason , but rather a short “altcoin rotation window” . Historically, after each major BTC breakout since mid-2023 , altcoins typically rallied for 3–5 weeks before Bitcoin resumed dominance.

The only pullback was a 4.83% drop in May, which quickly recovered. VirtualBacon emphasizes that a sustained altcoin season needs BTC dominance to decline , something that hasn’t happened yet. But short-term opportunities may still exist. Altcoins to Watch Now VirtualBacon highlights several altcoins with breakout potential: BNB : Near cycle lows LINK : Undervalued with strong fundamentals ADA : Forming a macro double-bottom TRX : Quiet strength DOGE : Known for rallying post-BTC breakouts He also notes Solana ecosystem tokens are showing strength: Bonk : +110.9% (14 days) PENGU : +112.9% (14 days) Emerging Layer-1s and smart contract platforms are also on the radar: SUI, Aptos (APT), and Avalanche (AVAX) —with AVAX yet to rally since October 2023 . Meanwhile, narrative-driven tokens like TAO (14x in 5 months) and PEPE (6.6x in 3 months) have shown what’s possible during strong Bitcoin uptrends. What Happens If Bitcoin Hits $150K? VirtualBacon predicts that if BTC touches $150K , the top 20 altcoins could explode in value, as institutional and retail investors look for the next big opportunity.

2025-07-15T10:00:35,"China Stablecoins: CICC Unveils Crucial Insights on Their Future","BitcoinWorld China Stablecoins: CICC Unveils Crucial Insights on Their Future The world of digital currencies is constantly evolving, with stablecoins often touted as the bridge between volatile cryptocurrencies and traditional fiat. However, a fascinating and crucial perspective has emerged from China, challenging the universal necessity of these digital assets. China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a leading investment bank, has unveiled its findings, suggesting that independent blockchain-based China stablecoins are unlikely to find a foothold in the nation’s already sophisticated financial landscape. Why China’s Payment Ecosystem Already Excels For many, the idea of a stablecoin offers a solution to the volatility inherent in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. But what if a country’s existing payment infrastructure already provides the stability, efficiency, and low costs that stablecoins promise? This is precisely the argument put forth by CICC. China’s digital payment realm is dominated by giants like WeChat Pay and Alipay, which have fundamentally transformed how transactions occur for hundreds of millions of people. Consider these points about China’s existing payment ecosystem : “Quasi-Stablecoin” Functionality: CICC highlights that platforms like WeChat Pay already operate as “quasi-stablecoins.” Users hold balances pegged directly to the renminbi (RMB), ensuring price stability. These balances are backed by legal reserves, mirroring the very mechanism stablecoins aim to achieve. Unmatched Efficiency and Low Cost: One of the most compelling aspects is the transaction fees. WeChat Pay and Alipay charge ultra-low fees, often just a fraction of a percent. This stands in stark contrast to the multi-percent fees sometimes seen on overseas platforms, including those for certain stablecoin transactions. Widespread Adoption: Digital payments are ubiquitous in China, from street vendors to high-end retailers. The convenience and speed are unparalleled, making cash almost obsolete in many urban areas. This mature, efficient, and incredibly low-cost environment means the core problems that independent stablecoins seek to solve—volatility, high fees, and slow transactions—simply don’t exist to the same degree within China’s domestic payment system. Dissecting the CICC Report: A Deep Dive The recent CICC report , as noted by JinSe Finance, delves into the specifics of why independent stablecoins would struggle to gain traction. The report essentially argues that the existing infrastructure has already achieved what stablecoins aspire to, but with the added benefits of established regulatory oversight and widespread trust. The bank’s analysis suggests that the value proposition of a new, blockchain-based stablecoin is significantly diminished when compared to the seamless experience already provided by dominant players. For the average Chinese consumer or business, switching to a new, potentially less regulated, and less integrated stablecoin system would offer no discernible advantages and might even introduce unnecessary friction or risk. Furthermore, China maintains strict capital controls and a tightly regulated financial system. The introduction of independent stablecoins, especially those not directly controlled or overseen by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), would likely conflict with these existing frameworks. The nation prioritizes financial stability and control, making it inherently cautious about decentralized financial instruments that could circumvent its established mechanisms. The Digital Yuan: China’s Own Stablecoin Solution? It’s impossible to discuss China stablecoins without addressing the elephant in the room: the Digital Yuan (e-CNY). While not a blockchain-based stablecoin in the decentralized sense, the e-CNY is China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) and serves as a digital version of its fiat currency. This government-backed digital currency is undergoing extensive trials and is designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing payment ecosystem. The Digital Yuan essentially functions as the ultimate official stablecoin, offering: Sovereign Backing: Directly issued and guaranteed by the PBOC, ensuring ultimate stability and trust. Programmability: Potential for smart contract-like features, allowing for specific use cases and enhanced financial control. Integration: Designed to work alongside WeChat Pay and Alipay, not replace them, but rather offer another layer of digital payment infrastructure. Enhanced Oversight: Provides the central bank with greater visibility and control over monetary flows, crucial for financial stability and combating illicit activities. The existence and ongoing rollout of the Digital Yuan further solidify CICC’s argument. If the state itself is providing a digital, stable version of its currency, the need for private, independent stablecoins diminishes even further. Why would consumers or businesses opt for a less official, potentially riskier alternative when a state-backed digital currency offers superior security and integration? Global Stablecoin Trends vs. China’s Unique Path Globally, stablecoins like USDT and USDC play a significant role in the cryptocurrency market, often serving as liquidity bridges, trading pairs, and a store of value during market volatility. Regulatory discussions around stablecoins are intense in the West, with governments exploring frameworks for their oversight and issuance. However, China’s approach stands in stark contrast. Its robust and centralized payment ecosystem , coupled with its proactive development of the Digital Yuan, positions it uniquely. Unlike many Western nations where stablecoins emerged to fill perceived gaps in traditional finance or to offer a decentralized alternative, China’s financial system already provides highly efficient digital payment solutions. The focus in China is on control, stability, and integration within the existing state-led financial framework, rather than fostering decentralized alternatives. This difference in philosophy and existing infrastructure explains why the CICC report comes to its seemingly counter-intuitive conclusion for those accustomed to Western crypto narratives. For China, the ‘problem’ that stablecoins solve simply isn’t a pressing issue domestically. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Finance? CICC’s assessment offers crucial insights into China’s strategic direction regarding digital currencies. It underscores a clear preference for a centrally controlled, efficient, and highly integrated digital financial system, rather than one driven by independent, decentralized blockchain projects. This doesn’t mean China is against all forms of digital innovation; quite the opposite, as seen with the Digital Yuan. However, the innovation must align with national priorities of stability, control, and efficiency. For global crypto enthusiasts and developers, this perspective from CICC serves as a powerful reminder that not all markets operate under the same assumptions or have the same needs. While stablecoins may be transformative in some regions, their utility is context-dependent. In China, the existing financial architecture and regulatory environment have already addressed many of the challenges that stablecoins aim to overcome. In conclusion, CICC’s assessment provides a compelling argument for why independent stablecoins are unlikely to make significant inroads in China. The nation’s mature, efficient, and incredibly low-cost payment ecosystem, spearheaded by giants like WeChat Pay , coupled with the ongoing development of the Digital Yuan , effectively negates the core value proposition of private stablecoins. China’s digital financial future appears to be one of centralized innovation and unparalleled efficiency, built upon its already formidable foundation.

2025-07-15T10:00:17,"Ripple Vs. SEC: Former SEC Lawyer Reveals What Is Holding Back The Lawsuit","The lawsuit brought against Ripple by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raged on for the last five years. While the last year has brought very good news for supporters of XRP, it has yet to be dismissed completely , which has further dampened morale. But while it seems that there is something major holding the lawsuit from being concluded, a former SEC lawyer has come forth to verify that what is actually holding back the conclusion. No Pending Decisions In Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit After one XRP community member known as ToniTheRippler posted on X (formerly Twitter) about the possibility of Ripple’s banking license being approved, a debate was quickly sparked in the comments over when this could happen. Community members were mainly worried about the ongoing Ripple Vs. SEC lawsuit and how this could impact and probably delay the approval of the banking license. One community member responded that things are expected to move fast now that there is a pro-crypto SEC. However, another user commented that if it were so, they would have dropped the Ripple case already. A third user then explained that the fault does not lie with the SEC, but rather with the judge, Judge Analisa Torres , who has ordered that both parties follow due process in their bid to drop the case. Given the multiple angles being thrown around, former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel chimed in to clear the air and reveal what was really holding up the case. Since both the SEC and Ripple have agreed to drop the case, Fagel revealed that neither of them was to blame for the case not being dropped yet. Rather, both parties have to follow the standard procedure to do so, and the problem was that this procedure typically takes between 1 and 2 months before it is completed. Explaining further, Fagel, responding to the same user, explained that both parties had actually already resubmitted their filings to drop the case. But the court decided that they had failed to meet the burden required. Thus, Judge Analissa Torres had refused to modify the order against Ripple. This means that presently, there is actually nothing left to be deliberated on by the court, as both parties no longer have any pending judgments. Instead, they now have to work to actually meet the requirements to completely dismiss the appeals that were initially filed by both parties , which Fagel said they would do shortly. As for when the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit would be completely done, going by the timeline provided by Fagel, it would mean that the lawsuit should be concluded by late-August, barring any other developments.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-former-lawyer/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING","Ripple|ripple|ripple lawsuit|ripple news|Ripple price|ripple sec|Ripple vs SEC|SEC|SEC news|SEC Vs.

On Tuesday, long-term government yields quietly hit levels not seen before. The 30-year Japanese bond yield jumped to 3.20%, a fresh record. It didn’t come with alarms, but the fallout is loud. Since 2019, those same bonds have now lost 45% of their value. The financial damage is starting to spread, and confidence in the country’s ability to manage its debt is sinking, fast. According to CNBC, this collapse has triggered a chain reaction. Over the past year, yields on the 30Y note climbed by 100 basis points, a surge that’s left institutional portfolios in tatters. Japan’s four largest life insurers reported their unrealized losses on domestic bonds shot up from around $15 billion to $60 billion in Q1 2025. That’s not a small uptick—that’s four times bigger in just one year. Bank of Japan absorbs the damage The worst numbers are coming from the Bank of Japan. The central bank reported $198 billion in unrealized losses on government bonds for Fiscal Year 2024. One year earlier, that figure was around $66 billion. The losses have tripled, and nothing suggests they’re slowing down. In fact, the bleed is accelerating. It’s not just a bad year, it’s a system that’s starting to break. That breakdown is now visible in Japan’s debt-to-GDP ratio, which has officially crossed 260%, the highest level in the country’s modern history. That ratio is now double that of the United States, even though the U.S. is also ramping up deficit spending under President Donald Trump. While America might be following behind, Japan is already deep in the hole. There’s another problem: who holds all this collapsing debt? The Bank of Japan itself owns 52% of all domestic government bonds. Life insurers only hold 13.4%, banks hold 9.8%, and pension funds 8.9%. That means over half of the bonds crashing on fears of a default are held by the issuer. It’s the equivalent of lending money to yourself and then watching your own IOUs burn. Global markets feel the pressure Zooming out, this isn’t just about Japan. The U.S. 10-year yield has risen by nearly 500% since 2020, just behind the jump in Japan’s 30Y. That’s because Washington is flooding the market with bonds to finance Trump’s aggressive fiscal push. As supply rises, prices drop. The situation is dragging global bond markets into uncharted territory. Inflation is making it worse. In May, Japan’s core CPI, excluding fresh food, rose 3.7% year-over-year, the fastest pace since January 2023. That’s the exact scenario U.S. Federal Reserve officials are trying to avoid, and it’s why they keep warning that interest rates may stay “higher for longer.” And then there’s the weirdest part: Germany’s 30Y bond yields are almost identical to Japan’s, around 3.1%. But Germany has a Debt-to-GDP ratio of 62% and a policy rate of 2.25%, compared to Japan’s 0.50% and 260%+ debt ratio. The math doesn’t add up. It shows the global market is under pressure and nobody wants to be the first to cut spending. Now, Japan’s mess is a warning to everyone else. A preview of what happens when governments rely too much on debt. Bond market liquidity is already worse than during the 2008 financial crisis. That’s not speculation, it’s a fact. And investors are reacting. This is why Bitcoin and gold are both exploding to all-time highs. People are moving their money out of bonds and into hard assets. The market isn’t waiting around for politicians to fix it. It already knows what’s coming.

2025-07-15T10:00:00,"Function Raises $10M to Bring Yield to Bitcoin; Gets Backing From Galaxy Digital, Antalpha, and Mantle","Crypto infrastructure firm Function has closed a $10 million seed round led by Galaxy Digital (GLXY), with participation from Antalpha (ANTA) and Mantle, the company said in a press release on Tuesday. The round positions Function, formerly known as Ignition, at the forefront of a growing effort to unlock institutional yield opportunities from bitcoin (BTC), which remains the largest yet least-utilized digital asset in decentralized finance (DeFi). Function's flagship product, FBTC, a fully reserved and composable bitcoin representation, has already amassed $1.5 billion in total value locked (TVL), the company said. Function is positioning FBTC as the gateway for institutions and corporate treasuries to productively deploy bitcoin while maintaining full custodial control and 1:1 asset backing. The firm is entering the market as momentum builds around the institutional adoption of bitcoin, not just as a store of value, but as a yield-generating instrument. With Mike Novogratz's Galaxy joining as both an investor and core contributor, Function gains a heavyweight partner in scaling FBTC’s institutional reach. Galaxy’s involvement includes liquidity provisioning, governance and risk framework design, and strategic oversight. “By 2026, treating bitcoin as a passive treasury asset may no longer be enough. The new standard will be actively earning yield” said Thomas Chen, CEO of Function, in emailed comments. “We’re evolving from wrapped assets to functional infrastructure that's programmable and institutional-grade to transform bitcoin into a productive asset class. Sophisticated allocators will demand their bitcoin work as hard as their cash. Those slow to adapt will underperform; forward-looking firms will win the next era of bitcoin yield.” Chen added.

2025-07-15T09:53:12,"Bitcoin's Volatility Will Continue to Decline as Adoption Grows: Deutsche Bank","Bitcoin's (BTC) volatility could continue to fall as mainstream acceptance grows and the cryptocurrency is adopted by companies, retail investors and governments, Deutsche Bank said in a research report on Tuesday. Excitement over upcoming legislation in the U.S. has spurred bitcoin’s recent rally, the german lender said, but it is notable that the crypto's rise has also been accompanied by a historic decline in volatility levels. The world's largest cryptocurrency has risen nearly 75% since mid-November, driven by a mix of favorable regulations, growing institutional adoption, and global macroeconomic shifts, the report said. The rally coincides with “Crypto Week” in Washington, DC, highlighting increasing government and corporate engagement with digital assets. This week the House of Representatives is set to vote on the CLARITY Act, a crypto market structure bill, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins in the U.S. Deutsche Bank suggests the drop in volatility signals a maturing market, where regulatory clarity, broader adoption, and long-term investment behaviors are stabilizing performance. As bitcoin gains legitimacy through regulation and integration into traditional portfolios, it may continue to shed its speculative image and evolve into a more stable, strategic asset, the report added. As volatility decreases and regulatory certainty increases, bitcoin is becoming more appealing for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other long-term allocators.

2025-07-15T09:40:43,"Altcoin Season Index at 31: Unpacking the Dominant Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 31: Unpacking the Dominant Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Are you keeping a close eye on the ever-evolving crypto market ? If so, understanding the ebb and flow between Bitcoin and altcoins is absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. The cryptocurrency landscape is a dynamic arena, often characterized by distinct periods where one asset class outshines the other. Currently, a key metric, the Altcoin Season Index , is signaling a clear trend: we are firmly in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio and future investments? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, tracked by prominent cryptocurrency price data platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC). It offers a snapshot of market sentiment and asset performance by comparing how the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have fared against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a barometer for understanding which segment of the market is currently leading the charge. Let’s break down how the index works: Index Range: The score ranges from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season Criteria: For the market to be considered in ‘Altcoin Season,’ at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This is when altcoins typically see significant gains and often capture more investor attention. Bitcoin Season Criteria: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ occurs when 25% or fewer of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that capital is largely flowing into Bitcoin, or Bitcoin is holding its value better during market downturns. Current Snapshot: Why the Index Stands at 31 and Signals Bitcoin Season As of 00:30 UTC on July 15, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 31. This figure, unchanged from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is presently in a pronounced Bitcoin Season . A score of 31 is significantly below the 75 threshold required for altcoin dominance, suggesting that a vast majority of altcoins have not managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last three months. What drives such a shift? Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s outperformance: Flight to Safety: During periods of uncertainty or volatility in the broader financial markets, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Growing institutional adoption and large-scale investments often flow into Bitcoin first, given its liquidity and established position. Halving Cycles: Anticipation or post-halving effects can draw significant attention and capital into Bitcoin, as its supply issuance decreases. Dominance Cycle: Bitcoin typically leads bull runs, with altcoins catching up later. A strong Bitcoin Season can be a precursor to a future altcoin rally, but it signifies a current period of Bitcoin strength. Understanding this current market phase is vital for strategizing your next moves in the crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market: Implications for Your Altcoin Performance So, what does a score of 31 on the Altcoin Season Index mean for your altcoin performance and overall investment strategy? It suggests that, for now, capital is consolidating around Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless, but rather that they might be experiencing less significant gains, or even corrections, while Bitcoin either holds strong or makes notable advances. During Bitcoin Season, investors often observe: Lower Altcoin Volatility (Potentially): While altcoins are inherently volatile, their price movements might be more subdued compared to Bitcoin’s gains, or they might experience steeper percentage drops during corrections. Bitcoin Dominance Increase: The percentage of the total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin tends to rise. Focus on Foundational Projects: Investors might shift focus to established, larger-cap altcoins with strong fundamentals, rather than highly speculative smaller projects. This period can be challenging for those heavily invested in smaller altcoins hoping for quick returns. It emphasizes the importance of a well-diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective. Forecasting Cryptocurrency Trends: What Comes Next? While the current data points to a clear Bitcoin Season , the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. History suggests that a prolonged period of Bitcoin dominance often sets the stage for a subsequent Altcoin Season . But how do we anticipate these shifts in cryptocurrency trends ? Key indicators and factors to watch for a potential shift: Bitcoin Consolidation: After a strong rally, Bitcoin might enter a period of consolidation, trading sideways. This often allows capital to flow into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. New Narratives and Innovations: The emergence of groundbreaking technologies or strong narratives within the altcoin space (e.g., new DeFi protocols, successful Layer-2 solutions, major gaming projects) can ignite investor interest. Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance, even if Bitcoin’s price is stable, can signal capital moving into altcoins. Macroeconomic Stability: A more stable global economic environment can encourage investors to take on more risk, flowing into higher-beta assets like altcoins. It’s crucial to remember that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator. It tells us what has happened, not what will happen. Therefore, while it confirms the current state, active monitoring of market sentiment and fundamental developments is key for anticipating future shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Navigating the current Bitcoin Season requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current asset allocation. If you’re heavily weighted in altcoins, consider whether a rebalance towards Bitcoin or stablecoins is prudent for risk management. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): During a Bitcoin Season, altcoin prices might be suppressed. This can be an opportune time to DCA into promising altcoins you’ve researched thoroughly, accumulating them at potentially lower prices. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of chasing hype, delve into the fundamentals of altcoin projects. Look for strong teams, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. These projects are more likely to weather a Bitcoin Season and thrive when altcoins regain momentum. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news, technical analysis, and the Altcoin Season Index itself. Knowledge is your most powerful tool in the volatile crypto space. Manage Expectations: Understand that not every altcoin will perform equally, especially during a Bitcoin-dominant phase. Patience and realistic expectations are vital. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin’s strength, the wheel will eventually turn. Being prepared for both seasons is the mark of a truly strategic investor. The Cycle Continues: A Compelling Summary The Altcoin Season Index , currently at 31, unequivocally signals that the crypto market is in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins over the past 90 days. While this phase might present challenges for immediate altcoin performance , it also offers unique opportunities for strategic accumulation and portfolio rebalancing. Understanding these distinct cryptocurrency trends , from Bitcoin dominance to the eventual resurgence of altcoins, is fundamental for long-term success in this dynamic asset class. Stay vigilant, conduct thorough research, and prepare for the market’s inevitable shifts.

2025-07-15T09:30:32,"Ethereum Shorts Reach Record Levels, How To Stay Positioned For A Breakout","As the Ethereum price has broken out above $3,000, the shorts have piled on with expectations that this rally will end up like the others before it: in a crash. Not only have the shorts been dominating the market recently, but the exponential growth has seen the short positions rise to levels never before seen in the history of the digital asset. While this might look bearish at a glance as it means traders expect the price to decline, it could actually end up being ultra-bullish for the altcoin. Ethereum Leverage Positions Reach Record Short Levels In a post on X, market expert Zerohedge revealed an interesting development for Ethereum, and that is the fact that Ethereum shorts have now reached new records. The chart showed the Ether leveraged net totals, and it came out to a -13291, beating the previous high that was set back in May at -12000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Stopping At $123,000 — Technical Indicators Point To $140,000 Top This rise in Ethereum shorts proves that there is still a lot of disbelief in the current market rally, and many traders expect the Ethereum price to fall again. However, looking at the historical performance when it comes to shorts reaching record levels, it shows a trend that this could mean the rally could be sustained. For example, back in May 2025, when it set its previous peak of -12000, the Ethereum price had rallied from below $1,800 to above $2,600 before the month was over. This trend is also playing out now as the Ethereum price has crossed $3,000, as the Ether shorts have reached a new peak. How To Stay Positioned For ETH Given that the Ethereum price seems to be headed into what might be a parabolic rally after clearing $3,000, crypto analyst Luca on X has outlined how they intend to position for the surge. Luca explains that with the new week, the Ethereum price is at a key point. This is because it is approaching the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement level, and this level is important because it has been a point of consolidation for the altcoin in the past. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst As such, the analyst explains that he intends to keep holding his positions on Ethereum. So far, Luca revealed that he has only de-risked Bitcoin positions as the pioneer cryptocurrency has hit all-time highs, but as the end of the cycle draws closer, the focus remains on altcoins. He maintains that the Ethereum price, alongside altcoins, will end up outperforming Bitcoin once the dominance drops. When this dominance drop happens, the analyst says that is when to begin de-risking altcoin positions. For now, though, the analyst expects Ethereum and altcoins to keep trailing Bitcoin as the dominance still remains high above 64% and BTC is yet to enter its distribution phase.

2025-07-15T09:24:14,"Bitcoin, XRP Open Interest Nears Record High as Bull Market Pullback Unfolds","This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin: Bull Market Pullback Underway The bitcoin (BTC) market rally has stalled in the past 24 hours as expected , but instead of consolidation, prices have pulled back over 5% to $116,800 from record highs in a move typical of a bull market pullback. Reports suggest that profit-taking by long-term holders is weighing on the cryptocurrency's price. It's common for markets to revisit breakout points, in this case, the May 22 high of around $111,960, and test the underlying buying interest before chalking out bigger rallies. A similar dynamic played out earlier this year as prices dropped from over $100,000 of $75,000, revisiting the breakout point from late 2024. From a technical analysis perspective, the broader bullish bias will prevail while prices remain locked in the ascending channel on the daily chart. Over the next 24 hours, the focus will be on the hourly chart, which shows a steep corrective trend lower, with prices trading below the Ichimoku cloud to suggest bearish momentum. However, the RSI on the hourly chart has dropped below 30, indicating an oversold condition – a stark contrast to the above-70 or overbought reading seen a day ago. So, a bounce cannot be ruled out. The probability of a pullback to $111,960 would weaken if the potential recovery ends the downward-trending channel. Such a move will likely result in fresh record highs. Open interest nears record high Volatility could remain high as cumulative open interest in onshore and offshore futures and offshore perpetual futures has increased to 734.82K BTC, which is just shy of the record 744K BTC in October 2022, according to data source CoinGecko. The growth in open interest is likely being led by offshore exchanges as the number of active contracts on the CME remains below the May high, with the three-month annualized basis still below 10%. Conversely, annualized funding rates on offshore perpetuals have topped 11%, indicating a growing demand for the bullish exposure. MOVE Index turns higher The MOVE index, which gauges 30-day implied volatility in U.S. Treasury notes, has rebounded from a critical level that has consistently foreshadowed sharp spikes in market volatility since 2024. That's a cause for concern for the bulls because volatility spikes in the Treasury market tend to lead to financial tightening, a risk-off development. Moreover, since 2024, bottoms in MOVE have marked interim BTC price tops. Watch out for the history to repeat itself, leading to a deeper BTC bull market pullback. AI's take: Bitcoin's 5% pullback is a healthy bull market feature, aiming to retest the key breakout level of $111,960 before potentially initiating a stronger rally. Resistance: $118,000-118,500, $120,000, $123,181 Support: $113,688 (the 38.2% Fib retracement of the rally from June 22 lows), $111,965, $107,823 (the 61.8% Fib) XRP: Holds 100-hour MA and cloud support XRP (XRP) has dropped from $3 and appears to be trapped in a downward-trending channel on the hourly chart, mirroring BTC. Still, XRP appears relatively better off, holding the confluence of the 100-hour simple moving average (SMA) and the Ichimoku cloud at $2.81. A breakout from here would imply an end to the correction and resumption of the broader uptrend toward the yearly peak of $3.4. On the way higher, bulls will likely be tested again at around $3. Watch out for the move below the Ichimoku cloud, as that would strengthen the immediate bear case, shifting focus to the 200-hour SMA at $2.6. Again, volatility could be elevated with perpetual futures open interest hitting a record high of 2.74 billion XRP, according to Coinglass. The annualized XRP funding rates hover at 15%, indicating a growing bias for leveraged bullish plays. AI's take: Despite XRP's hourly chart showing a BTC-mirroring downtrend from $3, its strong hold above the 100-hour SMA and Ichimoku cloud at $2.81 signals underlying support. Record perpetual futures open interest and high funding rates indicate significant leveraged bullish demand, making a breakout above $3, towards $3.4, likely if current support holds. Resistance: $3, $3.4 Support: $2.81, $2.6-$2.65, $2.38 ETH: Awaiting breakout Ether (ETH) remains trapped in an expanding triangle, with the daily stochastic flashing an overbought reading, pointing to stretched upward momentum, which weakens the case for a firm breakout in the short term. A consolidation around the resistance looks likely as prices are firmly above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and short-term SMAs point north, indicating a bullish bias. An eventual breakout would shift focus to $3,400, a level targeted by options traders. AI's take: The daily stochastic being overbought indicates that momentum is stretched, making a convincing push above the upper trendline unlikely in the short term. Resistance: $3,067 (the 61.8% Fib retracement), $3,500, $3,570, $4,000. Support: $2,905, $2,880, $2,739, $2,600 SOL: $168 is the new resistance level SOL's upside remains elusive despite the dual breakout on the daily chart. Since Friday, the bulls have failed at least twice to chew through bearish pressures at around $168, as evidenced by the long upper wicks attached to the candles for Monday and Friday. So, a break above $168 is now needed to confirm bullishness. On the downside, $157 is the level to watch as it marks the neckline support of the double top pattern on the hourly chart. A breakdown of the support line would imply potential for a deeper decline to $146, per the measured move method. AI's take : Traders should watch for a definitive break above $168 to confirm bullish continuation; otherwise, a loss of the $157 neckline support could trigger a deeper decline towards $146. Resistance : $168, $180-$190, $200.

2025-07-15T09:19:50,"Bitcoin (BTC) dips ahead of potential US inflation increase: Price analysis","Bitcoin (BTC) fell from its new top of $123,200 on Monday and into Tuesday, to currently stand at just under $117,000. Besides the reason of buyer exhaustion, Tuesday will see the new monthly CPI data print, with experts forecasting a 0.3% month on month rise. How will Bitcoin react to this? Potential uptick in U.S. consumer price inflation? As predicted by plenty of analysts over recent times, inflation could start to rear its ugly head again in the US. Expected to feed through from the Trump tariffs, an incremental increase in consumer price inflation may be about to make its presence felt. The new monthly figures will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, around 5 hours from now. CPI is expected to increase by 0.3%, while Core CPI is predicted to rise by the same margin. The figures are an increase on the previous 0.1% monthly rise. This translates to 2.6% year on year. Of course, the actual data may be above or below what is estimated, and this could then cause the U.S. stock market to turn in one direction or the other, with the potential to further affect Bitcoin and the crypto market. How far down will this correction go? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for Bitcoin reveals the current corrective phase. The sharp and sustained rise out of the bull flag could not keep going indefinitely, and so a correction at this point was favourite to happen, and is very healthy for the $BTC price going forward, allowing momentum/overbought indicators to reset. It now remains to be seen just how far down the price will go. The Fibonacci retracements for this move out of the bull flag, and to the new all-time high, suggest the price could come back to $115,000, or $113,500. The horizontal level of $112,000 coincides with the top of the bull flag and the top of the first pennant after the price first escaped the full flag. The price could also consolidate at its current level, which corresponds to the bottom of the larger pennant. Whichever of the above options finally comes true, the main thing for investors to consider is that the longer the price stays down in this area, the more time it provides for the bulls to regain their composure ready for the next push to the upside. Potential for a sharp drop to strong support at $112,000? Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $BTC price does contain some concerns. Not least of which is the long candle wick to the upside, left over from the sharp surge to over $123,000 on Monday. This would imply a lot of downside momentum, and so if the price does not recover before going below $116,000, the next stop could be the $112,000 horizontal support level seen in the chart above. While this potential $11,000 correction might seriously scare investors, if support was found at $112,000, it would likely result in a strong bounce to the upside, founded on what could become strong price structure. CPI print awaited for bulls or bears to take control Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows how the support at $112,000 is also part of a band of support which descends until $109,000. For the bull market to continue, this would probably need to hold firm. One scenario that could unfold today is if the US CPI print is slightly worse than expected. This might then have the potential to force the price all the way back down to the strong support band. But as already mentioned, a bounce is more likely than not from there. If the CPI release is as expected, or better than expected, the current correction could be reasonably short-lived. For the more long-term investor, this probably all counts as noise. Bitcoin’s trend is still up, and its bull market is not finished yet. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-15T09:16:14,"Bitcoin Buyers Absorb All New Supply as Price-Agnostic Demand Surges","Bitcoin rally is being driven by a relentless wave of price-agnostic buyers, with demand from small investors now exceeding the monthly supply miners bring to market. According to Bitfinex analysts, the combined holdings of new buyers are expanding at a rate of around 19,300 BTC per month, comfortably outpacing the post-halving issuance of approximately 13,400 BTC. Analysts note that smaller investor groups—known in the crypto community as “Shrimp” (less than 1 BTC), “Crab” (1–10 BTC), and “Fish” (10–100 BTC)—are steadily accumulating Bitcoin, unfazed by price swings. “Demand from this segment alone is more than enough to absorb all new supply,” the Bitfinex report stated, emphasizing that these buyers are “relentlessly accumulating with limited intervals.” Bitcoin Sets New Highs The surge in grassroots accumulation comes as Bitcoin continues to break records . On Monday, the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $122,884 before pulling back to around $116,700 at the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Crypto trading firm QCP Capital commented that BTC’s relentless rally “shows no signs of fatigue,” as retail and institutional participation remains strong . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment, posted a “Greed” score of 74 on Monday, marking its fifth consecutive day in the “Greed” zone. Despite the ongoing bullish momentum, the rapid price ascent has liquidated a significant number of short positions. CoinGlass reported that nearly $430 million in Bitcoin shorts were wiped out as the price surged past $121,000. Warnings of Potential Volatility Ahead While the persistent demand and new highs are energizing the market, analysts warn investors to remain cautious. Redstone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak noted that although some analysts are predicting near-term Bitcoin targets as high as $140,000 , “history teaches us that parabolic moves often invite sharp corrections.” Kazmierczak highlighted recent large-scale liquidations as a reminder that volatility is a constant companion for Bitcoin traders, advising investors to approach price milestones with careful position sizing rather than euphoria. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan echoed these sentiments, pointing out that spikes in trader optimism have previously been followed by sharp price corrections, as seen during BTC drops on June 11 and July 7.
