2025-07-15T19:58:37,"‘Crypto Week’ Takes A Hit: US House Fails To Advance Key Acts","In a major blow for the crypto industry, several bills championed by President Donald Trump failed to pass a crucial procedural vote in the House of Representatives on Tuesday. According to CNBC, the final tally stood at 196-223, with 13 Republican representatives siding with Democrats to block the motion, marking a rare moment of dissent among House Republicans. House Rejects Key Crypto Legislation The proposed legislation included notable measures such as the GENIUS Act, which aimed to establish regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies including stablecoins, which have gained notable traction over the past months among traditional firms. In light of the failed vote, House leadership has indicated plans to hold another vote later in the day. However, it remains uncertain whether this subsequent vote will address the same bills or if amendments will be made to appease those who opposed the original motion.

Digital Assets are the FUTURE, and we are leading by a lot! Get the first Vote done this afternoon (ALL REPUBLICANS SHOULD VOTE YES!). Market Reacts Negatively Despite the optimism surrounding “Crypto Week,” the failure of the vote sent ripples through the market.

2025-07-15T19:48:08,"How Much Higher Does Bitcoin Need To Go To Surpass Gold’s Market Cap? Here Is That Critical Price Point","Bitcoin reached an all-time high, reaching as high as $123,000. Following this historic surge, investors and analysts have begun to re-discuss the next big goal for the world's largest digital asset: reaching the market capitalization of gold. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $117,252 and its total market capitalization is around $2.34 trillion. In comparison, gold's estimated total market capitalization is $23.13 trillion. This means Bitcoin currently represents only 10.09% of gold's market capitalization. Analysts estimate that for Bitcoin to “flip”—or surpass—gold's market capitalization, its price would need to rise to $1,161,767, representing an increase of approximately 890% from today's level. Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Bitcoin's long-term performance is increasing the number of investors who believe this goal is beyond imagination. While Bitcoin has gained over 1,168 percent in the last five years, gold's return has been only around 85 percent. Over the three-year period, Bitcoin has risen 470 percent, while gold's return has remained at 92 percent. This comparison paints a similar picture over the two-year, one-year, and three-month periods. For example, since the beginning of 2025, BTC has increased by approximately 25%, while gold has gained around 26%. However, in just the last three months, Bitcoin has gained over 38%, while gold has only gained around 3%. In the last month, Bitcoin has risen by more than 11%, while gold has lost 4%. There are also significant differences between the two assets on the supply side. Bitcoin's annual supply growth is around 0.83%, while gold's is estimated at around 1.72%. Furthermore, Bitcoin's halving mechanism, which occurs every four years, further reduces new supply, making the digital asset even more scarce. *This is not investment advice.

In today's vote, a proposal that would have paved the way for discussion of three important cryptocurrency bills was rejected by 223 “no” votes to 196. According to parliamentary sources, a retry is scheduled for midnight the same day. During what has been dubbed “Crypto Week,” two major bills were on the House agenda: the National Innovation Guidelines and Establishment for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS) and the Digital Asset Market Openness Act (Clarity). The GENIUS bill has already passed the Senate and is expected to reach President Trump's desk by the end of the week. The GENIUS law stipulates that stablecoin issuances must be fully collateralized only by US dollars or similar liquid assets, requires annual audits for issuers with a market capitalization over $50 billion, and establishes rules for overseas stablecoin issuance. Related News: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Hater JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Backtracked Again: “I Still Don't Fully Understand It, But...” The Clarity Act, meanwhile, aims to clarify the regulatory framework for crypto assets by offering a more comprehensive approach. It clarifies the roles and jurisdictions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as requiring digital asset service providers to notify individual investors and segregate client funds from company assets. A vote was also expected in the House this week on a bill spearheaded by House Republican Deputy Chairman Tom Emmer, which aims to block the direct issuance of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to individuals. However, the procedural vote failed after 12 Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor Greene, Chip Roy, Michael Cloud, and Anna Paulina Luna, voted “no.” House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that some opposition lawmakers had demanded that all crypto bills be merged into a single text. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-15T19:26:34,"Bitcoin Whales Scoop 248K BTC This Month as Bulls Eye $200K","TL;DR Bitcoin accumulator wallets hit a 2025 peak, adding 248K BTC worth $30B in recent weeks. Whale short exposure shows market split, even as long-term holders continue to stack Bitcoin. BTC inflows hit $3.7B last week, pushing assets under management to a record $211 billion. Long-Term Holders Step Up Accumulation Bitcoin wallets known for never selling have added about 248,000 BTC this month, according to data from CryptoQuant. These addresses are called “accumulators” because they only receive Bitcoin and have no record of moving units out. The monthly average sits closer to 164,000 BTC, which means most of the recent buying happened in just a few weeks. At current prices, this stash is worth around $30 billion. It shows that some players are adding to their holdings even as Bitcoin trades near all-time highs. Source: CryptoQuant Caution Remains If Prices Pull Back If Bitcoin enters a correction or moves sideways for a while, some of these wallets may start selling. That would pull out their accumulator status and might result in a new supply in the market. Meanwhile, most of them are clinging. This pattern signals a strong interest in holding BTC long term, even as price swings remain sharp. It’s not a guarantee of future price moves, but it adds context to recent demand. At the same time, big trades over $1 million are showing short exposure. Joao Wedson from Alphractal says whales are currently leaning bearish based on tools that track volume and open interest.

The mixed signals between whales and accumulator wallets show that not everyone agrees on what comes next. Key Levels After Recent Price Drop Bitcoin was trading around $116,500 at the time of writing. That’s a drop of 4.5% in 24 hours, but still up 8% over the last week. Analyst Ali Martinez said the price recently hit a target near $121,000, with the next levels at $131,000, $144,000, and $158,000. Some are pointing to a possible top around $200,000 later this year if the current chart pattern plays out. Nothing is certain, but the momentum remains strong for now. Funds tied to crypto brought in $3.7 billion last week alone. That’s the second-biggest weekly inflow ever. Year-to-date inflows are now $22.7 billion.

2025-07-15T19:26:16,"GameStop CEO Says Bitcoin Bet Is a Hedge, Not a Strategy Copy","Key Takeaways: Ryan Cohen said GameStop is prioritizing cautious capital allocation over aggressive crypto exposure. The company’s convertible note offerings remain a popular funding route even amid equity market volatility. Digital assets continue to enter treasury management discussions, but adoption strategies are uneven. GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen said on Tuesday that the company’s recent Bitcoin purchase was meant as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. According to his comments made during a July 15 appearance on CNBC, the company is not making an attempt to follow other corporate treasury approaches like Strategy (previously known as MicroStrategy). Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation “I look at it as a hedge against inflation and global money printing, and we’ll see what happens,” Cohen said. GameStop acquired 4,710 bitcoins in late May, valued at over $500 million. The purchase followed a series of corporate moves by firms like Strategy, which accumulated billions of dollars in Bitcoin in recent years. Cohen clarified that GameStop’s move was unrelated. GameStop has purchased 4,710 Bitcoin. pic.twitter.com/gGdr0BRrAv — GameStop (@gamestop) May 28, 2025 “We have our own unique strategy, and we have a very strong balance sheet, over $9 billion of cash and marketable securities,” he said. Cohen said the company would maintain a disciplined approach in deploying capital. “We will deploy that capital responsibly as I would my own capital, and only look for opportunities where the downside is limited and there’s a lot of upside,” he said. “We’ll be opportunistic when we see those opportunities.” GameStop’s crypto position is part of Cohen’s effort to stabilize operations. The company has shifted its business mix, focusing more on trading cards and collectibles. New Outlook for GameStop The CEO added that GameStop has moved away from its earlier dependence on hardware and software. He said the retailer has now made a “significant” shift toward those newer segments. “We will deploy that capital responsibly as I would my own capital, and only look for opportunities where the downside is limited and there’s a lot of upside,” Cohen said. “We’ll be opportunistic when we see those opportunities.” The company recently raised $2.25 billion through an upsized convertible note offering. The zero-coupon notes carry a conversion price of approximately $28.91 per share, reflecting a 32.5% premium over the stock’s average trading price at the time of announcement. The offering follows a similar $1.5 billion raise in April and comes amid ongoing volatility in the company’s stock, which fell 24% in the past week. Some public companies are exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset, but with different levels of exposure. Strategy has taken an aggressive approach, while others, including Tesla and Block, have kept their holdings limited. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Are there accounting standards specific to corporate Bitcoin holdings? Yes. Under current U.S. GAAP, Bitcoin is treated as an intangible asset, meaning it must be written down for impairments but cannot be marked up if its value increases. This has raised concerns about transparency and financial reporting accuracy. How do zero-coupon convertible notes affect existing shareholders? Convertible notes issued at a premium typically delay dilution but still create the possibility of future share issuance. If converted, the new shares can dilute existing ownership depending on the stock price performance at maturity. What regulatory developments could impact corporate BTC adoption? The SEC and FASB have both initiated reviews related to digital asset disclosure, particularly after the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Future rules may clarify how corporations report holdings or manage risk, potentially influencing more widespread adoption.

2025-07-15T19:25:01,"Bitcoin exchange inflows surged on July 15 as BTC skyrocketed to its most recent ATH","CryptoQuant data on July 15 showed that Bitcoin exchange inflows rose from 54.151K BTC to 63.1K BTC in 24 hours, an increase of about 3%. The spike came as Bitcoin prices peaked at $123.218K on July 14, marking the coin’s most recent ATH. The data revealed that BTC exchange reserves jumped +0.91% to 2.265M, following the uptick in BTC exchange inflows in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin exchange netflow was positive, increasing 3.73% to 21.81K BTC. There was also a 2.24 Bitcoin exchange inflow mean, representing a 3.64% rise. The top 10 exchange inflow metric also showed an increase of 3.17% to 3.656K BTC. Bitcoin exchange depositing transactions inched up 1.03% to 43.552K as BTC depositing addresses also went up 1.13% to 2.29K. Bitcoin exchange inflows were at 83.99K as of publication, an increase of 2.37% from yesterday. CryptoQuant analysis suggests bullish whale activity Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin exchange inflows go up on July 15. A CryptoQuant analyst claimed that a surge in exchange inflows indicated a “local top” likely to result in a “healthy price correction” or near-term consolidation. The analyst also believes that the spike in BTC exchange inflows (especially to CEXs) suggested short-term profit-taking whale activity. Another CryptoQuant contributor pointed out a wallet dormant for over 14 years with 80K BTC that had just offloaded about 20K BTC, much of which ended up in CEXs. The analyst added that the recent positive movement in BTC exchange inflows was a classic pattern following parabolic rallies. Profits were realized, weak positions exited, and BTC prices found a new base. The market structure generally remained “largely bullish” despite looming signs of price correction. Long-term holders also sat tight on their BTC bounty. Another CryptoQuant contributor partly agreed that the surge in BTC deposits to exchanges was likely due to activity by large-scale investors. Whales reportedly deposited 1.8K BTC to Binance in one day, with over 35% of the transactions clocking over $1 million, noted the contributor. The analyst claimed that whales leveraged the deep liquidity in exchanges to speculate, possibly for profit-taking. The contributor also concluded that the surge was likely due to two scenarios. First, investors likely sat on “healthy profits” and sought to make some profit. Secondly, investors possibly aimed to leverage Binance’s liquidity to open positions or hedge amid heightened market volatility. Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, believes that rising BTC exchange inflows precede price volatility. An independent crypto analyst claimed that the wave of BTC hitting exchanges usually suggested that wallets were preparing to sell. The analyst pointed out a similar spike in March 2024, followed by a drop of 8-12% within 48 hours. Large holders likely sent BTC to “spot venues” to rotate or liquidate. Daily BTC exchange inflow drops CryptoQuant’s Moreno said on July 11 that daily BTC exchange inflows fell to their lowest since April 2015, plummeting to 18K BTC . He also revealed that large Bitcoin holders were sending fewer coins to exchanges, with the amount coming from this group falling to only 7K BTC, down from 62K BTC in November last year. Moreno emphasized that the increase in BTC price resulted in low selling pressure. He pointed out that whale activity had dropped, but mentioned that the trend was common across the crypto industry. Moreno also observed that the current BTC rally was much calmer than the early 2021 and late 2017 bull runs. CryptoQuant research suggested that fewer daily BTC flows from large and small holders to exchanges signaled less selling pressure. It also implied that the market had yet to enter “overheating mode.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-inflow-into-cexs-spikes/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS","Bitcoin|BTC|CryptoQuant",cryptocompare

This message from Dimon attracted attention while answering questions about stablecoin technology at the balance sheet meeting held today. Stablecoins, as their name suggests, are cryptocurrencies typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, aiming for stability in value. Last month, JPMorgan announced the development of a limited stablecoin solution designed exclusively for its own clients. However, a more general stablecoin is expected to appeal to a much broader user base. “As JPMorgan, we will be involved in both our own deposit coin and stablecoins. We want to understand this space and become proficient in it,” Dimon said. “Stablecoins are real. However, I still don't fully understand why you would want to use a stablecoin instead of making a payment directly.” Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Dimon, 69, is known for his criticism of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. However, JPMorgan's massive presence in the sector, with a daily global payment volume of approximately $10 trillion, means the company cannot afford to neglect emerging payment technologies. Dimon stated that fintech companies trying to create alternatives to the traditional banking system pose a threat, saying, “These guys are very smart. They want to create bank accounts, access payment systems, and offer rewards programs. We need to be aware of this. The way to do this is to be active in this area.” Citigroup executives also stated in a statement today that they are exploring the possibility of issuing stablecoins and that they see opportunities, particularly in areas such as tokenized deposits and the storage of crypto assets. *This is not investment advice.

The misfire on the procedural vote quickly slammed the crypto markets over uncertainty about the good news expected this week as the House has moved toward passage of two of the industry's top priorities. The legislation still has strong, bipartisan support, suggesting the procedural mishap may be overcome as a further vote was scheduled for later Tuesday afternoon.

2025-07-15T19:10:17,"Marathon Holdings Accelerates Strategic Bitcoin Allocation with Two Prime Investment","BitcoinWorld Marathon Holdings Accelerates Strategic Bitcoin Allocation with Two Prime Investment Are you ready to dive into the latest strategic moves shaping the cryptocurrency landscape? Get ready, because a significant development has just unfolded involving one of the biggest names in Bitcoin mining. Marathon Holdings , a leading player in the digital asset space, has made a bold move that signals growing institutional confidence and strategic foresight within the crypto ecosystem. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a peek into how major entities are positioning themselves for the future of finance, directly impacting the trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader market. Unpacking the Strategic Vision of Marathon Holdings In a move that has sent ripples across the crypto community, Marathon Holdings (MARA), a prominent Bitcoin mining firm, has announced a significant investment. As reported by Cointelegraph, Marathon has acquired a partial stake in the digital asset fund Two Prime, committing a substantial $20 million. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic partnership designed to enhance Marathon’s financial capabilities and optimize its exposure to Bitcoin. For a company primarily known for its mining operations, this diversification into fund management highlights a maturing approach to capital deployment and risk management in a volatile market. Marathon Holdings has long been a key player in the Bitcoin mining industry, consistently expanding its hash rate and infrastructure. Their core business revolves around validating transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and earning newly minted BTC as a reward. However, the crypto market is dynamic, and successful companies must adapt. This investment in Two Prime signifies a shift from a purely operational focus to a more comprehensive financial strategy, blending their mining prowess with sophisticated asset management. It speaks volumes about their long-term vision for sustainable growth and maximizing shareholder value. The Pivotal Role of Digital Asset Fund Two Prime So, what exactly is Two Prime, and why is Marathon Holdings entrusting them with a significant portion of their Bitcoin? Two Prime is a digital asset fund, a specialized financial entity that manages portfolios of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets for clients. Think of them as asset managers for the crypto world. They employ various strategies, including active trading, yield generation, and long-term holding, to grow their clients’ digital wealth. Their expertise lies in navigating the complexities of the crypto market, which can be highly volatile and requires deep understanding of both technology and finance. For Marathon, partnering with a reputable digital asset fund like Two Prime offers several compelling advantages: Professional Management: Two Prime brings specialized knowledge and trading algorithms that can potentially outperform a simple HODL strategy. Diversification of Strategies: While Marathon mines Bitcoin, Two Prime can deploy those BTCs into various yield-generating protocols or manage them through different market cycles. Risk Mitigation: Entrusting a portion of their holdings to a fund can help manage market exposure and potentially reduce the impact of sudden price swings through active management. Operational Efficiency: It allows Marathon to focus on its core mining operations while a dedicated financial entity handles the intricacies of asset management. This collaboration underscores a growing trend where crypto-native businesses are looking beyond their primary operations to optimize their treasury management and capital allocation, mirroring strategies seen in traditional finance. A Massive Boost in BTC Allocation Perhaps the most eye-catching detail of this announcement is Marathon’s plan to dramatically increase its entrusted Bitcoin (BTC) allocation with Two Prime. The company intends to boost its holdings from an initial 500 BTC to a staggering 2,000 BTC. At current market prices, this represents a multi-million dollar commitment, solidifying Marathon’s belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value and its confidence in Two Prime’s ability to manage these assets effectively. Let’s put this into perspective: Metric Previous Allocation New Allocation Increase Factor Bitcoin (BTC) Entrusted 500 BTC 2,000 BTC 4x Investment in Two Prime N/A $20 Million N/A This quadrupling of entrusted Bitcoin holdings is a strong bullish signal, not just for Marathon but for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. It demonstrates a proactive strategy to leverage their mined Bitcoin for additional growth, rather than simply holding it on their balance sheet. This move could involve various strategies by Two Prime, such as lending out BTC for yield, participating in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, or engaging in active trading to capitalize on market movements. It signifies a sophisticated approach to treasury management for a public company operating in the crypto space. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and the Market? The implications of Marathon’s significant investment and increased BTC allocation extend far beyond the two companies involved. This move is a powerful testament to the growing institutionalization of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. When a publicly traded company like Marathon Holdings makes such a substantial commitment, it sends a clear message to the market: Increased Institutional Confidence: It shows that major players are not just dabbling in crypto but are deeply integrating it into their core financial strategies. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The reliance on professional digital asset funds indicates a maturing infrastructure capable of handling large institutional flows. Potential for Price Impact: While 2,000 BTC might not move the market single-handedly, the cumulative effect of such institutional adoption can significantly impact Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the long run. Validation of Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative: By holding and actively managing a substantial amount of BTC, Marathon reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate asset class and a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. This strategic move by Marathon aligns with a broader trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or engaging with the crypto economy in more profound ways. It signals a shift from speculative interest to long-term strategic positioning, recognizing Bitcoin not just as a volatile asset but as a foundational element of future finance. The Broader Impact on Crypto Investment Strategies Marathon Holdings’ latest actions provide a fascinating case study for the evolving landscape of crypto investment . It showcases a blend of direct asset accumulation (through mining) with sophisticated financial management (through fund investment). This hybrid approach could become a blueprint for other crypto-native companies looking to optimize their digital asset holdings. For individual investors, this institutional activity offers valuable insights: Look Beyond Simple Holding: While holding Bitcoin is a common strategy, institutions are exploring ways to generate yield or enhance returns from their holdings. This could involve exploring DeFi, lending platforms, or professional asset management services. Understand the Value of Professional Management: The decision to invest in Two Prime highlights the expertise required to navigate the complex crypto markets. For those with substantial holdings, considering professional management might become more appealing. Institutional Validation: Continued large-scale investments by public companies provide a strong vote of confidence in the long-term viability and growth potential of the crypto space. This can help de-risk the asset class for more conservative investors. Diversification within Crypto: While Bitcoin remains central, the involvement of a digital asset fund suggests a broader view of the crypto market, potentially including other high-growth digital assets or strategies.

2025-07-15T19:00:01,"SEC Passes ProShare’s Ultra XRP ETF","In a groundbreaking move for the cryptocurrency market, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the listing of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF . The announcement was made official through a letter issued by NYSE Arca on July 14, 2025, addressed to the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance. The letter confirms NYSE Arca’s certification of the ETF’s registration under the Exchange Act of 1934. This regulatory milestone was shared by renowned crypto commentator JackTheRippler on X, who posted the signed document, drawing massive attention from the XRP and broader digital asset communities. A Historic Moment for XRP and U.S. Crypto ETFs The ProShares Ultra XRP ETF is the first leveraged exchange-traded fund focused solely on XRP. Unlike standard ETFs, a “Ultra” ETF is designed to offer magnified exposure to the daily price movements of its underlying asset. In this case, the fund will provide investors with a 2x exposure to XRP, meaning that if XRP gains 5% in a day, the ETF could deliver approximately a 10% return, and vice versa for losses. BREAKING: Here’s the official NYSE Arca document announcing the successful passing of Proshare’s Ultra #XRP ETF! pic.twitter.com/2Te4aH9EbC — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) July 15, 2025 ProShares, a veteran in the ETF space, made history in 2021 by launching the first-ever Bitcoin futures ETF. Its entry into XRP not only marks a new chapter in the diversification of crypto investment products but also underscores growing institutional demand for alternatives to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Legal Clarity Unlocks Institutional Confidence This ETF approval follows years of legal uncertainty surrounding XRP’s regulatory status. However, the tide began to turn in July 2023, when U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP sales on secondary markets do not constitute securities offerings. Though Ripple still faced penalties over institutional sales, recent developments, including the company dropping its counter-appeal and the SEC expected to follow, suggest the legal standoff is reaching its conclusion. This growing legal clarity has reignited institutional interest in XRP, with many seeing the ProShares ETF as a signal of Wall Street’s growing trust in the asset’s compliance status and long-term potential. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Expanding Ecosystem Fuels Market Optimism The ETF launch coincides with major developments in Ripple’s ecosystem. The company recently rolled out RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and continues to build momentum in real-world asset tokenization and cross-border payment infrastructure. XRP sits at the center of these efforts, providing liquidity for financial institutions and decentralized platforms alike. With XRP recently crossing the $3.00 threshold and forming bullish long-term technical patterns, many analysts believe this ETF could catalyze a fresh wave of investment, especially from hedge funds, asset managers, and crypto-savvy retail traders. A New Era for Crypto Exposure on Wall Street The ProShares Ultra XRP ETF is not just a product; it’s a landmark. It opens the door for traditional investors to gain leveraged exposure to one of the most battle-tested digital assets. It also marks a broader shift in how XRP is perceived, no longer just as a cross-border utility token, but as a legitimate financial instrument recognized by legacy institutions. As demand for crypto investment vehicles grows, the SEC’s approval signals a maturing regulatory environment and a wider embrace of digital assets in traditional finance.

2025-07-15T18:54:24,"No Euphoria in Bitcoin Markets but Warning Signs Are Starting to Appear (Analyst)","Bitcoin’s record-setting rally may be nearing a crucial inflection point, with on-chain data showing an increase in large-scale Bitcoin deposits to Binance. According to an expert at the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, this could point to big-money investors possibly preparing for strategic exits or leveraged plays. Whale Moves Signal Market Shift BTC reached a new all-time high (ATH) above $123,000 on July 14, before retreating to the $117,000 neighborhood. This correction may appear modest on the surface, but deeper market signals suggest more turbulence could be ahead. In a recent “quick take,” pseudonymous CQ analyst Crazzyblock noted that the “Binance Whale Activity Score” had spiked sharply following Bitcoin’s latest peak. And it isn’t a minor movement either; it represents a coordinated shift by major players. According to him, approximately 1,800 BTC, worth more than $210 million at current rates, flowed into Binance deposits yesterday alone. Additionally, transactions exceeding $1 million accounted for over 35% of total Bitcoin inflows to the world’s largest exchange, confirming the presence of institutional-sized wallets. Just as importantly, CryptoQuant’s age-band data showed that these aren’t coins from recent buyers, but rather older holdings from experienced, strategic investors re-entering the active market. Given Binance’s status as the world’s largest crypto trading venue, commanding over 25% of global spot volume, such moves warrant closer scrutiny. It implies whales may be positioning assets on the most liquid platform to either secure profits after the historic run or to use the exchange’s deep derivatives markets for hedging and new positions amidst peak volatility. “Either way, the presence of this much ‘sell-side’ pressure on the market’s primary trading venue increases the risk of sharp price swings,” wrote Crazzyblock. “The smart money is moving, and their actions often precede significant market shifts.” Euphoria Yet to Kick In Interestingly, this whale-driven shift is coming at a time when bullish sentiment is dominating headlines. Bitcoin’s rise to a new ATH triggered a wave of price forecasts, with some market watchers predicting the cryptocurrency could be changing hands at $200,000 each by year’s end. However, behind the optimism lies a more measured market structure. CQ’s proprietary greed indicators remain in neutral territory, and the rHODL ratio sits at just 32%, indicating that broader retail participation still hasn’t materialized, an essential ingredient for true market euphoria. The latest price movements hint at this brewing tension, with the asset seemingly stepping back from the heat of its last breakout. Data from CoinGecko shows the number one cryptocurrency is trading at $117,496 at the time of this writing, down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. Still, it’s up almost 9% for the week and 11.3% across the past month, outperforming legacy markets but falling just short of the broader crypto sector, which gained 9.2% over seven days.

According to the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , institutional investors coughed up $3.7 billion in crypto inflows last week alone. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows of $3.7 billion last week, marking the 2nd largest weekly inflow on record. Notably, July 10th recorded the third-highest daily inflow ever. This also represents the 13th consecutive week of inflows, bringing the cumulative total to $21.8 billion and pushing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $22.7 billion. Assets under management (AuM) surged past the US $200 billion threshold for the first time, reaching a new record of $211 billion. ETP (exchange-traded product) trading volumes reached $29 billion, twice this year’s weekly average.” Source: CoinShares The US led globally with $3.7 billion worth of inflows. Switzerland and Canada followed with $65.8 million and $17.1 million in inflows, respectively, while Germany suffered outflows to the tune of $86 million. Top crypto asset by market cap Bitcoin ( BTC ), per usual, enjoyed the lion’s share of inflows at $2.7 billion. “For the first time, this equals 54% of the total AuM held in gold ETPs. Short Bitcoin ETPs showed minimal activity.” Ethereum ( ETH ) continued its 12-week run of inflows with $990 million last week. Meanwhile, XRP and Solana ( SOL ) also enjoyed large inflows of $104 million and $92.6 million, respectively.

2025-07-15T18:40:40,"MOEX to offer futures tracking the value of Ethereum","Russia’s largest stock market, the Moscow Exchange, will soon offer futures contracts tracking the price of Ethereum, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. The platform said it will also present futures on U.S. treasury bonds – a first in the Russian Federation, where the growing yield of American government securities has caught the attention of investors. Russians to start trading futures on ETH The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) plans to launch two new futures contracts in August, one of which will be tied to the value of the second most popular cryptocurrency, while the other will track the market dynamics of U.S. government securities. The exchange intends to begin trading a futures contract on an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in Ethereum (ETH), Maria Patrikeeva, managing director of its derivatives market, told RBC during an investment forum, organized by the Russian business news outlet. Speaking on the sidelines of the Invest Weekend event, Patrikeeva elaborated: “The underlying asset will be an ETF for the largest fund from BlackRock, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, which invests in Ethereum. Its quote will be equal to the cost of one share of the fund, the contract size will be slightly less than IBIT.” The announcement of the ETF-based product comes after, in early June, MOEX started trading Bitcoin futures, following the Central Bank of Russia’s decision to allow the offering of crypto derivatives to qualified investors in the country. Besides MOEX, a number of other major players in the Russian financial market have also launched crypto-linked instruments, including Russia’s largest bank by assets, the state-controlled Sber, and the leading Russian broker Finam. The contracts, the first batch of which expires in September, are on the shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which tracks the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. MOEX also prepares to offer a futures contract based on its own Bitcoin index . BTC recently reached a historic high, exceeding $123,000 per coin on Monday, although it has since dropped below $120,000. Late on July 14, the IBIT futures were trading at around $70 per contract while one share of its underlying asset, the IBIT fund, was under $76 on the NASDAQ exchange, RBC noted. By June 27, the open net positions of retail investors in Bitcoin futures on the Moscow Exchange reached 1.25 billion rubles (over $16 million), Russia’s monetary authority revealed in its latest “Overview of Financial Market Risks” report for last month. Russian investors to speculate on U.S. debt The other instrument that the Moscow Exchange will offer next month will be based on an ETF investing in long-term U.S. Treasury bonds – the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF. The MOEX contract will be based on the value of one share of this fund. The average maturity of the bonds in the ETF portfolio is nearly 26 years, and the effective duration of the government securities is 15.7 years, Maria Patrikeeva detailed. The yield on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds has grown significantly, to almost 5%, since President Donald Trump announced he’s going to raise import duties, RBC remarked. It also highlighted that this will be the first futures contract on the Moscow Exchange that tracks the dynamics of U.S. debt securities. MOEX is already providing Russian investors with access to about a dozen contracts with underlying assets in the form of shares of funds based on S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones, as well as indexes of European and Asian stock markets. As part of a plan to expand the geography of its derivative offerings, the Russian exchange announced earlier that it will launch two futures contracts on shares traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, those of Chinese tech giants Tencent and Xiaomi.

2025-07-15T18:20:04,"Bitcoin’s Remarkable Stability: Deutsche Bank Confirms Maturing Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Remarkable Stability: Deutsche Bank Confirms Maturing Crypto Market In a significant development for the digital asset world, Bitcoin , the pioneering cryptocurrency, is increasingly demonstrating characteristics of a mature asset class. This transformation is underscored by a recent report from Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest commercial bank, which highlights a notable decline in Bitcoin’s volatility. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a profound shift signaling a new era for the crypto market , one where stability and broader acceptance are becoming the norm rather than the exception. Understanding Bitcoin Volatility: A Journey Towards Stability For years, Bitcoin volatility was synonymous with its identity. Its price swings were legendary, offering both exhilarating gains and gut-wrenching losses. This inherent unpredictability often deterred traditional investors and large institutions, who prioritize stability and predictable returns. However, Deutsche Bank’s analysis, as reported by CoinDesk, reveals a compelling narrative: despite Bitcoin’s record-breaking rallies, its volatility has significantly decreased. What does this mean for the future of digital assets? Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements were heavily influenced by retail investor sentiment, news cycles, and speculative trading. Large price swings could occur with minimal trading volume. Now, the landscape is evolving. Increased liquidity, a wider array of sophisticated trading instruments, and the entry of more diverse participants are collectively contributing to a more stable environment. This shift is crucial for Bitcoin to transcend its ‘speculative asset’ label and be recognized as a legitimate investment vehicle. Consider the factors that typically drive asset volatility: Market Depth: A shallow market, where large orders can significantly impact price, leads to higher volatility. As Bitcoin’s market depth grows, it can absorb larger trades with less impact. Investor Demographics: A market dominated by short-term speculators tends to be more volatile. The influx of long-term holders and institutional investors mitigates this. Regulatory Clarity: Uncertainty breeds volatility. Clear regulations reduce risk premiums and foster confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Like traditional assets, Bitcoin is increasingly influenced by global economic trends, interest rates, and inflation, indicating its integration into the broader financial system. The observed volatility decline is not accidental; it’s a consequence of fundamental changes within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Unstoppable March of Institutional Adoption One of the primary catalysts behind Bitcoin’s newfound stability is the surging wave of institutional adoption . What began as a niche interest for tech-savvy individuals has now captured the attention, and capital, of some of the world’s most conservative financial entities. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and large asset managers are no longer just observing; many are actively allocating capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Why are these traditional giants entering the fray? The answer lies in diversification, inflation hedging potential, and the recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate, albeit nascent, asset class. Their entry brings significant capital, but more importantly, it brings a long-term investment horizon. Unlike retail traders who might panic sell during downturns, institutions often buy and hold, providing a strong floor for the market. This long-term perspective naturally dampens short-term price fluctuations. Examples of increasing institutional interest include: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets, opening doors for regulated access. Major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest launching their own Bitcoin-related products. Corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Traditional banks exploring blockchain technology and digital asset services. This institutional embrace is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s evolving status. It signifies a maturation from a fringe asset to one increasingly integrated into the global financial fabric. Is Increased Regulation a Blessing for the Crypto Market? For many early crypto enthusiasts, the idea of regulation was anathema, seen as an encroachment on the decentralized ethos. However, the reality is that increased regulatory clarity is proving to be a significant boon for the entire crypto market . Deutsche Bank’s report specifically highlights this aspect as a key driver of stability. Regulation brings legitimacy, reduces risks for investors, and fosters a safer environment for innovation. When financial products are regulated, they become more accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly the institutional players mentioned earlier, who operate under strict compliance mandates. Clear rules around custody, trading, and asset classification build trust and encourage participation. Consider the benefits of a well-regulated crypto environment: Aspect Impact of Regulation Investor Protection Reduces fraud, enhances transparency, provides recourse for investors. Market Integrity Combats market manipulation, ensures fair trading practices. Institutional Participation Provides legal and compliance frameworks for large entities to engage. Innovation & Growth Creates a predictable environment for businesses to build and expand. While the path to comprehensive global crypto regulation is still unfolding, the progress made so far has undeniably contributed to the observed reduction in Bitcoin’s volatility. It’s a clear signal that the industry is moving towards a more structured and robust future. Deutsche Bank’s Profound Perspective: A Game Changer? The fact that Deutsche Bank , a titan of traditional finance with a history spanning over 150 years, is issuing such a report on Bitcoin’s maturity is incredibly significant. For a long time, major banks maintained a skeptical, if not outright dismissive, stance towards cryptocurrencies. Their pivot, even if cautious, signals a broader acceptance within the traditional financial establishment. Deutsche Bank’s analysis isn’t merely an observation; it’s an acknowledgment that Bitcoin is evolving into an asset class that warrants serious consideration alongside traditional investments. When a bank of this stature highlights decreasing volatility and the role of institutional adoption, it lends immense credibility to the cryptocurrency space. This perspective can influence other major financial players and even policymakers, accelerating the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Their report validates the long-held belief by crypto proponents that Bitcoin, despite its turbulent youth, possesses the fundamental characteristics to become a resilient and enduring store of value. It’s a powerful endorsement that could encourage more conservative investors, like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, to explore allocations to digital assets, further solidifying the market’s stability. Navigating the Future: What Does Reduced Volatility Mean for Investors? The continued volatility decline in Bitcoin presents both opportunities and considerations for investors. For long-term holders and those looking for a store of value, reduced volatility makes Bitcoin a far more appealing proposition. It mitigates the risk of sudden, drastic losses, allowing for a more predictable investment experience. Benefits for Investors: Increased Appeal to Conservative Investors: Pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds can now consider Bitcoin more seriously for long-term diversification. Enhanced Portfolio Stability: For portfolios that include Bitcoin, reduced volatility can lead to smoother overall returns and lower risk. Foundation for Financial Products: A more stable Bitcoin facilitates the development of more sophisticated financial products, such as lending, borrowing, and derivatives, further integrating it into the financial system. Greater Predictability: While no asset is entirely predictable, lower volatility allows for more reliable long-term financial planning. Challenges and Considerations: Not Zero Volatility: It’s crucial to remember that ‘reduced’ volatility does not mean ‘zero’ volatility. Bitcoin will still experience price swings, albeit less extreme ones. Macroeconomic Influences: As Bitcoin integrates, it becomes more susceptible to global economic factors like inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events. Market Maturation vs. Growth Potential: Some early investors might lament the loss of extreme volatility, which offered opportunities for rapid, large gains. However, maturity often comes with more sustainable, albeit slower, growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: Long-Term Horizon: Embrace Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Its value proposition strengthens over extended periods, especially with declining volatility. Diversification: While more stable, Bitcoin should still be part of a diversified portfolio, not its sole component. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and institutional movements, as these will continue to shape the market. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Even with reduced volatility, Bitcoin remains a dynamic asset. A New Dawn for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market The findings from Deutsche Bank paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is shedding its wild west image and maturing into a sophisticated financial asset. The convergence of declining volatility , increasing institutional adoption , and growing regulatory clarity is fundamentally reshaping the entire crypto market . This evolution is not just a statistical anomaly; it’s a profound transformation that makes Bitcoin increasingly appealing to a broader spectrum of investors, from individual enthusiasts to massive sovereign wealth funds. The endorsement from a venerable institution like Deutsche Bank serves as a powerful signal, reinforcing the idea that digital assets are here to stay and will play an increasingly vital role in the global financial landscape. As Bitcoin continues its journey towards greater stability, it opens up unprecedented opportunities for long-term growth and integration, promising a future where digital assets are a cornerstone of diverse investment portfolios.

This pivotal investment, spearheaded by industry giant Galaxy Digital, with key participation from Antalpha and Mantle, marks a resounding vote of confidence in Function’s vision and its flagship product, FBTC. Function Crypto: Powering the Future of Digital Assets Have you ever wondered what truly underpins the rapidly expanding world of cryptocurrencies? It’s not just about the digital coins themselves, but the robust, secure, and scalable systems that allow them to function. This is where Function Crypto steps in. As a dedicated crypto infrastructure firm, Function is committed to building the foundational layers necessary for the widespread adoption and seamless operation of digital assets. Think of it like the internet. While we see websites and applications, there’s a vast, complex infrastructure of servers, networks, and protocols working tirelessly behind the scenes. Similarly, for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, firms like Function are developing the essential tools, platforms, and services that enable everything from secure transactions to the creation of innovative financial products. Their work is crucial for bringing stability and efficiency to a dynamic ecosystem. Why This Strategic Seed Funding Round Matters The announcement of a $10 million seed funding round for Function Crypto is more than just a financial headline; it’s a powerful indicator of market sentiment and future direction. Led by Galaxy Digital, a prominent player in the digital asset and blockchain space, this investment underscores the growing institutional appetite for robust, reliable crypto solutions. The participation of Antalpha and Mantle further solidifies the broad industry support for Function’s mission. Why is a seed round of this magnitude so significant? Seed funding is typically the earliest stage of investment, often provided to promising startups to help them develop their product, build their team, and establish market presence. For Function, this $10 million injection means accelerated growth, enhanced product development, and the ability to scale their operations to meet the increasing demand for secure crypto infrastructure. It’s a testament to the potential investors see in Function’s ability to solve critical industry challenges. Strengthening the Core: The Importance of Robust Crypto Infrastructure The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, but it still faces challenges related to scalability, security, and regulatory clarity. This is precisely why strong crypto infrastructure is not just important, but absolutely vital for the industry’s continued growth and mainstream acceptance. Without reliable underlying systems, the promise of decentralized finance and digital assets remains largely unfulfilled. Function’s work directly addresses these challenges by building secure and efficient frameworks. Consider the implications: Enhanced Security: Protecting billions in digital assets requires state-of-the-art security protocols. Improved Scalability: As more users enter the space, the infrastructure must handle increased transaction volumes without compromising performance. Regulatory Compliance: Building systems that can adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes is key for institutional adoption. By focusing on these core areas, Function is not just creating products; they are contributing to the very stability and trustworthiness of the entire digital economy. Their infrastructure solutions pave the way for more institutions and individuals to confidently participate in the crypto space. Unpacking FBTC Bitcoin: A Pillar of Trust and Transparency At the heart of Function’s current success and future plans lies FBTC Bitcoin , their innovative fully reserved Bitcoin (BTC) product. With an impressive $1.5 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), FBTC has quickly established itself as a significant player in the ecosystem. But what does ‘fully reserved’ truly mean, and why is it so important? A fully reserved product means that for every unit of FBTC issued, there is an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin held in reserve.

2025-07-15T18:05:22,"Analyst Warns More Downside Likely for Bitcoin and Ethereum, With One Altcoin Far Outperforming the Competition","Analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe is warning that the top two crypto assets by market cap may have deeper corrections as markets trade lower with new US data showing a rise in inflation. Van de Poppe tells his 795,100 followers on the social media platform X that after Bitcoin ( BTC ) printed new all-time highs and Ethereum ( ETH ) surged into the $3,000 range, the digital assets will likely start trending lower based on historical precedent. “Classic move on the markets here. Likely we’re going to be seeing some more downside on Bitcoin and Ethereum to squeeze out the longs. Remember: volatility goes up, price goes up. This means harsh corrections are around the corner.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests ETH may decline to the $2,750 level before a trend reversal. Bitcoin is trading for $116,947 at time of writing, down 5% from its all-time high of $122,838 on Monday. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $3,048 at time of writing, up 19% in the last week. Next up, the analyst says that layer-1 blockchain SUI Network ( SUI ) is showing strong market fundamentals after regaining the $3 level, and he believes the digital asset has more upside potential. “Strongest ecosystems bounce back the strongest when a market is reversing. SUI is one of them. Did held strong support at $2.35 and started to rally substantially as it broke the downtrend. Crucial breakout above $3, and it’s basically into ‘buy the dip’ territory as it will be trading upwards.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading for $4.01 at time of writing, up 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

The analyst noted that ADA might be repeating, with market conditions mirroring the ones that led to an all-time high (ATH). Cardano Prices Eyes 285% Rally To New Highs In a TradingView post, Scrambler predicted that the Cardano price could soon record a 285% rally to reach $2.05. He noted that the 285% potential move mirrors ADA’s past rally from similar conditions. The analyst added that if market sentiment continues improving and the Bitcoin price holds above key levels, then the altcoin might repeat history. Related Reading: Cardano Price Shows Seller Exhaustion Above $0.57 — Bullish Divergence Signals Rally Further commenting on the Cardano price action, Scrambler stated that ADA is showing a major breakout from a long-standing descending channel on the daily timeframe. He highlighted the structure, alluding to a downtrend channel that has been respected for around seven months. He also noted that a breakout has been confirmed with a strong bullish daily candle. Meanwhile, price is hovering around $0.7192, above previous resistance. Scrambler stated that the support levels for the Cardano price are $0.60 and $0.5299. The resistance and long-term targets are $0.8158, $1.0876, $1.3159, and $1.8958. Meanwhile, the ultimate target is the Fibonacci extension above $2.76. The analyst stated that a pullback to between $0.60 and $0.66 could offer re-entry opportunities. Regardless of what happens to the Cardano price in the short term, Scrambler remains bullish in the long term and expects ADA to reach new highs. The analyst also advised market participants to watch for the BTC/ETH correlation. It is worth noting that ADA has shown impressive strength amid this recent crypto market rally. The altcoin has risen by over 25% in the last seven days, despite a recent pullback. ADA To Breakout Against Its BTC Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Sebastian stated that the ADA/BTC chart appears to be ready for a breakout. The analyst added that this is the most important breakout that market participants want to see, with the Cardano price separating itself from the Bitcoin price. Once that happens, the altcoin is likely to outperform the flagship crypto during that period. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Announces $100 Million Bitcoin Buy In Shocking Move To Prop Up ADA Price Sebastian had earlier noted how Bitcoin’s dominance could be breaking down. Based on this, he remarked that alcoins like Cardano are about to rally if this happens. A break in Bitcoin’s dominance could usher in altcoin season, which is bullish for the Cardano price. In the meantime, ADA’s performance still hinges on BTC’s performance. At the time of writing, the Cardano price is trading at around $0.72, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-15T18:00:11,"Co-CEO of CoinRoutes Says It Loud: “XRP is Beta to Bitcoin”","In a recent panel discussion shared by respected crypto analyst Xaif on X, Dave Weisberger, the Co-CEO of CoinRoutes, delivered a blunt assessment that has reignited debate within the XRP community: “XRP is beta to Bitcoin.” According to Weisberger, XRP’s price action is not primarily shaped by legal or regulatory developments, but instead follows Bitcoin, often with heightened volatility and momentum. XRP and Bitcoin: A High-Beta Relationship Weisberger’s comments stem from a broader observation about market behavior. In his words, “What matters is XRP is beta to Bitcoin.” By describing XRP as having a high beta to BTC, he means that XRP tends to mimic Bitcoin’s movements , often in a magnified way. When Bitcoin rises, XRP usually follows, and sometimes outpaces it. When Bitcoin stalls or corrects, XRP typically responds in kind, sometimes with more dramatic swings. “Bitcoin’s gone up,” Weisberger noted. “And guess what? XRP has done exactly what I said it would do… It’s gone up more when Bitcoin plateaus. His remarks reinforce the idea that XRP’s market performance, while influenced by its fundamentals, remains largely tethered to Bitcoin’s macro trends. :Dave Weisberger says it loud: ""XRP is beta to Bitcoin!"" BTC goes up, XRP follows… but this time, XRP might lead. It’s doing EXACTLY what was predicted. LET’S GOOO! #XRP #Bitcoin #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/9uUUghyLFr — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 14, 2025 Legal Battles Are Not the Driving Force Weisberger also challenged a popular narrative in the XRP space, that legal outcomes, especially Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are the primary catalyst for price movements. Dismissing this idea, he recalled a recent interview: “They were asking about XRP’s price. They were talking about the court case. I said, ‘The court cases don’t mean shit.’” This bold claim underscores Weisberger’s view that while regulatory clarity may shape XRP’s long-term use case, it is Bitcoin’s price action that truly moves the needle in the short to medium term. XRP’s Recent Price Action Validates the Thesis The current market supports Weisberger’s thesis. As Bitcoin surged past $110,000, XRP reclaimed the $3 mark. The rally has fueled speculation among investors that XRP could be poised for an even greater breakout, especially if Bitcoin continues its bullish trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This behavior aligns with the beta principle: XRP lags slightly behind BTC during the early phases of a move, but once momentum builds, it often accelerates with greater force. For traders, this makes XRP a high-risk, high-reward asset in bull markets, and a dangerous one during corrections. Could XRP Eventually Lead? Interestingly, a growing segment of the XRP community believes the dynamic may be shifting. With Ripple expanding its cross-border payment solutions globally and XRP gaining traction in real-world financial systems, some argue that XRP could soon decouple from Bitcoin and pave its path. However, Weisberger remains pragmatic. For now, his analysis is clear, data-driven, and seemingly accurate: XRP’s market behavior continues to reflect Bitcoin’s larger moves. Xaif’s post has since gone viral, sparking widespread discussion across social media and further cementing Weisberger’s place as a critical voice in understanding XRP’s market dynamics. Whether XRP remains beta to Bitcoin or eventually becomes a market leader in its own right, the current cycle is once again proving that Weisberger’s insights can’t be ignored.

2025-07-15T18:00:04,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial $100K Support Unveiled by Short-Term Holders","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial $100K Support Unveiled by Short-Term Holders Are you tracking Bitcoin’s next big move? The crypto world is buzzing with a fascinating development: Bitcoin price analysis reveals that short-term holders (STHs) have reached a significant milestone, pushing their average buying price above $100,000. This isn’t just a number; it’s a potential game-changer, hinting at a robust new Bitcoin support level that could redefine future market dynamics for the world’s leading digital asset. This breakthrough, reported by Cointelegraph citing Glassnode data, signals a maturing market and potentially stronger foundational support for BTC. Who are BTC Short-Term Holders and Why Does Their Behavior Matter? Before diving into the significance of the $100,000 mark, it’s crucial to understand who BTC short-term holders (STHs) are and why their collective behavior offers such profound insights into Bitcoin price analysis . In the realm of on-chain analytics, STHs are typically defined as Bitcoin addresses that have held their coins for less than 155 days. These participants are often more reactive to market volatility compared to long-term holders (LTHs), who tend to HODL through cycles. Market Sensitivity: STHs are generally more sensitive to price fluctuations, making them key drivers of immediate market sentiment and short-term price movements. Their buying and selling activity can significantly influence market momentum. Cost Basis as a Barometer: The average buying price, or ‘cost basis,’ of STHs acts as a powerful indicator. When the price falls below their average cost, STHs are typically ‘underwater,’ increasing the likelihood of selling pressure as they seek to minimize losses or break even. Conversely, when the price is significantly above their cost basis, they might realize profits. Liquidity Providers: STHs often represent the more speculative and liquid segment of the market, frequently entering and exiting positions. Their movements can signal shifts in supply and demand dynamics. Understanding their aggregated cost basis provides a unique lens into where significant amounts of capital have recently entered the market, which can then act as a psychological and technical level of interest for future price action. The Pivotal $100,000 Mark: A New Bitcoin Support Level in the Making? The news that the average buying price of BTC short-term holders has crossed above $100,000 is not merely a statistical anomaly; it represents a profound shift in market structure. According to Glassnode data, this means that, on average, recent buyers of Bitcoin have acquired their holdings at a price point that has now surpassed the six-figure mark. Why is this so important? Historically, an aggregate cost basis for a significant cohort of market participants often transforms into a psychological and technical Bitcoin support level . Here’s why this $100,000 threshold is being eyed as a potential bulwark against future corrections: Psychological Anchor: For many recent buyers, $100,000 represents their breakeven point. If the price were to dip towards this level, these holders might be less inclined to sell, or even be motivated to buy more to average down, creating buying pressure. Realized Price Indicator: The STH cost basis is a form of ‘realized price’ for this specific group, reflecting the aggregate price at which coins last moved on-chain. When the market price trades above this realized price, it often signals a healthy, profitable market for recent participants. Historical Precedent: In past market cycles, the STH cost basis has frequently acted as a reliable support during pullbacks. When the price dips to or slightly below this level, it often finds a floor before resuming an upward trajectory. This pattern suggests a strong conviction among these newer market entrants. This development suggests a robust belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition among those who have entered the market more recently. It implies that a substantial amount of capital is now ‘locked in’ at or above this $100,000 level, potentially providing a strong foundation for future growth. How Does Glassnode Data Illuminate Crypto Market Trends ? The insights we’re discussing, particularly regarding BTC short-term holders ‘ cost basis, come courtesy of Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform. But what exactly is on-chain data, and how does it help us understand broader crypto market trends ? Glassnode specializes in transforming raw blockchain data into actionable intelligence. Unlike traditional financial markets where much of the data is proprietary or requires significant aggregation, every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger. Glassnode’s sophisticated algorithms process this vast amount of information to derive meaningful metrics, offering transparency into market behavior that is unparalleled in traditional finance. Key ways Glassnode data illuminates market trends include: Supply Dynamics: Tracking the distribution of coins, active supply, and illiquid supply helps identify whether more coins are being held for the long term or are readily available for trading. Holder Behavior: Differentiating between short-term and long-term holders, analyzing their spending patterns, and tracking their profitability provides insights into market sentiment and potential selling pressure or accumulation. Miner Activity: Monitoring miner revenues, hash rate, and spending behavior can signal miner capitulation or confidence, impacting market supply. Exchange Flows: Tracking Bitcoin inflows and outflows from exchanges can indicate whether investors are moving coins off-exchange for cold storage (bullish) or onto exchanges for selling (bearish). The STH cost basis is just one powerful example of how Glassnode data provides a unique, fundamental perspective on Bitcoin’s market health, moving beyond mere price charts to reveal the underlying investor psychology and capital flows that drive Bitcoin price analysis . Decoding Bitcoin Market Cycles : What Can We Learn from History? The current observation about BTC short-term holders and the $100,000 threshold isn’t isolated; it fits within the larger narrative of Bitcoin market cycles . Bitcoin’s history is characterized by distinct bull and bear markets, often influenced by halving events and broader macroeconomic factors. Understanding how different holder cohorts behave during these cycles is crucial for predicting future movements. Let’s consider some historical patterns: During previous bull markets, as Bitcoin’s price ascended, the average cost basis of STHs would typically rise. When corrections occurred, this rising STH cost basis often acted as dynamic support. For example: In the 2017 bull run, dips to the STH cost basis often presented strong buying opportunities before the next leg up. Similarly, during the 2021 bull market, the STH realized price provided a floor during significant corrections, demonstrating strong conviction from new market entrants. Conversely, during bear markets, when the price falls significantly below the STH cost basis, these holders often capitulate, leading to increased selling pressure and further price depreciation. The point where the market price falls below the STH cost basis and stays there can signal the onset of a bear market, and the re-crossing above it can signal recovery. The fact that the STH cost basis is now at $100,000 in the current environment suggests a high level of confidence and capital inflow at these elevated prices. It implies that recent buyers are not just chasing fleeting pumps but are investing with a strong conviction, potentially indicating a robust phase within the ongoing Bitcoin market cycles . Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Current Landscape So, what does this significant development mean for you as an investor or enthusiast? The establishment of a potential $100,000 Bitcoin support level by BTC short-term holders offers several actionable insights for navigating the current crypto market trends . For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Confirmation of Strength: This data reinforces the idea that significant capital is entering and staying in Bitcoin at higher price points, validating the long-term bullish outlook. Accumulation Opportunities: Should Bitcoin experience pullbacks towards the $100,000 level, it might present a compelling accumulation zone, assuming the historical behavior of STH cost basis acting as support holds true. Reduced Volatility Expectations: While Bitcoin remains volatile, a strong underlying support level can potentially mitigate the severity of future downturns, offering some peace of mind. For Traders and Short-Term Participants: Key Reference Point: Use the $100,000 STH cost basis as a critical technical level for setting stop-losses or identifying potential bounce zones during corrections. Sentiment Indicator: Monitor whether the market price consistently holds above this level. A sustained break below could signal weakening sentiment among recent buyers and potential further downside. Risk Management: Always prioritize robust risk management strategies. While on-chain data provides powerful insights, market dynamics can change rapidly due to unforeseen events. General Advice: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics from sources like Glassnode. These insights provide a deeper understanding beyond simple price charts. Diversify: While Bitcoin is a foundational asset, a diversified portfolio can help manage risk across different crypto market trends . Long-Term Vision: Remember that Bitcoin market cycles are often long, and short-term fluctuations should be viewed within that broader context. This data point doesn’t guarantee a smooth ride, but it does provide a powerful indicator of underlying market strength and conviction among a crucial segment of Bitcoin investors. What Challenges Could Impact This Crucial Support? While the $100,000 average buying price for BTC short-term holders presents a compelling argument for a strong Bitcoin support level , it’s essential to acknowledge that no support is absolute. Several factors could challenge or even invalidate this crucial threshold, influencing future Bitcoin price analysis and broader crypto market trends . Potential challenges include: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Significant shifts in global economic conditions, such as unexpected interest rate hikes, a severe recession, or geopolitical instability, could trigger a broad risk-off sentiment, leading investors to divest from risk assets like Bitcoin, regardless of on-chain fundamentals. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events, whether regulatory crackdowns, major exchange hacks, or technological vulnerabilities, could cause a sudden and severe market downturn, overwhelming any established support levels. Significant Profit-Taking by Long-Term Holders: While STHs are reactive, long-term holders (LTHs) might decide to realize substantial profits accumulated over years, leading to a supply shock that could temporarily depress prices below STH cost basis. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulatory landscapes in major economies could introduce uncertainty or restrictions, impacting investor confidence and capital flows into the crypto market. Whale Movements: Large institutional or individual holders (whales) can execute trades significant enough to move the market independently of aggregate STH behavior. Their coordinated selling could exert immense downward pressure. Therefore, while the $100,000 STH cost basis is a powerful indicator, it should be viewed as one piece of a larger puzzle. Investors should continuously monitor a range of on-chain metrics, macroeconomic indicators, and news developments to form a holistic view of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. The ascent of the average buying price of BTC short-term holders above $100,000 marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s journey. This robust data point, courtesy of Glassnode, strongly suggests the formation of a critical Bitcoin support level at this six-figure threshold. It reflects the increasing conviction and substantial capital inflows from recent market participants, signaling a potential new floor for the flagship cryptocurrency. As we navigate the ever-evolving crypto market trends , understanding the nuances of Bitcoin market cycles and the behavior of different holder cohorts becomes paramount. While challenges persist, this development offers a compelling narrative of Bitcoin’s growing maturity and resilience, providing valuable insights for investors seeking to make informed decisions in this dynamic landscape.

2025-07-15T17:59:41,"JPMorgan and others test stablecoin products","Fresh off historic earnings, Wall Street’s biggest banks are now setting their sights on stablecoins. Even Jamie Dimon, the longtime crypto critic and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says the bank is getting involved, whether he understands the point of it or not. Speaking Tuesday during the company’s earnings call, Dimon said plainly, “I think they’re real, but I don’t know why you’d want to [use a] stablecoin as opposed to just payment.” He’s not wrong about his confusion. Dimon, now 69, has built his brand on skepticism of bitcoin and most things crypto. But when you’re running the largest U.S. bank, which moves nearly $10 trillion every single day, you don’t get the luxury of ignoring new rails just because they don’t fit into your worldview. Especially not when fintech players are coming hard for your turf. JPMorgan and others test stablecoin products Stablecoins, for those who need the reminder, are digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies—most often the U.S. dollar. They’re supposed to stay steady in value and act like cash that moves faster, settles instantly, and costs less. They’re not speculative coins like Bitcoin; they’re more like upgraded wire transfers that don’t take three days to clear. Last month, JPMorgan revealed it’s already rolling out a limited version of its own coin—called a deposit coin—but it’s only for the bank’s private clients. This isn’t a full-blown public stablecoin yet. But it’s a step into the water. “We’re going to be involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it,” Dimon said. He’s not the only one dipping a toe. On the same day as JPMorgan’s call, Citigroup executives said the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin.” They’re not just stopping there. Citi says the real opportunity lies in tokenized deposits and crypto custody services—two areas where legacy banks have serious muscle to flex if they stop dragging their feet. And over at Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan is also making it clear: the bank will engage with stablecoins. No rollout yet, but the signal is loud enough. When this many top dogs start circling the same space at the same time, it’s never a coincidence. Big banks watch fintech and prep for team-ups What’s pushing these banks off the bench isn’t enthusiasm—it’s fear of falling behind. Dimon said Tuesday, “These guys are very smart,” when asked about fintech rivals. “They’re trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts, to get into payment systems and rewards programs, and we have to be cognizant of that.” In other words, the enemy’s not waiting. These fintech companies are already offering services that traditional banks used to own. They’re fast, they’re global, and they don’t have to deal with 1970s tech like ACH and SWIFT. That alone makes stablecoins a real threat if the banks don’t evolve. Dimon gets that. He didn’t say it outright, but the move toward stablecoin infrastructure now is a play to stay relevant while rules around digital currencies start getting clearer. Regulation is finally catching up. Banks have the lawyers and capital to dominate once they commit—and now they’re starting to. There’s also talk of banks joining forces. One route could be to push through Early Warning Services, a firm owned by a group of banks that already gave us Zelle. That instant payments network was the banks’ answer to PayPal and Cash App. A joint stablecoin effort could play out the same way, helping them fight off Silicon Valley’s attempts to eat their lunch. But Dimon wasn’t giving any details. When asked about a possible collaboration between banks on stablecoins, he said, “That’s a great question, and we’ll leave it remaining as a question.” So yeah, it’s being discussed. Just don’t expect a roadmap yet. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

According to on-chain tracker Onchain Lens on X, Wynn deposited a substantial $467,999 into Hyperliquid, a decentralized platform, to initiate this massive long position. With 40x leverage, this relatively modest initial capital controls a Bitcoin position worth $18.43 million. For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin leveraged trading amplifies both potential gains and losses. A 40x leverage means that for every 1% price movement in Bitcoin, the position’s value changes by 40%. While this can lead to exponential profits if the market moves favorably, it also means a small adverse price movement can quickly liquidate the entire position. Wynn’s strategy isn’t new; he’s known for his aggressive, high-risk approach. This isn’t his first foray into highly leveraged plays, nor is it his first time in the spotlight for significant financial outcomes, both positive and negative. His reported $100 million loss in June serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and unforgiving nature of such strategies. Yet, here he is again, doubling down with one of the most significant individual leveraged positions observed recently. The High-Stakes World of Crypto High Risk Strategies Why do traders like James Wynn engage in such crypto high risk strategies? The allure is simple: the potential for immense profits in a short timeframe. However, the reality is far more complex and often brutal. High leverage acts as a double-edged sword. It allows traders with limited capital to control large positions, maximizing their exposure to market movements. But this amplification works both ways. Liquidation Risk: At 40x leverage, even a minor price drop of 2.5% against the long position could wipe out the initial margin. This is known as liquidation, where the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are notorious for their price swings. These rapid fluctuations make high-leverage positions incredibly precarious. Emotional Toll: The pressure of managing such large, volatile positions can be immense, leading to impulsive decisions that further exacerbate losses. Wynn’s previous reported losses underscore the critical importance of risk management, even for seasoned traders. While his aggressive style might seem reckless to some, it highlights a segment of the crypto trading community that thrives on these extreme scenarios, seeking to capitalize on every market tremor. Why Hyperliquid Exchange for Such a Massive Position? The choice of platform for such a significant trade is also noteworthy. James Wynn opted for Hyperliquid exchange , a decentralized perpetual exchange. This choice reflects a growing trend among experienced crypto traders towards decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for their trading activities. What makes Hyperliquid an attractive venue for a trade of this magnitude? Decentralization: Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs) that hold user funds and control order books, Hyperliquid operates on a decentralized model. This means users retain custody of their assets, reducing counterparty risk. Transparency: Transactions on decentralized exchanges are recorded on a public blockchain, offering a high degree of transparency. This is how on-chain trackers like Onchain Lens can identify and report on such large positions. Liquidity and Fees: DeFi perpetuals have matured, offering competitive liquidity and often lower fees compared to some centralized counterparts, especially for high-volume traders. Permissionless Access: Decentralized platforms typically offer permissionless access, meaning anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can participate, without extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures often required by CEXs. Wynn’s decision to use Hyperliquid reinforces the platform’s reputation as a serious contender for professional traders seeking robust and transparent decentralized trading environments, even for high-leverage plays. Decoding the On-Chain Analysis Behind the Bet The public nature of blockchain transactions is a defining characteristic of the crypto space, enabling detailed on-chain analysis . In Wynn’s case, it was precisely this transparency that allowed Onchain Lens to identify and report on his $467,999 deposit and subsequent 40x leveraged Bitcoin long. On-chain data provides an unprecedented level of insight into market activity, often revealing the moves of large players, or “whales,” before they become widely known. For analysts, tracking such movements can offer clues about market sentiment and potential future price action. When a well-known trader, especially one with a history like Wynn’s, takes such a large position, it inevitably sparks discussion and speculation. While not a guarantee of success, observing these high-profile trades can provide a fascinating look into the conviction (or speculative nature) of market participants. However, it’s crucial to remember that on-chain data alone doesn’t tell the whole story. The reasons behind a trade, the trader’s overall portfolio, and their risk management strategies (if any) remain largely private. What we see is merely the transaction itself, open for public interpretation. What Does This Mean for James Wynn Crypto’s Future? James Wynn’s consistent presence in the headlines, whether for massive gains or significant losses, positions him as a fascinating figure in the crypto landscape. His latest James Wynn crypto maneuver raises questions about his long-term strategy and resilience. Is this a calculated risk based on deep market conviction, or another chapter in a series of high-stakes gambles? For the broader crypto community, Wynn’s actions serve as a powerful case study: The Power of Leverage: It demonstrates the incredible capital efficiency leverage offers, allowing small sums to control vast positions. The Perils of Leverage: Simultaneously, it highlights the extreme fragility of such positions and the potential for rapid capital erosion. The Role of On-Chain Data: It showcases how transparent blockchain data empowers a new generation of market observers and analysts. Ultimately, the outcome of Wynn’s $18.43 million Bitcoin long position remains to be seen. It will undoubtedly be closely watched by many, serving as a real-time example of the exhilarating highs and devastating lows that define the world of high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. While such strategies are not for everyone, understanding them is key to comprehending the full spectrum of activities within the dynamic crypto market. Conclusion: The Unfolding Drama of High-Stakes Crypto Trading James Wynn’s $18.43 million 40x leveraged Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid is more than just a trade; it’s a testament to the audacious spirit and inherent risks that define the cryptocurrency market. From his reported past losses to his current high-stakes gamble, Wynn embodies the relentless pursuit of alpha that characterizes a segment of crypto traders. This move not only puts his capital on the line but also shines a spotlight on the capabilities of decentralized exchanges and the invaluable insights offered by on-chain analysis. As the crypto world watches, this position serves as a potent reminder that while opportunities for significant gains exist, they often come hand-in-hand with equally significant risks. It’s a thrilling, perilous dance on the edge of market volatility, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye.

Jacquelyn Melinek, founder of Token Relations, drew attention to this scaling adjustment on the Bloomberg Terminal, which now shows Bitcoin’s spot price (XBT) at $0.118M, corresponding to the $118,000 level the asset achieved on July 10. Source: @jacqmelinek on X Following this adjustment, Bitcoin has shattered multiple resistance levels , initially breaching the significant $120,000 threshold before establishing a new all-time high of $123,000 the following day. These developments have reignited the debates about whether Wall Street is positioning itself for a massive bull market cycle. Wall Street Veterans Eye Seven-Figure Bitcoin Targets In May, while Bitcoin consolidated around $103,000, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood informed CNBC that Bitcoin is destined for “$1.5 million” due to its increasing market share capture from gold.

BULLISH pic.twitter.com/TaWVNvnpPp — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 9, 2025 Wood emphasized that Wall Street institutions are currently in an exploratory phase, testing the market waters before committing larger capital allocations. Since her statement, Bitcoin has added $20,000 to its valuation, enabling it to surpass Amazon as the world’s fifth most valuable asset , trailing only Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and gold. This performance has convinced numerous investors and billionaires that Bloomberg’s million-scale formatting for Bitcoin will eventually display a value of $1 million. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis – Where is BTC Heading Next? Bitcoin (BTC) is holding strong near $117,000 after a powerful breakout, with momentum still favoring the bulls. If current support around $115,000 holds, BTC could be gearing up for another leg higher toward $123,000 and potentially $125,000 in the short term. The recent dip has helped reset the RSI from overbought levels, creating room for another push up. With bullish structure still intact and volume remaining elevated, Bitcoin looks primed for continuation. As long as the price stays within the current rising channel, the path of least resistance remains upward in what could be the start of a larger rally. New Layer-2 Opportunity Gaining Steam as Bitcoin Rallies As Bitcoin continues to climb, many investors are starting to look beyond BTC and into presales, which can far outperform well-established coins. One standout is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) — a new Bitcoin-based project that’s picking up major traction. Built to make Bitcoin faster and more useful, HYPER has already raised over $2.8 million in its ongoing presale, and interest is growing fast. For those looking to get in early on the next big thing, HYPER is shaping up to be a strong contender. Smart investors and retail traders alike are starting to take notice, with many calling HYPER one of the most promising early-stage projects right now. Those looking to get involved can join the presale at the current price of $0.012275 through the official Bitcoin Hyper website .

2025-07-15T17:20:04,"Nextdoor App Unveils Transformative AI Recommendations and Critical Real-Time Alerts","BitcoinWorld Nextdoor App Unveils Transformative AI Recommendations and Critical Real-Time Alerts In an era where digital trust and hyper-local information are paramount, the Nextdoor app is embarking on a significant transformation. Moving beyond its traditional role as a simple forum for neighborhood chatter, the platform is launching a comprehensive redesign aimed at becoming a more indispensable utility for communities. This ambitious overhaul introduces cutting-edge AI, direct integration of local news, and critical real-time emergency alerts, signaling a strategic pivot towards a more structured, helpful, and timely user experience. For those accustomed to the rapid evolution of digital platforms, Nextdoor’s bold move underscores the growing demand for reliable, accessible information at the local level. Revolutionizing Local Discovery with AI Recommendations One of the most exciting additions to the new Nextdoor experience is ‘Faves,’ an innovative feature powered by artificial intelligence designed to help users discover the best local businesses and hidden gems. Imagine needing a reliable plumber or the perfect family-friendly restaurant, and instead of sifting through generic search results, you get tailored suggestions based on years of genuine neighbor conversations. This is precisely what Faves aims to deliver. Powered by Hyperlocal AI: Nextdoor boasts an LLM (Large Language Model) specifically trained on 15 years of neighbor-generated content. This proprietary dataset allows the AI to understand and answer questions with a truly local context, a capability currently unmatched by broader platforms like Google or ChatGPT. Curated Suggestions: Users can ask specific questions, such as, “What is the best place to hike with kids?” and receive quick, summarized responses. These summaries are directly linked to the original posts from real users, ensuring transparency and trust. Proprietary Data Advantage: Nextdoor CEO and co-founder Nirav Tolia emphasized that this content is unique to Nextdoor, unindexed by external search engines. This positions the Nextdoor app as the go-to source for the kind of invaluable word-of-mouth information that defines local life – from finding a child’s lemonade stand to discovering a beloved, quirky local shop. Bringing Hyperlocal Local News to Your Doorstep To enhance the quality and quantity of information available, Nextdoor is integrating professional journalism directly into the app. This marks a significant shift from relying solely on user-generated content, acknowledging the importance of verified, timely reporting for a truly informed community. Nextdoor has forged partnerships with 3,500 local publications across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, including notable names like the San Francisco Standard, The London Standard, and The Toronto Star. This collaboration is designed to be mutually beneficial, as Nirav Tolia explained to Bitcoin World: “The reason that this is so important for us is historically, Nextdoor has relied 100% on user-generated content, just the content that’s created by your neighbors. That’s been a great source of information. But, to really make sure if it’s happening in your neighborhood, we need to bring in local news as well. So this is the first time we’re letting third party publishers use our distribution.” The agreements are non-commercial; Nextdoor doesn’t pay for the content, nor do publishers pay Nextdoor. The app simply displays a headline, a snippet, and an image, directing traffic to the publishers’ websites. This ensures that users have access to reliable local reporting while supporting local journalism. A dedicated section under each post will allow neighbors to discuss the news, fostering community dialogue around relevant local events. Critical Safety with Real-Time Alerts In moments of crisis, timely information can be life-saving. The redesigned Nextdoor app introduces a robust real-time alert system for events like severe weather, traffic incidents, power outages, storms, and wildfires. These alerts are displayed on a dynamic neighborhood map, enabling neighbors to engage in immediate conversations about safety and preparedness. To power these crucial updates, Nextdoor has partnered with Samdesk and Weather.com (including The Weather Channel app). Tolia detailed the alert system’s urgency levels: Yellow State: For important, attention-worthy events, alerts appear prominently at the top of the app. Red State: For critical, life-threatening situations, the alert takes over the entire app screen, ensuring immediate attention. As Tolia emphasized, “at that point, you don’t care about the conversations neighbors are having about pickleball. You don’t really care about the new restaurant review that the local publishers put in. You need to get together with your neighbors and help save each other’s lives in some cases.” What truly sets Nextdoor’s alerts apart is their hyper-localization. Built on a geospatial platform, the app can personalize alerts down to an individual house. Unlike broad Amber Alerts, if a power outage affects only a specific block, only residents on that block will receive the notification, minimizing unnecessary alerts and maximizing relevance. Beyond a Neighborhood Social Network: A Utility-Centric Future For years, Nextdoor has served as a popular, albeit sometimes controversial, platform for neighborhood interactions. While it excelled at connecting people for recommendations or lost pets, it also faced challenges with misinformation and instances of racism, leading to stalled growth and declining engagement. With this significant redesign, Nextdoor is determined to turn the tide, repositioning itself from merely a neighborhood social network to an essential, utility-centric service. The company’s focus is squarely on increasing the quality and quantity of local information. By integrating professional news and hyper-localized alerts, Nextdoor aims to provide a more valuable and reliable resource. This shift is not just about new features; it’s about a fundamental change in philosophy – making the platform more helpful, useful, and timely for everyday life. Looking ahead, Nextdoor plans to further expand its content ecosystem. Tolia noted that publishers are just the first step; in the future, the platform intends to allow small businesses, schools, and various organizations to establish native presences within the app, creating an even richer tapestry of local information and services. The Vision from the Top: CEO Nirav Tolia’s Insights Nirav Tolia’s vision for the “new Nextdoor” is clear: to digitize and capture the invaluable essence of local word-of-mouth. He firmly believes that the kind of hyperlocal information available on Nextdoor is simply not found on global platforms. “I give the funny example of, if you wanted to know all the lemonade stands that kids are operating in your neighborhood, you can’t go to Google Maps and find that,” Tolia remarked. “You can’t go to ChatGPT and ask that question, right? The only way is for you to ask your neighbors. And so that’s what Nextdoor is all about.” This renewed commitment to being truly hyperlocal, combined with sophisticated AI recommendations and vital real-time alerts , is set to redefine the platform’s utility. By blending neighbor-generated insights with professional content and critical safety tools, Nextdoor is striving to be less of a casual social network and more of an indispensable tool for community life, ensuring that when something important happens in your neighborhood, you’re the first to know. The redesign of the Nextdoor app represents a pivotal moment for the platform. By embracing advanced AI, integrating trusted local news, and delivering critical real-time alerts, Nextdoor is not just updating its interface; it’s fundamentally reshaping its purpose. This transformation aims to solve past challenges of misinformation and declining engagement by offering unparalleled utility and hyper-local relevance. As communities increasingly seek reliable information and stronger connections, Nextdoor’s strategic pivot positions it as an essential digital companion for modern neighborhood life, promising a more informed, safer, and connected future for its users.

2025-07-15T17:18:10,"Why This Week Is Crucial For Cryptocurrencies: Here’s All The Bills Being Introduced In The U.S., Their Potential Impact, And All You Need To Know","Washington, the capital of the United States, is witnessing a historic period for the cryptocurrency sector this week. During this period, dubbed “Crypto Week,” two important bills to be voted on in the House of Representatives could pave the way for the establishment of a long-awaited legal framework for digital assets. GENIUS Act: Stablecoins The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, will be voted on Thursday in the House of Representatives. If passed, it would mark the first time in US history that independent cryptocurrency regulation has been enacted. The Trump administration supports this process. The House of Representatives, having abandoned the previous version, took up the new version after President Donald Trump called on Truth Social, “No delays, no addendums, bring it to my desk now.” CLARITY: The Status of Cryptocurrencies However, the industry's biggest hope lies in the CLARITY Act, a bill that would clarify whether digital assets are securities or commodities. This bill aims to clearly divide regulatory powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday and is expected to pass after passing committees with bipartisan support. However, its progress in the Senate is less clear. Democrats are wary of the bill due to the Trump family's crypto investments. Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, despite supporting the GENIUS Act, stating that “Trump’s crypto corruption is corrupting the digital asset market,” did not show the same commitment to CLARITY. Coinbase, aiming to boost support for the CLARITY Act, distributed nearly 5,000 chocolate bars across Washington to highlight the law's importance. The company noted on the packaging that nearly one-fifth of Americans own crypto, according to a Morning Consult poll. Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Coinbase, Ripple, and other crypto companies are urging members of Congress to support them, arguing that a clearer regulatory framework would boost investor confidence. “Consumers want to know what they're getting into when they buy and sell these assets and that they're using a trusted intermediary,” said Kara Calvert, Coinbase's Vice President of U.S. Public Policy. The Senate is preparing to introduce its own market structure regulation this month, which will differ from the House version. Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are working on the legislation, while Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand plans to support it with a bipartisan approach. “We have a lot of work to do, and we will be working in a bipartisan manner over the next month,” Gillibrand told CNBC. Bill to Ban CBDC Another key item for the crypto industry is a separate bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing digital dollars (CBDCs).This bill is also expected to be passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger expressed support for the bill, saying, “If this is something the private sector should be doing, the government should not be the competitor.” *This is not investment advice.

Markets are now pricing in “Crypto Week,” a key regulatory event , as the CLARITY Act market structure bill, GENIUS Act stablecoin bill, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act face the U.S. House. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Is the Stage Set for $1 While a $1 Shiba Inu price remains speculative, the token’s increasingly bullish fundamentals add weight to the long-term case. The recent launch of DegenSafe, SHIB’s response to Solana’s meme coin launchpads, and ongoing token burns could lift prices through increased adoption and scarcity. Even without these catalysts fully priced in, the technical setup still points higher, backed by a developing six-month double bottom pattern. SHIB / USDT 1-week chart, double bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Since its second bottom in mid-June, the Shiba Inu price has pushed steadily toward a breakout above the neckline at $0.0000177. Momentum indicators continue to support the move. The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory in the 30s, climbing toward neutral as buying pressure returns. More so, the MACD line continues to widen its lead over the signal line after a short-lived death cross, signaling underlying strength and a potential longer-term uptrend. If the double bottom plays out, SHIB could see a 93% surge, targeting a higher resistance zone stretching back to early January at $0.000025. However, its full potential hinges on a successful break above its neckline. Still, that move hinges on a clean break above the neckline. Until then, $0.000012 remains the key support to watch. Losing it risks a third bottom at $0.00001, invalidating the setup. SHIB Might Not Be The Best Meme Coin Narrative to Follow The truth is, SHIB has been in the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives. On the speculative meme coin scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins,” the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come. Millions of gamble coins will come and go. But only a handful of MISSION COINS will WIN. pic.twitter.com/rxsVfeux8A — Murad (@MustStopMurad) July 8, 2025 Token6900 ($T6900) is the latest chapter in that saga: no promises, no utility—you are the utility.

2025-07-15T17:08:55,"The Real Narrative Behind Bitcoin That You Need To Know","Summary Bitcoin's price is driven by institutionalization and regulation. Not safe-haven demand, making it more akin to the S&P 500 than gold. Key catalysts include regulatory moves like the Genius Act and political dynamics undermining monetary policy credibility. In my opinion, we can talk about institutionalization, until proven otherwise, as an “anti‑liberalization” of Bitcoin. But this certainly doesn’t mean less demand. But watch out for traps. With increasing overextension, the attractiveness of taking a position could decrease compared to ""alts"". Bitcoin does not follow macroeconomics, but above all, it is not a safe-haven asset . At least not right now. What drives the price of Bitcoin is not fear but rather a de- liberalization , or better said, a phase of institutionalization/regulation that could be truly epochal. Here’s my opinion: we must not make the mistake of treating it like gold; perhaps we should make the effort to treat it more like the S&P 500 . And now that the market has flipped the risk‑on switch, my attention once again turns to Bitcoin. And not only that . But first, let me share with you… My bullish view on BTC It diverges from the idea that a weak dollar and expectations of a rate cut are a panacea for BTC demand. I prefer to identify two other catalysts: institutionalization and monetary instability. Simply, two threads: The “fight” between President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell The Genius Act Not tariffs: I consider it too simplistic to say that Bitcoin demand increases because of the instability generated by tariffs. It would be like supporting the classic dynamic “bitcoin = safe asset haven,” which we have seen does not match real danger situations. For those who still embrace Bitcoin today as a challenger to the modern monetary system, I think following the two narrative threads I have identified is more consistent. The two catalysts to remember Simply put, the fact that President Donald Trump directly steps in to undermine Powell , and by doing so influences monetary policy decisions, is an important historical inconsistency. For Bitcoin, it’s as if its fiercest enemy were saying, “Hey, you were right, we’re not that efficient.” Of course, this part of my analysis is more storytelling than data‑driven analysis, but I can’t help finding in it a very theatrical, fascinating narrative. Especially when I frame the story with the stablecoin regulation process, defined as the Genius Act, here, I find a logical reason in the weakness of the dollar, but also in Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC , and coming back to us, the introduction of a new monetary system. Therefore, both the Genius Act, the Clarity Act (regulatory framework for crypto), and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance State Act . In one word: institutionalization. Makes you think, doesn’t it? A bullish phase, because it increases demand, but not so close to the “liberal” concept of Bitcoin from 2010, even though that propaganda is still very much alive among supporters, but let’s see if between this narrative and the data there is actually a formal correlation. In numbers: If I look for signs of institutionalization, first of all, I look at the flows in the USA spot Bitcoin ETFs, and I notice that they have over $138 billion in AUM. Not really a typical feature of a market with less than 3 years of experience. IBIT: Example of AUM of the most capitalized ETF (Seeking Alpha) Another sign of institutionalization? The volatility, hasn't anyone noticed a drop in Bitcoin’s volatility? How many remember 2021, when you woke up in the morning and realized that during the night the portfolio had registered a positive fluctuation of 10% and then maybe a negative of 15%? Well, the 30-day rolling volatility drops to 35% , while before 2022, it was over 100%. IBIT – Example of how volatility has halved compared to the average (Seeking Alpha) But do you know what confirms to me that the bullish movement is driven by this (allow me the term) artificial process? The comparison with a real safe asset heaven: Bitcoin has a trend substantially disconnected from gold , which actually is ONLY a safe asset heaven, even if the dollar is falling. But what does this discrepancy really mean? In essence, the market is not looking for protection but for risk . Data by YCharts And if Bitcoin is in demand, it means that it is treated more like an S&P 500 , a signal of the fact that it follows “earnings-driven” narratives, even if naturally it has no earnings, but more similar to the accumulation methodologies of institutions. Data by YCharts Risk: “Yes, alright, it may make sense, so will it keep growing endlessly?” In the end, that’s what we really want to know. Let’s look at some numbers: of Bitcoin traders, 86% are in profit, 13% at break‑even , and only 1% in loss. Simply put, if we’re at ATH, how is it possible that 13% are at breakeven? Here’s the point: after all these words, I’ve come to this to tell you that this piece of information can be read by many in a contrarian sense. It basically shows there are a lot of buyers at the highs, which becomes even more worrying if you consider a Large Transactions Volume of $164.28B : clearly a sign of euphoria but also of strong hands intervening, who tend to play on these retail imbalances. (Of course, this is my personal opinion.) IBIT (Seeking Alpha) Well, it’s a risk, especially considering that this is the first year Bitcoin’s price is below the stock‑to‑flow level at 463 days in the yellow range of the post‑halving day distribution. It’s anomalous. Bear market... or alt season If you got scared, know that this is not enough for me to call a downgrade on Bitcoin. Because the narrative is still promising, in my opinion. Rather, this seems to me like a typical phase of an alt season, that is, a market phase in which very positive idiosyncratic drivers develop for smaller cryptocurrencies. Data by YCharts In other words, it is statistically likely that, with Bitcoin already in an upper‑extreme zone, the market could shift part of its resources toward alternative assets, potentially those that have been “left behind,” and of course, ETH immediately comes to mind, and I’ve talked about it here as well. An element that, in fact, would remain close to the institutionalized narrative, considering the launch of ETFs. Conclusion To conclude, I remain close to the bullish narrative on BTC, while keeping an eye on the imbalance in the distribution of demand and supply, which could generate short‑term volatility, such as a fake breakout above the highs. In this sense, I look favorably on alternatives, and I think the market will too.
