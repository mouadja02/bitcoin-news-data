2025-07-15T16:55:26,"Falling US Dollar Could Trigger ‘Full Bubble Cycle’ in Risk Assets, According to Ex-Goldman Sachs Exec Raoul Pal","Macroeconomics expert Raoul Pal says risk assets could witness massive eruptions if the US dollar continues to weaken. In a new video, Pal tells his 242,000 YouTube subscribers that if the US dollar index (DXY) falls further amid an improving business cycle, risk assets such as stocks and crypto could experience an extended bullish phase. “So what happens is when the business cycle picks up, there’s more disposable income and businesses have more investment income and that gets driven out of the risk curve always… And I think the inverse to the business cycle being so low for so long will be the flip side of the cycle will be longer than people expected because we’ve got this slight dislocation still working through post-Covid that then extends the business cycle… But if financial conditions keep moving, if they really have done some sort of Mar-a-Lago Accord, and they get the dollar [DXY] below 90. Okay, then we’re going on further and yeah, maybe it’s a full bubble cycle then.” The DXY, a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of six other leading currencies from major economies, is currently at 98. Pal further says an increase in global liquidity could also act as a bullish catalyst for asset prices amid high government debt levels. “Just using the liquidity framework, the business cycle framework, the financial conditions framework, it’s all suggesting that the probability is because they need to roll the debt, they’re going to have to increase more liquidity, and this is just going to drive assets up strongly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-15T16:43:20,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Slides Below $120,000 After Record Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a significant decline on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency surged to record levels. BTC raced past $123,000 on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $123,097 before declining to settle at $119,714. Analysts believe BTC’ s rally is far from over, with predictions coming thick and fast. Most analysts believe the price could reach $135,000 before a market correction sets in. Strategy Resumes Bitcoin Shopping, Purchases 4,225 BTC For $472 Million Michael Saylor’s Strategy has resumed its weekly Bitcoin purchases, acquiring 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per coin. The latest purchase takes Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 601,550 BTC , worth over $73 billion at current prices, at an average cost of $71,268 per Bitcoin for a total cost of $42.9 billion. The company holds nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply and is sitting on almost $30 billion of paper gains. Strategy funded its latest acquisition from at-the-money (ATM) sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual Strike preferred stock, STRK, perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF, and perpetual Stride preferred stock, STRD. The company sold 797,008 MSTR shares for $330.9 million. $17.78 billion worth of MSTR shares remain available for issuance and sale as of July 13. The firm also sold 573,976 STRK shares for $71.1 million, and has $20.45 billion worth of STRK shares remaining available for sale and issuance under that program. Strategy also sold 444,005 STRF shares for $55.3 million, and has $1.88 billion remaining. Lastly, it sold 158,278 STRD shares for $15 million, with $4.19 billion available for sale and issuance. Standard Chartered Launches Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) Spot Trading Standard Chartered is allowing its institutional clients to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) through its UK branch. Financial institutions have reported a substantial jump in demand for crypto products from clients as BTC surges to record levels. The decision allows institutional investors, corporates, and asset managers to conduct spot crypto trading using the bank’s existing platforms. Standard Chartered already offers several crypto products, including trading services via two subsidiary companies, Zodia Markets and Zodia Custody. Standard Chartered Chief Executive Bill Winters said in a statement, “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade, and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements.” Retail Demand Outpacing Bitcoin Supply Bitfinex analysts have said that even retail demand is outpacing supply, with new buyers entering the market buying the cryptocurrency faster than the rate at which miners mine it. The analysts stated in a market report, “Currently, the combined balance of these cohorts is expanding at a rate of approximately 19.3K BTC per month.” The analysts highlighted that the Shrimp ( BTC ), Crab (1-10 BTC ), and Fish (10-100 BTC ) holder groups were accumulating Bitcoin and growing their portfolio significantly faster than the monthly issuance rate. “Demand from this segment alone is more than enough to absorb all new supply. This cohort-level accumulation trend supports the broader bullish narrative that new buyers entering the Bitcoin market are price-agnostic buyers and are relentlessly accumulating with limited intervals.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a substantial decline during the ongoing session as traders lock in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency raced to record highs on Monday. BTC crossed $116,000 on Friday and settled at $116,885. However, it lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline before rising 1.72% on Sunday and settling at $118,624. The price soared to a new all-time high on Monday, racing past $123,000 and settling at $123,091 before declining to $119,714. BTC is down over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $117,030. Market experts believe the correction is driven by profit booking, as investors lock their gains after the price surged past $120,000. Despite the decline, Bitcoin ETFs reported $300 million in inflows, indicating continued investor confidence. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, believes that BTC could push to $135,000 before any substantial correction. Stockton added that stocks like Coinbase and Strategy, which track BTC markets, will also perform well. “There is positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies.” Other analysts offered similar predictions after BTC broke above $120,000 on Monday, crossing $123,000 on Coinbase before retreating. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, “Based on the July 10 breakout signal, which has historically led to an average 20% rally over the following two months, we project Bitcoin could reach $133,000. We expect some near-term consolidation, followed by a push toward $133,000, with our $160,000 year-end target still firmly in sight.” BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 on Thursday (July 3), but lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday, settling at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC registered an increase of over 2% and settled at $111,255. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered an increase of 3.51% and settled at $115,159. Price action remained bullish on Friday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose 1.50%, settling at $116,885, but not before reaching an intraday high of $118,287. The rally took a breather on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline. However, it resumed on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Monday, surging past $120,000 to reach $123,091. Despite strong bullish sentiment, it retreated from this level and settled at $119,714, ultimately rising 0.92%.

2025-07-15T16:06:37,"Stablecoins May Reshape U.S. Treasury Market at $750B Threshold, Standard Chartered Says","The stablecoin market could start reshaping traditional finance if it grows to about $750 billion, according to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research. Kendrick, writing in a note Tuesday after a week-long trip through Washington, New York and Boston, said there’s a growing consensus among crypto industry players, fund managers and policymakers that this $750 billion mark would be the tipping point where stablecoins begin to influence government debt issuance, monetary policy and the structure of U.S. Treasury markets through sheer demand. The current stablecoin market stands at about $240 billion. But Kendrick’s contacts expect it could more than triple by the end of 2026, driven by broadening use and regulatory clarity, particularly if the bipartisan GENIUS Act becomes law — a move that could happen as early as next week. “In the U.S., once the stablecoin market gets to a certain size, the amount of T-bills required to back stablecoins will likely require a shift in planned issuance across the curve towards more T-bill issuance, less longer-tenor issuance,” Kendrick wrote. “This potentially has implications for the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and demand for USD assets.” Stablecoins — cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a fixed value, usually $1 — are typically backed by cash-equivalent reserves, most often short-term U.S. government debt. As demand rises, so too does the need to hold vast quantities of Treasury bills, putting stablecoins on a potential collision course with traditional fixed income markets. Kendrick met with a cross-section of market participants during his U.S. visit, including Bitcoin miners, crypto-native firms, traditional hedge funds and policymakers, he said. Their near-unanimous focus: stablecoins. Market participants expect a wave of stablecoin issuance, not just from crypto firms, but possibly from banks and even local governments. Emerging markets may be the most immediately affected. Kendrick flagged concerns that individuals in these regions are using stablecoins as a digital savings vehicle, pulling capital away from local banking systems and central bank reserves. That could challenge financial stability in countries that rely on U.S. dollar liquidity to manage fixed exchange rates or capital controls. On the U.S. front, stablecoins could shift corporate treasuries away from traditional banking and into tokenized cash alternatives. But how much of their cash businesses move on-chain — and how fast — remains uncertain. The growing attention is reflected in public markets. Shares of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, have surged 540% since its public debut last month. The run-up signals investor confidence in stablecoins as a central pillar of the next phase of digital finance.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/stablecoins-may-reshape-u-s-treasury-market-at-usd750b-threshold-standard-chartered-says,"MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","Markets|Stablecoins|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T16:04:45,"Whales Are Back in Meme Coins After Bitcoin’s New ATH – This Telegram Bot Could Help You Find the Best Ones","Bitcoin’s (BTC) new all-time high has reignited the entire crypto market, and meme coins are once again in the spotlight. Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing in whales and institutional traders alike, pushing futures volume to over $1.5 billion on Monday. And as attention shifts back to high-risk, high-reward plays, many traders are turning to automation – not because it guarantees wins, but because the right bot can at least tilt the odds in your favor, such as Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) . The most recognized bots in the space such as Banana Gun, Maestro, and Unibot have all originated on Ethereum – a chain that’s notorious for congestion and high gas fees. Snorter takes a different route, being built natively on Solana, where transactions are faster and cheaper by design. Since last year, the network has become the preferred engine for meme coin trading and now, with a purpose-built bot operating directly on it, traders can finally match that speed with execution optimized for it. For those looking to support the development of a sharper tool for spotting high-potential tokens, the SNORT presale is live and has raised nearly $1.9 million. Tokens are available at $0.0981 for the next two hours before the price ticks up to the next presale stage. Meme Coin Volatility Is Back – But Snorter Can Trade the Chaos Meme coins have now topped $70 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. Since Bitcoin broke its all-time high in May, investors have funneled gains into the industry’s less serious assets, with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK) climbing 11%, 22.1%, and 26.7% respectively, over the past week. DOGE, boosted by heavy whale accumulation, surged 13.9% in the same timeframe. But the returns across the sector can vary wildly. Among the top 10 meme coins, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) led the pack with a 105% weekly gain – far above the usual 15% to 25% range. Meanwhile, lesser-known tokens like MemeCore (M) have exploded even harder, clocking in at 598% since July 3, driven by the hype around its Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for meme coins. The price action is reminiscent of the speculative frenzy last seen in mid-2023. Yet, spotting tokens on the verge of a breakout is tough to do manually. That’s where crypto trading bots like Snorter Token help level the playing field for retail traders. As mentioned earlier, Snorter’s Solana-native foundation gives it a clear edge in execution. Unlike Ethereum-based bots that often get bogged down by high fees and network congestion, Snorter is meant for high-frequency trading, exactly the kind of environment Telegram bots are meant to thrive in. Snorter Token is Built Exactly for the Traders Who Never Log Off Snorter is designed for the rhythm of meme coin season, when new tokens drop without warning, and seconds determine a winning trade from a losing trade. As mentioned, it runs directly inside Telegram, so trades happen in the same space where calls, rumors, and alpha get posted in real time. What makes Snorter stand out isn’t just the execution speed, though, but also the full environment it builds around the trader. It features real-time feed monitoring, wallet mirroring, and sniper configurations, and it compresses the entire trading flow into a single, responsive interface. Essentially, with these features, users can track wallets, set up sniper parameters to auto-buy tokens based on specific triggers, and deploy swaps instantly. And with MEV protection built in, trades land cleanly without being front-run by predatory bots. Snorter also helps flag contracts with red flags – including honeypots, which let you buy but block you from selling – giving traders added security in a market filled with stealth launches and fast-moving traps. On Solana, tokens regularly 2x within the first minute of launch on DEX Screener – often before Telegram groups or X even react. With Snorter, that early edge becomes accessible to retail. Snorter is also structured for expansion. As mentioned, multi-chain support is on the roadmap, and community proposals will soon guide its direction from what gets prioritized next to how features evolve. The end goal is a trading bot that’s intuitive enough to become a full-on crypto trading command center – one that’s ready for a renewed meme coin season in 2025. How to Buy SNORT at a Discount In short, trading the meme coin market – especially with buying activity surging again – is nearly impossible without automation. But if you think any trading bot will do the job, you’d be mistaken. Once launched, one of Snorter’s biggest advantages – beyond its speed and functionality – is its cost-efficiency. Simply holding SNORT unlocks execution fees as low as 0.85% – the lowest in the space. Most competing bots charge between 1% and 2%, making Snorter a clear value pick for active traders aiming to maximize returns. And of course, SNORT tokens aren’t just a currency within the tool – they’re exposure to the ecosystem itself, with future rewards, governance rights, and utility baked in for those who want a stake in how the platform evolves. If you’re ready to back it, head to the Snorter Token presale site and secure your SNORT using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or a credit card. SNORT tokens bought in the presale can generate passive returns through its own staking pool that currently offers a dynamic 207% APY. For the smoothest experience, use Best Wallet – the only Web3 wallet that shows your SNORT balance in-app and gives early access to new token launches through its exclusive ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. Download Best Wallet now on Google Play or the Apple App Store . Follow Snorter Token on X and Instagram for the latest updates.

Trump made the following statements: Happy Crypto Week! The House of Representatives will vote on a monumental bill that will make America the undisputed #1 leader in digital assets. No one does it better than us! The GENIUS Act will put our great country far ahead of China, Europe, and others. They're trying to catch up, but they won't.

Launched three days before Trump's inauguration, the token was listed on leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase within just one day. Coinbase states that it normally conducts a “rigorous” review process before listing new digital assets. The TRUMP token has entered exchanges at an extraordinary pace compared to other major memecoins. However, the large holdings of the token by Trump and his associates pose a risk of potential price manipulation.

The slide mirrors broader market jitters after bitcoin (BTC) surged to a record above $120,000, prompting a wave of profit-taking that brought the cryptocurrency back down to $116,000 at the time of writing. The profit-taking trend also comes at a time in which inflation grew to 2.7% in June, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. It’s up from a 2.4% annual increase in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics For hours, BNB oscillated within a narrow $23 corridor, bouncing between $698.72 and $675.47, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Buyers showed up near $675, helping stem the slide with a burst of volume exceeding 134,000 tokens traded as prices hit session lows. BNB has since clawed back some ground. Technical signals remain mixed. A downtrend persists, capped by resistance at $690 to $695, a zone where earlier support has flipped into selling pressure. Yet surges in trading activity hint at possible accumulation, as seen in a brief spike of over 1,600 tokens traded in a four-minute window. Various companies have indeed moved to adopt a BNB treasury reserve. The volatility comes as BNB celebrates its eighth anniversary, a milestone that underscores its journey. It’s also recently undergone a $1 billion token burn. BNB is also benefitting from BNB Chain joining the Ondo Global Markets Alliance to bring tokenized securities, which include U.S. stocks, ETFs, and funds, to its network. Whether BNB can break above resistance, or sink lower if profit-taking continues, could shape sentiment for the broader crypto market in coming days.

2025-07-15T15:49:36,"Pump.fun suffers steep crash after explosive launch","PUMP, the native token of Solana ( SOL )-based meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, has suffered a sharp reversal following its high-profile debut. At press time, PUMP was trading at $0.00570, down 15% over the past 24 hours, making it the largest loser among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token initially surged to a peak of $0.00968 but has since dropped 41%. PUMP one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Launched on July 12 through a public token sale , the PUMP ICO raised $500 million in just 12 minutes, selling 150 billion tokens at $0.004 each. While a broader market pullback, driven by Bitcoin ( BTC ) losing the $120,000 support level, has added to the sell-off, several PUMP-specific factors have accelerated the decline. For instance, on-chain data reveals that roughly 340 wallets controlled more than 60% of the presale allocation. Many of these wallets began selling their tokens as they unlocked on July 14, increasing selling pressure on the market. Volatility was further fueled by the decision from Binance and other major exchanges to list PUMP futures before spot markets, a move that appears to have dampened retail investor enthusiasm. Whales turn bearish on PUMP At the same time, large holders have shown a bearish stance. For instance, a whale reportedly opened a $8.5 million short position, while short funding rates on decentralized platforms spiked to an annualized rate of 1,100%, indicating extreme negative sentiment. PUMP whale transactions. Source: Arkham Investors also seem concerned about growing competition in the meme coin launchpad space. To this end, rival platform LetsBonk overtook Pump.fun in daily market share, grabbing 44.87% compared to Pump.fun’s 43.73%. LetsBonk also leads in token graduation rates, with 1.04% of its 18,150 tokens achieving full trading status versus 0.93% for Pump.fun’s 12,261 launches. Notably, Pump.fun, which gained popularity in 2024 as the go-to platform for launching Solana-based meme coins, had pitched the PUMP ICO as part of a larger vision to create a decentralized alternative to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch.

2025-07-15T15:38:55,"Bitwise Adds Proof of Reserves for Bitcoin, Ether ETFs","Crypto asset manager Bitwise said it is improving transparency for its spot bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds, rolling out third-party proof-of-reserves verifications through U.S. accounting company The Network Firm. The process, which is already live, replaces Bitwise’s prior practice of publicly listing nearly 90 wallet addresses on its websites. Instead, The Network Firm will confirm on-chain holdings daily for the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) and Bitwise Ethereum ETF (ETHW), reconciling balances with the number of fund shares outstanding, Bitwise said in a post on X. In the coming weeks, the firm said, it plans to add a second layer of transparency. That layer will bring in daily CPA-attested reports verifying not just asset balances but also fund liabilities. “Together, these features deliver a more comprehensive and easily readable approach to transparency,” the company wrote. The added layer is meant to assure investors that fund holdings match obligations. Proof-of-reserve audits have been a growing trend in the cryptocurrency industry, taking off after the collapse of FTX in November 2022. That collapse occurred after a leaked balance sheet triggered a bank run on the exchange, revealing it did not have customers’ assets on hand to meet its obligations. Since then, platforms’ reserves have been a major concern for investors. Bitwise’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund currently has $4.9 billion in net assets, far below the market leader, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which holds $85.9 billion, according to SoSoValue data. Similarly, its ether ETF holds $358 million in net assets, below the sector’s leader’s $6.28 billion.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/15/bitwise-adds-proof-of-reserves-for-bitcoin-ether-etfs,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Finance|Bitwise|bitcoin spot ETF|Ether ETFs|Proof-of-Reserves|News",cryptocompare

Anthony Pompliano recently addressed the performance of BTC while underlining key drivers behind the substantial growth. Pompliano Brands Bitcoin “The Greatest Show On Wall Street” Over the past few days, Bitcoin has witnessed a remarkable upward performance, breaking into uncharted territories. Renowned investor and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Capital Management, Anthony Pompliano, has dubbed BTC the “Greatest Show on Wall Street” after the recent ferocious surge that brought it back into the spotlight. The Capital Management CEO made the bullish statement in a recent interview on the popular CNBC Squawk Box show. In comments that demonstrate how captivating the asset’s recent upward trends have been, Pompliano emphasized Bitcoin’s unparalleled capacity to take center stage and hold investors’ attention . According to the founder, the reason behind his statement that Bitcoin is the greatest show on Wall Street is that “everyone wants the crypto king.” Furthermore, he stated that BTC is no longer a contrarian trade; it is a consensus trade. His statement is backed by the Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) , the BTC Treasury companies, retailers, and the Sovereign Wealth Fund, among others. When asked about concerns regarding the notion that when economists and analysts have a consensus view on BTC, investors should go the other way, the CEO asserted that this is nothing to be afraid of. This is due to his claims that “economists do not like Bitcoin.” Major Drivers Of BTC’s Powerful Rally Financial circles are taking notice of Bitcoin’s remarkable rise , which has sparked more extensive discussions regarding its crucial position in the industry. Pompliano has broken down the potential triggers behind BTC’s substantial upside action. The first driver mentioned by the CEO is the record inflows into the BTC Spot ETFs in recent weeks, highlighting the massive $1.2 billion capital flow witnessed on Thursday. BTC Spot ETFs have seen significant growth since their introduction, recording a net inflow of over $140 billion, with BlackRock’s fund valued at nearly $90 billion alone . Another key factor pointed out is Bitcoin Options Expiry. After the options expired at the end of Q2, BTC saw a notable downward pressure, which appears to have served as a launchpad to the recent rally. Finally, the entrepreneur considers the significant liquidations of short sellers as a major part of BTC’s upsurge. As Bitcoin takes out short sellers, Pompliano claims that the flagship asset ultimately went into a price discovery phase. According to the CEO, BTC entered a price discovery phase in November last year when the crypto king surged from its previous high $70,000 to $90,000 within 3 weeks. Pompliano has identified a possible similar trend following BTC’s break above the $110,000. As a result, he is confident that the asset could rally hard, potentially reaching the $140,000 price mark because it is now in a true price discovery phase.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-rally-no-mystery/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE","Bitcoin News|Anthony Pompliano|bitcoin|bitcoin news|Bitcoin options expiry|bitcoin price|BlackRock|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Capital Management|CNBC Squawk Box|ETFs|Price Discovery Phase|Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds|wall street",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T15:00:41,"Top Crypto Gainers 2025: BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Smart Earning Ideas","The crypto market is heating up in July 2025. Bitcoin has crossed $122,000, Ethereum stays above $3,000, and the total market cap is nearing $4 trillion. With many top crypto gainers showing strong weekly growth, people are now searching for smart ways to earn through crypto. Whether you’re new or experienced, it’s a good time to explore your options. Here are five smart ways to earn from crypto in 2025. The first on the list is BlockDAG’s $0.0016 presale, a key highlight among this year’s top crypto gainers. 1. Join BlockDAG at $0.0016 Before August 11 BlockDAG is standing out with one of the biggest presale runs of the year. It has collected over $339 million so far. The current Batch 29 rate is $0.0276, a 2,660% jump from its starting price of $0.001. What makes BlockDAG (BDAG) even more appealing is the special offer running until August 11. New buyers can still join at $0.0016, close to the entry point that early participants had. That brings a strong potential for gains if the launch price hits $0.05. So far, the testnet is live, 18,500 miners have shipped, and over 2 million users are active on the X1 Miner App. The project has also built sports links with Inter Milan and Seattle Seawolves. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release is set for August 11, making it a top mention among this year’s top crypto gainers. 2. Use Ethereum Staking to Build Steady Returns Ethereum remains one of the top crypto gainers this year and is still a strong choice for long-term plans. Staking it offers a reliable way to earn extra income. With Ethereum holding above $3,000, staking rewards range between 4% and 6% per year, depending on the platform used. User-friendly platforms like Lido and Coinbase help make the process simple. Staking also helps support the Ethereum network while giving rewards in return. It’s a practical option for those wanting to earn passively from a top crypto project. 3. Try Bitcoin ETFs for Simple Market Access Bitcoin, now priced over $122,000, continues to be one of the top crypto gainers. A big reason for this is the rising demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have seen more than $3.6 billion added in recent weeks. ETFs offer a way to be part of Bitcoin’s growth without handling wallets or private keys. This makes them a useful option for those who want easier, more secure access to the world’s largest digital asset. 4. Use Stablecoin Farming for Steady Earnings For those wanting less risk, yield farming with stablecoins such as USDC, DAI, or USDT could be a smart path. Platforms like Aave and Curve offer yearly returns between 5% and 10%. Stablecoins hold a steady value, which helps reduce price risk. This approach works well for anyone looking for consistent returns without large price changes. It’s also useful for those who prefer safer ways to take part in the top crypto gainers market. 5. Trade Altcoins That Show Strong Price Moves Many altcoins are climbing fast in 2025, with names like Solana, XRP, and Avalanche showing double-digit gains in a week. These coins are among the top crypto gainers this season. For active traders, these price moves create chances to earn, though it takes careful planning. Keeping up with news, using stop-loss tools, and managing risk are all key to trading altcoins successfully. Final Thoughts on Earning in a Fast-Moving Market There are many paths to earning in crypto this year, such as staking, trading, referrals, and more. Among all these, BlockDAG’s presale has drawn attention as one of the top crypto gainers . At the current $0.0016 price and a listing goal of $0.05, combined with working tools already in use, BlockDAG offers a rare mix of early access and active progress. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release is set for August 11, giving users a deadline to watch. If you’re thinking about earning through crypto in 2025, this could be one of the most timely moves to explore.

2025-07-15T14:59:10,"Donald Trump Launches Official Process for Fed Chair! US Treasury Secretary Calls for ""Extension"" to Powell!","As is well known, US President Donald Trump has been calling on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates and resign for some time. Powell stated that interest rate cuts should wait a little longer, while Trump stated that the time has come for interest rate cuts and that delaying them would harm the US economy. As interest and resignation tensions continued between the two, Trump began to look for another candidate to replace Powell. At this point, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the process of selecting Fed Chair Powell's successor has begun. Speaking to Bloomberg's Surveillance program, Scott Bessent said the official process has begun to identify Powell as a potential replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Treasury Secretary stated that the process will proceed at President Trump's pace. “The official process has begun. There are many great candidates and we will see how quickly the process moves.” Bessent also noted that uncertainty surrounding Powell's tenure could have a negative impact on markets and warned that Powell's continued presence beyond his term could create confusion in the markets. “Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down from his or her position on the board. If he or she acts as a shadow Fed chair, it could create confusion. It would be very misleading for the market,” Bessent said. Powell's term as chairman expires in 2026, but her board membership continues until January 2028. This means she can continue to influence decision-making even after her chairmanship ends. However, Powell has consistently avoided any questions about her continued board membership. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Donald Trump Launches Official Process for Fed Chair!

The crypto market cap has plunged by nearly 4% as BTC and other cryptocurrencies trade in the red. The decline is largely due to traders locking in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency raced past $123,000 to an all-time high of $123,091 on Monday. BTC is down over 4% in the past 24 hours, and is trading around $116,954. Ethereum (ETH) has also lost momentum as selling pressure returns.

Suleimenov also claimed that Kazakhstan plans to establish a national crypto asset reserve using digital assets seized by its law enforcement agencies. CZ Alleges Coinbase Was Anonymous Source Behind Bloomberg Report Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao has reposted a tweet that alleges Coinbase was the anonymous source behind a Bloomberg report targeting the Trump-backed World Liberty Financial crypto project and Binance. Crypto contributor Matt Wallace had claimed in a post on X that Coinbase executives fear a potential pardon for Zhao and Binance’s return to the US market. According to Wallace, Coinbase executives saw this as a threat to their market share, prompting efforts to undermine the competition. Wallace stated on X, “Binance is the world’s #1 crypto exchange. What is most shocking is that Coinbase would target President Trump in an attempt to hurt their competition. This is anti-American! Will Coinbase fess up and face the heat for their poor decision? It will all come out soon!” Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, responded to Wallace and denied the rumors, stating, “Sorry — this is pure misinformation. We absolutely did not contribute to this story. We don't attack competitors, and we welcome any businesses that share our goal of growing the crypto pie.” The Bloomberg report alleged Binance developed the smart contract for the USD1 stablecoin, issued by World Liberty Financial. The report also revealed that Zhao applied for a presidential pardon after the USD1 stablecoin was used in a $2 billion deal with a UAE-based fund. Zhao called the article a “hit piece” filled with factual errors. Unauthorized Crypto Trading Could Land You In Prison Hungary has passed a law to imprison traders using unauthorized crypto exchanges to trade crypto. Traders using these “unauthorized crypto-asset exchange services” could face two years in prison, with penalties increasing based on the value of the trades. The law also targets unauthorized crypto service providers, who now face up to three years in prison. However, local reports claim the new laws have created confusion among crypto companies. Hungary’s Supervisory Authority for Regulatory Affairs (SZTFH) has 60 days to develop a compliance framework for the laws. US Stocks Register Marginal Gains US stocks registered a marginal increase as investors turned their attention to tariffs and the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones rose 50 points (0.11%), while the S&P 500 registered a similar increase. The tech-heavy Nasdaq registered a more significant jump of 0.32%. Traders have been measured and lowered their risk appetite after President Trump announced a 30% tariff on Mexico and the European Union. The tariffs will come into effect on August 1. Markets are undecided whether the new tariffs are a long-term policy shift or a negotiating tactic to secure a more favorable deal for the US. Strategy Resumes Bitcoin (BTC) Buying With Latest Purchase Michael Saylor’s Strategy has resumed its Bitcoin (BTC) buying spree, announcing the purchase of 4,225 BTC for $472 million. The latest purchase takes the company’s total holdings to 601,550 BTC valued at $73,243,825,675 at current prices. The most recent acquisition also takes Strategy’s Bitcoin yield to 20.2% year-to-date. This is Strategy’s first purchase after a brief pause. The previous purchase came on June 30, when the company bought 4,980 BTC for $531 million. Saylor reaffirmed his conviction about BTC in a discussion on X, stating the flagship cryptocurrency would be “going up forever.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a sharp decline during the ongoing session as traders lock in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency raced to record levels over the past few sessions. BTC’s rally took a breather on Saturday before resuming on Sunday, with the price rising almost 2% to $118,624. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as the price raced past $123,000, setting a new all-time high of $123,091 before declining. Buyers started losing momentum late on Monday as profit-taking led to a jump in selling pressure. As a result, the price fell below $120,000 to $119,714, ultimately registering an increase of 0.92%. The current session sees BTC down nearly 3%. Despite the decline during the ongoing session, analysts believe the uptrend will continue. The current drop has been attributed to profit-taking, as traders lock in their gains after BTC climbed to record levels over the past few sessions, peaking at $123,091 on Monday. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, believes that BTC could push to $135,000 before any substantial correction. Stockton added that stocks like Coinbase and Strategy, which track BTC markets, will also perform well. “There is positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies.” Other analysts offered similar predictions after BTC broke above $120,000 on Monday, crossing $123,000 on Coinbase before retreating. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, “Based on the July 10 breakout signal, which has historically led to an average 20% rally over the following two months, we project Bitcoin could reach $133,000. We expect some near-term consolidation, followed by a push toward $133,000, with our $160,000 year-end target still firmly in sight.” Meanwhile, LVRG Research director Nick Ruck made a bolder prediction of $150,000 for BTC, stating, “Investors are still looking at $150,000 as the next major price level to reach during this cycle. We remain optimistic that Bitcoin can continue, pending no sudden black swan events.” BTC crossed $110,000 on Thursday (July 3), reaching an intraday high of $110,583 before retreating to $109,637. It lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. The price recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday before rising nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $109,231. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 0.88% to $108,273. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered an increase of 3.51% and settled at $115,159. Price action remained bullish on Friday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose 1.50% and settled at $116,885, but not before reaching an intraday high of $118,287. The rally took a breather on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline. However, it resumed on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Monday, surging past $120,000 to reach $123,091. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level as traders began locking in their profits. As a result, the price settled at $119,714, ultimately rising 0.92%. The current session sees BTC down over 2%, trading around $116,912. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) declined sharply after crossing $3,000 on Monday, losing momentum after reaching a day high of $3,081. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is down over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $2,984 as it struggles to reclaim $3,000. With the broader market also declining, analysts believe a short-term correction is imminent. However, it remains to be seen whether ETH can maintain its position above $2,900 or register a deeper correction. ETH’s price action suggests it is entering a consolidation phase. However, a bounce could occur if the price manages to stay above $2,900, and we could see an attempt to reclaim $3,000. On the other hand, a break below this level could drive the price towards $2,700-$2,800. ETH reached an intraday high of $2,636 on Thursday (July 3) before settling at $2,592. Despite the positive sentiment, it lost momentum on Friday, dropping over 3% to $2,509.

2025-07-15T14:37:48,"BTC Volatility Hit Historic Lows as ETF Inflows Transformed Market Dynamics: Bybit & Block Scholes Monthly Report","BitcoinWorld BTC Volatility Hit Historic Lows as ETF Inflows Transformed Market Dynamics: Bybit & Block Scholes Monthly Report Dubai, United Arab Emirates, July 15th, 2025, Chainwire Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, released the latest monthly volatility report in collaboration with Block Scholes. The comprehensive analysis of June 2025 revealed that BTC had entered historically low volatility territories driven by significant spot ETF inflows. BTC’s implied volatility is dropping to just 28%, with realized volatility hitting levels not seen in nearly 20 months. Institutional investment, the report noted, is fundamentally reshaping BTC’s price behavior and creating a more stable trading environment, departing from its historical pattern through spot ETFs. The report covers trading data in June and is released as BTC momentarily touched a new all-time-high of $120K overnight. Key Insights: BTC Market Matures as Volatility Drops: BTC’s implied volatility has reached a remarkable milestone, reaching the lowest level since October 2023 and well below the significant 30% threshold. This dramatic decline continues a downward trend that began in 2020, reflecting growing asset maturity as BTC gains mainstream acceptance. The report shows that both implied and realized volatility have dropped simultaneously, with realized volatility hitting 22-25% at 20-month lows, creating exceptional calm that persists even amid broader macroeconomic turbulence. The “ETF Effect” Stabilized BTC Prices : The analysis reveals a clear correlation between the January 2024 launch of US spot BTC ETFs and the subsequent volatility decline, with ETF flows appearing to stabilize BTC’s price movements and create more frequent small, positive daily returns as institutional buyers help soften sell-offs and anchor demand. The data shows that 2025 has demonstrated a notable shift toward smaller, more positive daily price movements, indicating that institutional ETF buyers are providing consistent support during market downturns and creating a more stable price floor. This stabilization mechanism has resulted in fewer and milder volatility spikes compared to BTC’s pre-ETF era, fundamentally altering the cryptocurrency’s risk profile. ETH Volatility Remains High Despite ETF Launch : While BTC experiences historic stability, ETH has not followed the same pattern despite its own spot ETF launch in July 2024, with the ETH/BTC realized volatility ratio steadily climbing since July 2024 and ranging from 1.68 to 2.34 in June, indicating ETH continues to trade with significantly higher volatility than BTC. The divergence extends beyond ETH, with Solana showing even more pronounced volatility spikes – the SOL/BTC ratio hit 2.96 in June 2025, matching January’s high and representing levels not seen since January 2024. The report attributes this divergence to the relative strength of institutional demand, with BTC spot ETFs consistently representing a far larger share of total trading volume than ETH ETFs – before the 2024 US election, BTC ETF inflows were 36 times greater than ETH relative to their respective trade volumes. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitReport About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

2025-07-15T14:35:13,"GameStop bought Bitcoin to guard against inflation, not to copy MicroStrategy","GameStop boss Ryan Cohen said Tuesday on CNBC’s Squawk Box that the company’s recent crypto play is strictly about protecting itself from inflation, not trying to copy other firms. “I look at it as a hedge against inflation and global money printing, and we’ll see what happens,” Ryan said. The statement came days after GameStop bought 4,710 bitcoins, worth over $500 million, during a market rally that saw Bitcoin cross $120,000 for the first time. According to CNBC, Ryan was direct about not following the model of MicroStrategy, now called Strategy, which over the past few years spent billions loading up on Bitcoin to become the biggest corporate holder of it. Strategy’s decision sent its stock flying but also brought big volatility. Ryan said that GameStop isn’t interested in chasing the same outcome. “We have our own unique strategy, and we have a very strong balance sheet, over $9 billion of cash and marketable securities,” he told the network. Ryan Cohen says crypto buy isn’t about hype Ryan said the company will treat capital deployment the same way he treats his own money. “We will deploy that capital responsibly as I would my own capital,” he said. “And only look for opportunities where the downside is limited and there’s a lot of upside. We’ll be opportunistic when we see those opportunities.” The Bitcoin buy, according to him, is based on macroeconomic risks. He pointed to the fact that Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized structure make it useful as a store of value when fiat currencies keep getting devalued. He also made clear that this isn’t some new path into full-on crypto speculation. It’s part of a larger plan to keep GameStop stable as it fights through rough retail headwinds. Ryan took over during the meme-stock craze of 2020 and 2021 after buying a large stake and joining the board. He made his name building Chewy, the pet food company, and retail investors saw him as the guy who could bring GameStop into the e-commerce world. Over the past year, he’s been cutting costs, changing operations, and pulling GameStop away from its old hardware/software focus. The company is now leaning more into trading cards and collectibles, with Ryan confirming on Thursday at the company’s annual meeting that this is the new direction. “It’s a natural extension,” he said, noting that cards are embedded in physical retail and have “high margin potential.” Wall Street isn’t buying it, and revenue numbers back that up On Tuesday, the company posted weak results. Revenue in the first quarter fell 17% year over year to $732.4 million. The stock dropped 5% the next day. That dip came after the Bitcoin news and suggests that investors still aren’t convinced by the crypto angle, or by GameStop’s path forward in general. Shares are down 24% in 2025, after rising 79% last year. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter isn’t impressed. He stuck with his underperform rating, saying the company has always depended on hype and retail FOMO. He criticized the Bitcoin move, pointing out that GameStop is already trading at 2.4 times cash, and he doesn’t see how throwing more money into crypto will boost the premium. “Greater fools” is the phrase he used, accusing the company of depending on people who overpay for shares. Despite all that, Ryan isn’t shifting gears. He said trading cards are gaining fast and that GameStop’s collectibles revenue grew 54% year over year in Q1. That jump was mainly powered by Pokémon cards, which he sees as a core part of the business going forward. It’s not just kids either. Circana data shows 19% of adults bought Pokémon cards for themselves in the last six months. These aren’t just being used for play either; many are collecting them or decorating with them. Circana also said that grown-ups spent the most money on toys in Q1 compared to every other age group. GameStop is betting that trading cards and collectibles are where the real profits are now, not game consoles or physical disks. That movement is already underway, whether Wall Street wants to believe it or not.

2025-07-15T14:30:53,"Unraveling The Bitcoin Boom: Experts Decode Record $123,000 Surge","In a major display of bullish momentum, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), surged to a new record high on Monday, surpassing $123,000 for the first time. US House Kicks Off ‘Crypto Week The Bitcoin price climbed more than 90% year-to-date with Monday’s rally, reaching $123,200, and reflecting a nearly 15% increase over the past month. This upward momentum coincides with the US House of Representatives’ “crypto week,” which will feature debates on legislation aimed at reducing regulatory hurdles that have long been viewed as obstacles for the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23—Is It Too Far-Fetched? One of the key pieces of legislation set for discussion in the House is the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. Proponents of the GENIUS Act argue that it is a groundbreaking initiative that formalizes a critical aspect of the cryptocurrency industry. They believe it will enhance consumer protections, facilitate the entry of traditional financial institutions, and contribute to the growth of the digital currency market. Conversely, critics assert that the bill represents a “weak set of regulations” that may not adequately safeguard consumers or prevent illicit trading activities involving stablecoins. Growing Support For Crypto Regulation In addition to the GENIUS Act, the House will also debate measures to clarify the federal government’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies and proposals that could prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing its own digital currency. Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, remarked that this legislative push reflects a series of favorable developments for the crypto industry since President Donald Trump’s election in November. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has surged nearly 80%. As “crypto week” unfolds, Armour suggests it signals a continuation of supportive policies under the Trump administration. However, Trump’s involvement in the cryptocurrency space has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. For instance, his backing of World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, USD1, has led to significant investments in major exchanges like Binance, which critics say creates opportunities for Trump’s business to profit. Despite these concerns, Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and a White House spokesperson has stated that his financial assets are managed in a trust to avoid conflicts. Bitcoin ETFs Propel Price Surge The recent surge in Bitcoin prices has also been fueled by the US approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year. These investment vehicles have proven to be successful, with record-breaking amounts of capital moving into them. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst The overall asset value of Bitcoin ETFs has reached a record high of over $158 billion, driven by a wave of investments that included over a billion dollars flowing into these funds on consecutive days last week. Nikhil Bhatia, a finance professor at the University of Southern California, noted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has contributed significantly to institutional adoption of Bitcoin, signaling a return to a bullish market sentiment. As of this writing, BTC’s price has retraced back to the $117,000 level, 4.3% below its recently achieved all-time high.
