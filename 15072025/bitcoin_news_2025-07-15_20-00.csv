We'll see what happens,” Cohen said on CNBC's Squawk Box. GameStop invested more than half a billion dollars in late May by purchasing 4,710 Bitcoin. This move came just before Bitcoin reached all-time highs of over $120,000.

2025-07-15T17:50:04,"Bitcoin Leveraged Trading: James Wynn’s Audacious $18.43M Bet on Hyperliquid","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Leveraged Trading: James Wynn’s Audacious $18.43M Bet on Hyperliquid In the high-octane world of cryptocurrency trading, few names evoke as much intrigue and caution as James Wynn. Fresh off reported significant losses in June, Wynn has once again captivated the crypto community by opening an astonishing $18.43 million Bitcoin leveraged trading position . This audacious move, executed on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid, involves a staggering 40x leverage on Bitcoin (BTC). What drives such a high-stakes gamble, and what can we learn from a trader who consistently embraces extreme risk? Let’s dive deep into the details of this latest bold maneuver and explore the intricate dynamics of leveraged trading in the digital asset space. Unpacking James Wynn’s Audacious Bitcoin Leveraged Trading Bet The crypto market is no stranger to dramatic entries and exits, but James Wynn’s latest move stands out. According to on-chain tracker Onchain Lens on X, Wynn deposited a substantial $467,999 into Hyperliquid, a decentralized platform, to initiate this massive long position. With 40x leverage, this relatively modest initial capital controls a Bitcoin position worth $18.43 million. For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin leveraged trading amplifies both potential gains and losses. A 40x leverage means that for every 1% price movement in Bitcoin, the position’s value changes by 40%. While this can lead to exponential profits if the market moves favorably, it also means a small adverse price movement can quickly liquidate the entire position. Wynn’s strategy isn’t new; he’s known for his aggressive, high-risk approach. This isn’t his first foray into highly leveraged plays, nor is it his first time in the spotlight for significant financial outcomes, both positive and negative. His reported $100 million loss in June serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and unforgiving nature of such strategies. Yet, here he is again, doubling down with one of the most significant individual leveraged positions observed recently. The High-Stakes World of Crypto High Risk Strategies Why do traders like James Wynn engage in such crypto high risk strategies? The allure is simple: the potential for immense profits in a short timeframe. However, the reality is far more complex and often brutal. High leverage acts as a double-edged sword. It allows traders with limited capital to control large positions, maximizing their exposure to market movements. But this amplification works both ways. Liquidation Risk: At 40x leverage, even a minor price drop of 2.5% against the long position could wipe out the initial margin. This is known as liquidation, where the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are notorious for their price swings. These rapid fluctuations make high-leverage positions incredibly precarious. Emotional Toll: The pressure of managing such large, volatile positions can be immense, leading to impulsive decisions that further exacerbate losses. Wynn’s previous reported losses underscore the critical importance of risk management, even for seasoned traders. While his aggressive style might seem reckless to some, it highlights a segment of the crypto trading community that thrives on these extreme scenarios, seeking to capitalize on every market tremor. Why Hyperliquid Exchange for Such a Massive Position? The choice of platform for such a significant trade is also noteworthy. James Wynn opted for Hyperliquid exchange , a decentralized perpetual exchange. This choice reflects a growing trend among experienced crypto traders towards decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for their trading activities. What makes Hyperliquid an attractive venue for a trade of this magnitude? Decentralization: Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs) that hold user funds and control order books, Hyperliquid operates on a decentralized model. This means users retain custody of their assets, reducing counterparty risk. Transparency: Transactions on decentralized exchanges are recorded on a public blockchain, offering a high degree of transparency. This is how on-chain trackers like Onchain Lens can identify and report on such large positions. Liquidity and Fees: DeFi perpetuals have matured, offering competitive liquidity and often lower fees compared to some centralized counterparts, especially for high-volume traders. Permissionless Access: Decentralized platforms typically offer permissionless access, meaning anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can participate, without extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures often required by CEXs. Wynn’s decision to use Hyperliquid reinforces the platform’s reputation as a serious contender for professional traders seeking robust and transparent decentralized trading environments, even for high-leverage plays. Decoding the On-Chain Analysis Behind the Bet The public nature of blockchain transactions is a defining characteristic of the crypto space, enabling detailed on-chain analysis . In Wynn’s case, it was precisely this transparency that allowed Onchain Lens to identify and report on his $467,999 deposit and subsequent 40x leveraged Bitcoin long. On-chain data provides an unprecedented level of insight into market activity, often revealing the moves of large players, or “whales,” before they become widely known. For analysts, tracking such movements can offer clues about market sentiment and potential future price action. When a well-known trader, especially one with a history like Wynn’s, takes such a large position, it inevitably sparks discussion and speculation. While not a guarantee of success, observing these high-profile trades can provide a fascinating look into the conviction (or speculative nature) of market participants. However, it’s crucial to remember that on-chain data alone doesn’t tell the whole story. The reasons behind a trade, the trader’s overall portfolio, and their risk management strategies (if any) remain largely private. What we see is merely the transaction itself, open for public interpretation. What Does This Mean for James Wynn Crypto’s Future? James Wynn’s consistent presence in the headlines, whether for massive gains or significant losses, positions him as a fascinating figure in the crypto landscape. His latest James Wynn crypto maneuver raises questions about his long-term strategy and resilience. Is this a calculated risk based on deep market conviction, or another chapter in a series of high-stakes gambles? For the broader crypto community, Wynn’s actions serve as a powerful case study: The Power of Leverage: It demonstrates the incredible capital efficiency leverage offers, allowing small sums to control vast positions. The Perils of Leverage: Simultaneously, it highlights the extreme fragility of such positions and the potential for rapid capital erosion. The Role of On-Chain Data: It showcases how transparent blockchain data empowers a new generation of market observers and analysts. Ultimately, the outcome of Wynn’s $18.43 million Bitcoin long position remains to be seen. It will undoubtedly be closely watched by many, serving as a real-time example of the exhilarating highs and devastating lows that define the world of high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. While such strategies are not for everyone, understanding them is key to comprehending the full spectrum of activities within the dynamic crypto market. Conclusion: The Unfolding Drama of High-Stakes Crypto Trading James Wynn’s $18.43 million 40x leveraged Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid is more than just a trade; it’s a testament to the audacious spirit and inherent risks that define the cryptocurrency market. From his reported past losses to his current high-stakes gamble, Wynn embodies the relentless pursuit of alpha that characterizes a segment of crypto traders. This move not only puts his capital on the line but also shines a spotlight on the capabilities of decentralized exchanges and the invaluable insights offered by on-chain analysis. As the crypto world watches, this position serves as a potent reminder that while opportunities for significant gains exist, they often come hand-in-hand with equally significant risks. It’s a thrilling, perilous dance on the edge of market volatility, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye.

Jacquelyn Melinek, founder of Token Relations, drew attention to this scaling adjustment on the Bloomberg Terminal, which now shows Bitcoin’s spot price (XBT) at $0.118M, corresponding to the $118,000 level the asset achieved on July 10. Source: @jacqmelinek on X Following this adjustment, Bitcoin has shattered multiple resistance levels , initially breaching the significant $120,000 threshold before establishing a new all-time high of $123,000 the following day. These developments have reignited the debates about whether Wall Street is positioning itself for a massive bull market cycle. Wall Street Veterans Eye Seven-Figure Bitcoin Targets In May, while Bitcoin consolidated around $103,000, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood informed CNBC that Bitcoin is destined for “$1.5 million” due to its increasing market share capture from gold.

Since her statement, Bitcoin has added $20,000 to its valuation, enabling it to surpass Amazon as the world’s fifth most valuable asset , trailing only Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and gold. This performance has convinced numerous investors and billionaires that Bloomberg’s million-scale formatting for Bitcoin will eventually display a value of $1 million. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis – Where is BTC Heading Next? Bitcoin (BTC) is holding strong near $117,000 after a powerful breakout, with momentum still favoring the bulls. If current support around $115,000 holds, BTC could be gearing up for another leg higher toward $123,000 and potentially $125,000 in the short term. The recent dip has helped reset the RSI from overbought levels, creating room for another push up. With bullish structure still intact and volume remaining elevated, Bitcoin looks primed for continuation. As long as the price stays within the current rising channel, the path of least resistance remains upward in what could be the start of a larger rally. New Layer-2 Opportunity Gaining Steam as Bitcoin Rallies As Bitcoin continues to climb, many investors are starting to look beyond BTC and into presales, which can far outperform well-established coins.

For those looking to get in early on the next big thing, HYPER is shaping up to be a strong contender. Smart investors and retail traders alike are starting to take notice, with many calling HYPER one of the most promising early-stage projects right now.

2025-07-15T17:20:04,"Nextdoor App Unveils Transformative AI Recommendations and Critical Real-Time Alerts","BitcoinWorld Nextdoor App Unveils Transformative AI Recommendations and Critical Real-Time Alerts In an era where digital trust and hyper-local information are paramount, the Nextdoor app is embarking on a significant transformation. Moving beyond its traditional role as a simple forum for neighborhood chatter, the platform is launching a comprehensive redesign aimed at becoming a more indispensable utility for communities. This ambitious overhaul introduces cutting-edge AI, direct integration of local news, and critical real-time emergency alerts, signaling a strategic pivot towards a more structured, helpful, and timely user experience. For those accustomed to the rapid evolution of digital platforms, Nextdoor’s bold move underscores the growing demand for reliable, accessible information at the local level. Revolutionizing Local Discovery with AI Recommendations One of the most exciting additions to the new Nextdoor experience is ‘Faves,’ an innovative feature powered by artificial intelligence designed to help users discover the best local businesses and hidden gems. Imagine needing a reliable plumber or the perfect family-friendly restaurant, and instead of sifting through generic search results, you get tailored suggestions based on years of genuine neighbor conversations. This is precisely what Faves aims to deliver. Powered by Hyperlocal AI: Nextdoor boasts an LLM (Large Language Model) specifically trained on 15 years of neighbor-generated content. This proprietary dataset allows the AI to understand and answer questions with a truly local context, a capability currently unmatched by broader platforms like Google or ChatGPT. Curated Suggestions: Users can ask specific questions, such as, “What is the best place to hike with kids?” and receive quick, summarized responses. These summaries are directly linked to the original posts from real users, ensuring transparency and trust. Proprietary Data Advantage: Nextdoor CEO and co-founder Nirav Tolia emphasized that this content is unique to Nextdoor, unindexed by external search engines. This positions the Nextdoor app as the go-to source for the kind of invaluable word-of-mouth information that defines local life – from finding a child’s lemonade stand to discovering a beloved, quirky local shop. Bringing Hyperlocal Local News to Your Doorstep To enhance the quality and quantity of information available, Nextdoor is integrating professional journalism directly into the app. This marks a significant shift from relying solely on user-generated content, acknowledging the importance of verified, timely reporting for a truly informed community. Nextdoor has forged partnerships with 3,500 local publications across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, including notable names like the San Francisco Standard, The London Standard, and The Toronto Star. This collaboration is designed to be mutually beneficial, as Nirav Tolia explained to Bitcoin World: “The reason that this is so important for us is historically, Nextdoor has relied 100% on user-generated content, just the content that’s created by your neighbors. That’s been a great source of information. But, to really make sure if it’s happening in your neighborhood, we need to bring in local news as well. So this is the first time we’re letting third party publishers use our distribution.” The agreements are non-commercial; Nextdoor doesn’t pay for the content, nor do publishers pay Nextdoor. The app simply displays a headline, a snippet, and an image, directing traffic to the publishers’ websites. This ensures that users have access to reliable local reporting while supporting local journalism. A dedicated section under each post will allow neighbors to discuss the news, fostering community dialogue around relevant local events. Critical Safety with Real-Time Alerts In moments of crisis, timely information can be life-saving. The redesigned Nextdoor app introduces a robust real-time alert system for events like severe weather, traffic incidents, power outages, storms, and wildfires. These alerts are displayed on a dynamic neighborhood map, enabling neighbors to engage in immediate conversations about safety and preparedness. To power these crucial updates, Nextdoor has partnered with Samdesk and Weather.com (including The Weather Channel app). Tolia detailed the alert system’s urgency levels: Yellow State: For important, attention-worthy events, alerts appear prominently at the top of the app. Red State: For critical, life-threatening situations, the alert takes over the entire app screen, ensuring immediate attention. As Tolia emphasized, “at that point, you don’t care about the conversations neighbors are having about pickleball. You don’t really care about the new restaurant review that the local publishers put in. You need to get together with your neighbors and help save each other’s lives in some cases.” What truly sets Nextdoor’s alerts apart is their hyper-localization. Built on a geospatial platform, the app can personalize alerts down to an individual house. Unlike broad Amber Alerts, if a power outage affects only a specific block, only residents on that block will receive the notification, minimizing unnecessary alerts and maximizing relevance. Beyond a Neighborhood Social Network: A Utility-Centric Future For years, Nextdoor has served as a popular, albeit sometimes controversial, platform for neighborhood interactions. While it excelled at connecting people for recommendations or lost pets, it also faced challenges with misinformation and instances of racism, leading to stalled growth and declining engagement. With this significant redesign, Nextdoor is determined to turn the tide, repositioning itself from merely a neighborhood social network to an essential, utility-centric service. The company’s focus is squarely on increasing the quality and quantity of local information. By integrating professional news and hyper-localized alerts, Nextdoor aims to provide a more valuable and reliable resource. This shift is not just about new features; it’s about a fundamental change in philosophy – making the platform more helpful, useful, and timely for everyday life. Looking ahead, Nextdoor plans to further expand its content ecosystem. Tolia noted that publishers are just the first step; in the future, the platform intends to allow small businesses, schools, and various organizations to establish native presences within the app, creating an even richer tapestry of local information and services. The Vision from the Top: CEO Nirav Tolia’s Insights Nirav Tolia’s vision for the “new Nextdoor” is clear: to digitize and capture the invaluable essence of local word-of-mouth. He firmly believes that the kind of hyperlocal information available on Nextdoor is simply not found on global platforms. “I give the funny example of, if you wanted to know all the lemonade stands that kids are operating in your neighborhood, you can’t go to Google Maps and find that,” Tolia remarked. “You can’t go to ChatGPT and ask that question, right? The only way is for you to ask your neighbors. And so that’s what Nextdoor is all about.” This renewed commitment to being truly hyperlocal, combined with sophisticated AI recommendations and vital real-time alerts , is set to redefine the platform’s utility. By blending neighbor-generated insights with professional content and critical safety tools, Nextdoor is striving to be less of a casual social network and more of an indispensable tool for community life, ensuring that when something important happens in your neighborhood, you’re the first to know. The redesign of the Nextdoor app represents a pivotal moment for the platform. By embracing advanced AI, integrating trusted local news, and delivering critical real-time alerts, Nextdoor is not just updating its interface; it’s fundamentally reshaping its purpose. This transformation aims to solve past challenges of misinformation and declining engagement by offering unparalleled utility and hyper-local relevance. As communities increasingly seek reliable information and stronger connections, Nextdoor’s strategic pivot positions it as an essential digital companion for modern neighborhood life, promising a more informed, safer, and connected future for its users.

2025-07-15T17:18:10,"Why This Week Is Crucial For Cryptocurrencies: Here’s All The Bills Being Introduced In The U.S., Their Potential Impact, And All You Need To Know","Washington, the capital of the United States, is witnessing a historic period for the cryptocurrency sector this week. During this period, dubbed “Crypto Week,” two important bills to be voted on in the House of Representatives could pave the way for the establishment of a long-awaited legal framework for digital assets. GENIUS Act: Stablecoins The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, will be voted on Thursday in the House of Representatives. If passed, it would mark the first time in US history that independent cryptocurrency regulation has been enacted. The Trump administration supports this process. The House of Representatives, having abandoned the previous version, took up the new version after President Donald Trump called on Truth Social, “No delays, no addendums, bring it to my desk now.” CLARITY: The Status of Cryptocurrencies However, the industry's biggest hope lies in the CLARITY Act, a bill that would clarify whether digital assets are securities or commodities. This bill aims to clearly divide regulatory powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday and is expected to pass after passing committees with bipartisan support. However, its progress in the Senate is less clear. Democrats are wary of the bill due to the Trump family's crypto investments. Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, despite supporting the GENIUS Act, stating that “Trump’s crypto corruption is corrupting the digital asset market,” did not show the same commitment to CLARITY. Coinbase, aiming to boost support for the CLARITY Act, distributed nearly 5,000 chocolate bars across Washington to highlight the law's importance. The company noted on the packaging that nearly one-fifth of Americans own crypto, according to a Morning Consult poll. Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Coinbase, Ripple, and other crypto companies are urging members of Congress to support them, arguing that a clearer regulatory framework would boost investor confidence. “Consumers want to know what they're getting into when they buy and sell these assets and that they're using a trusted intermediary,” said Kara Calvert, Coinbase's Vice President of U.S. Public Policy. The Senate is preparing to introduce its own market structure regulation this month, which will differ from the House version. Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are working on the legislation, while Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand plans to support it with a bipartisan approach. “We have a lot of work to do, and we will be working in a bipartisan manner over the next month,” Gillibrand told CNBC. Bill to Ban CBDC Another key item for the crypto industry is a separate bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing digital dollars (CBDCs).This bill is also expected to be passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger expressed support for the bill, saying, “If this is something the private sector should be doing, the government should not be the competitor.” *This is not investment advice.

Over 1 billion SHIB tokens were burned last week in a 2,080% spike as retail liquidity flows back into meme coins . This renewed momentum has pushed SHIB to a 20% monthly gain, surpassing BTC’s 13%.

Markets are now pricing in “Crypto Week,” a key regulatory event , as the CLARITY Act market structure bill, GENIUS Act stablecoin bill, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act face the U.S. House. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Is the Stage Set for $1 While a $1 Shiba Inu price remains speculative, the token’s increasingly bullish fundamentals add weight to the long-term case. The recent launch of DegenSafe, SHIB’s response to Solana’s meme coin launchpads, and ongoing token burns could lift prices through increased adoption and scarcity. Even without these catalysts fully priced in, the technical setup still points higher, backed by a developing six-month double bottom pattern. SHIB / USDT 1-week chart, double bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Since its second bottom in mid-June, the Shiba Inu price has pushed steadily toward a breakout above the neckline at $0.0000177. Momentum indicators continue to support the move. The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory in the 30s, climbing toward neutral as buying pressure returns. More so, the MACD line continues to widen its lead over the signal line after a short-lived death cross, signaling underlying strength and a potential longer-term uptrend. If the double bottom plays out, SHIB could see a 93% surge, targeting a higher resistance zone stretching back to early January at $0.000025. However, its full potential hinges on a successful break above its neckline. Still, that move hinges on a clean break above the neckline. Until then, $0.000012 remains the key support to watch. Losing it risks a third bottom at $0.00001, invalidating the setup. SHIB Might Not Be The Best Meme Coin Narrative to Follow The truth is, SHIB has been in the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives. On the speculative meme coin scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins,” the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come. Millions of gamble coins will come and go. But only a handful of MISSION COINS will WIN. pic.twitter.com/rxsVfeux8A — Murad (@MustStopMurad) July 8, 2025 Token6900 ($T6900) is the latest chapter in that saga: no promises, no utility—you are the utility.

2025-07-15T17:08:55,"The Real Narrative Behind Bitcoin That You Need To Know","Summary Bitcoin's price is driven by institutionalization and regulation. Not safe-haven demand, making it more akin to the S&P 500 than gold. Key catalysts include regulatory moves like the Genius Act and political dynamics undermining monetary policy credibility. In my opinion, we can talk about institutionalization, until proven otherwise, as an “anti‑liberalization” of Bitcoin. But this certainly doesn’t mean less demand. But watch out for traps. With increasing overextension, the attractiveness of taking a position could decrease compared to ""alts"". Bitcoin does not follow macroeconomics, but above all, it is not a safe-haven asset . At least not right now. What drives the price of Bitcoin is not fear but rather a de- liberalization , or better said, a phase of institutionalization/regulation that could be truly epochal. Here’s my opinion: we must not make the mistake of treating it like gold; perhaps we should make the effort to treat it more like the S&P 500 . And now that the market has flipped the risk‑on switch, my attention once again turns to Bitcoin. And not only that . But first, let me share with you… My bullish view on BTC It diverges from the idea that a weak dollar and expectations of a rate cut are a panacea for BTC demand. I prefer to identify two other catalysts: institutionalization and monetary instability. Simply, two threads: The “fight” between President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell The Genius Act Not tariffs: I consider it too simplistic to say that Bitcoin demand increases because of the instability generated by tariffs. It would be like supporting the classic dynamic “bitcoin = safe asset haven,” which we have seen does not match real danger situations. For those who still embrace Bitcoin today as a challenger to the modern monetary system, I think following the two narrative threads I have identified is more consistent. The two catalysts to remember Simply put, the fact that President Donald Trump directly steps in to undermine Powell , and by doing so influences monetary policy decisions, is an important historical inconsistency. For Bitcoin, it’s as if its fiercest enemy were saying, “Hey, you were right, we’re not that efficient.” Of course, this part of my analysis is more storytelling than data‑driven analysis, but I can’t help finding in it a very theatrical, fascinating narrative. Especially when I frame the story with the stablecoin regulation process, defined as the Genius Act, here, I find a logical reason in the weakness of the dollar, but also in Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC , and coming back to us, the introduction of a new monetary system. Therefore, both the Genius Act, the Clarity Act (regulatory framework for crypto), and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance State Act . In one word: institutionalization. Makes you think, doesn’t it? A bullish phase, because it increases demand, but not so close to the “liberal” concept of Bitcoin from 2010, even though that propaganda is still very much alive among supporters, but let’s see if between this narrative and the data there is actually a formal correlation. In numbers: If I look for signs of institutionalization, first of all, I look at the flows in the USA spot Bitcoin ETFs, and I notice that they have over $138 billion in AUM. Not really a typical feature of a market with less than 3 years of experience. IBIT: Example of AUM of the most capitalized ETF (Seeking Alpha) Another sign of institutionalization? The volatility, hasn't anyone noticed a drop in Bitcoin’s volatility? How many remember 2021, when you woke up in the morning and realized that during the night the portfolio had registered a positive fluctuation of 10% and then maybe a negative of 15%? Well, the 30-day rolling volatility drops to 35% , while before 2022, it was over 100%. IBIT – Example of how volatility has halved compared to the average (Seeking Alpha) But do you know what confirms to me that the bullish movement is driven by this (allow me the term) artificial process? The comparison with a real safe asset heaven: Bitcoin has a trend substantially disconnected from gold , which actually is ONLY a safe asset heaven, even if the dollar is falling. But what does this discrepancy really mean? In essence, the market is not looking for protection but for risk . Data by YCharts And if Bitcoin is in demand, it means that it is treated more like an S&P 500 , a signal of the fact that it follows “earnings-driven” narratives, even if naturally it has no earnings, but more similar to the accumulation methodologies of institutions. Data by YCharts Risk: “Yes, alright, it may make sense, so will it keep growing endlessly?” In the end, that’s what we really want to know. Let’s look at some numbers: of Bitcoin traders, 86% are in profit, 13% at break‑even , and only 1% in loss. Simply put, if we’re at ATH, how is it possible that 13% are at breakeven? Here’s the point: after all these words, I’ve come to this to tell you that this piece of information can be read by many in a contrarian sense. It basically shows there are a lot of buyers at the highs, which becomes even more worrying if you consider a Large Transactions Volume of $164.28B : clearly a sign of euphoria but also of strong hands intervening, who tend to play on these retail imbalances. (Of course, this is my personal opinion.) IBIT (Seeking Alpha) Well, it’s a risk, especially considering that this is the first year Bitcoin’s price is below the stock‑to‑flow level at 463 days in the yellow range of the post‑halving day distribution. It’s anomalous. Bear market... or alt season If you got scared, know that this is not enough for me to call a downgrade on Bitcoin. Because the narrative is still promising, in my opinion. Rather, this seems to me like a typical phase of an alt season, that is, a market phase in which very positive idiosyncratic drivers develop for smaller cryptocurrencies. Data by YCharts In other words, it is statistically likely that, with Bitcoin already in an upper‑extreme zone, the market could shift part of its resources toward alternative assets, potentially those that have been “left behind,” and of course, ETH immediately comes to mind, and I’ve talked about it here as well. An element that, in fact, would remain close to the institutionalized narrative, considering the launch of ETFs. Conclusion To conclude, I remain close to the bullish narrative on BTC, while keeping an eye on the imbalance in the distribution of demand and supply, which could generate short‑term volatility, such as a fake breakout above the highs. In this sense, I look favorably on alternatives, and I think the market will too. In particular, ETH.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801408-real-narrative-behind-bitcoin-you-need-to-know?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION|FIAT","IBIT|BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T17:07:19,"Bitcoin’s New ATH Isn’t Just a Number: It’s a Statement, Says Bitfinex Alpha","BTC has officially broken past its previous ceiling, setting a new all-time high and reigniting bullish momentum across the market. But this isn’t just another milestone in a volatile chart; it’s a powerful statement about Bitcoin’s growing role in global finance. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , the recent rally is being driven by a unique combination of factors: aggressive ETF demand, grassroots accumulation, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Together, they paint a picture of Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic hedge with staying power. BTC climbed to a record high of $123,120 on Monday, ending months of sideways movement and marking a 65% rebound from its April low. The move not only reverses losses from earlier this year but also signals a fundamental shift in how Bitcoin is positioned in global markets. The Bitfinex report links the surge to renewed buying activity from short-term holders. Analysts view this trend as a reflection of Bitcoin’s growing resilience in uncertain conditions, particularly in comparison to traditional assets such as gold and stocks. ETF Inflows and Retail Demand Tighten Bitcoin Supply Following its new all-time high, Bitcoin briefly became the fifth most valuable asset globally, with a market capitalization of almost $2.5 trillion, before it slipped back to sixth position after today’s correction. Demand from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs remains intense, with over $2.7 billion in inflows last week alone, far exceeding the number of new BTC mined during the same period. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s IBIT ETF , which has now crossed $80 billion in assets under management, reaching the milestone faster than any ETF in history. At the same time, retail investors with smaller wallets (wallets holding less than 100 BTC) are accumulating aggressively. According to Bitfinex, this grassroots demand is now outpacing new Bitcoin issuance, further tightening supply and adding to the pressure on prices. This wave of institutional and retail interest reflects more than just market speculation. With increasing participation from large asset managers and government-linked entities, Bitcoin is steadily cementing its place in financial planning and macroeconomic strategy. Bitcoin’s Rise Mirrors Cracks in the U.S. Economy The Bitfinex report also highlights growing signs of stress within the U.S. economy, a crucial backdrop for Bitcoin’s rise. Continuing unemployment claims are on the rise, especially in lower-wage sectors, suggesting that labor market weakness may be quietly building beneath headline stability. Households are feeling the strain from rising living costs, elevated credit card rates, and geopolitical instability. While some sentiment surveys remain optimistic, the persistence of high borrowing costs and essential expenses continues to test household resilience. Meanwhile, small businesses, often the first to feel the impact of macroeconomic tremors, are reporting weaker sales, hiring difficulties, and tighter margins. Business investment is also slowing, suggesting that confidence in long-term growth is fading on Main Street. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s new all-time high carries symbolic weight. It signals not just strength in the market but a shift in how investors, institutions, and individuals alike are preparing for an increasingly uncertain global economy .

2025-07-15T17:00:42,"Can Ethereum Replace Bitcoin? Bitwise CEO Reveals What ETH Can Do","The long-standing debate over whether Ethereum (ETH) can one day replace Bitcoin (BTC) has taken a new turn, as Hunter Horsley, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Bitwise, offers a fresh perspective on the matter. Rather than framing Ethereum as a direct challenger to BTC, Horsley suggests that its true value lies in competing with traditional tech and financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, this view could influence how investors and developers assess cryptocurrencies by focusing less on price rankings and more on real-world utility . Ethereum’s Value Goes Beyond Bitcoin Rivalry According to Horsley, the question of whether Ethereum can completely supersede Bitcoin may overlook a larger narrative. In a recent statement on X social media, the Bitwise CEO emphasized that ETH is not in direct competition with BTC at all. Instead, the real battle is unfolding in an entirely different arena, targeting legacy financial software and Web2 systems . Horsley explains that the perception that all cryptocurrencies are just variations of each other based on market capitalization is quickly becoming outdated. He forecasts that within the next 6-12 months, the crypto industry will move away from the “CoinMarketCap mindset”, which is the idea that all crypto assets are interchangeable and only differ by size. Instead, he believes the focus will shift toward understanding what makes each blockchain unique. For reference purposes, the crypto CEO drew a comparison to mobile applications, noting that while they may share the same operating system, each app serves a unique purpose. Similarly, different blockchains , including Ethereum, are built on related technologies but are designed to solve vastly different problems . While Bitcoin remains dominant in its role as a decentralized, non-sovereign form of money and a digital store of value , ETH is carving out a position as an open platform for programmable finance, dApps, and tokenized services. This view implies that Ethereum provides functionality that stretches far beyond the boundaries of money, shifting its primary challenge toward outdated legacy systems rather than Bitcoin. Overall, Horsley’s evolving perspective suggests that the crypto space is moving into a more mature phase, where blockchains may no longer be viewed through a narrow lens of rankings and price movements , but through their actual purpose, functionality, and long-term potential. ETH Tipped To Lead Future Of Crypto A prominent market analyst on X, identified as ‘Crypto Xlarge’, has suggested that while Bitcoin sparked the crypto revolution, ETH is poised to carry it into the next era of technological transformation. In his post, the expert described the Ethereum blockchain as a foundational technology layer for the digital future, suggesting that its role extends far beyond that of a typical cryptocurrency. The analyst noted that Ethereum is positioned as the core next-generation infrastructure supporting a wide range of decentralized technologies, including Web3, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) , Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications . Furthermore, he drew comparisons between Ethereum’s current stage and Bitcoin’s in 2013, seemingly implying that ETH may be at a similar inflection point where early adoption could yield significant returns.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/can-ethereum-replace-bitcoin/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE","Ethereum|AI|artificial intelligence|Bitwise|Coinmarketcap|Crypto Xlarge|daos|Decentralized Autonomous Organizations|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Blockchain|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Hunter Horsley|NFT|Non Fungible Tokens",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T17:00:17,"Bitcoin Bears Strike Back After ATH: Long/Short Ratio Flips Negative","Bitcoin is undergoing a slight retrace after hitting a new all-time high of $123,000 on Monday. While the broader trend remains bullish, short-term sentiment has shifted as selling pressure begins to build. Bulls are now defending key support levels, with the $117,000 zone emerging as a critical line that could determine whether the uptrend holds or deeper corrections follow. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Locked Hits New ATH: Smart Money Bets On Long-Term Growth The pullback has introduced fresh uncertainty into the market. According to new data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin Futures Position Dominance has started to lean bearish, suggesting that short positions are gaining momentum across major derivatives platforms. This shift reflects growing caution among traders, particularly as long-to-short ratios weaken and funding rates normalize after weeks of elevated bullish activity. Although Bitcoin remains far above its 2024 highs and the macro structure still favors bulls, the current pause is being closely watched. Investors are looking for confirmation that the recent all-time high was not a local top. With fear slowly creeping in and derivatives data flashing early warning signs, the coming days could be pivotal. Whether bulls can hold the line—or whether bears take control—will likely set the tone for Bitcoin’s next major move. Bitcoin Retraces As Bearish Sentiment Rises Bitcoin has pulled back more than 5% since reaching its all-time high of $123,000 earlier this week, with current price action testing the strength of short-term support levels. While retracements are common after major breakouts, some analysts note that Bitcoin’s decline has been sharper than that of Ethereum and many altcoins, which have either held their ground or continued to climb. Top analyst Axel Adler pointed out a significant shift in sentiment following the ATH. According to his insights, bears began aggressively shorting immediately after the price peak, leading to a sharp drop in bullish dominance. Most notably, the long-to-short ratio flipped into negative territory for the first time in weeks, signaling a clear rise in short interest across derivatives platforms. This pivot in positioning reflects growing caution among traders and raises the stakes for bulls. The $117,000 level is now seen as a key support zone—if Bitcoin fails to hold above it, a deeper correction could follow, potentially dragging the broader market down with it. The timing is especially critical. This week, the US Congress kicks off “Crypto Week,” a series of discussions and potential votes on important legislation that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets. The outcome of these debates may act as a catalyst for renewed bullish momentum—or deepen the correction if uncertainty dominates. As markets brace for clarity, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s ability to defend $117K and reclaim its short-term trend.

BTC Pulls Back: $114K–$117K Key Zone to Watch The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin retracing sharply after reaching an all-time high of $123,200 earlier this week. Currently trading at $116,900, BTC has dropped over 5% from its recent peak, marking its first significant correction since the breakout above $109,300. This pullback brings Bitcoin back toward the $114,000–$117,000 zone, which now acts as short-term support. This area coincides with the rising 50-period simple moving average (SMA) at $114,466 and is closely aligned with the previous breakout structure. A successful retest of this level could provide the foundation for a new leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm However, failure to hold this zone could open the door for a deeper correction toward the $109,300 support level, which served as a multi-week resistance throughout May and June. The bearish momentum on the latest candles, combined with high sell volume, reflects rising short-term uncertainty. Despite this, Bitcoin remains above all major moving averages on this timeframe (50, 100, and 200 SMAs), indicating that the broader trend is still intact.

2025-07-15T16:59:31,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Binance Announce New Pump.fun Style Meme Coin Launchpad","Pump.fun’s recent token launch became one of the biggest stories in crypto, pulling in over $600 million in just 12 minutes. It showed how strong the appetite has become for meme coins, where speed and community drive the action. Now Binance is stepping in with its own version of a token launch system. Although inspired by the bonding curve model seen on Pump.fun, Binance’s approach works differently, adding an approval process for projects wanting to participate. This move comes at a time when attention is gradually moving from large-cap tokens toward smaller altcoins and meme coins, as fresh capital looks for new ground. Binance’s entry suggests it wants to play an active role as this next chapter of the market opens. Binance’s New Approach to Meme Coin Launches Binance’s recently announced token generation event system marks an interesting development in how meme coins and new projects come to market. The bonding curve mechanism allows token prices to adjust gradually as demand rises, rewarding early participants with lower prices and ensuring liquidity builds naturally. But where Pump.fun allows nearly anyone to create tokens, Binance has set up a process where projects must apply, adding a filter to what reaches the platform. Since early 2024, Pump.fun has seen over 11 million tokens created, driven largely by viral momentum and fast-paced experimentation. Binance, by contrast, seems focused on channeling that same excitement into something more stable, giving users the thrill of early access but within a more structured environment. We’re proud to join @binance & @binancewallet in reshaping token launches through the new Bonding Curve TGE model - powered by @four_meme_ The first launch drops tomorrow. Get ready. 👀 https://t.co/f0Isj7Z7td — Four.Meme (@four_meme_) July 14, 2025 The collaboration with Four.meme, known for its work on the BNB Chain, marks the start of this rollout, with the possibility of expanding to other blockchains later. As more capital flows out of Bitcoin and Ethereum into smaller speculative assets, Binance may be positioning itself to capture that development by offering a curated launch experience. This could help meme coins reach a wider audience while giving Binance’s user base access to early-stage opportunitie s, all within a platform they already trust. Investors seem to already be interested in the model and also seem to speculate this move as Binance's next step to push meme coins as the bull run finally starts running its usual course and funds flow from top altcoins to smaller projects with high community support and potential.

As funds continue shifting away from blue-chip coins into smaller tokens with personality and energy, Token6900 is well placed to benefit. It reflects a larger trend where crypto investors are looking for more than just price action; they want a sense of belonging, participation, and shared identity. For anyone exploring the meme coin space, Token 6900 offers a combination of humor, activity, and real features that set it apart and give it the potential to keep growing. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 network designed to bring more speed, scalability, and utility to Bitcoin without sacrificing its foundation. While Bitcoin has long been seen as a store of value, Bitcoin Hyper expands its role by allowing smart contracts, decentralized applications, and cross-chain interactions. This opens up an entirely new space where not only financial tools but also meme coins and experimental projects can thrive on Bitcoin’s backbone. For developers, it creates an environment to launch creative tokens without facing the high costs or slower speeds usually tied to the main Bitcoin network. What makes Bitcoin Hyper especially relevant now is how it aligns with the current market environment. As funds begin flowing from major tokens into smaller, community-focused projects, networks like Bitcoin Hyper stand ready to host this new wave. The technical framework supports everything from rapid settlements to staking pools, giving both builders and users the flexibility they need. At present, Bitcoin Hyper has managed to be featured and endorsed by multiple top crypto content creators, like Cilinix Crypto and many others. With platforms like Binance introducing new token launch models, the idea of bringing meme coins and experimental tokens to major chains has become more widely accepted. Bitcoin Hyper fits naturally into this shift, providing a way to combine Bitcoin’s reputation with the creativity and fast pace of the altcoin and meme coin scene. For traders and communities looking for a place where innovation meets strong fundamentals, Bitcoin Hyper offers a compelling option. It reflects the evolving crypto space, where even Bitcoin is no longer just about holding value but about building, experimenting, and connecting across ecosystems in ways that were once out of reach. Conclusion As funds gradually move from larger coins into lesser-known projects, the focus is turning to tokens that combine practical use with strong community backing. This is not just about short-term moves, but about identifying projects that offer real tools, access to early-stage growth, or meaningful engagement for holders. In this environment, the projects discussed above stand out as worth considering. They reflect the kinds of efforts that are not just following passing trends but are building features and connections that can carry them through the ups and downs of the market. For traders and holders alike, keeping an eye on these kinds of projects could prove worthwhile in the weeks ahead. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-15T16:55:26,"Falling US Dollar Could Trigger ‘Full Bubble Cycle’ in Risk Assets, According to Ex-Goldman Sachs Exec Raoul Pal","Macroeconomics expert Raoul Pal says risk assets could witness massive eruptions if the US dollar continues to weaken. In a new video, Pal tells his 242,000 YouTube subscribers that if the US dollar index (DXY) falls further amid an improving business cycle, risk assets such as stocks and crypto could experience an extended bullish phase. “So what happens is when the business cycle picks up, there’s more disposable income and businesses have more investment income and that gets driven out of the risk curve always… And I think the inverse to the business cycle being so low for so long will be the flip side of the cycle will be longer than people expected because we’ve got this slight dislocation still working through post-Covid that then extends the business cycle… But if financial conditions keep moving, if they really have done some sort of Mar-a-Lago Accord, and they get the dollar [DXY] below 90. Okay, then we’re going on further and yeah, maybe it’s a full bubble cycle then.” The DXY, a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of six other leading currencies from major economies, is currently at 98. Pal further says an increase in global liquidity could also act as a bullish catalyst for asset prices amid high government debt levels. “Just using the liquidity framework, the business cycle framework, the financial conditions framework, it’s all suggesting that the probability is because they need to roll the debt, they’re going to have to increase more liquidity, and this is just going to drive assets up strongly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-15T16:43:20,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Slides Below $120,000 After Record Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) registered a significant decline on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency surged to record levels. BTC raced past $123,000 on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $123,097 before declining to settle at $119,714. Analysts believe BTC’ s rally is far from over, with predictions coming thick and fast. Most analysts believe the price could reach $135,000 before a market correction sets in. Strategy Resumes Bitcoin Shopping, Purchases 4,225 BTC For $472 Million Michael Saylor’s Strategy has resumed its weekly Bitcoin purchases, acquiring 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per coin. The latest purchase takes Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 601,550 BTC , worth over $73 billion at current prices, at an average cost of $71,268 per Bitcoin for a total cost of $42.9 billion. The company holds nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply and is sitting on almost $30 billion of paper gains. Strategy funded its latest acquisition from at-the-money (ATM) sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual Strike preferred stock, STRK, perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF, and perpetual Stride preferred stock, STRD. The company sold 797,008 MSTR shares for $330.9 million. $17.78 billion worth of MSTR shares remain available for issuance and sale as of July 13. The firm also sold 573,976 STRK shares for $71.1 million, and has $20.45 billion worth of STRK shares remaining available for sale and issuance under that program. Strategy also sold 444,005 STRF shares for $55.3 million, and has $1.88 billion remaining. Lastly, it sold 158,278 STRD shares for $15 million, with $4.19 billion available for sale and issuance. Standard Chartered Launches Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) Spot Trading Standard Chartered is allowing its institutional clients to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) through its UK branch. Financial institutions have reported a substantial jump in demand for crypto products from clients as BTC surges to record levels. The decision allows institutional investors, corporates, and asset managers to conduct spot crypto trading using the bank’s existing platforms. Standard Chartered already offers several crypto products, including trading services via two subsidiary companies, Zodia Markets and Zodia Custody. Standard Chartered Chief Executive Bill Winters said in a statement, “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade, and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements.” Retail Demand Outpacing Bitcoin Supply Bitfinex analysts have said that even retail demand is outpacing supply, with new buyers entering the market buying the cryptocurrency faster than the rate at which miners mine it. The analysts stated in a market report, “Currently, the combined balance of these cohorts is expanding at a rate of approximately 19.3K BTC per month.” The analysts highlighted that the Shrimp ( BTC ), Crab (1-10 BTC ), and Fish (10-100 BTC ) holder groups were accumulating Bitcoin and growing their portfolio significantly faster than the monthly issuance rate. “Demand from this segment alone is more than enough to absorb all new supply. This cohort-level accumulation trend supports the broader bullish narrative that new buyers entering the Bitcoin market are price-agnostic buyers and are relentlessly accumulating with limited intervals.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a substantial decline during the ongoing session as traders lock in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency raced to record highs on Monday. BTC crossed $116,000 on Friday and settled at $116,885. However, it lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline before rising 1.72% on Sunday and settling at $118,624. The price soared to a new all-time high on Monday, racing past $123,000 and settling at $123,091 before declining to $119,714. BTC is down over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $117,030. Market experts believe the correction is driven by profit booking, as investors lock their gains after the price surged past $120,000. Despite the decline, Bitcoin ETFs reported $300 million in inflows, indicating continued investor confidence. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, believes that BTC could push to $135,000 before any substantial correction. Stockton added that stocks like Coinbase and Strategy, which track BTC markets, will also perform well. “There is positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies.” Other analysts offered similar predictions after BTC broke above $120,000 on Monday, crossing $123,000 on Coinbase before retreating. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, “Based on the July 10 breakout signal, which has historically led to an average 20% rally over the following two months, we project Bitcoin could reach $133,000. We expect some near-term consolidation, followed by a push toward $133,000, with our $160,000 year-end target still firmly in sight.” BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 on Thursday (July 3), but lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday, settling at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC registered an increase of over 2% and settled at $111,255. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered an increase of 3.51% and settled at $115,159. Price action remained bullish on Friday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose 1.50%, settling at $116,885, but not before reaching an intraday high of $118,287. The rally took a breather on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline. However, it resumed on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Monday, surging past $120,000 to reach $123,091. Despite strong bullish sentiment, it retreated from this level and settled at $119,714, ultimately rising 0.92%.

2025-07-15T16:06:37,"Stablecoins May Reshape U.S. Treasury Market at $750B Threshold, Standard Chartered Says","The stablecoin market could start reshaping traditional finance if it grows to about $750 billion, according to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research. Kendrick, writing in a note Tuesday after a week-long trip through Washington, New York and Boston, said there’s a growing consensus among crypto industry players, fund managers and policymakers that this $750 billion mark would be the tipping point where stablecoins begin to influence government debt issuance, monetary policy and the structure of U.S. Treasury markets through sheer demand. The current stablecoin market stands at about $240 billion. But Kendrick’s contacts expect it could more than triple by the end of 2026, driven by broadening use and regulatory clarity, particularly if the bipartisan GENIUS Act becomes law — a move that could happen as early as next week. “In the U.S., once the stablecoin market gets to a certain size, the amount of T-bills required to back stablecoins will likely require a shift in planned issuance across the curve towards more T-bill issuance, less longer-tenor issuance,” Kendrick wrote. “This potentially has implications for the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and demand for USD assets.” Stablecoins — cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a fixed value, usually $1 — are typically backed by cash-equivalent reserves, most often short-term U.S. government debt. As demand rises, so too does the need to hold vast quantities of Treasury bills, putting stablecoins on a potential collision course with traditional fixed income markets. Kendrick met with a cross-section of market participants during his U.S. visit, including Bitcoin miners, crypto-native firms, traditional hedge funds and policymakers, he said. Their near-unanimous focus: stablecoins. Market participants expect a wave of stablecoin issuance, not just from crypto firms, but possibly from banks and even local governments. Emerging markets may be the most immediately affected. Kendrick flagged concerns that individuals in these regions are using stablecoins as a digital savings vehicle, pulling capital away from local banking systems and central bank reserves. That could challenge financial stability in countries that rely on U.S. dollar liquidity to manage fixed exchange rates or capital controls. On the U.S. front, stablecoins could shift corporate treasuries away from traditional banking and into tokenized cash alternatives. But how much of their cash businesses move on-chain — and how fast — remains uncertain. The growing attention is reflected in public markets. Shares of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, have surged 540% since its public debut last month. The run-up signals investor confidence in stablecoins as a central pillar of the next phase of digital finance.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/stablecoins-may-reshape-u-s-treasury-market-at-usd750b-threshold-standard-chartered-says,"MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","Markets|Stablecoins|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T16:04:45,"Whales Are Back in Meme Coins After Bitcoin’s New ATH – This Telegram Bot Could Help You Find the Best Ones","Bitcoin’s (BTC) new all-time high has reignited the entire crypto market, and meme coins are once again in the spotlight. Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing in whales and institutional traders alike, pushing futures volume to over $1.5 billion on Monday. And as attention shifts back to high-risk, high-reward plays, many traders are turning to automation – not because it guarantees wins, but because the right bot can at least tilt the odds in your favor, such as Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) . The most recognized bots in the space such as Banana Gun, Maestro, and Unibot have all originated on Ethereum – a chain that’s notorious for congestion and high gas fees. Snorter takes a different route, being built natively on Solana, where transactions are faster and cheaper by design. Since last year, the network has become the preferred engine for meme coin trading and now, with a purpose-built bot operating directly on it, traders can finally match that speed with execution optimized for it. For those looking to support the development of a sharper tool for spotting high-potential tokens, the SNORT presale is live and has raised nearly $1.9 million. Tokens are available at $0.0981 for the next two hours before the price ticks up to the next presale stage. Meme Coin Volatility Is Back – But Snorter Can Trade the Chaos Meme coins have now topped $70 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. Since Bitcoin broke its all-time high in May, investors have funneled gains into the industry’s less serious assets, with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK) climbing 11%, 22.1%, and 26.7% respectively, over the past week. DOGE, boosted by heavy whale accumulation, surged 13.9% in the same timeframe. But the returns across the sector can vary wildly. Among the top 10 meme coins, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) led the pack with a 105% weekly gain – far above the usual 15% to 25% range. Meanwhile, lesser-known tokens like MemeCore (M) have exploded even harder, clocking in at 598% since July 3, driven by the hype around its Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for meme coins. The price action is reminiscent of the speculative frenzy last seen in mid-2023. Yet, spotting tokens on the verge of a breakout is tough to do manually. That’s where crypto trading bots like Snorter Token help level the playing field for retail traders. As mentioned earlier, Snorter’s Solana-native foundation gives it a clear edge in execution. Unlike Ethereum-based bots that often get bogged down by high fees and network congestion, Snorter is meant for high-frequency trading, exactly the kind of environment Telegram bots are meant to thrive in. Snorter Token is Built Exactly for the Traders Who Never Log Off Snorter is designed for the rhythm of meme coin season, when new tokens drop without warning, and seconds determine a winning trade from a losing trade. As mentioned, it runs directly inside Telegram, so trades happen in the same space where calls, rumors, and alpha get posted in real time. What makes Snorter stand out isn’t just the execution speed, though, but also the full environment it builds around the trader. It features real-time feed monitoring, wallet mirroring, and sniper configurations, and it compresses the entire trading flow into a single, responsive interface. Essentially, with these features, users can track wallets, set up sniper parameters to auto-buy tokens based on specific triggers, and deploy swaps instantly. And with MEV protection built in, trades land cleanly without being front-run by predatory bots. Snorter also helps flag contracts with red flags – including honeypots, which let you buy but block you from selling – giving traders added security in a market filled with stealth launches and fast-moving traps. On Solana, tokens regularly 2x within the first minute of launch on DEX Screener – often before Telegram groups or X even react. With Snorter, that early edge becomes accessible to retail. Snorter is also structured for expansion. As mentioned, multi-chain support is on the roadmap, and community proposals will soon guide its direction from what gets prioritized next to how features evolve. The end goal is a trading bot that’s intuitive enough to become a full-on crypto trading command center – one that’s ready for a renewed meme coin season in 2025. How to Buy SNORT at a Discount In short, trading the meme coin market – especially with buying activity surging again – is nearly impossible without automation. But if you think any trading bot will do the job, you’d be mistaken. Once launched, one of Snorter’s biggest advantages – beyond its speed and functionality – is its cost-efficiency. Simply holding SNORT unlocks execution fees as low as 0.85% – the lowest in the space. Most competing bots charge between 1% and 2%, making Snorter a clear value pick for active traders aiming to maximize returns. And of course, SNORT tokens aren’t just a currency within the tool – they’re exposure to the ecosystem itself, with future rewards, governance rights, and utility baked in for those who want a stake in how the platform evolves. If you’re ready to back it, head to the Snorter Token presale site and secure your SNORT using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or a credit card. SNORT tokens bought in the presale can generate passive returns through its own staking pool that currently offers a dynamic 207% APY. For the smoothest experience, use Best Wallet – the only Web3 wallet that shows your SNORT balance in-app and gives early access to new token launches through its exclusive ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. Download Best Wallet now on Google Play or the Apple App Store . Follow Snorter Token on X and Instagram for the latest updates.

Trump made the following statements: Happy Crypto Week! The House of Representatives will vote on a monumental bill that will make America the undisputed #1 leader in digital assets. No one does it better than us! The GENIUS Act will put our great country far ahead of China, Europe, and others. They're trying to catch up, but they won't.

Launched three days before Trump's inauguration, the token was listed on leading cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase within just one day. Coinbase states that it normally conducts a “rigorous” review process before listing new digital assets. The TRUMP token has entered exchanges at an extraordinary pace compared to other major memecoins. However, the large holdings of the token by Trump and his associates pose a risk of potential price manipulation.

The slide mirrors broader market jitters after bitcoin (BTC) surged to a record above $120,000, prompting a wave of profit-taking that brought the cryptocurrency back down to $116,000 at the time of writing. The profit-taking trend also comes at a time in which inflation grew to 2.7% in June, as measured by the Consumer Price Index. It’s up from a 2.4% annual increase in May, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics For hours, BNB oscillated within a narrow $23 corridor, bouncing between $698.72 and $675.47, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Buyers showed up near $675, helping stem the slide with a burst of volume exceeding 134,000 tokens traded as prices hit session lows. BNB has since clawed back some ground. Technical signals remain mixed. A downtrend persists, capped by resistance at $690 to $695, a zone where earlier support has flipped into selling pressure. Yet surges in trading activity hint at possible accumulation, as seen in a brief spike of over 1,600 tokens traded in a four-minute window. Various companies have indeed moved to adopt a BNB treasury reserve. The volatility comes as BNB celebrates its eighth anniversary, a milestone that underscores its journey. It’s also recently undergone a $1 billion token burn. BNB is also benefitting from BNB Chain joining the Ondo Global Markets Alliance to bring tokenized securities, which include U.S. stocks, ETFs, and funds, to its network. Whether BNB can break above resistance, or sink lower if profit-taking continues, could shape sentiment for the broader crypto market in coming days.

At press time, PUMP was trading at $0.00570, down 15% over the past 24 hours, making it the largest loser among the 100 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The token initially surged to a peak of $0.00968 but has since dropped 41%. PUMP one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Launched on July 12 through a public token sale , the PUMP ICO raised $500 million in just 12 minutes, selling 150 billion tokens at $0.004 each. While a broader market pullback, driven by Bitcoin ( BTC ) losing the $120,000 support level, has added to the sell-off, several PUMP-specific factors have accelerated the decline. For instance, on-chain data reveals that roughly 340 wallets controlled more than 60% of the presale allocation. Many of these wallets began selling their tokens as they unlocked on July 14, increasing selling pressure on the market. Volatility was further fueled by the decision from Binance and other major exchanges to list PUMP futures before spot markets, a move that appears to have dampened retail investor enthusiasm. Whales turn bearish on PUMP At the same time, large holders have shown a bearish stance. For instance, a whale reportedly opened a $8.5 million short position, while short funding rates on decentralized platforms spiked to an annualized rate of 1,100%, indicating extreme negative sentiment. PUMP whale transactions. Source: Arkham Investors also seem concerned about growing competition in the meme coin launchpad space. To this end, rival platform LetsBonk overtook Pump.fun in daily market share, grabbing 44.87% compared to Pump.fun’s 43.73%. LetsBonk also leads in token graduation rates, with 1.04% of its 18,150 tokens achieving full trading status versus 0.93% for Pump.fun’s 12,261 launches. Notably, Pump.fun, which gained popularity in 2024 as the go-to platform for launching Solana-based meme coins, had pitched the PUMP ICO as part of a larger vision to create a decentralized alternative to platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Twitch. With the token now faltering, skepticism is growing over whether the project can fulfill its ambitious roadmap.

That layer will bring in daily CPA-attested reports verifying not just asset balances but also fund liabilities. “Together, these features deliver a more comprehensive and easily readable approach to transparency,” the company wrote. The added layer is meant to assure investors that fund holdings match obligations. Proof-of-reserve audits have been a growing trend in the cryptocurrency industry, taking off after the collapse of FTX in November 2022. That collapse occurred after a leaked balance sheet triggered a bank run on the exchange, revealing it did not have customers’ assets on hand to meet its obligations. Since then, platforms’ reserves have been a major concern for investors. Bitwise’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund currently has $4.9 billion in net assets, far below the market leader, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which holds $85.9 billion, according to SoSoValue data. Similarly, its ether ETF holds $358 million in net assets, below the sector’s leader’s $6.28 billion.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/15/bitwise-adds-proof-of-reserves-for-bitcoin-ether-etfs,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT","Finance|Bitwise|bitcoin spot ETF|Ether ETFs|Proof-of-Reserves|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T15:00:41,"Top Crypto Gainers 2025: BlockDAG, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Smart Earning Ideas","The crypto market is heating up in July 2025. Bitcoin has crossed $122,000, Ethereum stays above $3,000, and the total market cap is nearing $4 trillion. With many top crypto gainers showing strong weekly growth, people are now searching for smart ways to earn through crypto. Whether you’re new or experienced, it’s a good time to explore your options. Here are five smart ways to earn from crypto in 2025. The first on the list is BlockDAG’s $0.0016 presale, a key highlight among this year’s top crypto gainers. 1. Join BlockDAG at $0.0016 Before August 11 BlockDAG is standing out with one of the biggest presale runs of the year. It has collected over $339 million so far. The current Batch 29 rate is $0.0276, a 2,660% jump from its starting price of $0.001. What makes BlockDAG (BDAG) even more appealing is the special offer running until August 11. New buyers can still join at $0.0016, close to the entry point that early participants had. That brings a strong potential for gains if the launch price hits $0.05. So far, the testnet is live, 18,500 miners have shipped, and over 2 million users are active on the X1 Miner App. The project has also built sports links with Inter Milan and Seattle Seawolves. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release is set for August 11, making it a top mention among this year’s top crypto gainers. 2. Use Ethereum Staking to Build Steady Returns Ethereum remains one of the top crypto gainers this year and is still a strong choice for long-term plans. Staking it offers a reliable way to earn extra income. With Ethereum holding above $3,000, staking rewards range between 4% and 6% per year, depending on the platform used. User-friendly platforms like Lido and Coinbase help make the process simple. Staking also helps support the Ethereum network while giving rewards in return. It’s a practical option for those wanting to earn passively from a top crypto project. 3. Try Bitcoin ETFs for Simple Market Access Bitcoin, now priced over $122,000, continues to be one of the top crypto gainers. A big reason for this is the rising demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs. These funds have seen more than $3.6 billion added in recent weeks. ETFs offer a way to be part of Bitcoin’s growth without handling wallets or private keys. This makes them a useful option for those who want easier, more secure access to the world’s largest digital asset. 4. Use Stablecoin Farming for Steady Earnings For those wanting less risk, yield farming with stablecoins such as USDC, DAI, or USDT could be a smart path. Platforms like Aave and Curve offer yearly returns between 5% and 10%. Stablecoins hold a steady value, which helps reduce price risk. This approach works well for anyone looking for consistent returns without large price changes. It’s also useful for those who prefer safer ways to take part in the top crypto gainers market. 5. Trade Altcoins That Show Strong Price Moves Many altcoins are climbing fast in 2025, with names like Solana, XRP, and Avalanche showing double-digit gains in a week. These coins are among the top crypto gainers this season. For active traders, these price moves create chances to earn, though it takes careful planning. Keeping up with news, using stop-loss tools, and managing risk are all key to trading altcoins successfully. Final Thoughts on Earning in a Fast-Moving Market There are many paths to earning in crypto this year, such as staking, trading, referrals, and more. Among all these, BlockDAG’s presale has drawn attention as one of the top crypto gainers . At the current $0.0016 price and a listing goal of $0.05, combined with working tools already in use, BlockDAG offers a rare mix of early access and active progress. Its GLOBAL LAUNCH release is set for August 11, giving users a deadline to watch. If you’re thinking about earning through crypto in 2025, this could be one of the most timely moves to explore.
