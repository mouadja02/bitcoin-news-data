2025-07-15T09:53:12,"Bitcoin's Volatility Will Continue to Decline as Adoption Grows: Deutsche Bank","Bitcoin's (BTC) volatility could continue to fall as mainstream acceptance grows and the cryptocurrency is adopted by companies, retail investors and governments, Deutsche Bank said in a research report on Tuesday. Excitement over upcoming legislation in the U.S. has spurred bitcoin’s recent rally, the german lender said, but it is notable that the crypto's rise has also been accompanied by a historic decline in volatility levels. The world's largest cryptocurrency has risen nearly 75% since mid-November, driven by a mix of favorable regulations, growing institutional adoption, and global macroeconomic shifts, the report said. The rally coincides with “Crypto Week” in Washington, DC, highlighting increasing government and corporate engagement with digital assets. This week the House of Representatives is set to vote on the CLARITY Act, a crypto market structure bill, and the GENIUS Act, which regulates stablecoins in the U.S. Deutsche Bank suggests the drop in volatility signals a maturing market, where regulatory clarity, broader adoption, and long-term investment behaviors are stabilizing performance. As bitcoin gains legitimacy through regulation and integration into traditional portfolios, it may continue to shed its speculative image and evolve into a more stable, strategic asset, the report added. As volatility decreases and regulatory certainty increases, bitcoin is becoming more appealing for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and other long-term allocators.

2025-07-15T09:40:43,"Altcoin Season Index at 31: Unpacking the Dominant Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Index at 31: Unpacking the Dominant Bitcoin Season in the Crypto Market Are you keeping a close eye on the ever-evolving crypto market ? If so, understanding the ebb and flow between Bitcoin and altcoins is absolutely crucial for making informed decisions. The cryptocurrency landscape is a dynamic arena, often characterized by distinct periods where one asset class outshines the other. Currently, a key metric, the Altcoin Season Index , is signaling a clear trend: we are firmly in a Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio and future investments? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Market Compass The Altcoin Season Index is a valuable tool, tracked by prominent cryptocurrency price data platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC). It offers a snapshot of market sentiment and asset performance by comparing how the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have fared against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a barometer for understanding which segment of the market is currently leading the charge. Let’s break down how the index works: Index Range: The score ranges from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season Criteria: For the market to be considered in ‘Altcoin Season,’ at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the specified 90-day period. This is when altcoins typically see significant gains and often capture more investor attention. Bitcoin Season Criteria: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ occurs when 25% or fewer of these top altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This indicates that capital is largely flowing into Bitcoin, or Bitcoin is holding its value better during market downturns. Current Snapshot: Why the Index Stands at 31 and Signals Bitcoin Season As of 00:30 UTC on July 15, the Altcoin Season Index registered a score of 31. This figure, unchanged from the previous day, clearly indicates that the market is presently in a pronounced Bitcoin Season . A score of 31 is significantly below the 75 threshold required for altcoin dominance, suggesting that a vast majority of altcoins have not managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last three months. What drives such a shift? Several factors can contribute to Bitcoin’s outperformance: Flight to Safety: During periods of uncertainty or volatility in the broader financial markets, investors often view Bitcoin as a relatively safer asset compared to the more volatile altcoins. Institutional Interest: Growing institutional adoption and large-scale investments often flow into Bitcoin first, given its liquidity and established position. Halving Cycles: Anticipation or post-halving effects can draw significant attention and capital into Bitcoin, as its supply issuance decreases. Dominance Cycle: Bitcoin typically leads bull runs, with altcoins catching up later. A strong Bitcoin Season can be a precursor to a future altcoin rally, but it signifies a current period of Bitcoin strength. Understanding this current market phase is vital for strategizing your next moves in the crypto market . Navigating the Crypto Market: Implications for Your Altcoin Performance So, what does a score of 31 on the Altcoin Season Index mean for your altcoin performance and overall investment strategy? It suggests that, for now, capital is consolidating around Bitcoin. This doesn’t mean altcoins are worthless, but rather that they might be experiencing less significant gains, or even corrections, while Bitcoin either holds strong or makes notable advances. During Bitcoin Season, investors often observe: Lower Altcoin Volatility (Potentially): While altcoins are inherently volatile, their price movements might be more subdued compared to Bitcoin’s gains, or they might experience steeper percentage drops during corrections. Bitcoin Dominance Increase: The percentage of the total crypto market capitalization held by Bitcoin tends to rise. Focus on Foundational Projects: Investors might shift focus to established, larger-cap altcoins with strong fundamentals, rather than highly speculative smaller projects. This period can be challenging for those heavily invested in smaller altcoins hoping for quick returns. It emphasizes the importance of a well-diversified portfolio and a long-term perspective. Forecasting Cryptocurrency Trends: What Comes Next? While the current data points to a clear Bitcoin Season , the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. History suggests that a prolonged period of Bitcoin dominance often sets the stage for a subsequent Altcoin Season . But how do we anticipate these shifts in cryptocurrency trends ? Key indicators and factors to watch for a potential shift: Bitcoin Consolidation: After a strong rally, Bitcoin might enter a period of consolidation, trading sideways. This often allows capital to flow into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. New Narratives and Innovations: The emergence of groundbreaking technologies or strong narratives within the altcoin space (e.g., new DeFi protocols, successful Layer-2 solutions, major gaming projects) can ignite investor interest. Reduced Bitcoin Dominance: A sustained decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance, even if Bitcoin’s price is stable, can signal capital moving into altcoins. Macroeconomic Stability: A more stable global economic environment can encourage investors to take on more risk, flowing into higher-beta assets like altcoins. It’s crucial to remember that the Altcoin Season Index is a lagging indicator. It tells us what has happened, not what will happen. Therefore, while it confirms the current state, active monitoring of market sentiment and fundamental developments is key for anticipating future shifts. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor Navigating the current Bitcoin Season requires a thoughtful approach. Here are some actionable insights: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: Assess your current asset allocation. If you’re heavily weighted in altcoins, consider whether a rebalance towards Bitcoin or stablecoins is prudent for risk management. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): During a Bitcoin Season, altcoin prices might be suppressed. This can be an opportune time to DCA into promising altcoins you’ve researched thoroughly, accumulating them at potentially lower prices. Focus on Fundamentals: Instead of chasing hype, delve into the fundamentals of altcoin projects. Look for strong teams, clear use cases, active development, and robust communities. These projects are more likely to weather a Bitcoin Season and thrive when altcoins regain momentum. Stay Informed: Continuously monitor market news, technical analysis, and the Altcoin Season Index itself. Knowledge is your most powerful tool in the volatile crypto space. Manage Expectations: Understand that not every altcoin will perform equally, especially during a Bitcoin-dominant phase. Patience and realistic expectations are vital. Remember, the cryptocurrency market is cyclical. While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin’s strength, the wheel will eventually turn. Being prepared for both seasons is the mark of a truly strategic investor. The Cycle Continues: A Compelling Summary The Altcoin Season Index , currently at 31, unequivocally signals that the crypto market is in a Bitcoin Season . This means Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins over the past 90 days. While this phase might present challenges for immediate altcoin performance , it also offers unique opportunities for strategic accumulation and portfolio rebalancing. Understanding these distinct cryptocurrency trends , from Bitcoin dominance to the eventual resurgence of altcoins, is fundamental for long-term success in this dynamic asset class. Stay vigilant, conduct thorough research, and prepare for the market’s inevitable shifts.

2025-07-15T09:30:32,"Ethereum Shorts Reach Record Levels, How To Stay Positioned For A Breakout","As the Ethereum price has broken out above $3,000, the shorts have piled on with expectations that this rally will end up like the others before it: in a crash. Not only have the shorts been dominating the market recently, but the exponential growth has seen the short positions rise to levels never before seen in the history of the digital asset. While this might look bearish at a glance as it means traders expect the price to decline, it could actually end up being ultra-bullish for the altcoin. Ethereum Leverage Positions Reach Record Short Levels In a post on X, market expert Zerohedge revealed an interesting development for Ethereum, and that is the fact that Ethereum shorts have now reached new records. The chart showed the Ether leveraged net totals, and it came out to a -13291, beating the previous high that was set back in May at -12000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Not Stopping At $123,000 — Technical Indicators Point To $140,000 Top This rise in Ethereum shorts proves that there is still a lot of disbelief in the current market rally, and many traders expect the Ethereum price to fall again. However, looking at the historical performance when it comes to shorts reaching record levels, it shows a trend that this could mean the rally could be sustained. For example, back in May 2025, when it set its previous peak of -12000, the Ethereum price had rallied from below $1,800 to above $2,600 before the month was over. This trend is also playing out now as the Ethereum price has crossed $3,000, as the Ether shorts have reached a new peak. How To Stay Positioned For ETH Given that the Ethereum price seems to be headed into what might be a parabolic rally after clearing $3,000, crypto analyst Luca on X has outlined how they intend to position for the surge. Luca explains that with the new week, the Ethereum price is at a key point. This is because it is approaching the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement level, and this level is important because it has been a point of consolidation for the altcoin in the past. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst As such, the analyst explains that he intends to keep holding his positions on Ethereum. So far, Luca revealed that he has only de-risked Bitcoin positions as the pioneer cryptocurrency has hit all-time highs, but as the end of the cycle draws closer, the focus remains on altcoins. He maintains that the Ethereum price, alongside altcoins, will end up outperforming Bitcoin once the dominance drops. When this dominance drop happens, the analyst says that is when to begin de-risking altcoin positions. For now, though, the analyst expects Ethereum and altcoins to keep trailing Bitcoin as the dominance still remains high above 64% and BTC is yet to enter its distribution phase.

2025-07-15T09:24:14,"Bitcoin, XRP Open Interest Nears Record High as Bull Market Pullback Unfolds","This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin: Bull Market Pullback Underway The bitcoin (BTC) market rally has stalled in the past 24 hours as expected , but instead of consolidation, prices have pulled back over 5% to $116,800 from record highs in a move typical of a bull market pullback. Reports suggest that profit-taking by long-term holders is weighing on the cryptocurrency's price. It's common for markets to revisit breakout points, in this case, the May 22 high of around $111,960, and test the underlying buying interest before chalking out bigger rallies. A similar dynamic played out earlier this year as prices dropped from over $100,000 of $75,000, revisiting the breakout point from late 2024. From a technical analysis perspective, the broader bullish bias will prevail while prices remain locked in the ascending channel on the daily chart. Over the next 24 hours, the focus will be on the hourly chart, which shows a steep corrective trend lower, with prices trading below the Ichimoku cloud to suggest bearish momentum. However, the RSI on the hourly chart has dropped below 30, indicating an oversold condition – a stark contrast to the above-70 or overbought reading seen a day ago. So, a bounce cannot be ruled out. The probability of a pullback to $111,960 would weaken if the potential recovery ends the downward-trending channel. Such a move will likely result in fresh record highs. Volatility could remain high as cumulative open interest in onshore and offshore futures and offshore perpetual futures has increased to 734.82K BTC, which is just shy of the record 744K BTC in October 2022, according to data source CoinGecko. The growth in open interest is likely being led by offshore exchanges as the number of active contracts on the CME remains below the May high, with the three-month annualized basis still below 10%. Conversely, annualized funding rates on offshore perpetuals have topped 11%, indicating a growing demand for the bullish exposure. AI's take: Bitcoin's 5% pullback is a healthy bull market feature, aiming to retest the key breakout level of $111,960 before potentially initiating a stronger rally. Resistance: $118,000-118,500, $120,000, $123,181 Support: $113,688 (the 38.2% Fib retracement of the rally from June 22 lows), $111,965, $107,823 (the 61.8% Fib) XRP: Holds 100-hour MA and cloud support XRP (XRP) has dropped from $3 and appears to be trapped in a downward-trending channel on the hourly chart, mirroring BTC. Still, XRP appears relatively better off, holding the confluence of the 100-hour simple moving average (SMA) and the Ichimoku cloud at $2.81. A breakout from here would imply an end to the correction and resumption of the broader uptrend toward the yearly peak of $3.4. On the way higher, bulls will likely be tested again at around $3. Watch out for the move below the Ichimoku cloud, as that would strengthen the immediate bear case, shifting focus to the 200-hour SMA at $2.6. Again, volatility could be elevated with perpetual futures open interest hitting a record high of 2.74 billion XRP, according to Coinglass. The annualized XRP funding rates hover at 15%, indicating a growing bias for leveraged bullish plays. AI's take: Despite XRP's hourly chart showing a BTC-mirroring downtrend from $3, its strong hold above the 100-hour SMA and Ichimoku cloud at $2.81 signals underlying support. Record perpetual futures open interest and high funding rates indicate significant leveraged bullish demand, making a breakout above $3, towards $3.4, likely if current support holds. Resistance: $3, $3.4 Support: $2.81, $2.6-$2.65, $2.38 ETH: Awaiting breakout Ether (ETH) remains trapped in an expanding triangle, with the daily stochastic flashing an overbought reading, pointing to stretched upward momentum, which weakens the case for a firm breakout in the short term. A consolidation around the resistance looks likely as prices are firmly above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and short-term SMAs point north, indicating a bullish bias. An eventual breakout would shift focus to $3,400, a level targeted by options traders. AI's take: The daily stochastic being overbought indicates that momentum is stretched, making a convincing push above the upper trendline unlikely in the short term. Resistance: $3,067 (the 61.8% Fib retracement), $3,500, $3,570, $4,000. Support: $2,905, $2,880, $2,739, $2,600 SOL: $168 is the new resistance level SOL's upside remains elusive despite the dual breakout on the daily chart. Since Friday, the bulls have failed at least twice to chew through bearish pressures at around $168, as evidenced by the long upper wicks attached to the candles for Monday and Friday. So, a break above $168 is now needed to confirm bullishness. On the downside, $157 is the level to watch as it marks the neckline support of the double top pattern on the hourly chart. A breakdown of the support line would imply potential for a deeper decline to $146, per the measured move method. AI's take : Traders should watch for a definitive break above $168 to confirm bullish continuation; otherwise, a loss of the $157 neckline support could trigger a deeper decline towards $146. Resistance : $168, $180-$190, $200. Support : $157, $145, $125.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/bitcoin-xrp-open-interest-nears-record-high-as-bull-market-pullback-unfolds,"TRADING|MARKET|BTC|XRP|SOL","Markets|market analysis|Bitcoin|XRP|open interest|Solana|Ether|News",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T09:19:50,"Bitcoin (BTC) dips ahead of potential US inflation increase: Price analysis","Bitcoin (BTC) fell from its new top of $123,200 on Monday and into Tuesday, to currently stand at just under $117,000. Besides the reason of buyer exhaustion, Tuesday will see the new monthly CPI data print, with experts forecasting a 0.3% month on month rise. How will Bitcoin react to this? Potential uptick in U.S. consumer price inflation? As predicted by plenty of analysts over recent times, inflation could start to rear its ugly head again in the US. Expected to feed through from the Trump tariffs, an incremental increase in consumer price inflation may be about to make its presence felt. The new monthly figures will be released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, around 5 hours from now. CPI is expected to increase by 0.3%, while Core CPI is predicted to rise by the same margin. The figures are an increase on the previous 0.1% monthly rise. This translates to 2.6% year on year. Of course, the actual data may be above or below what is estimated, and this could then cause the U.S. stock market to turn in one direction or the other, with the potential to further affect Bitcoin and the crypto market. How far down will this correction go? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for Bitcoin reveals the current corrective phase. The sharp and sustained rise out of the bull flag could not keep going indefinitely, and so a correction at this point was favourite to happen, and is very healthy for the $BTC price going forward, allowing momentum/overbought indicators to reset. It now remains to be seen just how far down the price will go. The Fibonacci retracements for this move out of the bull flag, and to the new all-time high, suggest the price could come back to $115,000, or $113,500. The horizontal level of $112,000 coincides with the top of the bull flag and the top of the first pennant after the price first escaped the full flag. The price could also consolidate at its current level, which corresponds to the bottom of the larger pennant. Whichever of the above options finally comes true, the main thing for investors to consider is that the longer the price stays down in this area, the more time it provides for the bulls to regain their composure ready for the next push to the upside. Potential for a sharp drop to strong support at $112,000? Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $BTC price does contain some concerns. Not least of which is the long candle wick to the upside, left over from the sharp surge to over $123,000 on Monday. This would imply a lot of downside momentum, and so if the price does not recover before going below $116,000, the next stop could be the $112,000 horizontal support level seen in the chart above. While this potential $11,000 correction might seriously scare investors, if support was found at $112,000, it would likely result in a strong bounce to the upside, founded on what could become strong price structure. CPI print awaited for bulls or bears to take control Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows how the support at $112,000 is also part of a band of support which descends until $109,000. For the bull market to continue, this would probably need to hold firm. One scenario that could unfold today is if the US CPI print is slightly worse than expected. This might then have the potential to force the price all the way back down to the strong support band. But as already mentioned, a bounce is more likely than not from there. If the CPI release is as expected, or better than expected, the current correction could be reasonably short-lived. For the more long-term investor, this probably all counts as noise.

2025-07-15T09:16:14,"Bitcoin Buyers Absorb All New Supply as Price-Agnostic Demand Surges","Bitcoin rally is being driven by a relentless wave of price-agnostic buyers, with demand from small investors now exceeding the monthly supply miners bring to market. According to Bitfinex analysts, the combined holdings of new buyers are expanding at a rate of around 19,300 BTC per month, comfortably outpacing the post-halving issuance of approximately 13,400 BTC. Analysts note that smaller investor groups—known in the crypto community as “Shrimp” (less than 1 BTC), “Crab” (1–10 BTC), and “Fish” (10–100 BTC)—are steadily accumulating Bitcoin, unfazed by price swings. “Demand from this segment alone is more than enough to absorb all new supply,” the Bitfinex report stated, emphasizing that these buyers are “relentlessly accumulating with limited intervals.” Bitcoin Sets New Highs The surge in grassroots accumulation comes as Bitcoin continues to break records . On Monday, the cryptocurrency reached a new all-time high of $122,884 before pulling back to around $116,700 at the time of writing, data from CoinMarketCap shows. Crypto trading firm QCP Capital commented that BTC’s relentless rally “shows no signs of fatigue,” as retail and institutional participation remains strong . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which tracks market sentiment, posted a “Greed” score of 74 on Monday, marking its fifth consecutive day in the “Greed” zone. Despite the ongoing bullish momentum, the rapid price ascent has liquidated a significant number of short positions. CoinGlass reported that nearly $430 million in Bitcoin shorts were wiped out as the price surged past $121,000. Warnings of Potential Volatility Ahead While the persistent demand and new highs are energizing the market, analysts warn investors to remain cautious. Redstone co-founder Marcin Kazmierczak noted that although some analysts are predicting near-term Bitcoin targets as high as $140,000 , “history teaches us that parabolic moves often invite sharp corrections.” Kazmierczak highlighted recent large-scale liquidations as a reminder that volatility is a constant companion for Bitcoin traders, advising investors to approach price milestones with careful position sizing rather than euphoria. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan echoed these sentiments, pointing out that spikes in trader optimism have previously been followed by sharp price corrections, as seen during BTC drops on June 11 and July 7.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.7 million followers that he’s buying only one more Bitcoin as the flagship crypto asset hit a new all-time high on Monday of about $123,000 – at least until a clearer financial picture comes into view. “Yay: Bitcoin over $120,000. Great news for those who already have some Bitcoin. Bad news for those who, for whatever reason, never ‘pulled the trigger.’ They own nothing. As warned in previous X, ‘Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.’ I am buying one more coin and get fatter. I will not buy any more – until I know where the economy is going. As tempting as Bitcoin going to $200,000 to $1 million is, I don’t want to be a hog and get slaughtered. If you have not begun acquiring Bitcoin, I suggest starting very small, starting with a Satoshi.” The Bitcoin bull also warns of a global financial collapse, which he says may present a buying opportunity. “Remember, Warren Buffett is out of stocks and sitting on $350 billion in cash. I suspect he is waiting for the world to crash. Then he will move back in and buy the best assets with cash.

2025-07-15T09:15:19,"Major BTC darknet market vanishes in potential scam","Abacus Market, once the biggest Bitcoin‑friendly dark web shop for Western buyers, vanished from the internet in July. TRM Labs says the site’s operators probably closed the doors and ran off with customers’ funds in a classic exit scam. Some experts still think police may have secretly seized the servers, but no agency has claimed credit for the closure yet. Nevertheless, the timing is quite interesting, as Abacus went dark only three weeks after officers shut down Archetyp Market on 16 June 2025. Signs of trouble had already starting appearing in June Users complained they could not withdraw funds last month. The site’s administrator, who uses the name “Vito,” posted on the Dread forum and blamed the delays on a flood of new users from the closed Archetyp site and DDOS attacks. Abacus Market’s admin posted on the Dead forum. Source: TRM Labs. The community, however, doubted the claims and daily bitcoin deposits tell a different story. From 1 to 27 June, Abacus took in about US$230,000 a day over 1400 transactions. From 28 June to 10 July, the average amount of deposits plunged to US$13,000 over 100 deposits. This shows that users were growing increasingly suspicious of the site. Abacus launched in September 2021 under the name Alphabet Market and re‑branded two months later. Though it was open for users worldwide, it worked hard to attract Australian buyers, even hiring a local moderator and sprinkling Australian slang through its site text. The marketplace’s catalog covered stimulants, opioids, psychedelics, prescription pills, benzodiazepines, unlicensed medicines and cannabis products. The marketplace let customers pay in Bitcoin or Monero, unlike rivals DrugHub, ASAP Market and Incognito Market. An old screenshot of the Abacus Market. Source: TRM Labs. The strategy paid off. In 2022 Abacus held 10 percent of Bitcoin sales among Western darknet markets, rising to 17 percent in 2023. After ASAP Market’s closure in July 2023 and the seizure of Incognito Market in March 2024, Abacus’s share in the market shot above 70 percent in 2024. June 2025 was Abacus’s best month ever, with sales hitting US$6.3 million. No evidence of law enforcement seizure yet ‘Hugbunter,’ an administrator at the dark web forum called Dread, had been in contact with the team behind Abacus for a long time. Hugbunter says he has seen no proof of law enforcement activity yet. However, in previous cases like the Nemesis Market closure, official law enforcement seizure notifications only surfaced months later. So, it is still possible that Abacus was closed by the LEOs. Whatever the cause, users quickly move on. When ASAP Market closed in 2023, Abacus traffic jumped 20 percent the next month. After Archetyp fell in June 2025, thousands of its members shifted to Abacus overnight, helping push that record US$6.3 million sales figure. Becoming the top Western darknet market may have sealed Abacus’s fate. Large volume, a big user base and strong name recognition bring law‑enforcement attention. Abacus’s administrators may have chosen safety over further profit considering the fact Archetyp market’s team had already faced arrests and legal action. After roughly four years online and hundreds of millions in earnings, the team may have decided it was time to disappear, TRM Labs notes. The dark web marketplace activity hardly ever pauses. After the 2022 removal of Hydra Market, new Russian sites appeared and by 2024 captured more than 97 percent of global revenue in dark web drug sales. In the West, many fresh dark web markets are lightweight projects; examples include 3DogsMarket, Drugula Market, and Squid Market, built from templates with weak security and designed to make quick cash before vanishing. Abacus could very well be another such example. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

According to Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, XRP is in a strong position to be included in the next wave of crypto ETFs when regulators give the green light. McClurg explained that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is currently working on guidelines to decide which cryptocurrencies can be added to ETFs. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have already secured their spots, XRP is quickly becoming one of the most likely candidates for future approval. Court Ruling Clears the Way One big reason for this prediction is the clear court ruling that XRP is not a security. This decision has removed one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of an ETF approval. McClurg believes this will allow XRP to be smoothly added to an ETF under existing regulations. “I firmly believe that Ripple is paving the way on a lot of other different things here. And obviously the connection with XRP, so I believe that XRP will be one of those tokens that will be in an ETF when all of this launches,” McClurg said. Institutions Could Back XRP in a Big Way When asked which crypto ETFs might attract the most investor interest after Bitcoin and Ethereum, McClurg pointed to XRP. While retail investors may continue leaning toward Solana on crypto exchanges, McClurg sees XRP as a favorite among financial institutions and advisors. He predicts that, over time, XRP could even gather more assets under management (AUM) than Ethereum, especially because of its strong focus on financial services and payment solutions.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-set-to-join-bitcoin-and-ethereum-in-etf-club-ceo-of-canary-capital-says-ripple-is-paving-the-way/,"XRP|ETH|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

Glassnode data shows that investors collectively realized $3.5 billion in profit over the past 24 hours, with the majority going to long-term holders — defined as those who bought more than 155 days ago, who accounted for 56% of the total. The largest cryptocurrency's rapid rally from $108,000 to $123,000 left a notable supply gap because the swift price action meant little trading activity occurred in the $110,000 -$116,000 range. Glassnode’s UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) sheds light on the move. It measures the so-called unspent transaction outputs (UTXO), which capture the prices at which bitcoin was bought and not sold. It represents the prices at which BTC is currently being held across the Bitcoin blockchain. Each bar in the chart shows the amount of bitcoin that last moved within a specific price range. The entity-adjusted version of this data show above accounts for the average purchase price of each entity’s full balance and excludes internal transfers between addresses owned by the same entity, which do not represent genuine market activity. It also filters out supply held on exchanges, because aggregating millions of users’ funds into a single price point would create distortions in the data. With minimal supply sitting between $110,000 and $116,000, as shown by the dip at the right-hand side, the market remains vulnerable to sharp moves in either direction.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/bitcoin-rally-stalls-as-long-term-holders-cash-out,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN","Markets|Glassnode|Bitcoin|Markets|News",cryptocompare

The report could signal whether inflationary pressures are picking up again, particularly as new tariffs from the Trump administration begin to bite. While Wall Street waits for confirmation, the crypto market has already leapt ahead. Bitcoin climbed to a new all-time high of $117,000 on Monday, with Ethereum and altcoins following closely behind. The CPI figures could either amplify this rally or spark a sudden cooldown. As prices and policy hang in the balance, markets are preparing for a volatile session.

McClurg, who is positive about XRP at this point, argued that XRP could soon have a larger share of the market, especially in terms of assets managed through ETFs. McClurg stated that Bitcoin currently leads the market in ETFs with approximately 5.6%, while Ethereum has a share of approximately 3%. However, McClurg argued that this situation could change, predicting that market share for both XRP and ETH could reach around 6% in the future as more people accept them as financial instruments. McClurg stated that Ripple is one of the strongest contenders in the race to modernize financial transactions overall, claiming that XRP could play a major role in this growing market. At this point, the famous CEO said that some investors will prefer ETFs due to their simplicity and transparency, while others will prefer companies that hold XRP in their treasuries. Bitcoin and Altcoin Season Forecast! When asked about his market predictions, the renowned CEO stated that he expects the Bitcoin price to reach $140,000 this year. He also noted that an altcoin season will occur in 2025, adding that some altcoins will experience a boom, but not all will reach new highs. “I don't think Solana or Ethereum will break new records this year. I also believe that newer altcoins like SUI, Injective, and Axelar have a higher chance of breaking new records.” McClurg added that XRP's rise will depend on ongoing legal and regulatory developments, and that he expects XRP to reach a new peak within this year, even if there is no new ATH. *This is not investment advice.

The bank’s UK arm has given institutional investors a way to buy and sell the two largest cryptocurrencies directly through a trusted, regulated bank. Standard Chartered Opens Crypto Trading The bank’s new service focuses on institutional clients, giving them direct access to deliverable Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) through a secure and fully compliant trading platform. One key point is that Standard Chartered now lets clients trade crypto using the same tools as foreign exchange. They can also choose where to store their coins, either with the bank or another trusted custodian. But Standard Chartered isn’t stopping there Right after this launch, the bank plans to bring in crypto derivatives too. These will include non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), a type of contract that lets investors bet on the future price of Bitcoin and Ether without owning the coins directly. Big Step for Digital Finance Bill Winters, the group CEO, explained that digital assets are becoming a key part of the financial world’s future. He said the bank aims to help clients trade and manage crypto safely and efficiently while meeting rules and regulations. Last year, the bank rolled out its first regulated crypto custody service in the UAE, so this trading move builds on that progress. It’s clear that Standard Chartered wants to lead the way in bringing crypto deeper into the mainstream banking world. How This Will Impact Crypto With crypto adoption on the rise, many large investors have been waiting for secure and regulated ways to enter the crypto market. By launching these services with strong safeguards, Standard Chartered is helping remove a huge barrier to crypto adoption.

2025-07-15T09:00:43,"Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Explodes 8%—What Does It Mean?","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Difficulty has seen a sharp increase in the latest network adjustment. Here’s what this means for the blockchain. Bitcoin Difficulty Has Seen An 8% Jump In Latest Adjustment According to data from CoinWarz , the most recent BTC Difficulty adjustment made things harder for the miners. The “ Difficulty ” here refers to a feature built into the Bitcoin blockchain that controls how hard the validators would find it to mine blocks on the network right now. The metric is controlled entirely by the code that Satoshi wrote in and automatically changes its value about every two weeks, according to network conditions at the time. The pseudonymous creator of the cryptocurrency had one goal in mind when creating the Difficulty: the network must not deviate from a standard block time of 10 minutes per block. Whenever the miners are faster than this rate (that is, they mine a block in fewer than 10 minutes on average), the network reacts by raising the metric, in order to slow the validators back down to the intended speed. Similarly, the blockchain reduces the Difficulty if miners are unable to hit the target time. The latest network adjustment occurred this past weekend. Here’s a chart that shows how the Difficulty changed during it: Prior to the adjustment, the Bitcoin Difficulty stood at 116.9 terahashes, but now, it has jumped to 126.2 terahashes. This reflects a very notable rise of almost 8%. Considering the increase, it would appear that the miners were significantly faster at their task during the last couple of weeks compared to the norm. Miners speed up whenever they add more computing power to their facilities. And indeed, the trend in the Hashrate , a metric keeping track of the miners’ total computing power, confirms that the validators have aggressively been expandingrecently. As the above chart from Blockchain.com shows, the 7-day average Bitcoin Hashrate had plummeted earlier, which had caused a steep drop in the Difficulty. But since the low, miners have expanded back up and while the metric isn’t back at the all-time high (ATH) yet, it has come close. Now that things are difficult for the miners again, though, it remains to be seen how long these upgrades would stick around. Miners that are just breaking-even can get pushed underwater by spikes in Difficulty and they usually respond by disconnecting their machines, causing a drop in the Hashrate. In related news, the Bitcoin miners have been taking advantage of the breakout to the new price ATH , as analyst Ali Martinez has explained in an X post . As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin miner-associated wallets have offloaded around 70,000 BTC (worth almost $8.4 billion) since Thursday. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $119,800, up nearly 11% in the last seven days.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-explodes-8-what-it-mean/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING","Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin difficulty|bitcoin hashrate|Bitcoin Miners|bitcoin mining|btc|BTCUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T09:00:31,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment Amidst Greed Zone","BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment Amidst Greed Zone Are you feeling the pulse of the crypto market? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a crucial barometer for investor sentiment, recently registered a score of 73. While this marks a slight dip from the previous day, it firmly keeps the market in the “Greed” zone. But what does this really tell us about the current crypto market sentiment , and how should you interpret such a reading? What Exactly is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, emotions often run high. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, serves as an invaluable tool to gauge these prevailing sentiments. It distills complex market data into a simple score, ranging from 0 to 100. 0 (Extreme Fear): Signals that investors are overly worried, potentially indicating a buying opportunity for contrarians. 100 (Extreme Greed): Suggests that the market is overheating, possibly hinting at an impending correction as investors become too optimistic. The index is not just a random number; it’s a composite score derived from six key market factors, each contributing a specific weight to the final reading. Understanding these components is essential to truly grasp the nuances of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . Decoding the ‘Greed Zone’: What Does a Score of 73 Mean for Crypto Market Sentiment? A score of 73, though a slight decrease, keeps us squarely in the “ Greed zone .” Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections, as exuberance can lead to irrational decision-making and overvaluation. When the index is high, it suggests that investors are buying heavily, perhaps driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), rather than fundamental analysis. This elevated crypto market sentiment indicates a bullish outlook, but also a potential for increased risk. It’s a reminder that while positive sentiment is good, excessive greed can lead to unsustainable price pumps. Savvy investors often use this signal as a prompt to re-evaluate their portfolios, perhaps taking some profits or tightening stop-losses. The Pillars of the Index: How is Market Volatility Measured? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sophisticated calculation, taking into account several factors. Let’s break down the key pillars that contribute to its score, starting with a significant one: market volatility . Market Volatility (25%): This component assesses the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High market volatility often signals fear, as sudden price swings can unnerve investors. However, in a bull market, increasing volatility can also be a sign of growing excitement and momentum. Other crucial factors include: Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market, comparing it with historical averages. High buying volumes in a rising market indicate strong positive sentiment. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms (like Twitter, Reddit, etc.) for specific crypto-related hashtags and measures the sentiment of posts. High engagement and positive mentions typically contribute to a higher greed score. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) Historically, this involved polling investors to gather their direct sentiment about the market. Google Trends (10%): This factor looks at Google search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto scam” might indicate fear, while terms like “buy Bitcoin” or “crypto rally” suggest greed. Beyond Bitcoin: Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Its Impact While the index is called the “Crypto” Fear & Greed Index, Bitcoin’s influence is undeniable. Bitcoin dominance (10%) is a key factor. This metric measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. When Bitcoin dominance increases, it often indicates that investors are moving away from altcoins and into Bitcoin, which is perceived as a safer, more stable asset in uncertain times (fear). Conversely, a decreasing Bitcoin dominance often suggests a surge in altcoin interest, which can be a sign of increased risk appetite and greed in the broader market. The current state of Bitcoin dominance , therefore, offers another layer of insight into overall crypto market sentiment , complementing the other indicators within the index. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors So, what should you do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes “Greed”? It’s not a direct buy or sell signal, but rather a guide to understanding the prevailing psychological landscape. Here are some actionable insights: Exercise Caution: High greed often means the market might be due for a correction. Consider taking some profits, especially from assets that have seen significant gains. Re-evaluate Risk: Assess your portfolio’s exposure. Are you over-allocated to volatile assets? This might be a good time to rebalance. Avoid FOMO: Don’t let the hype drive your decisions. Stick to your investment strategy and avoid buying assets just because everyone else is. Look for Opportunities: While a high greed score suggests caution, it doesn’t mean you should exit the market entirely. Instead, look for projects with strong fundamentals that might be temporarily overlooked or consider setting limit orders for potential dips. Stay Informed: Continue to monitor not just the index, but also market news, technical indicators, and fundamental developments. Remember, the index is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. Combining its insights with your own research and risk tolerance is key to making informed decisions in the volatile crypto market. Summary: A Prudent Approach to Crypto Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 73, firmly in the “ Greed zone ,” serves as a valuable indicator of current crypto market sentiment . While the slight dip might suggest a minor cooling, the overall message remains: caution is warranted. By understanding the components that drive this index – from market volatility and momentum to social media trends and Bitcoin dominance – investors can gain a clearer picture of the prevailing emotional climate. This knowledge empowers you to make more rational decisions, avoiding the pitfalls of extreme fear or unchecked greed, and ultimately navigating the crypto market with greater confidence.

2025-07-15T09:00:00,"Crypto Hype and Chaos Feed a Growing Scam Wave","The average loss per incident climbed to $7.1 million, with pump-and-dump schemes and exit scams causing the most damage. Law enforcement agencies are also overwhelmed by legal complexities and limited resources, which allows sophisticated criminals to thrive. This was exemplified by the sudden disappearance of Abacus Market, the largest Bitcoin-based darknet marketplace, in what’s suspected to be a huge exit scam. The event happened after the seizure of Archetyp Market and led to chaos on the dark web. Experts warn that without smarter regulation and public education, crypto crime will only continue to escalate. Crypto Scammers Thrive Crypto crime surged to record levels in the first half of 2025, with losses surpassing previous highs that were set in 2022. Losses are even nearing the total for all of 2024. Total losses by year (Source: TRM Labs ) According to cybersecurity experts, a mix of slow regulatory response, fear of missing out (FOMO), and growing retail adoption is creating ideal conditions for scammers and cybercriminals to thrive. Former DEA agent and cryptocurrency investigator Bill Callahan pointed out that while he hesitates to call it a “supercycle,” the combination of hype, limited oversight, and rapid asset creation is very clearly empowering malicious actors. Criminals are capitalizing on the crypto market’s high-risk, high-reward dynamic, especially given the anonymity and ease with which scams can be launched. Callahan warned that these bad actors have more than enough resources and don’t need to succeed every time to turn a profit. Blockchain security firm CertiK reported in its H1 Hack3d report that the average loss per security incident this year reached $7.1 million, with a median loss of over $89,000. Senior blockchain investigator Natalie Newson from CertiK specifically pointed to a “convergence of conditions,” including token launches by influencers and key opinion leaders with questionable motives, as contributing to the surge in illicit activity. Solidus Labs also mentioned that close to 99% of tokens on Pump.fun showed signs of pump-and-dump schemes. Crime summary for H1 2025 (Source: CertiK ) To make things worse, law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep up. Cross-border legal complexities, resource constraints, and the growing sophistication of cybercriminals are making it extremely difficult to enforce the law effectively. Chainalysis previously flagged money laundering techniques as a major hurdle that complicates enforcement efforts and leaves legitimate users more vulnerable. Newson believes that while better smart contract security and public education could help, there is no silver bullet to stop criminal behavior completely. Meanwhile, Kronos Research CEO Hank Huang criticized what he sees as regulatory inconsistency. He argued that the pendulum has swung from aggressive overregulation to dangerous inaction, which is creating a climate of low accountability. Huang believes there is a need for “smart, targeted regulation” to both protect users and allow the crypto space to continue maturing. Despite a rise in enforcement actions, particularly against darknet markets, Huang warned that losses will never drop to zero. He explained that the decentralized and borderless nature of crypto markets will always attract a mix of honest participants and bad actors. The real solution, he said, lies in minimizing user risk rather than aiming for an unattainable zero-loss environment. Abacus Market Disappears in Suspected Exit Scam Despite the high crypto crime numbers from H1 of 2025, it is showing no signs of slowing down. Abacus Market, the largest Bitcoin-based Western darknet marketplace, recently went offline in what TRM Labs believes to be an exit scam. Post from TRM Labs The site and its infrastructure, including its clearnet mirror, have become completely inaccessible. According to TRM Labs, this sudden disappearance suggests the platform’s operators likely shut down operations and vanished with user funds. This happened after a period of heightened law enforcement activity and traffic spikes on the site. After the seizure of Archetyp Market in mid-June, which was one of the longest-running dark web marketplaces, users flocked to Abacus. This caused it to reach its highest-ever monthly sales volume of $6.3 million. But that growth may have painted a target on its back. Top DNMs’ incoming volume between 2021 and 2024 (Source: TRM Labs ) In late June, users began experiencing withdrawal delays, prompting reassurances from the Abacus administrator “Vito,” who blamed the issues on high traffic and DDoS attacks. Despite the explanation, the behavior looked very similar to classic exit scam tactics, and deposits fell sharply. Abacus was known for offering a variety of illicit drugs and supported both Bitcoin and Monero payments. While official figures estimate its lifetime Bitcoin sales at nearly $100 million, TRM Labs suggested the real volume, factoring in Monero transactions, could be closer to $300–$400 million. The market gained a lot of traction after the closures of competitors like ASAP Market and Incognito Market, and eventually commanded over 70% of the Western Bitcoin-based dark web marketplace share. TRM Labs speculates that the operators may have exited not only for profit but also to avoid law enforcement scrutiny, especially after Archetyp’s takedown. The firm explained that darknet administrators who either exit voluntarily or scam users—like those from Agora Market, ASAP Market, and Evolution Market—have often evaded capture entirely. There’s also speculation that Abacus may have been secretly seized by law enforcement, although no official announcement has been made. The administrator of the Dread dark web forum, who had close ties to Abacus, is especially doubtful over this theory. TRM Labs did, however, point out that in previous cases, official seizure notices sometimes appeared months after the site went dark. (Source: TRM Labs ) Whether Abacus’s disappearance was a strategic exit or a covert takedown, the fallout still disrupted the dark web ecosystem. It also seems like the cycle of migration, exploitation, and law enforcement pursuit will continue.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9938/crypto-hype-and-chaos-feed-a-growing-scam-wave,"MARKET|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS","News|Security",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T09:00:00,"Altcoin Season Index Holds at 32, Market Remains Firmly in “Bitcoin Season”","Altcoin Season Index remains low at 32, signaling continued Bitcoin market dominance. Recent altcoin gains show mild recovery but fail to trigger a broader market shift. Chart pattern mimics 2021’s double fakeout, hinting at potential altcoin breakout ahead. The long-awaited “altseason” has not yet officially started, with a key market indicator showing Bitcoin is still firmly in control. However, technical analysts are now pointing to a compelling chart pattern that looks nearly identical to the setup that preceded the explosive 2021 altcoin rally. Crypto Data: Still “Bitcoin Season” For Now The Altcoin Season Index stood at 32 as of 00:30 UTC on July 15, a figure that confirms the market remains in “Bitcoin Season.” This index, tracked by CoinMarketCap, measures whether 75% of the top 50 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. A score of 75 or above is needed to declare the start of an “Altcoin Season.” Source: CoinMarketCap The current reading of 32 indicates that fewer than one-third of leading altcoins are currently beating Bitcoin.

2025-07-15T08:59:39,"Bitcoin retraces below $117k after hitting a new ATH: check forecast","The cryptocurrency market had a positive start to the week but has given away most of its recent profits. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market cap, hit a new all-time high of $123k on Monday thanks to growing institutional demand. However, BTC has since lost 5% of its value and now trades below $117k. The market might be undergoing a retracement before it resumes its rally. BTC dips below $117k as investors focus on upcoming crypto bills in the US Bitcoin is currently undergoing a correction after hitting an all-time high of $123k on Monday. It is down 5% in the last 24 hours and now risks dropping below $116k if the bearish trend continues. The negative performance comes as investors turn their attention to the upcoming crypto regulation bills in the United States. In an email from XBTO’s Investment Officer, Javier Rodriguez-Alarcón, the expert stated that the legislation could be crucial to the future of the crypto market. He stated that, “Crypto Week marks a decisive shift in the U.S. approach to digital assets, moving from reactive enforcement to structured legislative architecture. The GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act are especially important for setting institutional ground rules – clarifying how stablecoins should be issued and overseen, and formally defining the roles of the SEC and CFTC in overseeing crypto markets. Together, these steps address one of the core barriers to institutional participation: legal uncertainty.” Javier added that this cycle still appears early, and the next leg up will depend on whether institutional interest continues to deepen as legislative, fiscal, and monetary tailwinds converge. BTC could retest the $110k resistance level The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient despite losing 5% of its value in the last 24 hours. The ongoing retracement could see Bitcoin sweep the Transactional Liquidity (TLQ) at $110k before rallying higher. On-chain data shows that BTC’s Exchange Netflow (the difference between BTC flowing into and out of the exchange) is positive and has hit a level last seen on February 25. The increase in inflows suggests that investors are likely sending BTC to sell and could contribute to the short-term retracement. If BTC continues to face a correction, it could extend the decline to the next resistance level (TLQ) at $110,851. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 67, pointing downward after rejecting its overbought conditions a few hours ago. This suggests that the bulls are losing momentum. If the RSI continues to decline and closes below the neutral level of 50, the BTC/USD pair could drop lower. The MACD line is also approaching the neutral zone, indicating that the bullish bias is fading. However, if BTC recovers and closes above the $120,000 level over the next few hours, it could extend its rally to take out its all-time high price of $123,218.

2025-07-15T08:54:24,"S&P 500 hits a new all time of 6,300 for the first time ever","The S&P 500 broke through 6,300 for the first time in history on Tuesday, as rising demand for crypto stocks and tech names sent U.S. markets higher across the board. This happened just a day after Wall Street posted small gains even with President Donald Trump threatening 30% tariffs on Mexico and the European Union, starting August 1. According to CNBC, stock futures were already flashing green before the open. S&P 500 futures rose 0.3%, Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.55%, and Dow Jones futures moved up just 13 points, or 0.03%. Monday’s session had already closed in the green. The Dow added 88 points (0.2%), the S&P 500 ticked up 0.1%, and the Nasdaq Composite pushed 0.3% higher. With earnings from big banks coming soon and a fresh inflation reading around the corner, investors are loading up on risk. Bitcoin breakout pulls COIN and MSTR higher The rally in the S&P 500 is closely tied to a breakout in bitcoin , which surged above $123,000 last week and cleared its previous ceiling. With that resistance now flipped into support near $108,300, analysts are watching for a climb toward $134,500. The MACD is trending positive, and stochastics are turning higher, giving bulls reason to stay in. That breakout is fueling rallies in crypto-linked stocks. Coinbase (COIN) confirmed a move above $346, a price level that hadn’t been breached since 2021. The pattern is forming a long-term cup-and-handle, and if it plays out, COIN could run to around $460. Momentum is also building, with a Golden Cross—the 50-day average crossing above the 200-day, adding technical support. The last time bitcoin showed that same crossover in November 2024, the market consolidated for a few weeks before heading higher again. MicroStrategy (MSTR) is following a similar path, as per usual, riding bitcoin’s wave. Analysts have noted that COIN and MSTR tend to hold a 60% or higher correlation with bitcoin’s price, making them top bets for traders looking to gain exposure. The strength in these stocks comes just as retail interest spikes again, partly fueled by social media and a surge in attention on platforms like X. On Tuesday, Jim Cramer joked about the trend, calling Palantir, Applovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase the new “PARC” stocks in a post. “A new acronym for the meme stocks that just won’t quit!!! PARC!” he wrote . Although he referred to them as meme stocks, HOOD and COIN are heavily tied to crypto, and the market clearly isn’t laughing. Asia markets jump on China GDP and Nvidia chip sales Meanwhile, Asian stocks opened higher on Tuesday, with a boost from stronger-than-expected growth in China. The country’s economy grew 5.2% in the second quarter, beating the 5.1% estimate. But it still slowed compared to the 5.4% growth recorded in Q1. The data was released by China’s National Bureau of Statistics. The Hang Seng Tech index in Hong Kong rallied 2.14% late in the day. Traders bought up companies that import Nvidia’s H20 chips, after the company said it would resume sales to China. The top three gainers on the index jumped 6.83%, 6.41%, and 5.53%, though their names weren’t included in the report. Elsewhere in Asia , the Straits Times Index in Singapore climbed to a fresh high of 4,128.18, before settling at 4,124.71. That marked the seventh straight gain, led by stocks in industrials, consumer non-cyclicals, and utilities. In Japan, long-dated bonds saw heavy selling. The 30-year government bond yield rose 14.5 basis points to 3.191%, setting a new record. The move comes ahead of the upper house elections scheduled for July 20. 10-year JGBs reached 1.594%, the highest level since 2008, while 20-year yields moved to 2.634%, last seen in 1999.

2025-07-15T08:50:12,"SharpLink Gaming’s Bold Ethereum Bet: A Strategic Masterstroke?","BitcoinWorld SharpLink Gaming’s Bold Ethereum Bet: A Strategic Masterstroke? In a move that has sent ripples across both the gaming and cryptocurrency sectors, Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming has significantly expanded its digital asset holdings. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a profound statement from a traditional company embracing the future of finance. The acquisition of an additional 24,371 Ethereum ETH , valued at an impressive $73.21 million, signals a deeper commitment to its innovative Crypto Treasury Strategy . What does this mean for the company, and more broadly, for the burgeoning trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption ? What’s Behind SharpLink Gaming’s Massive Ethereum ETH Acquisition? Just five hours ago, as reported by EmberCN on X, citing data from Arkham, SharpLink Gaming finalized its latest substantial purchase of Ethereum. This isn’t their first foray into digital assets, but the sheer scale of this particular acquisition underscores a growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value and its role in a diversified corporate treasury. For a Nasdaq-listed entity, such a public and significant commitment to a volatile asset like Ethereum speaks volumes. SharpLink Gaming, primarily known for its sports betting and iGaming technology, is now making headlines in the crypto world. Their decision to pour tens of millions into Ethereum suggests more than just speculation. It points towards a deliberate and evolving strategy to integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. This bold step positions them as a pioneer among traditional companies exploring the vast potential of the crypto economy, moving beyond mere curiosity to tangible Digital Asset Investment . Decoding SharpLink Gaming’s Strategic Crypto Treasury Strategy Why would a gaming company, operating in a regulated and established industry, pivot so strongly towards cryptocurrency? The answer lies in the evolving landscape of corporate finance and the increasing recognition of digital assets as legitimate stores of value and strategic tools. A Crypto Treasury Strategy involves a company holding cryptocurrencies on its balance sheet, much like it would hold fiat currencies, gold, or other traditional investments. Benefits of a Crypto Treasury Strategy: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, cryptocurrencies, particularly those with deflationary mechanisms like Ethereum, are seen by some as a hedge against the depreciation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding uncorrelated assets like crypto can diversify a company’s treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Potential Appreciation: Companies like SharpLink Gaming may believe in the long-term growth potential of Ethereum, viewing it as an appreciating asset that could significantly boost their balance sheet over time. Innovation and Brand Positioning: Embracing digital assets can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach, attracting talent and customers interested in Web3 and decentralized technologies. Operational Utility: For a gaming company, holding Ethereum could also be strategic for future Web3 gaming initiatives, NFT integrations, or decentralized finance (DeFi) applications within their ecosystem. Challenges and Considerations: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. SharpLink Gaming’s substantial Ethereum ETH holding means they are exposed to significant price swings, which could impact their quarterly earnings and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Companies holding digital assets must navigate complex and often unclear rules regarding accounting, taxation, and compliance. Security Risks: Storing large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to protect against hacks, phishing, and other digital threats. SharpLink’s focus on Ethereum, specifically, is notable. Ethereum is not just a digital currency; it’s the backbone of a vast ecosystem encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized applications. Its ongoing transition to Ethereum 2.0 (Serenity) and upgrades like Dencun aim to enhance its scalability and efficiency, potentially increasing its utility and value. This makes Ethereum ETH a compelling choice for companies looking beyond simple price speculation towards foundational blockchain technology. The Accelerating Trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption SharpLink Gaming’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a potent symbol of a broader, accelerating trend: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrencies through Institutional Crypto Adoption . What was once considered a fringe asset class is now firmly on the radar of corporate treasurers, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds. For years, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has been the poster child for corporate Bitcoin adoption, accumulating billions of dollars worth of BTC on its balance sheet. Tesla also famously made a significant Bitcoin purchase, albeit with some subsequent adjustments. Now, with companies like SharpLink Gaming making substantial commitments to Ethereum, the narrative is shifting from just Bitcoin to a broader acceptance of leading altcoins as legitimate treasury assets. This trend has several profound implications: Market Legitimacy: When publicly traded companies invest heavily in crypto, it lends an air of legitimacy and maturity to the market, attracting more conservative investors. Increased Liquidity: Institutional participation brings significant capital, which can enhance market liquidity and potentially stabilize prices over the long term. Infrastructure Development: The growing demand from institutions spurs the development of more robust and secure custodial solutions, trading platforms, and regulatory frameworks. Shifting Perceptions: It challenges the traditional view of crypto as purely speculative, repositioning it as a viable asset class for strategic corporate finance. The fact that a gaming company is leading this charge with Ethereum is particularly interesting. The gaming industry is at the forefront of exploring Web3 technologies, including NFTs and blockchain-based gaming. SharpLink’s investment could be seen as a strategic alignment with the future direction of interactive entertainment, where Digital Asset Investment might become commonplace for developers and publishers. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Investment for Corporations As more companies consider integrating cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies, the experience of pioneers like SharpLink Gaming provides valuable lessons. The journey into Digital Asset Investment requires careful planning, robust risk management, and a clear understanding of the underlying technology and market dynamics. Actionable Insights for Companies Considering Crypto: Define Clear Objectives: Is the goal capital appreciation, diversification, hedging, or operational integration? Conduct Thorough Due Diligence: Understand the specific cryptocurrencies, their technology, market capitalization, and regulatory status. Develop a Robust Security Framework: Partner with reputable custodians and implement best practices for digital asset security. Engage Legal and Tax Experts: Navigate the complex legal and tax implications of holding and transacting in cryptocurrencies. Communicate Transparently: Inform shareholders and the public about the rationale and risks involved in a crypto treasury strategy. For individual investors, the increasing Institutional Crypto Adoption by companies like SharpLink Gaming can be seen as a bullish signal. It suggests a growing conviction among sophisticated financial players that digital assets, particularly Ethereum, are here to stay and will play a significant role in the global economy. It reinforces the idea that the crypto market is maturing beyond its early, speculative phase. The future promises a deeper convergence of traditional corporate finance with the decentralized world of blockchain. SharpLink Gaming’s strategic move with Ethereum ETH is a testament to this evolving landscape, setting a precedent for how other companies might approach their own digital asset journeys. SharpLink Gaming’s substantial investment in Ethereum is far more than a simple purchase; it’s a strategic declaration of intent. It highlights the growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem, validates the concept of a corporate Crypto Treasury Strategy , and underscores the accelerating trend of Institutional Crypto Adoption . As companies continue to explore the vast potential of Digital Asset Investment , SharpLink Gaming stands out as a bold innovator, charting a course that many others may soon follow in the exciting intersection of gaming and blockchain technology. This masterstroke could well be a blueprint for the corporate treasuries of tomorrow.

This pullback comes as many investors decided to lock in profits at record levels that pushed to $116,700, when writing. While the market still appears structurally bullish, recent data and insights suggest a short-term consolidation might be underway before continuing another leg up. Profit-Taking Drives Market Pullback In Bitcoin Price Chart According to on-chain data from Glassnode, the correction strongly aligns with a significant spike in the realized profits. In total, investors realized over $3.5 billion in profits. Notably, long-term holders (LTHs) accounted for $1.96 billion, while short-term holders (STHs) contributed $1.54 billion. This level of profit realization by LTHs suggests a maturity in market participation instead of a newbie move. These kinds of investors are identified as those individuals or institutions who typically accumulate during bear phases and selectively offload during high volatility or market peaks. The current wave of profit booking shows that many LTHs saw the $123K milestone as a strategic exit point for partial gains. Over the past 24 hours, #Bitcoin investors realized $3.5B in profits.

According to Mister Crypto, the recent decline could be healthy in the broader uptrend. In his view, if Bitcoin price revisits the EMA ribbons, which are aligned near the $110K level, which is also June’s previous high, it could create an ideal bounce scenario. TradingView He also hinted that in strong bullish trends, the EMA ribbons tend to act as dynamic support. If Bitcoin tests this zone and holds, it may quickly reverse higher, potentially targeting $135K in the next leg up. Institutional Holdings Reflect Long-Term Optimism In BTC Adding to the longer-term bullish backdrop, Mister Crypto also highlighted that Bitcoin Treasury companies, which include public firms holding BTC on their balance sheets, now collectively hold more than half the amount of Bitcoin currently held by all ETFs combined. This indicates that long-term institutional interest is not only growing but may be more influential than Bitcoin ETF flows alone. Such holdings often reflect strategic positioning rather than short-term speculation, suggesting that large players still view Bitcoin as a viable long-term store of value.

Key Takeaways: 3IQ’s XRP ETF surpassed $50 million in assets within weeks. The ETF is among North America’s first publicly traded XRP vehicles. Bloomberg analysts now place the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval in the US at 95% The fund, listed as XRPQ and XRPQ.U on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is attracting investors with its zero management fees during the introductory six-month period, according to a Monday press release by 3IQ . The ETF provides direct exposure to XRP, with holdings sourced exclusively from regulated trading platforms and over-the-counter counterparties. One of North America’s First Publicly Traded XRP Investment Vehicles 3IQ’s XRP ETH stands out as one of the first publicly traded vehicles in North America to offer such access to XRP. As reported, the fund also amassed CAD 23 million ($16.7 million) in assets under management within just 72 hours of its launch. XRPQ entered the market with momentum, supported by a six-month 0% management fee and direct investment from Ripple itself. 3IQ President and CEO Pascal St-Jean noted the milestone as a sign of growing investor sophistication. “Retail and institutional investors are becoming increasingly discerning with their allocations, selecting this asset which offers a combination of the flexibility that comes with exchange-traded funds, combined with the 0% management fee at launch that contrasts with the higher premiums which were the hallmark of earlier digital asset ETFs.” Assets in the XRPQ fund are secured in fully segregated cold storage, ensuring robust security for investors. The ETF is also available for registered accounts across Canada and accessible to international investors where compliant. We are proud to announce that our XRP ETF (TSX: XRPQ, XRPQ.U), Canada’s largest #XRP ETF, has accumulated over 50 million USD in client assets since its launch on June 18th. “This significant milestone for our XRP ETF shows the continuing strong interest in these assets and… pic.twitter.com/rpi3BmwE3W — 3iQ Digital Asset Management (@3iq_corp) July 14, 2025 On June 11, VivoPower, a publicly listed firm, announced a partnership with the Flare blockchain to generate yield from its XRP holdings. The move could indicate that institutional players are looking for ways to leverage their crypto assets without liquidating them. In May, VivoPower also invested $121 million in XRP as a strategic reserve, making it the first company in the world with an XRP-focused treasury. XRP ETF Approval Odds Jump to 95% As reported, Bloomberg analysts now place the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval at 95% , fueling renewed speculation around institutional capital inflows and a potential shift in crypto market dynamics. The SEC has already acknowledged XRP’s 19b-4 filings, with a final decision expected by October 17, 2025. Last week, US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded over $1 billion in inflows for two straight days. On Friday, 11 spot Bitcoin ETF products reported combined inflows totaling $1.03 billion, following $1.17 billion the previous day. Recently, BlackRock reported earning more revenue from IBIT than from its flagship iShares Core S&P 500 ETF.

2025-07-15T08:27:20,"BTC Price Live Today—Don’t Panic: Bitcoin’s Correction Could Be the Setup for the Next Leg Up","The post BTC Price Live Today—Don’t Panic: Bitcoin’s Correction Could Be the Setup for the Next Leg Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin price has entered a corrective phase after an impressive upward rally that pushed prices to a new ATH above $122,000 . This recent pullback is being viewed by market participants as a natural part of its price cycle, often following extended bullish momentum. Rather than signaling a trend reversal, the consolidation reflects typical market behavior as traders reassess positioning. With strong underlying structure and buying interest at lower levels, the correction appears more like a healthy breather than a sign of weakness. What’s Behind the Latest Dip? The BTC price shocked everyone, recording the highest weekly close, followed by a new ATH at the beginning of the week. Meanwhile, the price saw a surge in the bearish pressure soon after marking highs with a drop in bull dominance. Here are a few reasons that caused the latest Bitcoin drop. Profit-taking was triggered after the price marked a new ATH, which is a typical pattern after a strong rally The long-to-short ratio flipped negative , showing a clear drop in bull dominance as traders started shorting aggressively The Fear & Greed Index is hovering around 70 , which is a signal that sentiment is greedy and ripe for short-term pullbacks. Why is this Bitcoin price correction healthy? After a massive rally, the bulls have drained their strength, which has paved the way for the bears to ramp up their activity. Despite this, the current BTC correction appears to be a healthy one, and here are a few reasons: Corrective phases reset overheated signals: Corrections cool off overbought market structures—important for sustaining long-term uptrends. On-chain behaviour shows limited profit-taking : Short-term holder SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) remains subdued, implying most investors are not selling, suggesting this is not a capitulation phase. Strong institutional and legislative tailwinds : Ongoing U.S. regulatory progress (e.g., GENIUS, CLARITY Acts) and institutional Bitcoin accumulation continue to underpin long-term confidence. Macro backdrop remains supportive: Expectations of interest rate cuts later this year and broader investor appetite for crypto-assets continue to favour upside over time. Here are the Crucial Levels to Monitor The Bitcoin price witnessed a steep drop over the past few hours, causing a pullback of over 5% from the highs. Meanwhile, the price is trying to find a base around the local support zone between $116,594 and $116,892. The buying pressure has dropped as the selling volume has decreased. As a result, the price is primed to test the crucial support in a short while, which may further trigger a rebound. The short-term price action shows the price plunging heavily, which has dragged the stochRSI into the oversold range. The levels are preparing for a rebound, and if this materializes, then the price may experience a notable shift. Until then, both the possibility of a rebound to $118,500 or a drop to $115,260 could be in place. These are the crucial levels to monitor, as a rise or drop from these levels could impact the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally accordingly.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/btc-price-live-today-dont-panic-bitcoins-correction-could-be-the-setup-for-the-next-leg-up/,"TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T08:20:24,"Coinbase’s Astounding $100 Billion Milestone Amidst Bitcoin’s Record Surge","BitcoinWorld Coinbase’s Astounding $100 Billion Milestone Amidst Bitcoin’s Record Surge The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement, and for good reason! We’ve just witnessed a truly remarkable moment as Coinbase, one of the leading names in digital assets, achieved a monumental feat: its Coinbase market capitalization soared past the $100 billion mark. This incredible milestone coincided perfectly with Bitcoin hitting a fresh Bitcoin all-time-high unit price, signaling a powerful bull run across the entire crypto ecosystem. Understanding Coinbase’s Historic Achievement It’s not every day a company crosses the $100 billion valuation threshold, especially one rooted in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. As reported by The Block, Coinbase officially closed with a market capitalization of $100.36 billion. This was driven by its Coinbase stock price reaching $394.01, up a solid 1.8%, marking its highest close since going public in April 2021. The stock even touched an intraday high of $398.50, showcasing immense investor confidence. So, what exactly does a $100 billion market capitalization signify for Coinbase? Legitimacy: It solidifies Coinbase’s position as a major financial institution, bridging traditional finance with the burgeoning digital asset space. Investor Confidence: Such a valuation reflects strong belief from both retail and institutional investors in Coinbase’s business model and the future of crypto. Industry Benchmark: It sets a new standard for crypto-native companies, paving the way for others to follow suit in terms of growth and public market acceptance. What Fueled This Explosive Crypto Market Growth? Coinbase’s ascent isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s intrinsically linked to the broader bullish sentiment engulfing the crypto market growth . Several key factors have converged to create this perfect storm of positive momentum: Bitcoin’s Dominance: As the pioneering cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s rally often sets the tone for the entire market. Its sustained climb to new record highs has injected optimism and capital into altcoins and crypto-related businesses. Institutional Adoption: More and more institutional players, from hedge funds to major corporations, are allocating significant capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets. This influx of ‘smart money’ adds stability and credibility. Increased Retail Participation: The narrative around crypto has shifted from niche to mainstream. With easier access through platforms like Coinbase, millions of new retail investors are entering the space, driving demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Concerns over inflation and traditional asset performance have led many to view Bitcoin as a store of value or a hedge, similar to digital gold. The Significance for Your Digital Asset Investment Strategy For anyone involved in or considering digital asset investment , Coinbase’s milestone offers valuable insights. It underscores the increasing maturity and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. While volatility remains a characteristic of the market, the sustained growth and institutional interest suggest a fundamental shift in how assets are perceived and valued. What are the benefits of this milestone? Enhanced Trust: A highly valued, publicly traded company like Coinbase adds a layer of trust and regulation to an often-unregulated market. Innovation Acceleration: Strong market performance encourages more investment in blockchain technology, leading to new products and services. Wider Accessibility: As major players grow, they typically improve user experience and expand offerings, making crypto more accessible to everyone. Are there challenges or considerations? While the news is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market, and consequently Coinbase, are still subject to certain challenges: Regulatory Landscape: Governments worldwide are still developing frameworks for crypto, which can introduce uncertainty. Market Volatility: Despite its growth, the crypto market can experience rapid price swings. Competition: The exchange landscape is competitive, with new players constantly emerging. Looking Ahead: The Future is Bright Coinbase’s remarkable achievement is more than just a financial headline; it’s a powerful indicator of the growing mainstream adoption and undeniable potential of the digital economy. As Bitcoin continues to forge new paths and the broader crypto market matures, companies like Coinbase will play a pivotal role in shaping the financial landscape of tomorrow. This milestone isn’t just about one company’s success; it’s a testament to the collective belief in a decentralized, digitally-driven future. It’s an exciting time to be part of this revolution.

2025-07-15T08:19:56,"AI predicts XRP price for August 1, 2025","Two artificial intelligence (AI) models are predicting that XRP’s current momentum is likely to push the asset above $3 on August 1. Notably, XRP has broken through key resistance zones in recent sessions, aligning with the broader market rally fueled by Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) new record high above $123,000. The surge saw XRP briefly touch $3 before retracing to $2.86 at press time. That price marks a 3.5% drop over the past 24 hours, though the asset remains up 26% on the week. XRP one-week price chart. Source: Finbold For its price forecast, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which offered several scenarios for XRP. ChatGPT predicts XRP price ChatGPT, analyzing technical patterns and market sentiment, predicts that XRP will trade between $2.95 and $3.15 by August 1. Its single-point prediction puts the token at $3.08, an 8% increase from current levels. The AI model noted that XRP has already broken past key resistance near $2.50 and is now consolidating just below the psychologically important $3 mark, a setup that is often bullish in the short term. However, the model cautioned that resistance between $3 and $3.10 remains strong and may be hard to break without a major catalyst. To this end, XRP’s history suggests 5% to 15% moves when consolidating near resistance. Still, the current market environment, described as “greedy but not euphoric”, might support moderate gains rather than explosive rallies. AI price reduction for XRP. Source: ChatGPT Grok predicts XRP price On the other hand, Grok, another AI model, also predicts further upside for XRP, with a target slightly higher at $3.10 by August 1. Its estimate factors in continued bullish momentum, improved regulatory clarity, and strong trading volume. Grok also sees the potential for XRP to test $3.20, though it warned of a possible dip to $2.90 if overbought conditions trigger a pullback. Ultimately, XRP’s ability to hit the expected $3 level will depend on how Bitcoin performs, as the asset has closely mirrored the leading cryptocurrency’s trading patterns. At the same time, if profit-taking accelerates in the coming days, XRP risks losing its $2.50 support, making it harder to reclaim the $3 mark.

While most altcoins display substantial bearishness, Yesnoerror’s YNE decoupled with massive gains. It has surged over 80% over the past 24 hours, driven by AI-related ecosystem developments. Yesnoerror creator Matt Schlicht has hinted at revamping the platform using Elon Musk’s Grok 4. Also, behind-the-scenes moves involving artificial intelligence giant Anthropic added to YNE’s bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the altcoin turned bullish after a flurry of intriguing posts from the project. On July 10, Matt revealed plans to integrate Grok 4 “to scan research papers for errors.” What followed is a series of posts featuring phrases like “YNE summer” and “alpha-detection initializing,” revealing how Yesnoerror will leverage artificial intelligence to democratize decentralized science (DeSci). Meanwhile, today’s explosive gains came after the project’s creator confirmed late-night developments aimed at building tools that Anthropic’s co-founder, Jack Clark, requested. These advanced tools help uncover “AI alpha” in research papers or arXiv, a platform where experts first publish scientific work. “Last night, the co-founder of $60B+ Anthropic told me the 4 tools he needs in order to improve how he finds AI alpha in arXiv research papers. I am sitting down to build 3/4 of the tools requested.

Notably, Jack Clack outlined four tools that will enhance his ability to identify cherished insights in AI research. Meanwhile, the YNE creator started working immediately, building three of the four requested tools overnight. He promises to finalize the last one and share all with the Anthropic co-founder in the next 24 hours. Tomorrow, I will send Jack Clark early access so that he can start using Yesnoerror to accelerate AnthropicAI and provide us with his next requests. YNE price outlook The native token exhibits robust bullishness after gaining over 80% in the past 24 hours. YNE changed hands at $0.007328, with a 250% increase in daily trading volume signaling a renewed interest in the altcoin. Chart by Coinmarketcap The digital token appears ready for extended upsurges. Moreover, AI utility positions YNE for steady long-term performance. The project will token-gate access to its advanced research tools using the native coin. That means increased opportunities for YNE holders. Furthermore, the Yesnoerror community can expect access to resources previously reserved for insiders. Matt affirmed: We’re democratizing the research intelligence tools that billion-dollar AI companies use to stay ahead. Access the same AI alpha-detection methods used by top VCs and AI executives. YNE’s rally appears organic and not highly speculative. Thus, the digital currency will possibly gain more in the coming hours. However, continued broad market dips and potential profit-booking by YNE investors could limit the upside.
