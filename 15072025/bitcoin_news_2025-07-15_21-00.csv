2025-07-15T18:54:24,"No Euphoria in Bitcoin Markets but Warning Signs Are Starting to Appear (Analyst)","Bitcoin’s record-setting rally may be nearing a crucial inflection point, with on-chain data showing an increase in large-scale Bitcoin deposits to Binance. According to an expert at the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, this could point to big-money investors possibly preparing for strategic exits or leveraged plays. Whale Moves Signal Market Shift BTC reached a new all-time high (ATH) above $123,000 on July 14, before retreating to the $117,000 neighborhood. This correction may appear modest on the surface, but deeper market signals suggest more turbulence could be ahead. In a recent “quick take,” pseudonymous CQ analyst Crazzyblock noted that the “Binance Whale Activity Score” had spiked sharply following Bitcoin’s latest peak. And it isn’t a minor movement either; it represents a coordinated shift by major players. According to him, approximately 1,800 BTC, worth more than $210 million at current rates, flowed into Binance deposits yesterday alone. Additionally, transactions exceeding $1 million accounted for over 35% of total Bitcoin inflows to the world’s largest exchange, confirming the presence of institutional-sized wallets. Just as importantly, CryptoQuant’s age-band data showed that these aren’t coins from recent buyers, but rather older holdings from experienced, strategic investors re-entering the active market. Given Binance’s status as the world’s largest crypto trading venue, commanding over 25% of global spot volume, such moves warrant closer scrutiny. It implies whales may be positioning assets on the most liquid platform to either secure profits after the historic run or to use the exchange’s deep derivatives markets for hedging and new positions amidst peak volatility. “Either way, the presence of this much ‘sell-side’ pressure on the market’s primary trading venue increases the risk of sharp price swings,” wrote Crazzyblock. “The smart money is moving, and their actions often precede significant market shifts.” Euphoria Yet to Kick In Interestingly, this whale-driven shift is coming at a time when bullish sentiment is dominating headlines. Bitcoin’s rise to a new ATH triggered a wave of price forecasts, with some market watchers predicting the cryptocurrency could be changing hands at $200,000 each by year’s end. However, behind the optimism lies a more measured market structure. CQ’s proprietary greed indicators remain in neutral territory, and the rHODL ratio sits at just 32%, indicating that broader retail participation still hasn’t materialized, an essential ingredient for true market euphoria. The latest price movements hint at this brewing tension, with the asset seemingly stepping back from the heat of its last breakout. Data from CoinGecko shows the number one cryptocurrency is trading at $117,496 at the time of this writing, down nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. Still, it’s up almost 9% for the week and 11.3% across the past month, outperforming legacy markets but falling just short of the broader crypto sector, which gained 9.2% over seven days.

According to the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows report , institutional investors coughed up $3.7 billion in crypto inflows last week alone. “Digital asset investment products saw inflows of $3.7 billion last week, marking the 2nd largest weekly inflow on record. Notably, July 10th recorded the third-highest daily inflow ever. This also represents the 13th consecutive week of inflows, bringing the cumulative total to $21.8 billion and pushing year-to-date (YTD) inflows to $22.7 billion. Assets under management (AuM) surged past the US $200 billion threshold for the first time, reaching a new record of $211 billion. ETP (exchange-traded product) trading volumes reached $29 billion, twice this year’s weekly average.” Source: CoinShares The US led globally with $3.7 billion worth of inflows. Switzerland and Canada followed with $65.8 million and $17.1 million in inflows, respectively, while Germany suffered outflows to the tune of $86 million. Top crypto asset by market cap Bitcoin ( BTC ), per usual, enjoyed the lion’s share of inflows at $2.7 billion. “For the first time, this equals 54% of the total AuM held in gold ETPs. Short Bitcoin ETPs showed minimal activity.” Ethereum ( ETH ) continued its 12-week run of inflows with $990 million last week. Meanwhile, XRP and Solana ( SOL ) also enjoyed large inflows of $104 million and $92.6 million, respectively.

2025-07-15T18:40:40,"MOEX to offer futures tracking the value of Ethereum","Russia’s largest stock market, the Moscow Exchange, will soon offer futures contracts tracking the price of Ethereum, the biggest cryptocurrency by market cap after Bitcoin. The platform said it will also present futures on U.S. treasury bonds – a first in the Russian Federation, where the growing yield of American government securities has caught the attention of investors. Russians to start trading futures on ETH The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) plans to launch two new futures contracts in August, one of which will be tied to the value of the second most popular cryptocurrency, while the other will track the market dynamics of U.S. government securities. The exchange intends to begin trading a futures contract on an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in Ethereum (ETH), Maria Patrikeeva, managing director of its derivatives market, told RBC during an investment forum, organized by the Russian business news outlet. Speaking on the sidelines of the Invest Weekend event, Patrikeeva elaborated: “The underlying asset will be an ETF for the largest fund from BlackRock, the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, which invests in Ethereum. Its quote will be equal to the cost of one share of the fund, the contract size will be slightly less than IBIT.” The announcement of the ETF-based product comes after, in early June, MOEX started trading Bitcoin futures, following the Central Bank of Russia’s decision to allow the offering of crypto derivatives to qualified investors in the country. Besides MOEX, a number of other major players in the Russian financial market have also launched crypto-linked instruments, including Russia’s largest bank by assets, the state-controlled Sber, and the leading Russian broker Finam. The contracts, the first batch of which expires in September, are on the shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which tracks the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization. MOEX also prepares to offer a futures contract based on its own Bitcoin index . BTC recently reached a historic high, exceeding $123,000 per coin on Monday, although it has since dropped below $120,000. Late on July 14, the IBIT futures were trading at around $70 per contract while one share of its underlying asset, the IBIT fund, was under $76 on the NASDAQ exchange, RBC noted. By June 27, the open net positions of retail investors in Bitcoin futures on the Moscow Exchange reached 1.25 billion rubles (over $16 million), Russia’s monetary authority revealed in its latest “Overview of Financial Market Risks” report for last month. Russian investors to speculate on U.S. debt The other instrument that the Moscow Exchange will offer next month will be based on an ETF investing in long-term U.S. Treasury bonds – the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF. The MOEX contract will be based on the value of one share of this fund. The average maturity of the bonds in the ETF portfolio is nearly 26 years, and the effective duration of the government securities is 15.7 years, Maria Patrikeeva detailed. The yield on long-term U.S. Treasury bonds has grown significantly, to almost 5%, since President Donald Trump announced he’s going to raise import duties, RBC remarked. It also highlighted that this will be the first futures contract on the Moscow Exchange that tracks the dynamics of U.S. debt securities. MOEX is already providing Russian investors with access to about a dozen contracts with underlying assets in the form of shares of funds based on S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones, as well as indexes of European and Asian stock markets. As part of a plan to expand the geography of its derivative offerings, the Russian exchange announced earlier that it will launch two futures contracts on shares traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, those of Chinese tech giants Tencent and Xiaomi.

2025-07-15T18:30:18,"Stablecoin Growth Accelerates: $235B Market Cap Reflects Rising Crypto Liquidity","Stablecoins have emerged as the fastest-growing sector in the crypto market since the beginning of this cycle, playing a critical role in driving liquidity, market stability, and cross-border transactions. Their explosive growth has now placed them at the center of regulatory discussions, especially during this week’s highly anticipated “Crypto Week” in Washington. US lawmakers are currently reviewing the Genius Act, a pivotal bill aimed at defining the legal framework for stablecoins in the United States. The outcome of this legislation could shape how dollar-backed digital assets are issued, regulated, and integrated into the broader financial system—impacting institutions, developers, and investors alike. Meanwhile, market data from CryptoQuant shows that Tether (USDT) continues to dominate the stablecoin landscape, commanding 68% of the market share. USD Coin (USDC) follows with 27%, while newer entrants like USDE hold 2.2%. Binance’s BUSD now trails at just 1.5%, reflecting its gradual phase-out. Stablecoins Fuel Market Liquidity Top analyst Darkfost has highlighted a critical development in the crypto market: the total market cap of stablecoins has now climbed to $235 billion. This steady increase is more than just a number—it’s a clear signal that liquidity continues to flow into the digital asset space, even as prices experience short-term volatility. The rising stablecoin supply suggests that capital is being parked on-chain, ready to deploy across trading, DeFi, and institutional strategies. Stablecoins have become the primary liquidity engine behind Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Their utility as dollar-pegged, low-volatility assets makes them ideal for trading, hedging, and transferring value without relying on traditional banks. In essence, they are the bridge between traditional finance and crypto—connecting centralized capital with decentralized infrastructure. With “Crypto Week” underway in Washington, stablecoins are under the spotlight. US legislators are expected to make critical decisions that could shape the way these assets function within both the crypto space and the traditional financial system. If regulators move toward supportive and well-defined guidelines, adoption and issuance could accelerate rapidly. Analysts expect that legal clarity around stablecoins will not only boost investor confidence but also open the door for more institutional participation. Given their central role in liquidity flows, any positive outcome from this week’s debates could fuel the next wave of capital entering crypto markets—solidifying stablecoins as essential infrastructure for the digital economy. As liquidity builds, the groundwork for a broader market expansion continues to strengthen. Dominance Holds at 7.28% as Market Liquidity Builds The weekly chart of stablecoin dominance shows that they currently account for 7.28% of the total crypto market, a level that has held relatively steady in recent months. Despite the recent surge in total market cap to $235 billion, dominance has remained within a sideways range, suggesting that liquidity is flowing into both stablecoins and crypto assets simultaneously—rather than moving defensively into stables as seen during previous bear cycles. Notably, the chart shows dominance falling below all major moving averages: the 50-week (7.73%), 100-week (7.97%), and 200-week (9.31%) SMAs. This suggests that while stablecoin issuance is rising in absolute terms, its share of total market value is shrinking as Bitcoin and altcoins outperform. This is typically seen during early to mid-stage bull markets, when capital begins rotating from stablecoins into risk-on assets. Historically, sharp spikes in dominance have coincided with periods of market stress, while declines have marked expansion phases. The current stability around 7% reflects a balanced environment where liquidity remains available, but market participants are comfortable holding volatile assets.

2025-07-15T18:20:04,"Bitcoin’s Remarkable Stability: Deutsche Bank Confirms Maturing Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Remarkable Stability: Deutsche Bank Confirms Maturing Crypto Market In a significant development for the digital asset world, Bitcoin , the pioneering cryptocurrency, is increasingly demonstrating characteristics of a mature asset class. This transformation is underscored by a recent report from Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest commercial bank, which highlights a notable decline in Bitcoin’s volatility. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a profound shift signaling a new era for the crypto market , one where stability and broader acceptance are becoming the norm rather than the exception. Understanding Bitcoin Volatility: A Journey Towards Stability For years, Bitcoin volatility was synonymous with its identity. Its price swings were legendary, offering both exhilarating gains and gut-wrenching losses. This inherent unpredictability often deterred traditional investors and large institutions, who prioritize stability and predictable returns. However, Deutsche Bank’s analysis, as reported by CoinDesk, reveals a compelling narrative: despite Bitcoin’s record-breaking rallies, its volatility has significantly decreased. What does this mean for the future of digital assets? Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements were heavily influenced by retail investor sentiment, news cycles, and speculative trading. Large price swings could occur with minimal trading volume. Now, the landscape is evolving. Increased liquidity, a wider array of sophisticated trading instruments, and the entry of more diverse participants are collectively contributing to a more stable environment. This shift is crucial for Bitcoin to transcend its ‘speculative asset’ label and be recognized as a legitimate investment vehicle. Consider the factors that typically drive asset volatility: Market Depth: A shallow market, where large orders can significantly impact price, leads to higher volatility. As Bitcoin’s market depth grows, it can absorb larger trades with less impact. Investor Demographics: A market dominated by short-term speculators tends to be more volatile. The influx of long-term holders and institutional investors mitigates this. Regulatory Clarity: Uncertainty breeds volatility. Clear regulations reduce risk premiums and foster confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Like traditional assets, Bitcoin is increasingly influenced by global economic trends, interest rates, and inflation, indicating its integration into the broader financial system. The observed volatility decline is not accidental; it’s a consequence of fundamental changes within the Bitcoin ecosystem. The Unstoppable March of Institutional Adoption One of the primary catalysts behind Bitcoin’s newfound stability is the surging wave of institutional adoption . What began as a niche interest for tech-savvy individuals has now captured the attention, and capital, of some of the world’s most conservative financial entities. Pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and large asset managers are no longer just observing; many are actively allocating capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets. Why are these traditional giants entering the fray? The answer lies in diversification, inflation hedging potential, and the recognition of Bitcoin as a legitimate, albeit nascent, asset class. Their entry brings significant capital, but more importantly, it brings a long-term investment horizon. Unlike retail traders who might panic sell during downturns, institutions often buy and hold, providing a strong floor for the market. This long-term perspective naturally dampens short-term price fluctuations. Examples of increasing institutional interest include: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets, opening doors for regulated access. Major financial institutions like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest launching their own Bitcoin-related products. Corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Traditional banks exploring blockchain technology and digital asset services. This institutional embrace is a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s evolving status. It signifies a maturation from a fringe asset to one increasingly integrated into the global financial fabric. Is Increased Regulation a Blessing for the Crypto Market? For many early crypto enthusiasts, the idea of regulation was anathema, seen as an encroachment on the decentralized ethos. However, the reality is that increased regulatory clarity is proving to be a significant boon for the entire crypto market . Deutsche Bank’s report specifically highlights this aspect as a key driver of stability. Regulation brings legitimacy, reduces risks for investors, and fosters a safer environment for innovation. When financial products are regulated, they become more accessible to a broader range of investors, particularly the institutional players mentioned earlier, who operate under strict compliance mandates. Clear rules around custody, trading, and asset classification build trust and encourage participation. Consider the benefits of a well-regulated crypto environment: Aspect Impact of Regulation Investor Protection Reduces fraud, enhances transparency, provides recourse for investors. Market Integrity Combats market manipulation, ensures fair trading practices. Institutional Participation Provides legal and compliance frameworks for large entities to engage. Innovation & Growth Creates a predictable environment for businesses to build and expand. While the path to comprehensive global crypto regulation is still unfolding, the progress made so far has undeniably contributed to the observed reduction in Bitcoin’s volatility. It’s a clear signal that the industry is moving towards a more structured and robust future. Deutsche Bank’s Profound Perspective: A Game Changer? The fact that Deutsche Bank , a titan of traditional finance with a history spanning over 150 years, is issuing such a report on Bitcoin’s maturity is incredibly significant. For a long time, major banks maintained a skeptical, if not outright dismissive, stance towards cryptocurrencies. Their pivot, even if cautious, signals a broader acceptance within the traditional financial establishment. Deutsche Bank’s analysis isn’t merely an observation; it’s an acknowledgment that Bitcoin is evolving into an asset class that warrants serious consideration alongside traditional investments. When a bank of this stature highlights decreasing volatility and the role of institutional adoption, it lends immense credibility to the cryptocurrency space. This perspective can influence other major financial players and even policymakers, accelerating the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Their report validates the long-held belief by crypto proponents that Bitcoin, despite its turbulent youth, possesses the fundamental characteristics to become a resilient and enduring store of value. It’s a powerful endorsement that could encourage more conservative investors, like pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, to explore allocations to digital assets, further solidifying the market’s stability. Navigating the Future: What Does Reduced Volatility Mean for Investors? The continued volatility decline in Bitcoin presents both opportunities and considerations for investors. For long-term holders and those looking for a store of value, reduced volatility makes Bitcoin a far more appealing proposition. It mitigates the risk of sudden, drastic losses, allowing for a more predictable investment experience. Benefits for Investors: Increased Appeal to Conservative Investors: Pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds can now consider Bitcoin more seriously for long-term diversification. Enhanced Portfolio Stability: For portfolios that include Bitcoin, reduced volatility can lead to smoother overall returns and lower risk. Foundation for Financial Products: A more stable Bitcoin facilitates the development of more sophisticated financial products, such as lending, borrowing, and derivatives, further integrating it into the financial system. Greater Predictability: While no asset is entirely predictable, lower volatility allows for more reliable long-term financial planning. Challenges and Considerations: Not Zero Volatility: It’s crucial to remember that ‘reduced’ volatility does not mean ‘zero’ volatility. Bitcoin will still experience price swings, albeit less extreme ones. Macroeconomic Influences: As Bitcoin integrates, it becomes more susceptible to global economic factors like inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical events. Market Maturation vs. Growth Potential: Some early investors might lament the loss of extreme volatility, which offered opportunities for rapid, large gains. However, maturity often comes with more sustainable, albeit slower, growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: Long-Term Horizon: Embrace Bitcoin as a long-term asset. Its value proposition strengthens over extended periods, especially with declining volatility. Diversification: While more stable, Bitcoin should still be part of a diversified portfolio, not its sole component. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments and institutional movements, as these will continue to shape the market. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. Even with reduced volatility, Bitcoin remains a dynamic asset. A New Dawn for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market The findings from Deutsche Bank paint a clear picture: Bitcoin is shedding its wild west image and maturing into a sophisticated financial asset. The convergence of declining volatility , increasing institutional adoption , and growing regulatory clarity is fundamentally reshaping the entire crypto market . This evolution is not just a statistical anomaly; it’s a profound transformation that makes Bitcoin increasingly appealing to a broader spectrum of investors, from individual enthusiasts to massive sovereign wealth funds. The endorsement from a venerable institution like Deutsche Bank serves as a powerful signal, reinforcing the idea that digital assets are here to stay and will play an increasingly vital role in the global financial landscape. As Bitcoin continues its journey towards greater stability, it opens up unprecedented opportunities for long-term growth and integration, promising a future where digital assets are a cornerstone of diverse investment portfolios.

This pivotal investment, spearheaded by industry giant Galaxy Digital, with key participation from Antalpha and Mantle, marks a resounding vote of confidence in Function’s vision and its flagship product, FBTC. Function Crypto: Powering the Future of Digital Assets Have you ever wondered what truly underpins the rapidly expanding world of cryptocurrencies? It’s not just about the digital coins themselves, but the robust, secure, and scalable systems that allow them to function. This is where Function Crypto steps in. As a dedicated crypto infrastructure firm, Function is committed to building the foundational layers necessary for the widespread adoption and seamless operation of digital assets. Think of it like the internet. While we see websites and applications, there’s a vast, complex infrastructure of servers, networks, and protocols working tirelessly behind the scenes. Similarly, for blockchain and cryptocurrencies, firms like Function are developing the essential tools, platforms, and services that enable everything from secure transactions to the creation of innovative financial products. Their work is crucial for bringing stability and efficiency to a dynamic ecosystem. Why This Strategic Seed Funding Round Matters The announcement of a $10 million seed funding round for Function Crypto is more than just a financial headline; it’s a powerful indicator of market sentiment and future direction. Led by Galaxy Digital, a prominent player in the digital asset and blockchain space, this investment underscores the growing institutional appetite for robust, reliable crypto solutions. The participation of Antalpha and Mantle further solidifies the broad industry support for Function’s mission. Why is a seed round of this magnitude so significant? Seed funding is typically the earliest stage of investment, often provided to promising startups to help them develop their product, build their team, and establish market presence. For Function, this $10 million injection means accelerated growth, enhanced product development, and the ability to scale their operations to meet the increasing demand for secure crypto infrastructure. It’s a testament to the potential investors see in Function’s ability to solve critical industry challenges. Strengthening the Core: The Importance of Robust Crypto Infrastructure The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, but it still faces challenges related to scalability, security, and regulatory clarity. This is precisely why strong crypto infrastructure is not just important, but absolutely vital for the industry’s continued growth and mainstream acceptance. Without reliable underlying systems, the promise of decentralized finance and digital assets remains largely unfulfilled. Function’s work directly addresses these challenges by building secure and efficient frameworks. Consider the implications: Enhanced Security: Protecting billions in digital assets requires state-of-the-art security protocols. Improved Scalability: As more users enter the space, the infrastructure must handle increased transaction volumes without compromising performance. Regulatory Compliance: Building systems that can adapt to evolving regulatory landscapes is key for institutional adoption. By focusing on these core areas, Function is not just creating products; they are contributing to the very stability and trustworthiness of the entire digital economy. Their infrastructure solutions pave the way for more institutions and individuals to confidently participate in the crypto space. Unpacking FBTC Bitcoin: A Pillar of Trust and Transparency At the heart of Function’s current success and future plans lies FBTC Bitcoin , their innovative fully reserved Bitcoin (BTC) product. With an impressive $1.5 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), FBTC has quickly established itself as a significant player in the ecosystem. But what does ‘fully reserved’ truly mean, and why is it so important? A fully reserved product means that for every unit of FBTC issued, there is an equivalent amount of actual Bitcoin held in reserve. This 1:1 backing provides unparalleled transparency and reduces counterparty risk, offering users and institutions a secure and verifiable way to interact with Bitcoin without directly holding the underlying asset. In a market where trust is paramount, FBTC stands out as a beacon of reliability. The $1.5 billion TVL signifies substantial confidence from the market, reflecting a strong demand for a transparent, auditable Bitcoin product. The new funding will directly support the expansion of FBTC, potentially leading to new features, broader accessibility, and even greater liquidity, further solidifying its position as a go-to reserved Bitcoin solution. The Broader Picture: Accelerating Digital Asset Investment Trends Function’s successful funding round is not an isolated event; it’s a clear signal within the broader landscape of digital asset investment . Institutional players like Galaxy Digital are increasingly looking beyond speculative trading to invest in the fundamental building blocks of the crypto economy. This shift indicates a maturing market where value is being recognized in the underlying technology and infrastructure rather than just the price volatility of individual assets. The commitment from major investors highlights several key trends: Focus on Utility: Investments are flowing into projects that offer real utility and solve tangible problems within the crypto space. Institutional Confidence: More traditional financial entities are entering the crypto market, bringing significant capital and demanding robust, compliant solutions. Long-Term Vision: Seed funding in infrastructure firms suggests a long-term belief in the growth and integration of digital assets into the global financial system. This investment in Function not only propels the company forward but also sends a powerful message to the wider market: the future of digital assets is being built on solid foundations, attracting serious capital and talent. A New Era for Bitcoin Infrastructure Function’s $10 million seed funding round is a monumental step, not just for the company, but for the entire crypto ecosystem.

2025-07-15T18:05:22,"Analyst Warns More Downside Likely for Bitcoin and Ethereum, With One Altcoin Far Outperforming the Competition","Analyst and trader Michaël van de Poppe is warning that the top two crypto assets by market cap may have deeper corrections as markets trade lower with new US data showing a rise in inflation. Van de Poppe tells his 795,100 followers on the social media platform X that after Bitcoin ( BTC ) printed new all-time highs and Ethereum ( ETH ) surged into the $3,000 range, the digital assets will likely start trending lower based on historical precedent. “Classic move on the markets here. Likely we’re going to be seeing some more downside on Bitcoin and Ethereum to squeeze out the longs. Remember: volatility goes up, price goes up. This means harsh corrections are around the corner.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Looking at his chart, the analyst suggests ETH may decline to the $2,750 level before a trend reversal. Bitcoin is trading for $116,947 at time of writing, down 5% from its all-time high of $122,838 on Monday. Meanwhile, Ethereum is trading for $3,048 at time of writing, up 19% in the last week. Next up, the analyst says that layer-1 blockchain SUI Network ( SUI ) is showing strong market fundamentals after regaining the $3 level, and he believes the digital asset has more upside potential. “Strongest ecosystems bounce back the strongest when a market is reversing. SUI is one of them. Did held strong support at $2.35 and started to rally substantially as it broke the downtrend. Crucial breakout above $3, and it’s basically into ‘buy the dip’ territory as it will be trading upwards.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading for $4.01 at time of writing, up 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-15T18:00:25,"A Breakout To Remember: Cardano Price Mirrors Market Conditions That Led To $3.10 ATH","Crypto analyst Scrambler has drawn attention to a bullish pattern that is forming for the Cardano price, which could lead to a massive breakout for the altcoin. The analyst noted that ADA might be repeating, with market conditions mirroring the ones that led to an all-time high (ATH). Cardano Prices Eyes 285% Rally To New Highs In a TradingView post, Scrambler predicted that the Cardano price could soon record a 285% rally to reach $2.05. He noted that the 285% potential move mirrors ADA’s past rally from similar conditions. The analyst added that if market sentiment continues improving and the Bitcoin price holds above key levels, then the altcoin might repeat history. Related Reading: Cardano Price Shows Seller Exhaustion Above $0.57 — Bullish Divergence Signals Rally Further commenting on the Cardano price action, Scrambler stated that ADA is showing a major breakout from a long-standing descending channel on the daily timeframe. He highlighted the structure, alluding to a downtrend channel that has been respected for around seven months. He also noted that a breakout has been confirmed with a strong bullish daily candle. Meanwhile, price is hovering around $0.7192, above previous resistance. Scrambler stated that the support levels for the Cardano price are $0.60 and $0.5299. The resistance and long-term targets are $0.8158, $1.0876, $1.3159, and $1.8958. Meanwhile, the ultimate target is the Fibonacci extension above $2.76. The analyst stated that a pullback to between $0.60 and $0.66 could offer re-entry opportunities. Regardless of what happens to the Cardano price in the short term, Scrambler remains bullish in the long term and expects ADA to reach new highs. The analyst also advised market participants to watch for the BTC/ETH correlation. It is worth noting that ADA has shown impressive strength amid this recent crypto market rally. The altcoin has risen by over 25% in the last seven days, despite a recent pullback. ADA To Breakout Against Its BTC Pair In an X post, crypto analyst Sebastian stated that the ADA/BTC chart appears to be ready for a breakout. The analyst added that this is the most important breakout that market participants want to see, with the Cardano price separating itself from the Bitcoin price. Once that happens, the altcoin is likely to outperform the flagship crypto during that period. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Announces $100 Million Bitcoin Buy In Shocking Move To Prop Up ADA Price Sebastian had earlier noted how Bitcoin’s dominance could be breaking down. Based on this, he remarked that alcoins like Cardano are about to rally if this happens. A break in Bitcoin’s dominance could usher in altcoin season, which is bullish for the Cardano price. In the meantime, ADA’s performance still hinges on BTC’s performance. At the time of writing, the Cardano price is trading at around $0.72, down almost 4% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-15T18:00:11,"Co-CEO of CoinRoutes Says It Loud: “XRP is Beta to Bitcoin”","In a recent panel discussion shared by respected crypto analyst Xaif on X, Dave Weisberger, the Co-CEO of CoinRoutes, delivered a blunt assessment that has reignited debate within the XRP community: “XRP is beta to Bitcoin.” According to Weisberger, XRP’s price action is not primarily shaped by legal or regulatory developments, but instead follows Bitcoin, often with heightened volatility and momentum. XRP and Bitcoin: A High-Beta Relationship Weisberger’s comments stem from a broader observation about market behavior. In his words, “What matters is XRP is beta to Bitcoin.” By describing XRP as having a high beta to BTC, he means that XRP tends to mimic Bitcoin’s movements , often in a magnified way. When Bitcoin rises, XRP usually follows, and sometimes outpaces it. When Bitcoin stalls or corrects, XRP typically responds in kind, sometimes with more dramatic swings. “Bitcoin’s gone up,” Weisberger noted. “And guess what? XRP has done exactly what I said it would do… It’s gone up more when Bitcoin plateaus. His remarks reinforce the idea that XRP’s market performance, while influenced by its fundamentals, remains largely tethered to Bitcoin’s macro trends. :Dave Weisberger says it loud: ""XRP is beta to Bitcoin!"" BTC goes up, XRP follows… but this time, XRP might lead. It’s doing EXACTLY what was predicted. LET’S GOOO! #XRP #Bitcoin #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/9uUUghyLFr — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) July 14, 2025 Legal Battles Are Not the Driving Force Weisberger also challenged a popular narrative in the XRP space, that legal outcomes, especially Ripple’s ongoing battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are the primary catalyst for price movements. Dismissing this idea, he recalled a recent interview: “They were asking about XRP’s price. They were talking about the court case. I said, ‘The court cases don’t mean shit.’” This bold claim underscores Weisberger’s view that while regulatory clarity may shape XRP’s long-term use case, it is Bitcoin’s price action that truly moves the needle in the short to medium term. XRP’s Recent Price Action Validates the Thesis The current market supports Weisberger’s thesis. As Bitcoin surged past $110,000, XRP reclaimed the $3 mark. The rally has fueled speculation among investors that XRP could be poised for an even greater breakout, especially if Bitcoin continues its bullish trend. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This behavior aligns with the beta principle: XRP lags slightly behind BTC during the early phases of a move, but once momentum builds, it often accelerates with greater force. For traders, this makes XRP a high-risk, high-reward asset in bull markets, and a dangerous one during corrections. Could XRP Eventually Lead? Interestingly, a growing segment of the XRP community believes the dynamic may be shifting. With Ripple expanding its cross-border payment solutions globally and XRP gaining traction in real-world financial systems, some argue that XRP could soon decouple from Bitcoin and pave its path. However, Weisberger remains pragmatic. For now, his analysis is clear, data-driven, and seemingly accurate: XRP’s market behavior continues to reflect Bitcoin’s larger moves. Xaif’s post has since gone viral, sparking widespread discussion across social media and further cementing Weisberger’s place as a critical voice in understanding XRP’s market dynamics. Whether XRP remains beta to Bitcoin or eventually becomes a market leader in its own right, the current cycle is once again proving that Weisberger’s insights can’t be ignored.

2025-07-15T18:00:04,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial $100K Support Unveiled by Short-Term Holders","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Analysis: Crucial $100K Support Unveiled by Short-Term Holders Are you tracking Bitcoin’s next big move? The crypto world is buzzing with a fascinating development: Bitcoin price analysis reveals that short-term holders (STHs) have reached a significant milestone, pushing their average buying price above $100,000. This isn’t just a number; it’s a potential game-changer, hinting at a robust new Bitcoin support level that could redefine future market dynamics for the world’s leading digital asset. This breakthrough, reported by Cointelegraph citing Glassnode data, signals a maturing market and potentially stronger foundational support for BTC. Who are BTC Short-Term Holders and Why Does Their Behavior Matter? Before diving into the significance of the $100,000 mark, it’s crucial to understand who BTC short-term holders (STHs) are and why their collective behavior offers such profound insights into Bitcoin price analysis . In the realm of on-chain analytics, STHs are typically defined as Bitcoin addresses that have held their coins for less than 155 days. These participants are often more reactive to market volatility compared to long-term holders (LTHs), who tend to HODL through cycles. Market Sensitivity: STHs are generally more sensitive to price fluctuations, making them key drivers of immediate market sentiment and short-term price movements. Their buying and selling activity can significantly influence market momentum. Cost Basis as a Barometer: The average buying price, or ‘cost basis,’ of STHs acts as a powerful indicator. When the price falls below their average cost, STHs are typically ‘underwater,’ increasing the likelihood of selling pressure as they seek to minimize losses or break even. Conversely, when the price is significantly above their cost basis, they might realize profits. Liquidity Providers: STHs often represent the more speculative and liquid segment of the market, frequently entering and exiting positions. Their movements can signal shifts in supply and demand dynamics. Understanding their aggregated cost basis provides a unique lens into where significant amounts of capital have recently entered the market, which can then act as a psychological and technical level of interest for future price action. The Pivotal $100,000 Mark: A New Bitcoin Support Level in the Making? The news that the average buying price of BTC short-term holders has crossed above $100,000 is not merely a statistical anomaly; it represents a profound shift in market structure. According to Glassnode data, this means that, on average, recent buyers of Bitcoin have acquired their holdings at a price point that has now surpassed the six-figure mark. Why is this so important? Historically, an aggregate cost basis for a significant cohort of market participants often transforms into a psychological and technical Bitcoin support level . Here’s why this $100,000 threshold is being eyed as a potential bulwark against future corrections: Psychological Anchor: For many recent buyers, $100,000 represents their breakeven point. If the price were to dip towards this level, these holders might be less inclined to sell, or even be motivated to buy more to average down, creating buying pressure. Realized Price Indicator: The STH cost basis is a form of ‘realized price’ for this specific group, reflecting the aggregate price at which coins last moved on-chain. When the market price trades above this realized price, it often signals a healthy, profitable market for recent participants. Historical Precedent: In past market cycles, the STH cost basis has frequently acted as a reliable support during pullbacks. When the price dips to or slightly below this level, it often finds a floor before resuming an upward trajectory. This pattern suggests a strong conviction among these newer market entrants. This development suggests a robust belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition among those who have entered the market more recently. It implies that a substantial amount of capital is now ‘locked in’ at or above this $100,000 level, potentially providing a strong foundation for future growth. How Does Glassnode Data Illuminate Crypto Market Trends ? The insights we’re discussing, particularly regarding BTC short-term holders ‘ cost basis, come courtesy of Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform. But what exactly is on-chain data, and how does it help us understand broader crypto market trends ? Glassnode specializes in transforming raw blockchain data into actionable intelligence. Unlike traditional financial markets where much of the data is proprietary or requires significant aggregation, every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public, immutable ledger. Glassnode’s sophisticated algorithms process this vast amount of information to derive meaningful metrics, offering transparency into market behavior that is unparalleled in traditional finance. Key ways Glassnode data illuminates market trends include: Supply Dynamics: Tracking the distribution of coins, active supply, and illiquid supply helps identify whether more coins are being held for the long term or are readily available for trading. Holder Behavior: Differentiating between short-term and long-term holders, analyzing their spending patterns, and tracking their profitability provides insights into market sentiment and potential selling pressure or accumulation. Miner Activity: Monitoring miner revenues, hash rate, and spending behavior can signal miner capitulation or confidence, impacting market supply. Exchange Flows: Tracking Bitcoin inflows and outflows from exchanges can indicate whether investors are moving coins off-exchange for cold storage (bullish) or onto exchanges for selling (bearish). The STH cost basis is just one powerful example of how Glassnode data provides a unique, fundamental perspective on Bitcoin’s market health, moving beyond mere price charts to reveal the underlying investor psychology and capital flows that drive Bitcoin price analysis . Decoding Bitcoin Market Cycles : What Can We Learn from History? The current observation about BTC short-term holders and the $100,000 threshold isn’t isolated; it fits within the larger narrative of Bitcoin market cycles . Bitcoin’s history is characterized by distinct bull and bear markets, often influenced by halving events and broader macroeconomic factors. Understanding how different holder cohorts behave during these cycles is crucial for predicting future movements. Let’s consider some historical patterns: During previous bull markets, as Bitcoin’s price ascended, the average cost basis of STHs would typically rise. When corrections occurred, this rising STH cost basis often acted as dynamic support. For example: In the 2017 bull run, dips to the STH cost basis often presented strong buying opportunities before the next leg up. Similarly, during the 2021 bull market, the STH realized price provided a floor during significant corrections, demonstrating strong conviction from new market entrants. Conversely, during bear markets, when the price falls significantly below the STH cost basis, these holders often capitulate, leading to increased selling pressure and further price depreciation. The point where the market price falls below the STH cost basis and stays there can signal the onset of a bear market, and the re-crossing above it can signal recovery. The fact that the STH cost basis is now at $100,000 in the current environment suggests a high level of confidence and capital inflow at these elevated prices. It implies that recent buyers are not just chasing fleeting pumps but are investing with a strong conviction, potentially indicating a robust phase within the ongoing Bitcoin market cycles . Actionable Insights for Investors: Navigating the Current Landscape So, what does this significant development mean for you as an investor or enthusiast? The establishment of a potential $100,000 Bitcoin support level by BTC short-term holders offers several actionable insights for navigating the current crypto market trends . For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Confirmation of Strength: This data reinforces the idea that significant capital is entering and staying in Bitcoin at higher price points, validating the long-term bullish outlook. Accumulation Opportunities: Should Bitcoin experience pullbacks towards the $100,000 level, it might present a compelling accumulation zone, assuming the historical behavior of STH cost basis acting as support holds true. Reduced Volatility Expectations: While Bitcoin remains volatile, a strong underlying support level can potentially mitigate the severity of future downturns, offering some peace of mind. For Traders and Short-Term Participants: Key Reference Point: Use the $100,000 STH cost basis as a critical technical level for setting stop-losses or identifying potential bounce zones during corrections. Sentiment Indicator: Monitor whether the market price consistently holds above this level. A sustained break below could signal weakening sentiment among recent buyers and potential further downside. Risk Management: Always prioritize robust risk management strategies. While on-chain data provides powerful insights, market dynamics can change rapidly due to unforeseen events. General Advice: Stay Informed: Continue to monitor on-chain metrics from sources like Glassnode. These insights provide a deeper understanding beyond simple price charts. Diversify: While Bitcoin is a foundational asset, a diversified portfolio can help manage risk across different crypto market trends . Long-Term Vision: Remember that Bitcoin market cycles are often long, and short-term fluctuations should be viewed within that broader context. This data point doesn’t guarantee a smooth ride, but it does provide a powerful indicator of underlying market strength and conviction among a crucial segment of Bitcoin investors. What Challenges Could Impact This Crucial Support? While the $100,000 average buying price for BTC short-term holders presents a compelling argument for a strong Bitcoin support level , it’s essential to acknowledge that no support is absolute. Several factors could challenge or even invalidate this crucial threshold, influencing future Bitcoin price analysis and broader crypto market trends . Potential challenges include: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Significant shifts in global economic conditions, such as unexpected interest rate hikes, a severe recession, or geopolitical instability, could trigger a broad risk-off sentiment, leading investors to divest from risk assets like Bitcoin, regardless of on-chain fundamentals. Black Swan Events: Unforeseen events, whether regulatory crackdowns, major exchange hacks, or technological vulnerabilities, could cause a sudden and severe market downturn, overwhelming any established support levels. Significant Profit-Taking by Long-Term Holders: While STHs are reactive, long-term holders (LTHs) might decide to realize substantial profits accumulated over years, leading to a supply shock that could temporarily depress prices below STH cost basis. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulatory landscapes in major economies could introduce uncertainty or restrictions, impacting investor confidence and capital flows into the crypto market. Whale Movements: Large institutional or individual holders (whales) can execute trades significant enough to move the market independently of aggregate STH behavior. Their coordinated selling could exert immense downward pressure. Therefore, while the $100,000 STH cost basis is a powerful indicator, it should be viewed as one piece of a larger puzzle. Investors should continuously monitor a range of on-chain metrics, macroeconomic indicators, and news developments to form a holistic view of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. The ascent of the average buying price of BTC short-term holders above $100,000 marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s journey. This robust data point, courtesy of Glassnode, strongly suggests the formation of a critical Bitcoin support level at this six-figure threshold. It reflects the increasing conviction and substantial capital inflows from recent market participants, signaling a potential new floor for the flagship cryptocurrency. As we navigate the ever-evolving crypto market trends , understanding the nuances of Bitcoin market cycles and the behavior of different holder cohorts becomes paramount. While challenges persist, this development offers a compelling narrative of Bitcoin’s growing maturity and resilience, providing valuable insights for investors seeking to make informed decisions in this dynamic landscape.

2025-07-15T17:59:41,"JPMorgan and others test stablecoin products","Fresh off historic earnings, Wall Street’s biggest banks are now setting their sights on stablecoins. Even Jamie Dimon, the longtime crypto critic and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, says the bank is getting involved, whether he understands the point of it or not. Speaking Tuesday during the company’s earnings call, Dimon said plainly, “I think they’re real, but I don’t know why you’d want to [use a] stablecoin as opposed to just payment.” He’s not wrong about his confusion. Dimon, now 69, has built his brand on skepticism of bitcoin and most things crypto. But when you’re running the largest U.S. bank, which moves nearly $10 trillion every single day, you don’t get the luxury of ignoring new rails just because they don’t fit into your worldview. Especially not when fintech players are coming hard for your turf. JPMorgan and others test stablecoin products Stablecoins, for those who need the reminder, are digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies—most often the U.S. dollar. They’re supposed to stay steady in value and act like cash that moves faster, settles instantly, and costs less. They’re not speculative coins like Bitcoin; they’re more like upgraded wire transfers that don’t take three days to clear. Last month, JPMorgan revealed it’s already rolling out a limited version of its own coin—called a deposit coin—but it’s only for the bank’s private clients. This isn’t a full-blown public stablecoin yet. But it’s a step into the water. “We’re going to be involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it,” Dimon said. He’s not the only one dipping a toe. On the same day as JPMorgan’s call, Citigroup executives said the bank is “looking at the issuance of a Citi stablecoin.” They’re not just stopping there. Citi says the real opportunity lies in tokenized deposits and crypto custody services—two areas where legacy banks have serious muscle to flex if they stop dragging their feet. And over at Bank of America, CEO Brian Moynihan is also making it clear: the bank will engage with stablecoins. No rollout yet, but the signal is loud enough. When this many top dogs start circling the same space at the same time, it’s never a coincidence. Big banks watch fintech and prep for team-ups What’s pushing these banks off the bench isn’t enthusiasm—it’s fear of falling behind. Dimon said Tuesday, “These guys are very smart,” when asked about fintech rivals. “They’re trying to figure out a way to create bank accounts, to get into payment systems and rewards programs, and we have to be cognizant of that.” In other words, the enemy’s not waiting. These fintech companies are already offering services that traditional banks used to own. They’re fast, they’re global, and they don’t have to deal with 1970s tech like ACH and SWIFT. That alone makes stablecoins a real threat if the banks don’t evolve. Dimon gets that. He didn’t say it outright, but the move toward stablecoin infrastructure now is a play to stay relevant while rules around digital currencies start getting clearer. Regulation is finally catching up. Banks have the lawyers and capital to dominate once they commit—and now they’re starting to. There’s also talk of banks joining forces. One route could be to push through Early Warning Services, a firm owned by a group of banks that already gave us Zelle. That instant payments network was the banks’ answer to PayPal and Cash App. A joint stablecoin effort could play out the same way, helping them fight off Silicon Valley’s attempts to eat their lunch. But Dimon wasn’t giving any details. When asked about a possible collaboration between banks on stablecoins, he said, “That’s a great question, and we’ll leave it remaining as a question.” So yeah, it’s being discussed. Just don’t expect a roadmap yet. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-07-15T17:50:04,"Bitcoin Leveraged Trading: James Wynn’s Audacious $18.43M Bet on Hyperliquid","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Leveraged Trading: James Wynn’s Audacious $18.43M Bet on Hyperliquid In the high-octane world of cryptocurrency trading, few names evoke as much intrigue and caution as James Wynn. Fresh off reported significant losses in June, Wynn has once again captivated the crypto community by opening an astonishing $18.43 million Bitcoin leveraged trading position . This audacious move, executed on the decentralized perpetual exchange Hyperliquid, involves a staggering 40x leverage on Bitcoin (BTC). What drives such a high-stakes gamble, and what can we learn from a trader who consistently embraces extreme risk? Let’s dive deep into the details of this latest bold maneuver and explore the intricate dynamics of leveraged trading in the digital asset space. Unpacking James Wynn’s Audacious Bitcoin Leveraged Trading Bet The crypto market is no stranger to dramatic entries and exits, but James Wynn’s latest move stands out. According to on-chain tracker Onchain Lens on X, Wynn deposited a substantial $467,999 into Hyperliquid, a decentralized platform, to initiate this massive long position. With 40x leverage, this relatively modest initial capital controls a Bitcoin position worth $18.43 million. For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin leveraged trading amplifies both potential gains and losses. A 40x leverage means that for every 1% price movement in Bitcoin, the position’s value changes by 40%. While this can lead to exponential profits if the market moves favorably, it also means a small adverse price movement can quickly liquidate the entire position. Wynn’s strategy isn’t new; he’s known for his aggressive, high-risk approach. This isn’t his first foray into highly leveraged plays, nor is it his first time in the spotlight for significant financial outcomes, both positive and negative. His reported $100 million loss in June serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and unforgiving nature of such strategies. Yet, here he is again, doubling down with one of the most significant individual leveraged positions observed recently. The High-Stakes World of Crypto High Risk Strategies Why do traders like James Wynn engage in such crypto high risk strategies? The allure is simple: the potential for immense profits in a short timeframe. However, the reality is far more complex and often brutal. High leverage acts as a double-edged sword. It allows traders with limited capital to control large positions, maximizing their exposure to market movements. But this amplification works both ways. Liquidation Risk: At 40x leverage, even a minor price drop of 2.5% against the long position could wipe out the initial margin. This is known as liquidation, where the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, are notorious for their price swings. These rapid fluctuations make high-leverage positions incredibly precarious. Emotional Toll: The pressure of managing such large, volatile positions can be immense, leading to impulsive decisions that further exacerbate losses. Wynn’s previous reported losses underscore the critical importance of risk management, even for seasoned traders. While his aggressive style might seem reckless to some, it highlights a segment of the crypto trading community that thrives on these extreme scenarios, seeking to capitalize on every market tremor. Why Hyperliquid Exchange for Such a Massive Position? The choice of platform for such a significant trade is also noteworthy. James Wynn opted for Hyperliquid exchange , a decentralized perpetual exchange. This choice reflects a growing trend among experienced crypto traders towards decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for their trading activities. What makes Hyperliquid an attractive venue for a trade of this magnitude? Decentralization: Unlike centralized exchanges (CEXs) that hold user funds and control order books, Hyperliquid operates on a decentralized model. This means users retain custody of their assets, reducing counterparty risk. Transparency: Transactions on decentralized exchanges are recorded on a public blockchain, offering a high degree of transparency. This is how on-chain trackers like Onchain Lens can identify and report on such large positions. Liquidity and Fees: DeFi perpetuals have matured, offering competitive liquidity and often lower fees compared to some centralized counterparts, especially for high-volume traders. Permissionless Access: Decentralized platforms typically offer permissionless access, meaning anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet can participate, without extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures often required by CEXs. Wynn’s decision to use Hyperliquid reinforces the platform’s reputation as a serious contender for professional traders seeking robust and transparent decentralized trading environments, even for high-leverage plays. Decoding the On-Chain Analysis Behind the Bet The public nature of blockchain transactions is a defining characteristic of the crypto space, enabling detailed on-chain analysis . In Wynn’s case, it was precisely this transparency that allowed Onchain Lens to identify and report on his $467,999 deposit and subsequent 40x leveraged Bitcoin long. On-chain data provides an unprecedented level of insight into market activity, often revealing the moves of large players, or “whales,” before they become widely known. For analysts, tracking such movements can offer clues about market sentiment and potential future price action. When a well-known trader, especially one with a history like Wynn’s, takes such a large position, it inevitably sparks discussion and speculation. While not a guarantee of success, observing these high-profile trades can provide a fascinating look into the conviction (or speculative nature) of market participants. However, it’s crucial to remember that on-chain data alone doesn’t tell the whole story. The reasons behind a trade, the trader’s overall portfolio, and their risk management strategies (if any) remain largely private. What we see is merely the transaction itself, open for public interpretation. What Does This Mean for James Wynn Crypto’s Future? James Wynn’s consistent presence in the headlines, whether for massive gains or significant losses, positions him as a fascinating figure in the crypto landscape. His latest James Wynn crypto maneuver raises questions about his long-term strategy and resilience. Is this a calculated risk based on deep market conviction, or another chapter in a series of high-stakes gambles? For the broader crypto community, Wynn’s actions serve as a powerful case study: The Power of Leverage: It demonstrates the incredible capital efficiency leverage offers, allowing small sums to control vast positions. The Perils of Leverage: Simultaneously, it highlights the extreme fragility of such positions and the potential for rapid capital erosion. The Role of On-Chain Data: It showcases how transparent blockchain data empowers a new generation of market observers and analysts. Ultimately, the outcome of Wynn’s $18.43 million Bitcoin long position remains to be seen. It will undoubtedly be closely watched by many, serving as a real-time example of the exhilarating highs and devastating lows that define the world of high-leverage cryptocurrency trading. While such strategies are not for everyone, understanding them is key to comprehending the full spectrum of activities within the dynamic crypto market. Conclusion: The Unfolding Drama of High-Stakes Crypto Trading James Wynn’s $18.43 million 40x leveraged Bitcoin long position on Hyperliquid is more than just a trade; it’s a testament to the audacious spirit and inherent risks that define the cryptocurrency market. From his reported past losses to his current high-stakes gamble, Wynn embodies the relentless pursuit of alpha that characterizes a segment of crypto traders. This move not only puts his capital on the line but also shines a spotlight on the capabilities of decentralized exchanges and the invaluable insights offered by on-chain analysis. As the crypto world watches, this position serves as a potent reminder that while opportunities for significant gains exist, they often come hand-in-hand with equally significant risks. It’s a thrilling, perilous dance on the edge of market volatility, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye.

Jacquelyn Melinek, founder of Token Relations, drew attention to this scaling adjustment on the Bloomberg Terminal, which now shows Bitcoin’s spot price (XBT) at $0.118M, corresponding to the $118,000 level the asset achieved on July 10. Source: @jacqmelinek on X Following this adjustment, Bitcoin has shattered multiple resistance levels , initially breaching the significant $120,000 threshold before establishing a new all-time high of $123,000 the following day. These developments have reignited the debates about whether Wall Street is positioning itself for a massive bull market cycle. Wall Street Veterans Eye Seven-Figure Bitcoin Targets In May, while Bitcoin consolidated around $103,000, Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood informed CNBC that Bitcoin is destined for “$1.5 million” due to its increasing market share capture from gold.

BULLISH pic.twitter.com/TaWVNvnpPp — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) May 9, 2025 Wood emphasized that Wall Street institutions are currently in an exploratory phase, testing the market waters before committing larger capital allocations. Since her statement, Bitcoin has added $20,000 to its valuation, enabling it to surpass Amazon as the world’s fifth most valuable asset , trailing only Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and gold. This performance has convinced numerous investors and billionaires that Bloomberg’s million-scale formatting for Bitcoin will eventually display a value of $1 million. Bitcoin Price Technical Analysis – Where is BTC Heading Next? Bitcoin (BTC) is holding strong near $117,000 after a powerful breakout, with momentum still favoring the bulls. If current support around $115,000 holds, BTC could be gearing up for another leg higher toward $123,000 and potentially $125,000 in the short term. The recent dip has helped reset the RSI from overbought levels, creating room for another push up. With bullish structure still intact and volume remaining elevated, Bitcoin looks primed for continuation. As long as the price stays within the current rising channel, the path of least resistance remains upward in what could be the start of a larger rally. New Layer-2 Opportunity Gaining Steam as Bitcoin Rallies As Bitcoin continues to climb, many investors are starting to look beyond BTC and into presales, which can far outperform well-established coins. One standout is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) — a new Bitcoin-based project that’s picking up major traction. Built to make Bitcoin faster and more useful, HYPER has already raised over $2.8 million in its ongoing presale, and interest is growing fast. For those looking to get in early on the next big thing, HYPER is shaping up to be a strong contender. Smart investors and retail traders alike are starting to take notice, with many calling HYPER one of the most promising early-stage projects right now.

2025-07-15T17:20:04,"Nextdoor App Unveils Transformative AI Recommendations and Critical Real-Time Alerts","BitcoinWorld Nextdoor App Unveils Transformative AI Recommendations and Critical Real-Time Alerts In an era where digital trust and hyper-local information are paramount, the Nextdoor app is embarking on a significant transformation. Moving beyond its traditional role as a simple forum for neighborhood chatter, the platform is launching a comprehensive redesign aimed at becoming a more indispensable utility for communities. This ambitious overhaul introduces cutting-edge AI, direct integration of local news, and critical real-time emergency alerts, signaling a strategic pivot towards a more structured, helpful, and timely user experience. For those accustomed to the rapid evolution of digital platforms, Nextdoor’s bold move underscores the growing demand for reliable, accessible information at the local level. Revolutionizing Local Discovery with AI Recommendations One of the most exciting additions to the new Nextdoor experience is ‘Faves,’ an innovative feature powered by artificial intelligence designed to help users discover the best local businesses and hidden gems. Imagine needing a reliable plumber or the perfect family-friendly restaurant, and instead of sifting through generic search results, you get tailored suggestions based on years of genuine neighbor conversations. This is precisely what Faves aims to deliver. Powered by Hyperlocal AI: Nextdoor boasts an LLM (Large Language Model) specifically trained on 15 years of neighbor-generated content. This proprietary dataset allows the AI to understand and answer questions with a truly local context, a capability currently unmatched by broader platforms like Google or ChatGPT. Curated Suggestions: Users can ask specific questions, such as, “What is the best place to hike with kids?” and receive quick, summarized responses. These summaries are directly linked to the original posts from real users, ensuring transparency and trust. Proprietary Data Advantage: Nextdoor CEO and co-founder Nirav Tolia emphasized that this content is unique to Nextdoor, unindexed by external search engines. This positions the Nextdoor app as the go-to source for the kind of invaluable word-of-mouth information that defines local life – from finding a child’s lemonade stand to discovering a beloved, quirky local shop. Bringing Hyperlocal Local News to Your Doorstep To enhance the quality and quantity of information available, Nextdoor is integrating professional journalism directly into the app. This marks a significant shift from relying solely on user-generated content, acknowledging the importance of verified, timely reporting for a truly informed community. Nextdoor has forged partnerships with 3,500 local publications across the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, including notable names like the San Francisco Standard, The London Standard, and The Toronto Star. This collaboration is designed to be mutually beneficial, as Nirav Tolia explained to Bitcoin World: “The reason that this is so important for us is historically, Nextdoor has relied 100% on user-generated content, just the content that’s created by your neighbors. That’s been a great source of information. But, to really make sure if it’s happening in your neighborhood, we need to bring in local news as well. So this is the first time we’re letting third party publishers use our distribution.” The agreements are non-commercial; Nextdoor doesn’t pay for the content, nor do publishers pay Nextdoor. The app simply displays a headline, a snippet, and an image, directing traffic to the publishers’ websites. This ensures that users have access to reliable local reporting while supporting local journalism. A dedicated section under each post will allow neighbors to discuss the news, fostering community dialogue around relevant local events. Critical Safety with Real-Time Alerts In moments of crisis, timely information can be life-saving. The redesigned Nextdoor app introduces a robust real-time alert system for events like severe weather, traffic incidents, power outages, storms, and wildfires. These alerts are displayed on a dynamic neighborhood map, enabling neighbors to engage in immediate conversations about safety and preparedness. To power these crucial updates, Nextdoor has partnered with Samdesk and Weather.com (including The Weather Channel app). Tolia detailed the alert system’s urgency levels: Yellow State: For important, attention-worthy events, alerts appear prominently at the top of the app. Red State: For critical, life-threatening situations, the alert takes over the entire app screen, ensuring immediate attention. As Tolia emphasized, “at that point, you don’t care about the conversations neighbors are having about pickleball. You don’t really care about the new restaurant review that the local publishers put in. You need to get together with your neighbors and help save each other’s lives in some cases.” What truly sets Nextdoor’s alerts apart is their hyper-localization. Built on a geospatial platform, the app can personalize alerts down to an individual house. Unlike broad Amber Alerts, if a power outage affects only a specific block, only residents on that block will receive the notification, minimizing unnecessary alerts and maximizing relevance. Beyond a Neighborhood Social Network: A Utility-Centric Future For years, Nextdoor has served as a popular, albeit sometimes controversial, platform for neighborhood interactions. While it excelled at connecting people for recommendations or lost pets, it also faced challenges with misinformation and instances of racism, leading to stalled growth and declining engagement. With this significant redesign, Nextdoor is determined to turn the tide, repositioning itself from merely a neighborhood social network to an essential, utility-centric service. The company’s focus is squarely on increasing the quality and quantity of local information. By integrating professional news and hyper-localized alerts, Nextdoor aims to provide a more valuable and reliable resource. This shift is not just about new features; it’s about a fundamental change in philosophy – making the platform more helpful, useful, and timely for everyday life. Looking ahead, Nextdoor plans to further expand its content ecosystem. Tolia noted that publishers are just the first step; in the future, the platform intends to allow small businesses, schools, and various organizations to establish native presences within the app, creating an even richer tapestry of local information and services. The Vision from the Top: CEO Nirav Tolia’s Insights Nirav Tolia’s vision for the “new Nextdoor” is clear: to digitize and capture the invaluable essence of local word-of-mouth. He firmly believes that the kind of hyperlocal information available on Nextdoor is simply not found on global platforms. “I give the funny example of, if you wanted to know all the lemonade stands that kids are operating in your neighborhood, you can’t go to Google Maps and find that,” Tolia remarked. “You can’t go to ChatGPT and ask that question, right? The only way is for you to ask your neighbors. And so that’s what Nextdoor is all about.” This renewed commitment to being truly hyperlocal, combined with sophisticated AI recommendations and vital real-time alerts , is set to redefine the platform’s utility. By blending neighbor-generated insights with professional content and critical safety tools, Nextdoor is striving to be less of a casual social network and more of an indispensable tool for community life, ensuring that when something important happens in your neighborhood, you’re the first to know. The redesign of the Nextdoor app represents a pivotal moment for the platform. By embracing advanced AI, integrating trusted local news, and delivering critical real-time alerts, Nextdoor is not just updating its interface; it’s fundamentally reshaping its purpose. This transformation aims to solve past challenges of misinformation and declining engagement by offering unparalleled utility and hyper-local relevance. As communities increasingly seek reliable information and stronger connections, Nextdoor’s strategic pivot positions it as an essential digital companion for modern neighborhood life, promising a more informed, safer, and connected future for its users.

2025-07-15T17:18:10,"Why This Week Is Crucial For Cryptocurrencies: Here’s All The Bills Being Introduced In The U.S., Their Potential Impact, And All You Need To Know","Washington, the capital of the United States, is witnessing a historic period for the cryptocurrency sector this week. During this period, dubbed “Crypto Week,” two important bills to be voted on in the House of Representatives could pave the way for the establishment of a long-awaited legal framework for digital assets. GENIUS Act: Stablecoins The GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill that has already passed the Senate, will be voted on Thursday in the House of Representatives. If passed, it would mark the first time in US history that independent cryptocurrency regulation has been enacted. The Trump administration supports this process. The House of Representatives, having abandoned the previous version, took up the new version after President Donald Trump called on Truth Social, “No delays, no addendums, bring it to my desk now.” CLARITY: The Status of Cryptocurrencies However, the industry's biggest hope lies in the CLARITY Act, a bill that would clarify whether digital assets are securities or commodities. This bill aims to clearly divide regulatory powers between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill is scheduled for a vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday and is expected to pass after passing committees with bipartisan support. However, its progress in the Senate is less clear. Democrats are wary of the bill due to the Trump family's crypto investments. Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock, despite supporting the GENIUS Act, stating that “Trump’s crypto corruption is corrupting the digital asset market,” did not show the same commitment to CLARITY. Coinbase, aiming to boost support for the CLARITY Act, distributed nearly 5,000 chocolate bars across Washington to highlight the law's importance. The company noted on the packaging that nearly one-fifth of Americans own crypto, according to a Morning Consult poll. Related News: US President Donald Trump Makes Hot Remarks on Cryptocurrencies - Shares a Long Statement Coinbase, Ripple, and other crypto companies are urging members of Congress to support them, arguing that a clearer regulatory framework would boost investor confidence. “Consumers want to know what they're getting into when they buy and sell these assets and that they're using a trusted intermediary,” said Kara Calvert, Coinbase's Vice President of U.S. Public Policy. The Senate is preparing to introduce its own market structure regulation this month, which will differ from the House version. Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are working on the legislation, while Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand plans to support it with a bipartisan approach. “We have a lot of work to do, and we will be working in a bipartisan manner over the next month,” Gillibrand told CNBC. Bill to Ban CBDC Another key item for the crypto industry is a separate bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing digital dollars (CBDCs).This bill is also expected to be passed by the House of Representatives on Wednesday. Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger expressed support for the bill, saying, “If this is something the private sector should be doing, the government should not be the competitor.” *This is not investment advice.

Markets are now pricing in “Crypto Week,” a key regulatory event , as the CLARITY Act market structure bill, GENIUS Act stablecoin bill, and Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act face the U.S. House. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Is the Stage Set for $1 While a $1 Shiba Inu price remains speculative, the token’s increasingly bullish fundamentals add weight to the long-term case. The recent launch of DegenSafe, SHIB’s response to Solana’s meme coin launchpads, and ongoing token burns could lift prices through increased adoption and scarcity. Even without these catalysts fully priced in, the technical setup still points higher, backed by a developing six-month double bottom pattern. SHIB / USDT 1-week chart, double bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. Since its second bottom in mid-June, the Shiba Inu price has pushed steadily toward a breakout above the neckline at $0.0000177. Momentum indicators continue to support the move. The RSI has rebounded from oversold territory in the 30s, climbing toward neutral as buying pressure returns. More so, the MACD line continues to widen its lead over the signal line after a short-lived death cross, signaling underlying strength and a potential longer-term uptrend. If the double bottom plays out, SHIB could see a 93% surge, targeting a higher resistance zone stretching back to early January at $0.000025. However, its full potential hinges on a successful break above its neckline. Still, that move hinges on a clean break above the neckline. Until then, $0.000012 remains the key support to watch. Losing it risks a third bottom at $0.00001, invalidating the setup. SHIB Might Not Be The Best Meme Coin Narrative to Follow The truth is, SHIB has been in the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives. On the speculative meme coin scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins,” the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come. Millions of gamble coins will come and go. But only a handful of MISSION COINS will WIN. pic.twitter.com/rxsVfeux8A — Murad (@MustStopMurad) July 8, 2025 Token6900 ($T6900) is the latest chapter in that saga: no promises, no utility—you are the utility.

2025-07-15T17:08:55,"The Real Narrative Behind Bitcoin That You Need To Know","Summary Bitcoin's price is driven by institutionalization and regulation. Not safe-haven demand, making it more akin to the S&P 500 than gold. Key catalysts include regulatory moves like the Genius Act and political dynamics undermining monetary policy credibility. In my opinion, we can talk about institutionalization, until proven otherwise, as an “anti‑liberalization” of Bitcoin. But this certainly doesn’t mean less demand. But watch out for traps. With increasing overextension, the attractiveness of taking a position could decrease compared to ""alts"". Bitcoin does not follow macroeconomics, but above all, it is not a safe-haven asset . At least not right now. What drives the price of Bitcoin is not fear but rather a de- liberalization , or better said, a phase of institutionalization/regulation that could be truly epochal. Here’s my opinion: we must not make the mistake of treating it like gold; perhaps we should make the effort to treat it more like the S&P 500 . And now that the market has flipped the risk‑on switch, my attention once again turns to Bitcoin. And not only that . But first, let me share with you… My bullish view on BTC It diverges from the idea that a weak dollar and expectations of a rate cut are a panacea for BTC demand. I prefer to identify two other catalysts: institutionalization and monetary instability. Simply, two threads: The “fight” between President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell The Genius Act Not tariffs: I consider it too simplistic to say that Bitcoin demand increases because of the instability generated by tariffs. It would be like supporting the classic dynamic “bitcoin = safe asset haven,” which we have seen does not match real danger situations. For those who still embrace Bitcoin today as a challenger to the modern monetary system, I think following the two narrative threads I have identified is more consistent. The two catalysts to remember Simply put, the fact that President Donald Trump directly steps in to undermine Powell , and by doing so influences monetary policy decisions, is an important historical inconsistency. For Bitcoin, it’s as if its fiercest enemy were saying, “Hey, you were right, we’re not that efficient.” Of course, this part of my analysis is more storytelling than data‑driven analysis, but I can’t help finding in it a very theatrical, fascinating narrative. Especially when I frame the story with the stablecoin regulation process, defined as the Genius Act, here, I find a logical reason in the weakness of the dollar, but also in Gary Gensler’s exit from the SEC , and coming back to us, the introduction of a new monetary system. Therefore, both the Genius Act, the Clarity Act (regulatory framework for crypto), and the Anti‑CBDC Surveillance State Act . In one word: institutionalization. Makes you think, doesn’t it? A bullish phase, because it increases demand, but not so close to the “liberal” concept of Bitcoin from 2010, even though that propaganda is still very much alive among supporters, but let’s see if between this narrative and the data there is actually a formal correlation. In numbers: If I look for signs of institutionalization, first of all, I look at the flows in the USA spot Bitcoin ETFs, and I notice that they have over $138 billion in AUM. Not really a typical feature of a market with less than 3 years of experience. IBIT: Example of AUM of the most capitalized ETF (Seeking Alpha) Another sign of institutionalization? The volatility, hasn't anyone noticed a drop in Bitcoin’s volatility? How many remember 2021, when you woke up in the morning and realized that during the night the portfolio had registered a positive fluctuation of 10% and then maybe a negative of 15%? Well, the 30-day rolling volatility drops to 35% , while before 2022, it was over 100%. IBIT – Example of how volatility has halved compared to the average (Seeking Alpha) But do you know what confirms to me that the bullish movement is driven by this (allow me the term) artificial process? The comparison with a real safe asset heaven: Bitcoin has a trend substantially disconnected from gold , which actually is ONLY a safe asset heaven, even if the dollar is falling. But what does this discrepancy really mean? In essence, the market is not looking for protection but for risk . Data by YCharts And if Bitcoin is in demand, it means that it is treated more like an S&P 500 , a signal of the fact that it follows “earnings-driven” narratives, even if naturally it has no earnings, but more similar to the accumulation methodologies of institutions. Data by YCharts Risk: “Yes, alright, it may make sense, so will it keep growing endlessly?” In the end, that’s what we really want to know. Let’s look at some numbers: of Bitcoin traders, 86% are in profit, 13% at break‑even , and only 1% in loss. Simply put, if we’re at ATH, how is it possible that 13% are at breakeven? Here’s the point: after all these words, I’ve come to this to tell you that this piece of information can be read by many in a contrarian sense. It basically shows there are a lot of buyers at the highs, which becomes even more worrying if you consider a Large Transactions Volume of $164.28B : clearly a sign of euphoria but also of strong hands intervening, who tend to play on these retail imbalances. (Of course, this is my personal opinion.) IBIT (Seeking Alpha) Well, it’s a risk, especially considering that this is the first year Bitcoin’s price is below the stock‑to‑flow level at 463 days in the yellow range of the post‑halving day distribution. It’s anomalous. Bear market... or alt season If you got scared, know that this is not enough for me to call a downgrade on Bitcoin. Because the narrative is still promising, in my opinion. Rather, this seems to me like a typical phase of an alt season, that is, a market phase in which very positive idiosyncratic drivers develop for smaller cryptocurrencies. Data by YCharts In other words, it is statistically likely that, with Bitcoin already in an upper‑extreme zone, the market could shift part of its resources toward alternative assets, potentially those that have been “left behind,” and of course, ETH immediately comes to mind, and I’ve talked about it here as well. An element that, in fact, would remain close to the institutionalized narrative, considering the launch of ETFs. Conclusion To conclude, I remain close to the bullish narrative on BTC, while keeping an eye on the imbalance in the distribution of demand and supply, which could generate short‑term volatility, such as a fake breakout above the highs. In this sense, I look favorably on alternatives, and I think the market will too. In particular, ETH.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801408-real-narrative-behind-bitcoin-you-need-to-know?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION|FIAT","IBIT|BTC-USD",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T17:07:19,"Bitcoin’s New ATH Isn’t Just a Number: It’s a Statement, Says Bitfinex Alpha","BTC has officially broken past its previous ceiling, setting a new all-time high and reigniting bullish momentum across the market. But this isn’t just another milestone in a volatile chart; it’s a powerful statement about Bitcoin’s growing role in global finance. According to the latest Bitfinex Alpha report , the recent rally is being driven by a unique combination of factors: aggressive ETF demand, grassroots accumulation, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Together, they paint a picture of Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic hedge with staying power. BTC climbed to a record high of $123,120 on Monday, ending months of sideways movement and marking a 65% rebound from its April low. The move not only reverses losses from earlier this year but also signals a fundamental shift in how Bitcoin is positioned in global markets. The Bitfinex report links the surge to renewed buying activity from short-term holders. Analysts view this trend as a reflection of Bitcoin’s growing resilience in uncertain conditions, particularly in comparison to traditional assets such as gold and stocks. ETF Inflows and Retail Demand Tighten Bitcoin Supply Following its new all-time high, Bitcoin briefly became the fifth most valuable asset globally, with a market capitalization of almost $2.5 trillion, before it slipped back to sixth position after today’s correction. Demand from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs remains intense, with over $2.7 billion in inflows last week alone, far exceeding the number of new BTC mined during the same period. Leading the charge is BlackRock’s IBIT ETF , which has now crossed $80 billion in assets under management, reaching the milestone faster than any ETF in history. At the same time, retail investors with smaller wallets (wallets holding less than 100 BTC) are accumulating aggressively. According to Bitfinex, this grassroots demand is now outpacing new Bitcoin issuance, further tightening supply and adding to the pressure on prices. This wave of institutional and retail interest reflects more than just market speculation. With increasing participation from large asset managers and government-linked entities, Bitcoin is steadily cementing its place in financial planning and macroeconomic strategy. Bitcoin’s Rise Mirrors Cracks in the U.S. Economy The Bitfinex report also highlights growing signs of stress within the U.S. economy, a crucial backdrop for Bitcoin’s rise. Continuing unemployment claims are on the rise, especially in lower-wage sectors, suggesting that labor market weakness may be quietly building beneath headline stability. Households are feeling the strain from rising living costs, elevated credit card rates, and geopolitical instability. While some sentiment surveys remain optimistic, the persistence of high borrowing costs and essential expenses continues to test household resilience. Meanwhile, small businesses, often the first to feel the impact of macroeconomic tremors, are reporting weaker sales, hiring difficulties, and tighter margins. Business investment is also slowing, suggesting that confidence in long-term growth is fading on Main Street. Against this backdrop, Bitcoin’s new all-time high carries symbolic weight. It signals not just strength in the market but a shift in how investors, institutions, and individuals alike are preparing for an increasingly uncertain global economy .

2025-07-15T17:00:17,"Bitcoin Bears Strike Back After ATH: Long/Short Ratio Flips Negative","Bitcoin is undergoing a slight retrace after hitting a new all-time high of $123,000 on Monday. While the broader trend remains bullish, short-term sentiment has shifted as selling pressure begins to build. Bulls are now defending key support levels, with the $117,000 zone emerging as a critical line that could determine whether the uptrend holds or deeper corrections follow. Related Reading: Ethereum Supply Locked Hits New ATH: Smart Money Bets On Long-Term Growth The pullback has introduced fresh uncertainty into the market. According to new data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin Futures Position Dominance has started to lean bearish, suggesting that short positions are gaining momentum across major derivatives platforms. This shift reflects growing caution among traders, particularly as long-to-short ratios weaken and funding rates normalize after weeks of elevated bullish activity. Although Bitcoin remains far above its 2024 highs and the macro structure still favors bulls, the current pause is being closely watched. Investors are looking for confirmation that the recent all-time high was not a local top. With fear slowly creeping in and derivatives data flashing early warning signs, the coming days could be pivotal. Whether bulls can hold the line—or whether bears take control—will likely set the tone for Bitcoin’s next major move. Bitcoin Retraces As Bearish Sentiment Rises Bitcoin has pulled back more than 5% since reaching its all-time high of $123,000 earlier this week, with current price action testing the strength of short-term support levels. While retracements are common after major breakouts, some analysts note that Bitcoin’s decline has been sharper than that of Ethereum and many altcoins, which have either held their ground or continued to climb. Top analyst Axel Adler pointed out a significant shift in sentiment following the ATH. According to his insights, bears began aggressively shorting immediately after the price peak, leading to a sharp drop in bullish dominance. Most notably, the long-to-short ratio flipped into negative territory for the first time in weeks, signaling a clear rise in short interest across derivatives platforms. This pivot in positioning reflects growing caution among traders and raises the stakes for bulls. The $117,000 level is now seen as a key support zone—if Bitcoin fails to hold above it, a deeper correction could follow, potentially dragging the broader market down with it. The timing is especially critical. This week, the US Congress kicks off “Crypto Week,” a series of discussions and potential votes on important legislation that could reshape the regulatory landscape for digital assets. The outcome of these debates may act as a catalyst for renewed bullish momentum—or deepen the correction if uncertainty dominates. As markets brace for clarity, all eyes remain on Bitcoin’s ability to defend $117K and reclaim its short-term trend. Related Reading: $30B In Bitcoin Added By Accumulator Wallets: Are Long-Term Players Preparing Early? BTC Pulls Back: $114K–$117K Key Zone to Watch The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin retracing sharply after reaching an all-time high of $123,200 earlier this week. Currently trading at $116,900, BTC has dropped over 5% from its recent peak, marking its first significant correction since the breakout above $109,300. This pullback brings Bitcoin back toward the $114,000–$117,000 zone, which now acts as short-term support. This area coincides with the rising 50-period simple moving average (SMA) at $114,466 and is closely aligned with the previous breakout structure. A successful retest of this level could provide the foundation for a new leg higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Remain Steady As CDD Normalizes After False Alarm However, failure to hold this zone could open the door for a deeper correction toward the $109,300 support level, which served as a multi-week resistance throughout May and June. The bearish momentum on the latest candles, combined with high sell volume, reflects rising short-term uncertainty. Despite this, Bitcoin remains above all major moving averages on this timeframe (50, 100, and 200 SMAs), indicating that the broader trend is still intact.

2025-07-15T16:59:31,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As Binance Announce New Pump.fun Style Meme Coin Launchpad","Pump.fun’s recent token launch became one of the biggest stories in crypto, pulling in over $600 million in just 12 minutes. It showed how strong the appetite has become for meme coins, where speed and community drive the action. Now Binance is stepping in with its own version of a token launch system. Although inspired by the bonding curve model seen on Pump.fun, Binance’s approach works differently, adding an approval process for projects wanting to participate. This move comes at a time when attention is gradually moving from large-cap tokens toward smaller altcoins and meme coins, as fresh capital looks for new ground. Binance’s entry suggests it wants to play an active role as this next chapter of the market opens. Binance’s New Approach to Meme Coin Launches Binance’s recently announced token generation event system marks an interesting development in how meme coins and new projects come to market. The bonding curve mechanism allows token prices to adjust gradually as demand rises, rewarding early participants with lower prices and ensuring liquidity builds naturally. But where Pump.fun allows nearly anyone to create tokens, Binance has set up a process where projects must apply, adding a filter to what reaches the platform. Since early 2024, Pump.fun has seen over 11 million tokens created, driven largely by viral momentum and fast-paced experimentation. Binance, by contrast, seems focused on channeling that same excitement into something more stable, giving users the thrill of early access but within a more structured environment. We’re proud to join @binance & @binancewallet in reshaping token launches through the new Bonding Curve TGE model - powered by @four_meme_ The first launch drops tomorrow. Get ready. 👀 https://t.co/f0Isj7Z7td — Four.Meme (@four_meme_) July 14, 2025 The collaboration with Four.meme, known for its work on the BNB Chain, marks the start of this rollout, with the possibility of expanding to other blockchains later. As more capital flows out of Bitcoin and Ethereum into smaller speculative assets, Binance may be positioning itself to capture that development by offering a curated launch experience. This could help meme coins reach a wider audience while giving Binance’s user base access to early-stage opportunitie s, all within a platform they already trust. Investors seem to already be interested in the model and also seem to speculate this move as Binance's next step to push meme coins as the bull run finally starts running its usual course and funds flow from top altcoins to smaller projects with high community support and potential.

Token 6900 Token6900 has captured the essence of what makes meme coins so magnetic: humor, culture, and community. The number “6900” is not random; it plays into crypto’s long-standing love for numbers and jokes, creating a token identity that is instantly recognizable and widely shared across social platforms. But Token6900 does not stop at surface-level entertainment. It has been quietly building a set of features that deepen its appeal, including staking programs, community rewards, NFT drops, and regular engagement activities designed to keep holders involved. What makes Token 6900 especially interesting is how it taps into the core of meme coin culture while still offering real substance. The community is highly active, driving social buzz, participating in votes, and helping shape how the project moves forward. At a time when big exchanges like Binance are setting up new ways to bring meme coins to market with curated launches, Token6900 shows that success in this space often comes from a mix of fun and utility. As funds continue shifting away from blue-chip coins into smaller tokens with personality and energy, Token6900 is well placed to benefit. It reflects a larger trend where crypto investors are looking for more than just price action; they want a sense of belonging, participation, and shared identity. For anyone exploring the meme coin space, Token 6900 offers a combination of humor, activity, and real features that set it apart and give it the potential to keep growing. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer 2 network designed to bring more speed, scalability, and utility to Bitcoin without sacrificing its foundation. While Bitcoin has long been seen as a store of value, Bitcoin Hyper expands its role by allowing smart contracts, decentralized applications, and cross-chain interactions. This opens up an entirely new space where not only financial tools but also meme coins and experimental projects can thrive on Bitcoin’s backbone. For developers, it creates an environment to launch creative tokens without facing the high costs or slower speeds usually tied to the main Bitcoin network. What makes Bitcoin Hyper especially relevant now is how it aligns with the current market environment. As funds begin flowing from major tokens into smaller, community-focused projects, networks like Bitcoin Hyper stand ready to host this new wave. The technical framework supports everything from rapid settlements to staking pools, giving both builders and users the flexibility they need. At present, Bitcoin Hyper has managed to be featured and endorsed by multiple top crypto content creators, like Cilinix Crypto and many others. With platforms like Binance introducing new token launch models, the idea of bringing meme coins and experimental tokens to major chains has become more widely accepted. Bitcoin Hyper fits naturally into this shift, providing a way to combine Bitcoin’s reputation with the creativity and fast pace of the altcoin and meme coin scene. For traders and communities looking for a place where innovation meets strong fundamentals, Bitcoin Hyper offers a compelling option. It reflects the evolving crypto space, where even Bitcoin is no longer just about holding value but about building, experimenting, and connecting across ecosystems in ways that were once out of reach. Conclusion As funds gradually move from larger coins into lesser-known projects, the focus is turning to tokens that combine practical use with strong community backing. This is not just about short-term moves, but about identifying projects that offer real tools, access to early-stage growth, or meaningful engagement for holders. In this environment, the projects discussed above stand out as worth considering. They reflect the kinds of efforts that are not just following passing trends but are building features and connections that can carry them through the ups and downs of the market. For traders and holders alike, keeping an eye on these kinds of projects could prove worthwhile in the weeks ahead. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

2025-07-15T16:55:26,"Falling US Dollar Could Trigger ‘Full Bubble Cycle’ in Risk Assets, According to Ex-Goldman Sachs Exec Raoul Pal","Macroeconomics expert Raoul Pal says risk assets could witness massive eruptions if the US dollar continues to weaken. In a new video, Pal tells his 242,000 YouTube subscribers that if the US dollar index (DXY) falls further amid an improving business cycle, risk assets such as stocks and crypto could experience an extended bullish phase. “So what happens is when the business cycle picks up, there’s more disposable income and businesses have more investment income and that gets driven out of the risk curve always… And I think the inverse to the business cycle being so low for so long will be the flip side of the cycle will be longer than people expected because we’ve got this slight dislocation still working through post-Covid that then extends the business cycle… But if financial conditions keep moving, if they really have done some sort of Mar-a-Lago Accord, and they get the dollar [DXY] below 90. Okay, then we’re going on further and yeah, maybe it’s a full bubble cycle then.” The DXY, a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of six other leading currencies from major economies, is currently at 98. Pal further says an increase in global liquidity could also act as a bullish catalyst for asset prices amid high government debt levels. “Just using the liquidity framework, the business cycle framework, the financial conditions framework, it’s all suggesting that the probability is because they need to roll the debt, they’re going to have to increase more liquidity, and this is just going to drive assets up strongly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

BTC raced past $123,000 on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $123,097 before declining to settle at $119,714. Analysts believe BTC’ s rally is far from over, with predictions coming thick and fast. Most analysts believe the price could reach $135,000 before a market correction sets in. Strategy Resumes Bitcoin Shopping, Purchases 4,225 BTC For $472 Million Michael Saylor’s Strategy has resumed its weekly Bitcoin purchases, acquiring 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million at an average price of $111,827 per coin. The latest purchase takes Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 601,550 BTC , worth over $73 billion at current prices, at an average cost of $71,268 per Bitcoin for a total cost of $42.9 billion. The company holds nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s total supply and is sitting on almost $30 billion of paper gains. Strategy funded its latest acquisition from at-the-money (ATM) sales of its Class A common stock, MSTR, perpetual Strike preferred stock, STRK, perpetual Strife preferred stock, STRF, and perpetual Stride preferred stock, STRD. The company sold 797,008 MSTR shares for $330.9 million. $17.78 billion worth of MSTR shares remain available for issuance and sale as of July 13. The firm also sold 573,976 STRK shares for $71.1 million, and has $20.45 billion worth of STRK shares remaining available for sale and issuance under that program. Strategy also sold 444,005 STRF shares for $55.3 million, and has $1.88 billion remaining. Lastly, it sold 158,278 STRD shares for $15 million, with $4.19 billion available for sale and issuance. Standard Chartered Launches Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) Spot Trading Standard Chartered is allowing its institutional clients to trade Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) through its UK branch. Financial institutions have reported a substantial jump in demand for crypto products from clients as BTC surges to record levels. The decision allows institutional investors, corporates, and asset managers to conduct spot crypto trading using the bank’s existing platforms. Standard Chartered already offers several crypto products, including trading services via two subsidiary companies, Zodia Markets and Zodia Custody. Standard Chartered Chief Executive Bill Winters said in a statement, “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade, and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements.” Retail Demand Outpacing Bitcoin Supply Bitfinex analysts have said that even retail demand is outpacing supply, with new buyers entering the market buying the cryptocurrency faster than the rate at which miners mine it. The analysts stated in a market report, “Currently, the combined balance of these cohorts is expanding at a rate of approximately 19.3K BTC per month.” The analysts highlighted that the Shrimp ( BTC ), Crab (1-10 BTC ), and Fish (10-100 BTC ) holder groups were accumulating Bitcoin and growing their portfolio significantly faster than the monthly issuance rate. “Demand from this segment alone is more than enough to absorb all new supply. This cohort-level accumulation trend supports the broader bullish narrative that new buyers entering the Bitcoin market are price-agnostic buyers and are relentlessly accumulating with limited intervals.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a substantial decline during the ongoing session as traders lock in their profits after the flagship cryptocurrency raced to record highs on Monday. BTC crossed $116,000 on Friday and settled at $116,885. However, it lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline before rising 1.72% on Sunday and settling at $118,624. The price soared to a new all-time high on Monday, racing past $123,000 and settling at $123,091 before declining to $119,714. BTC is down over 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $117,030. Market experts believe the correction is driven by profit booking, as investors lock their gains after the price surged past $120,000. Despite the decline, Bitcoin ETFs reported $300 million in inflows, indicating continued investor confidence. Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, believes that BTC could push to $135,000 before any substantial correction. Stockton added that stocks like Coinbase and Strategy, which track BTC markets, will also perform well. “There is positive action across the universe of cryptocurrencies.” Other analysts offered similar predictions after BTC broke above $120,000 on Monday, crossing $123,000 on Coinbase before retreating. 10x Research head Markus Thielen stated, “Based on the July 10 breakout signal, which has historically led to an average 20% rally over the following two months, we project Bitcoin could reach $133,000. We expect some near-term consolidation, followed by a push toward $133,000, with our $160,000 year-end target still firmly in sight.” BTC reached an intraday high of $110,583 on Thursday (July 3), but lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.41% to $108,097. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.19% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday, settling at $109,231. Despite the positive weekend, BTC lost momentum on Monday, dropping almost 1% to $108,273. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC registered an increase of over 2% and settled at $111,255. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC registered an increase of 3.51% and settled at $115,159. Price action remained bullish on Friday as the flagship cryptocurrency rose 1.50%, settling at $116,885, but not before reaching an intraday high of $118,287. The rally took a breather on Saturday as the price registered a marginal decline. However, it resumed on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Monday, surging past $120,000 to reach $123,091. Despite strong bullish sentiment, it retreated from this level and settled at $119,714, ultimately rising 0.92%.

2025-07-15T16:06:37,"Stablecoins May Reshape U.S. Treasury Market at $750B Threshold, Standard Chartered Says","The stablecoin market could start reshaping traditional finance if it grows to about $750 billion, according to Geoff Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s head of digital assets research. Kendrick, writing in a note Tuesday after a week-long trip through Washington, New York and Boston, said there’s a growing consensus among crypto industry players, fund managers and policymakers that this $750 billion mark would be the tipping point where stablecoins begin to influence government debt issuance, monetary policy and the structure of U.S. Treasury markets through sheer demand. The current stablecoin market stands at about $240 billion. But Kendrick’s contacts expect it could more than triple by the end of 2026, driven by broadening use and regulatory clarity, particularly if the bipartisan GENIUS Act becomes law — a move that could happen as early as next week. “In the U.S., once the stablecoin market gets to a certain size, the amount of T-bills required to back stablecoins will likely require a shift in planned issuance across the curve towards more T-bill issuance, less longer-tenor issuance,” Kendrick wrote. “This potentially has implications for the shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and demand for USD assets.” Stablecoins — cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a fixed value, usually $1 — are typically backed by cash-equivalent reserves, most often short-term U.S. government debt. As demand rises, so too does the need to hold vast quantities of Treasury bills, putting stablecoins on a potential collision course with traditional fixed income markets. Kendrick met with a cross-section of market participants during his U.S. visit, including Bitcoin miners, crypto-native firms, traditional hedge funds and policymakers, he said. Their near-unanimous focus: stablecoins. Market participants expect a wave of stablecoin issuance, not just from crypto firms, but possibly from banks and even local governments. Emerging markets may be the most immediately affected. Kendrick flagged concerns that individuals in these regions are using stablecoins as a digital savings vehicle, pulling capital away from local banking systems and central bank reserves. That could challenge financial stability in countries that rely on U.S. dollar liquidity to manage fixed exchange rates or capital controls. On the U.S. front, stablecoins could shift corporate treasuries away from traditional banking and into tokenized cash alternatives. But how much of their cash businesses move on-chain — and how fast — remains uncertain. The growing attention is reflected in public markets. Shares of Circle (CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, have surged 540% since its public debut last month. The run-up signals investor confidence in stablecoins as a central pillar of the next phase of digital finance.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/stablecoins-may-reshape-u-s-treasury-market-at-usd750b-threshold-standard-chartered-says,"MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE","Markets|Stablecoins|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T16:04:45,"Whales Are Back in Meme Coins After Bitcoin’s New ATH – This Telegram Bot Could Help You Find the Best Ones","Bitcoin’s (BTC) new all-time high has reignited the entire crypto market, and meme coins are once again in the spotlight. Dogecoin (DOGE) is drawing in whales and institutional traders alike, pushing futures volume to over $1.5 billion on Monday. And as attention shifts back to high-risk, high-reward plays, many traders are turning to automation – not because it guarantees wins, but because the right bot can at least tilt the odds in your favor, such as Snorter Bot Token (SNORT) . The most recognized bots in the space such as Banana Gun, Maestro, and Unibot have all originated on Ethereum – a chain that’s notorious for congestion and high gas fees. Snorter takes a different route, being built natively on Solana, where transactions are faster and cheaper by design. Since last year, the network has become the preferred engine for meme coin trading and now, with a purpose-built bot operating directly on it, traders can finally match that speed with execution optimized for it. For those looking to support the development of a sharper tool for spotting high-potential tokens, the SNORT presale is live and has raised nearly $1.9 million. Tokens are available at $0.0981 for the next two hours before the price ticks up to the next presale stage. Meme Coin Volatility Is Back – But Snorter Can Trade the Chaos Meme coins have now topped $70 billion in market capitalization, according to CoinGecko. Since Bitcoin broke its all-time high in May, investors have funneled gains into the industry’s less serious assets, with Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and Bonk (BONK) climbing 11%, 22.1%, and 26.7% respectively, over the past week. DOGE, boosted by heavy whale accumulation, surged 13.9% in the same timeframe. But the returns across the sector can vary wildly. Among the top 10 meme coins, Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) led the pack with a 105% weekly gain – far above the usual 15% to 25% range. Meanwhile, lesser-known tokens like MemeCore (M) have exploded even harder, clocking in at 598% since July 3, driven by the hype around its Layer-1 blockchain built specifically for meme coins. The price action is reminiscent of the speculative frenzy last seen in mid-2023. Yet, spotting tokens on the verge of a breakout is tough to do manually. That’s where crypto trading bots like Snorter Token help level the playing field for retail traders. As mentioned earlier, Snorter’s Solana-native foundation gives it a clear edge in execution. Unlike Ethereum-based bots that often get bogged down by high fees and network congestion, Snorter is meant for high-frequency trading, exactly the kind of environment Telegram bots are meant to thrive in. Snorter Token is Built Exactly for the Traders Who Never Log Off Snorter is designed for the rhythm of meme coin season, when new tokens drop without warning, and seconds determine a winning trade from a losing trade. As mentioned, it runs directly inside Telegram, so trades happen in the same space where calls, rumors, and alpha get posted in real time. What makes Snorter stand out isn’t just the execution speed, though, but also the full environment it builds around the trader. It features real-time feed monitoring, wallet mirroring, and sniper configurations, and it compresses the entire trading flow into a single, responsive interface. Essentially, with these features, users can track wallets, set up sniper parameters to auto-buy tokens based on specific triggers, and deploy swaps instantly. And with MEV protection built in, trades land cleanly without being front-run by predatory bots. Snorter also helps flag contracts with red flags – including honeypots, which let you buy but block you from selling – giving traders added security in a market filled with stealth launches and fast-moving traps. On Solana, tokens regularly 2x within the first minute of launch on DEX Screener – often before Telegram groups or X even react. With Snorter, that early edge becomes accessible to retail. Snorter is also structured for expansion. As mentioned, multi-chain support is on the roadmap, and community proposals will soon guide its direction from what gets prioritized next to how features evolve. The end goal is a trading bot that’s intuitive enough to become a full-on crypto trading command center – one that’s ready for a renewed meme coin season in 2025. How to Buy SNORT at a Discount In short, trading the meme coin market – especially with buying activity surging again – is nearly impossible without automation. But if you think any trading bot will do the job, you’d be mistaken. Once launched, one of Snorter’s biggest advantages – beyond its speed and functionality – is its cost-efficiency. Simply holding SNORT unlocks execution fees as low as 0.85% – the lowest in the space. Most competing bots charge between 1% and 2%, making Snorter a clear value pick for active traders aiming to maximize returns. And of course, SNORT tokens aren’t just a currency within the tool – they’re exposure to the ecosystem itself, with future rewards, governance rights, and utility baked in for those who want a stake in how the platform evolves. If you’re ready to back it, head to the Snorter Token presale site and secure your SNORT using SOL, ETH, BNB, USDT, USDC, or a credit card. SNORT tokens bought in the presale can generate passive returns through its own staking pool that currently offers a dynamic 207% APY. For the smoothest experience, use Best Wallet – the only Web3 wallet that shows your SNORT balance in-app and gives early access to new token launches through its exclusive ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section. Download Best Wallet now on Google Play or the Apple App Store . Follow Snorter Token on X and Instagram for the latest updates.
