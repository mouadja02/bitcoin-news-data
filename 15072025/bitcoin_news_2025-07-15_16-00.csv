The firm holds a stake of nearly 8%, worth $9.26 billion. It includes more than 20 million shares. The largest stake—5.7 million shares—is in the Total Stock Market Index Fund (VITSX). Vanguard did not select Strategy stock in a targeted way. The purchase was automatic because the company is included in various stock indexes. Vanguard's passive funds are required to track these indexes by purchasing the corresponding assets. The investment firm's management has repeatedly expressed its aversion to cryptocurrencies. The company called them ”unsuitable” for long-term investors and refused to add a spot Bitcoin ETF to its platform. ”We don't believe this asset has a place in the portfolio,” said Vanguard's former CEO Tim Buckley. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas called the situation ironic. ”God has a sense of humor. By choosing the path of index funds, Vanguard is obligated to own all stocks—whether it likes them or not,” he explained. Strategy founder Michael Saylor sees the event as ”a powerful signal of growing institutional support for Bitcoin.” In his opinion, it reflects the acceptance of digital gold as a reserve asset by the traditional financial community. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of the first cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, the company owns 601,550 BTC, representing over 2.8% of Bitcoin's total supply and valued at more than $73 billion. The company recently acquired an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, highlighting its ongoing aggressive accumulation strategy. As Bitcoin prices hover near all-time highs, Strategy's total unrealized gains exceed $30 billion, illustrating both the scale and impact of its bold treasury approach.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9949/vanguard-bitcoin-critic-invests-9-b-in-strategy-stocks,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T13:50:15,"Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit Surge: Glassnode Reveals $3.5B Realized Gains","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit Surge: Glassnode Reveals $3.5B Realized Gains The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode: Bitcoin investors have just experienced an astounding period of profit-taking, realizing a staggering $3.5 billion in gains within a mere 24-hour window. This monumental event marks the largest daily Bitcoin profit realization observed so far this year, underscoring a pivotal moment in the current market cycle. But what does this massive inflow of cash mean for the broader market, and who exactly is driving this surge? Understanding Realized Profit: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Investors? Before diving into the specifics, let’s clarify what ‘ realized profit ‘ truly signifies in the world of Bitcoin. Essentially, it refers to the total amount of profit taken by investors when they sell their BTC for a price higher than their acquisition cost. This metric is crucial because it provides a clear picture of actual capital flowing out of the Bitcoin network and into fiat or other assets, rather than just paper gains. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform, meticulously tracks these movements by analyzing transactions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Their comprehensive Glassnode data offers invaluable insights into investor behavior, market sentiment, and potential shifts in supply and demand dynamics. When Glassnode reports such a significant figure, it’s a strong indicator of market activity and investor confidence, or perhaps, strategic repositioning. Glassnode Data Unveils Key Insights: Who’s Cashing In? The recent $3.5 billion profit realization isn’t just a big number; it’s a story of different investor cohorts making strategic moves. According to the detailed analysis provided by Glassnode, the profits were not evenly distributed among all market participants. Here’s the breakdown: Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are the seasoned Bitcoin investors who have held their BTC for more than 155 days. They accounted for a substantial $1.96 billion of the total realized profits, representing approximately 56% of the overall sum. Short-Term Holders (STHs): In contrast, STHs are newer entrants or more active traders who have held their Bitcoin for 155 days or less. They contributed $1.54 billion to the realized profits, making up around 44% of the total. The fact that long-term holders are leading this profit-taking spree is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a degree of conviction and strategic decision-making from those who have weathered previous market cycles and held through significant volatility. This trend offers critical insights into the current market structure. The Dominance of Long-Term Holders: A Sign of Strength or Caution? When long-term holders decide to realize profits on such a grand scale, it can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it indicates that these investors are seeing substantial gains, which validates their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Their willingness to sell at current prices suggests they believe the market has reached a point where it’s opportune to lock in gains. Historically, significant profit realization by LTHs can precede periods of market consolidation or even minor corrections, as large amounts of supply re-enter circulation. However, it can also be a healthy sign of a mature market where strong hands are distributing assets to new demand, preventing overheating and allowing for sustainable growth. The market’s ability to absorb such a large amount of selling pressure from LTHs without a significant price drop would indicate robust underlying demand. Are Short-Term Holders Following Suit? Analyzing Recent Bitcoin Profit-Taking While long-term holders took the lion’s share, the contribution from short-term holders to the overall Bitcoin profit realization is also significant. STHs are often more reactive to price movements, and their profit-taking can signal a more immediate response to recent price surges. Their behavior can sometimes indicate a ‘top’ in the short-term, as newer investors or traders cash out quickly. However, the fact that LTHs’ realized profits surpassed STHs’ by a notable margin suggests that the market isn’t solely being driven by speculative short-term trading. It implies a more fundamental distribution from long-held supply, which could be absorbed by new demand coming into the market, eager to buy Bitcoin even at higher prices. Navigating the Market: What Does This Glassnode Data Imply for Your Strategy? For investors, understanding this latest Glassnode data is paramount. It provides a clearer picture of who is selling and why, allowing for more informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Demand: The key question now is whether there’s enough new demand to absorb this influx of realized profits without a significant price correction. Strong institutional and retail interest would be crucial. Volatility Expectation: Large profit-taking events can sometimes lead to increased market volatility as supply re-enters the market. Investors should be prepared for potential price swings. On-Chain Metrics are Key: This event highlights the importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Glassnode offer unparalleled transparency into market dynamics that traditional financial metrics simply cannot provide. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Perspective: Evaluate your own investment horizon. If you’re a long-term holder, this might be a healthy distribution. If you’re a short-term trader, it might signal a need for caution. The $3.5 billion in realized profits over 24 hours is a testament to Bitcoin’s incredible performance and the substantial gains accumulated by its investors. Led primarily by long-term holders, this event showcases a significant redistribution of wealth within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While such large-scale profit-taking warrants careful observation, it also underscores the maturity of the Bitcoin market and the effectiveness of on-chain analytics in providing a transparent view of investor behavior. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these underlying dynamics will be crucial for navigating the path ahead.

Posting on X, he addressed growing concerns about Bitcoin’s long-term future, offering a grounded take based on decades of trading experience and a solid grasp of macroeconomic trends. His latest comments are changing the conversation. Instead of predicting a crash, Brandt suggests Bitcoin may be nearing the natural end of its current growth cycle. It’s a realistic yet hopeful message, and one that matters for investors, traders, and crypto watchers alike. Is Bitcoin’s Parabolic Growth Still Realistic? The debate started when Brandt shared a parabolic regression chart of Bitcoin’s price history on July 13. The chart tracks BTC’s rise since inception, but not everyone was convinced by what it showed. One user pointed out that for Bitcoin to keep following the same steep upward path, it would need capital inflows in the tens of trillions of dollars, a level that feels unlikely in the current economic environment. They also noted that institutional and corporate buyers are now paying more while getting less, raising doubts about whether Bitcoin can keep breaking out like it used to.

He agreed that Bitcoin could be nearing the peak of its current growth arc unless there’s a major shift in the global reserve currency system. I tend to agree. Short of a complete re-ordering of the global reserve currency structure I believe we will soon reach a climax in this advance — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 14, 2025 This moment marks a rare intersection where technical charts and macroeconomic realities align. And coming from someone as seasoned as Brandt, it carries weight. He isn’t saying Bitcoin will crash. But he is pointing out that the fast, exponential growth we’ve seen over the past decade might be slowing down, at least for now. Not the End But Definitely a New Phase Brandt’s response shifts the narrative. While critics argue that rising inefficiencies and long-term resistance levels suggest a blow-off top, he sees something different. Bitcoin is going forward but gains won’t come easy.

2025-07-15T13:40:11,"Hilbert Group’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Signals Growing Institutional Confidence","BitcoinWorld Hilbert Group’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Signals Growing Institutional Confidence In a significant move that underscores the growing confidence of traditional finance in the digital asset space, Nasdaq-listed Hilbert Group has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. This development isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful indicator of how established financial entities are strategically integrating cryptocurrencies into their portfolios. Let’s delve into what this means for the market and the future of institutional engagement with Bitcoin. What Does This Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for Hilbert Group? The news, initially shared by @btcNLNico on X, reveals that Hilbert Group , a prominent digital asset investment firm listed on Nasdaq, has successfully acquired an additional 233 Bitcoin from Deus X Capital, a well-known operator in the crypto and fintech sectors. This latest purchase brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 430 BTC. But why is this particular Bitcoin acquisition so noteworthy? Increased Exposure: By nearly doubling its BTC reserves, Hilbert Group is signaling a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a core asset in a diversified portfolio. Strategic Positioning: This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s a calculated move by a publicly traded company to deepen its commitment to the digital asset class, potentially leveraging Bitcoin’s deflationary characteristics and growth potential. Market Confidence: When a Nasdaq-listed entity makes such a public and substantial move, it sends a powerful message to the broader market, potentially encouraging other institutional players to follow suit. This expansion of their BTC holdings is a clear testament to Hilbert Group’s strategic vision, positioning them as a key player in the evolving landscape where traditional finance meets decentralized innovation. Why Are Institutional Crypto Investments on the Rise? The trend of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency market is undeniable, and Hilbert Group’s latest move is a prime example. What’s driving this surge in institutional crypto interest? Several factors contribute to this growing appetite among major financial players: Bitcoin as a Store of Value and Inflation Hedge In an economic climate marked by inflation concerns and volatile traditional markets, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a viable store of value, akin to digital gold. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative for institutions seeking to preserve capital and hedge against economic uncertainties. The narrative around Bitcoin’s scarcity continues to resonate with investors looking beyond conventional assets. Maturing Market Infrastructure and Regulatory Clarity The cryptocurrency market has come a long way from its nascent days. We now see more robust infrastructure, including regulated exchanges, secure custody solutions, and clearer regulatory frameworks emerging in various jurisdictions. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year, for instance, significantly lowered the barrier to entry for institutional investors, providing a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin holdings . Diversification and Growth Potential Institutions are constantly seeking new avenues for diversification and growth. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, offer a unique risk-reward profile that can complement existing portfolios. While volatility remains a factor, the long-term growth trajectory and potential for significant returns make them an appealing asset class for those with a strategic, forward-looking investment horizon. How Does a Digital Asset Firm Navigate the Volatile Crypto Market? Being a dedicated digital asset firm in the cryptocurrency space requires a unique blend of expertise, risk management, and foresight. For companies like Hilbert Group, increasing their Bitcoin reserves isn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision but a result of careful analysis and strategic planning. How do they manage to thrive in such a dynamic environment? Robust Risk Management Frameworks Institutions employ sophisticated risk management strategies to mitigate the inherent volatility of the crypto market. This includes diversification beyond just Bitcoin, setting clear allocation limits, utilizing advanced trading algorithms, and implementing stringent security protocols to protect their digital assets. Deep Market Research and Expertise A successful digital asset firm invests heavily in research and development, maintaining a deep understanding of market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory shifts. This allows them to identify promising opportunities and make informed decisions, such as a strategic Bitcoin acquisition , that align with their long-term objectives. Long-Term Vision Over Short-Term Fluctuations While daily price movements grab headlines, established firms like Hilbert Group typically adopt a long-term investment philosophy. They focus on the fundamental value proposition of assets like Bitcoin and the transformative potential of blockchain technology, rather than reacting to every market swing. This patient approach is crucial for accumulating substantial BTC holdings and realizing significant returns over time. What Does This Signal for the Future of Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption? The actions of firms like Hilbert Group provide valuable insights into the evolving perception of Bitcoin within mainstream finance. Their latest Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a harbinger of things to come. So, what might the future hold? Continued Institutional Inflow As more firms like Hilbert Group demonstrate successful integration of digital assets, we can anticipate a ripple effect. The increased transparency and regulatory clarity will likely attract even more pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries to allocate a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Mainstreaming of Digital Assets The distinction between ‘traditional’ and ‘digital’ assets will continue to blur. Cryptocurrencies will increasingly be viewed as a legitimate and essential component of a well-rounded investment strategy, moving beyond niche status to become a staple in institutional portfolios. Impact on Market Liquidity and Stability Greater institutional participation typically brings increased liquidity and potentially reduced volatility to a market. As larger, more stable entities commit capital, the market could become more resilient to sudden price swings, fostering a more mature and predictable environment for all participants. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor While most individual investors don’t operate on the scale of a Nasdaq-listed digital asset firm , there are valuable lessons to be learned from Hilbert Group’s strategic moves: Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Institutions focus on the bigger picture. Consider Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than a short-term trade. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure it aligns with your personal financial goals. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is dominant, explore other promising digital assets. However, always conduct thorough research. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments, regulatory changes, and institutional moves. Knowledge is power in this rapidly evolving space. A Bold Step Forward for Digital Assets Hilbert Group’s decision to significantly boost its Bitcoin holdings with an additional 233 BTC from Deus X Capital is a powerful statement. It underscores the growing legitimacy and strategic importance of Bitcoin within the financial landscape. As a Nasdaq-listed digital asset firm , their actions provide a clear signal of confidence, not just in Bitcoin, but in the entire future of institutional crypto investment. This move highlights a broader trend where traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the undeniable value and potential of decentralized assets. It’s a fascinating time to witness the convergence of established financial powerhouses and the revolutionary world of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for a more integrated and digitally-driven financial future.

2025-07-15T13:38:31,"XRP Price Prediction For July 15","The post XRP Price Prediction For July 15 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP holders have had a bumpy ride over the past week. After showing a strong bullish trend and briefly testing the $3 resistance level, the price has pulled back slightly. According to recent analysis , XRP is currently holding up better than Bitcoin on the lower timeframes, despite the overall market cooling down. While a breakout above $3 seemed possible earlier, the odds now hint it might be a bit too soon for that move. If XRP can find strong support around $2.70 to $2.60, there’s a good chance the token will consolidate in that zone, a positive sign for the next possible push higher. Market sentiment will also hinge on upcoming inflation data, which has the potential to shake up crypto prices in the short term. If the broader market stays steady and XRP manages to hold above $2.70, a move past $3 could still happen later this month. But for now, the focus is on whether XRP can defend key support levels before attempting another breakout. Here’s what to expect: Short-term: Likely to dip towards $2.70–$2.60 Medium-term: Consolidation above $2.70 could open doors for a future breakout Watch for: Inflation data impact and overall crypto market sentiment Analyst Casi Trades shared that over the weekend, XRP perfectly retested the $2.69 support level and is now challenging the crucial $3 resistance. The $3 level is a key Fibonacci retracement from XRP’s all-time high, and reclaiming it would signal serious momentum. The ideal scenario next would be a breakout above $3.04, a quick retest turning it into support, and a sharp rally toward $3.40 and beyond. If XRP breaks past its all-time high, Casi expects the price to surge rapidly, with little resistance ahead, and plenty of time for this move to play out before the end of July.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-july-15/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

SEC Settlement: The Seal of Approval for Central Banks to Use XRP","Crypto Researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to the broader significance of the ongoing legal proceedings between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In a recent tweet, SMQKE stated that the conclusion of the Ripple v. SEC case would serve as a “seal of approval” for central banks and other financial institutions to begin adopting XRP through the XRP Ledger. SMQKE pinpoints that such an outcome would reduce regulatory uncertainty around the asset, which has been a key concern for institutional players considering the use of XRP in cross-border settlement and liquidity operations. A visual accompanying the tweet elaborated that settlement of the case is likely to make XRP usage by central banks and other large financial actors far less speculative than other notable cryptocurrency-related events, such as corporate bitcoin purchases. The document noted, by way of contrast, that even Tesla’s high-profile Bitcoin acquisition lacked the regulatory clarity that central banks and regulated financial entities require before adopting digital assets at scale. Ripple v. SEC conclusion —> “Seal of Approval for Central Banks to use XRP through the XRP Ledger.” https://t.co/rCUcHjCiX5 pic.twitter.com/OzslSbdBfD — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 13, 2025 Settlement Process Still Underway As of July 2025, the Ripple v. SEC case is still active. However, substantial progress has been made toward a resolution. In March 2025, Ripple and the SEC announced an agreement that would reduce Ripple’s civil penalty to $50 million, with the company no longer pursuing its appeal of the court’s earlier rulings. In return, the SEC agreed to withdraw its appeal and indicated that it would not pursue further litigation on the same issues. However, the proposed settlement is still subject to approval by the presiding judge, and key procedural steps remain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to a Times Tabloid report, Judge Analisa Torres declined in June to vacate the injunction against Ripple immediately, citing procedural and jurisdictional reasons. The SEC still needs to complete its internal voting process, which is expected to take several weeks, before filing a formal motion to dismiss its appeal and finalize the settlement. Both parties are expected to submit an update to the court by August 15, making it the likely timeframe for the formal closure of the case. Impact of Institutional Adoption of XRP SMQKE’s remarks reflect a widely held view among XRP advocates that the resolution of the SEC lawsuit will eliminate a major obstacle to institutional adoption. Since the SEC filed its complaint in late 2020, accusing Ripple of selling unregistered securities, many U.S.-based exchanges delisted XRP, and financial institutions hesitated to incorporate it into their operations. A completed settlement, with no further legal challenge from the SEC, would confirm that XRP can be used without fear of additional regulatory enforcement, which could make it a viable option for central banks exploring distributed ledger technology for cross-border settlement.

2025-07-15T13:30:31,"Dogecoin Poised For A Monster Rally Amid Brewing Altcoin Season","In livestream that stretched beyond the hour‑mark, technical analyst Kevin (Kev Capital TA) laid out the most compelling bullish case for Dogecoin since the meme‑coin’s April lows. Speaking to a cross‑platform audience, Kevin argued that the market is standing “right on the verge of a genuine altcoin season,” and that the textbook double‑bottom visible on Dogecoin’s higher‑time‑frame chart positions the asset for what he called “a monster move” once resistance levels yield. Dogecoin Chart Turns Bullish Kevin began by situating Dogecoin inside a broader macro chessboard. This week’s cascade of inflation data—CPI and PPI prints bracketed by near‑continuous Federal Reserve commentary—could inject volatility, he conceded, but the direction of trend is already set by structural forces. “Trueflation is sitting at 1.71 percent,” he noted, adding that the crowdsourced gauge routinely prints about sixty to seventy basis points beneath official Bureau of Labor Statistics data. “Anything under two is good. It means inflation isn’t the story.” Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23—Is It Too Far-Fetched? With macro risks in check, his focus narrowed to USDT dominance, the metric he has used all cycle to time rotations into riskier assets. Tether’s market‑share chart has completed a bear‑flag breakdown and is now pressing the 0.786 Fibonacci support band at roughly 4.14 percent. “When money‑flow is deep red on USDT‑D, that’s the green light for altcoins,” he said, emphasising that fresh downside in the stablecoin gauge would coincide almost mechanically with upside in DOGE. A hotter‑than‑expected CPI could deliver a short, counter‑trend bounce in USDT‑D, “but the path of least resistance is lower,” he insisted. The anchor for Kevin’s bullish thesis is an unmistakable double‑bottom on Dogecoin’s weekly chart that formed exactly on the macro 0.382 retracement of the 2024–25 advance and directly atop a multi‑year down‑trend line. “Flip the chart upside‑down,” he told viewers, “and you’d run from it—it looks like a perfect double‑top. Flip it back and it’s a gift.” Volume profiles confirm the pattern: sellers exhausted themselves on the second dip, while relative‑strength momentum created a higher low, an early signal that bulls are wresting control. Kevin’s conviction draws added weight from what is unfolding in the aggregate altcoin indices. Total 3—market‑cap ex‑Bitcoin and ex‑Ether—has slammed into a resistance “yellow box” that capped rallies all spring, yet the analyst believes the ceiling will crack soon. A pending daily golden cross on Total 2 (market‑cap ex‑Bitcoin) marks the fourth of the cycle; each prior cross generated a brief pullback of 9‑19 percent before giving way to fresh highs. “Golden crosses are lagging, so you manage risk here—pay yourself a little—but the trend is higher once the dust settles,” he said. For Dogecoin specifically, Kevin identified a hierarchy of breakout objectives: the local range high at $0.21, the $0.48 pivot from 2024, and the former all‑time high near $0.74. Beyond that he flagged extensions at $1.32 and $2.00, noting that targets lose utility if projected too far in advance. “We analyse the here and now; we let the chart earn the next level,” he cautioned, before reminding newcomers that DOGE is already a ten‑bagger off its June 2024 trough—a feat matched by few large‑cap tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It’s No Meme While audience questions repeatedly drifted towards Elon Musk and X and Tesla integration rumors, Kevin waved off the cult of personality. “Dogecoin doesn’t need Elon,” he said bluntly. The meme‑coin’s 10× rebound happened “with zero help from the world’s richest man,” and any future endorsement would likely serve as accelerant rather than spark. What matters, in his view, is liquidity: specifically, the Federal Reserve’s balance‑sheet trajectory and the timing of its eventual pivot away from quantitative tightening. “When QT ends, Bitcoin dominance tops. Then you get the real alt‑season,” he said, pointing to a perfect inverse correlation between Fed asset‑runoff periods and historical altcoin booms. Ending the session, the analyst projected that a decisive weekly close above Bitcoin’s 1.886 fib at $120,000—and a simultaneous rollover in USDT dominance—would ignite the next leg. In that scenario, Dogecoin’s double‑bottom would evolve into a full trend‑reversal, vaulting price into territory last visited during the meme‑mania of 2021. “You haven’t seen anything yet,” he concluded. “Stay calm, stay cool, and let the chart do the work.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19126.

In a post that’s doing rounds, Geraci pointed out the irony that while investment giant Vanguard is now the biggest shareholder of MicroStrategy, a company famous for its massive Bitcoin holdings, it still refuses to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs on its own platform. “If you don’t see the irony here, I don’t know what to tell you,” Geraci said, hinting it’s high time Vanguard opened its doors to crypto ETFs. Looking ahead, Geraci said that BlackRock should get more aggressive in the crypto space by filing for spot ETFs on popular tokens like XRP, Solana, and even a broader crypto index. He also feels firms like State Street and Schwab are falling behind and should move quickly to stay in the game. 2) Not too late for State Street (3rd largest ETF issuer) to enter category. Honestly don’t understand strategy here. Do they think they’re somehow protecting gold ETFs? 3) Schwab should file for/launch spot crypto ETFs. Why give advantage to Fidelity, their primary competitor? — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 15, 2025 According to a recent Bloomberg report, several crypto tokens are lined up for potential ETF approvals in 2025. The frontrunners? Solana, XRP, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Hedera, and Avalanche. But Geraci and other market watchers believe XRP and Solana have the best shot, thanks to strong interest from big financial firms and solid network growth. While ETF launches often spark price surges beforehand, they can also trigger a “sell the news” dip once they go live. The market has seen it before with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. That said, projects with strong fundamentals and big-name partnerships tend to bounce back and perform well over time. Right now, XRP seems especially well-positioned. It has low exposure in existing Grayscale trusts, a growing list of financial service partnerships, and several ETF applications already in motion. Solana isn’t far behind, with one of the most active networks in the market and rising institutional backing. If everything goes as expected, the second half of 2025 could be huge for crypto ETFs — and names like XRP and Solana might lead the charge.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-news-xrp-and-solana-etfs-could-be-2025s-big-winners-heres-why/,"SOL|XRP|MARKET|BTC|TRADING","News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

The recent breakthrough could catalyze further financialization of crypto, leading to more traditional entries. With the GENIUS Act gaining steam, the crypto rally is lifting TradFi’s biggest on‑ramp. Bitcoin’s recent charge to $122 000 sets the tone. It rips past key resistance. Volume spikes. Fear of missing out kicks in. As BTC rallies, capital flows into major exchanges. Coinbase sits in the sweet spot. Its platform handles massive order books and deep liquidity. Traders and institutions flock in. No more retail‑only frenzy. Big money is here. Hedge funds. Pension pools. Sovereign wealth. They’re all on Coinbase’s books. CoinMarketCap shows daily trading volume at $3.8 billion and fully diluted valuation at $100.5 billion. That’s the highest since its 2021 IPO. Analysts Turn Bullish For $COIN Wall Street firms are upping price targets. Some now forecast $COIN north of $420. The logic is simple: more BTC price gains mean more trading, more fees, more revenue. And with Bitcoin’s path pointing skyward, Coinbase’s upside seems baked in. Circle’s IPO filing steals headlines. USDC — the world’s second‑largest stablecoin — gains a direct route to public markets. That shine spills over to Coinbase, a key USDC custodian. Confidence in crypto‑native companies surges. Investors reallocate into infrastructure plays like $COIN. Washington’s tone is turning. The GENIUS Act moves through committees. It promises clear rules without stifling innovation. Lawmakers talk pro‑crypto. Wall Street reads between the lines: regulations are coming, and they’ll favor established players. Coinbase checks every box. Coinbase’s debut in the S&P 500 is more than symbolic. It unlocks passive money. Index funds and ETFs must buy $COIN to mirror the index. That creates a steady bid under the stock. And every new dollar in flows translates directly into market cap gains. These catalysts feed each other. BTC’s rise fuels volume. Regulatory clarity fuels institutional trust. IPO buzz fuels sector interest. S&P inclusion fuels passive inflows. Together, they create a crypto‑TradFi flywheel that’s just getting started. Major financial players are lining up. BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan expand crypto desks. They need a reliable, compliant on‑ramp. Coinbase fits the bill. Expect more custody mandates and staking deals. That’s recurring revenue waiting to be claimed.

If Bitcoin makes a run at $150 K, Coinbase could push toward a $150 billion market cap. But this isn’t pure price speculation. It’s about infrastructure dominance. Coinbase stands to benefit from every new crypto product and service. Crossing $100 billion marks crypto’s evolution. Digital assets step out of niche status into mainstream finance. Coinbase becomes a household name alongside Nasdaq and CME. For retail, that means better products, lower fees, and broader market access underpinned by institutional-grade security. Coinbase’s rise to $398.50 and beyond reflects a fundamental shift: crypto is no longer fringe. It’s woven into the fabric of global finance.

2025-07-15T13:20:03,"Standard Chartered Unleashes Breakthrough: First Global Bank Offers Direct Crypto Spot Trading","BitcoinWorld Standard Chartered Unleashes Breakthrough: First Global Bank Offers Direct Crypto Spot Trading The financial world is buzzing with a groundbreaking announcement that signals a new era for digital assets. Standard Chartered, a name synonymous with global banking, has officially stepped into the arena of direct cryptocurrency trading. This isn’t just another crypto headline; it’s a monumental shift, positioning Standard Chartered crypto services at the forefront of institutional adoption. What Does Standard Chartered Crypto Spot Trading Mean for Institutions? For years, institutional investors have navigated a complex landscape to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies. While various avenues like exchange-traded products (ETPs) and derivatives existed, direct spot trading—the actual buying and selling of the underlying digital asset—remained largely outside the purview of major global banks. Standard Chartered has shattered this barrier. According to CoinDesk, the UK-based financial giant has commenced offering direct spot trading services for two of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This service is being facilitated through its UK branch and is currently available during Asia and Europe trading hours. This move unequivocally positions Standard Chartered as the first major global financial institution to provide such direct access to its institutional clients. Imagine the doors this opens for large-scale investors who previously faced significant hurdles in accessing direct crypto exposure. Standard Chartered’s offering provides a regulated, trusted pathway for institutions to engage with the digital asset market directly. The bank is also reportedly considering expanding this access to a 24-hour, five-day-a-week service, a decision that will largely depend on client demand and market evolution. This flexibility underscores a client-centric approach, adapting traditional banking hours to the always-on nature of the crypto market. Why is Institutional Crypto Adoption Accelerating? The move by Standard Chartered is not an isolated event but rather a strong indicator of a broader trend: accelerating institutional crypto adoption . Several factors are contributing to this surge of interest from traditional finance: Growing Client Demand: Institutional clients, from hedge funds to asset managers and corporate treasuries, are increasingly seeking exposure to digital assets for diversification, potential growth, and inflation hedging. Maturation of the Market: The cryptocurrency market has evolved significantly beyond its early, nascent stages. Improved infrastructure, more robust custody solutions, and clearer regulatory frameworks (albeit still evolving) have made it a more palatable and secure environment for institutional players. Performance and Diversification: Bitcoin and Ethereum have demonstrated periods of significant outperformance compared to traditional asset classes. Institutions view them as potential diversifiers within their portfolios, especially in an era of low interest rates and macroeconomic uncertainty. Regulatory Progress: While global regulatory clarity is still a work in progress, various jurisdictions are making strides in establishing frameworks for digital assets. This gradual legitimization provides institutions with greater confidence to enter the space. However, it’s not without its challenges. Institutions must still navigate: Regulatory Uncertainty: Patchy and inconsistent regulations across different jurisdictions remain a hurdle. Security Concerns: The digital nature of crypto assets means they are susceptible to cyber threats and hacks, necessitating robust security protocols. Volatility: While potentially offering high returns, cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, which requires sophisticated risk management strategies. Operational Complexities: Integrating crypto into existing traditional finance systems can be complex, requiring new technologies and expertise. The Impact on Bitcoin Spot Trading and Ethereum Standard Chartered’s direct offering for Bitcoin spot trading and Ethereum spot trading carries significant implications for the broader crypto market: Increased Liquidity and Price Discovery: With a major global bank facilitating direct spot trades, we can expect a substantial increase in market liquidity. Large institutional orders, previously routed through less direct channels, will now flow directly into the spot market. This can lead to more efficient price discovery and potentially reduce volatility as order books deepen. Enhanced Legitimacy and Trust: When a venerable institution like Standard Chartered, with its extensive global network and reputation, provides direct crypto services, it confers a powerful stamp of legitimacy on the digital asset class. This can help erode lingering skepticism from traditional finance circles and attract even more conservative investors. Paving the Way for Others: Standard Chartered’s pioneering move could act as a catalyst, prompting other major global banks and financial institutions to follow suit. As the first-mover, SC sets a precedent, demonstrating that direct crypto spot trading is not only feasible but also a viable and in-demand service for institutional clients. This could kickstart a domino effect, leading to widespread adoption across the banking sector. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which provide exposure through derivatives or trusts, direct spot trading allows institutions to hold the actual underlying asset, appealing to those who prefer direct ownership and the potential for activities like staking or lending the assets themselves. Navigating the Future: Opportunities for Crypto Institutional Investors For crypto institutional investors , Standard Chartered’s initiative is more than just news; it’s a clear signal of the industry’s direction. The opportunities emerging from this evolution are vast: Broader Access and Product Offerings: We can anticipate that as demand grows, banks like Standard Chartered might expand their offerings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum to include other prominent altcoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and perhaps even tokenized real-world assets. Integrated Financial Services: The future could see crypto services seamlessly integrated into existing banking platforms, offering institutions a holistic view of their traditional and digital asset portfolios, along with advanced analytics and reporting. Enhanced Risk Management Tools: As more institutional capital enters the space, there will be an increased demand for sophisticated risk management tools tailored to the unique characteristics of digital assets, including volatility management, collateralization, and regulatory compliance solutions. Here’s a snapshot of the benefits and considerations for institutions engaging in direct crypto spot trading: Benefits for Institutions Key Considerations Direct ownership of underlying assets (BTC, ETH) Evolving regulatory landscape Increased liquidity and tighter spreads Need for robust cybersecurity measures Potential for diversification and hedging Managing price volatility Access to a regulated and trusted counterparty Operational integration complexities Opportunities for staking, lending, and yield generation Due diligence on custody solutions For institutions contemplating their entry or deeper involvement in the crypto space, Standard Chartered’s move offers a compelling case for action. It underscores the growing legitimacy and integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. The key is to approach this new frontier with a clear strategy, thorough due diligence, and a robust understanding of both the opportunities and the inherent risks. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Digital Assets in Traditional Finance Standard Chartered’s bold move marks a pivotal moment, not just for the bank, but for the entire financial ecosystem. By becoming the first global bank to offer direct crypto spot trading to institutional clients, SC has not only met a growing market demand but has also sent a powerful message: digital assets are here to stay, and they are increasingly becoming an integral part of global finance. This groundbreaking step will undoubtedly accelerate institutional crypto adoption , paving the way for more traditional financial institutions to embrace the transformative potential of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The future of finance is increasingly digital, and Standard Chartered is leading the charge.

2025-07-15T13:11:23,"Darknet Marketplace Abacus Market Suspected of $12M Exit Scam","Abacus Market, one of the largest darknet marketplaces, has suddenly stopped working. According to analysts at TRM Labs, after users complained about payment delays, the site's administrators ceased communicating with them. In 2024, Abacus accounted for 70% of Western darknet platforms accepting Bitcoin. TRM specialists suggested that, amid increased attention from law enforcement agencies, operators may have conducted an exit scam—disappearing with users' funds. Data from TRM Labs indicate that Abacus was among the top three bitcoin-enabled darknet marketplaces by transaction volume. A surge of activity on Abacus occurred in mid-June, coinciding with Europol's operation against Archetyp Market, one of the oldest darknet marketplaces. Many users migrated to Abacus, and the site’s monthly sales volume dramatically jumped to $6.3 million. By the end of the month, platform clients began reporting problems with withdrawals. The site administrator, known as Vito, explained that these difficulties were due to DDoS attacks. However, users remained unconvinced: daily deposits on the platform dropped from $230,000 to $13,000 within two weeks. Shortly after, Vito stopped communicating entirely. TRM Labs analysts observed that this pattern aligns with typical exit scams, similar to how Evolution Market and other darknet sites previously disappeared. Abacus primarily sold illegal substances and supported both Bitcoin and Monero for transactions. Over four years, the platform’s Bitcoin transaction volume exceeded $100 million. Including Monero, experts estimated the figure could reach $300–400 million. Other Possible Explanations Exit scam is not the only possible explanation, according to TRM Labs. Analysts also suggested that law enforcement may be conducting a covert operation to gather evidence. However, the site's administrator, known as Dread and reportedly in contact with the Abacus team, expressed doubts that authorities were involved in the shutdown. Analysts further proposed that administrators may have voluntarily left the market, fearing increased scrutiny from regulators.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9948/darknet-marketplace-abacus-market-suspected-of-12-m-exit-scam,"MARKET|BTC|REGULATION|XMR","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T13:10:59,"Bitcoin Surge: The Blockchain Group’s Bold $6.54M Capital Increase for Strategic BTC Reserves","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Surge: The Blockchain Group’s Bold $6.54M Capital Increase for Strategic BTC Reserves In a significant move that underscores the growing institutional confidence in digital assets, French blockchain firm The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) has announced an ambitious plan to raise approximately €6 million ($6.54 million). This substantial capital increase is earmarked specifically for bolstering its strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserves, signaling a robust commitment to the cryptocurrency space. What’s Driving The Blockchain Group’s Strategic Move? The decision by The Blockchain Group to pursue a capital increase for the sole purpose of acquiring more Bitcoin is a testament to the evolving corporate treasury strategies in the digital age. As detailed in their official press release, the proceeds from this fundraising initiative are explicitly designated for BTC acquisitions . This isn’t their first foray into holding significant Bitcoin; as of July 14, the company already boasts an impressive holding of 1,933 BTC, positioning them as a notable player in the corporate crypto landscape. This strategic pivot highlights several key aspects: Diversification: Companies are increasingly looking at Bitcoin as an alternative asset class to diversify their balance sheets beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional investments. Inflation Hedge: In an economic climate often characterized by inflation concerns, Bitcoin is perceived by many as a store of value, similar to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power over time. Future-Proofing: For a blockchain firm, holding significant crypto reserves , especially Bitcoin, aligns perfectly with their core business and demonstrates a long-term belief in the digital economy. It positions them at the forefront of financial innovation. Why Are Companies Bolstering Their Bitcoin Reserves? The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets gained significant momentum in recent years, with pioneers like MicroStrategy leading the charge. But why are more companies, including The Blockchain Group, opting to accumulate BTC? The rationale often revolves around a blend of financial prudence and strategic foresight. Consider the following: Reason for BTC Acquisition Potential Benefit Associated Challenge Inflation Hedge Protects against devaluation of fiat currency. High price volatility in the short term. Strategic Investment Potential for significant capital appreciation. Market downturns can impact balance sheet. Industry Alignment Reinforces credibility for blockchain/tech firms. Regulatory uncertainty in some jurisdictions. Diversification Reduces reliance on traditional assets. Liquidity concerns for very large holdings. For a company like The Blockchain Group, whose business is inherently tied to the blockchain ecosystem, having substantial Bitcoin holdings can also serve as a strategic asset for future operational needs, partnerships, or even as collateral for innovative financial products. What Does This Capital Increase Mean for the Market? The news of The Blockchain Group ‘s significant capital increase for Bitcoin purchases sends a positive signal to the broader cryptocurrency market. Each instance of a publicly traded company allocating substantial funds to BTC reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption and legitimizes Bitcoin as a serious asset class. This move contributes to: Increased Demand: Direct buying pressure on Bitcoin, potentially influencing its price. Enhanced Credibility: Further validates Bitcoin’s role in corporate finance, potentially encouraging other companies to follow suit. Market Maturity: Shows a growing sophistication in how traditional businesses integrate digital assets into their financial strategies. It’s not just about the money; it’s about the message. When a firm like ALTBG, which specializes in blockchain technology, publicly commits to such an extensive BTC acquisition , it speaks volumes about their confidence in the future trajectory of digital currencies and decentralized finance. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts For individuals and institutions observing these developments, The Blockchain Group’s move offers several insights: Monitor Institutional Trends: Keep an eye on public companies’ treasury strategies. Their actions can often precede broader market shifts. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just look at the ‘what’ (Bitcoin purchase), but delve into the ‘why’ (strategic rationale, inflation hedge, long-term vision). Risk vs. Reward: While corporate adoption is bullish, remember that Bitcoin’s volatility remains a factor. Companies undertake extensive due diligence for such large crypto reserves . This event underscores that Bitcoin is no longer just a fringe asset but is increasingly becoming a core component of forward-thinking corporate financial planning. The commitment to such a large capital increase specifically for Bitcoin demonstrates a strong conviction in its long-term value proposition. A Bold Step Towards a Decentralized Future The Blockchain Group’s decision to raise $6.54 million for strategic Bitcoin purchases is a powerful indicator of institutional confidence in the digital asset space. By bolstering its crypto reserves , ALTBG is not only making a significant financial bet but also aligning its treasury strategy with its core business in blockchain technology. This move highlights Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a strategic asset for corporations looking to diversify, hedge against inflation, and embrace the future of finance. As more companies follow suit, the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized economy will continue to blur, paving the way for broader adoption and innovation.

Inflation in the U.S. picked up pace in June, sending a ripple through global markets and crypto alike. According to the latest CPI data, consumer prices rose 0.3% month-over-month, up from 0.1% in May, and exactly in line with forecasts. On a year-over-year basis, inflation hit 2.7%, the highest level since February. While the numbers didn’t exceed expectations, they confirmed what many feared: inflation isn’t cooling as quickly as hoped. The Core CPI , which excludes food and energy, rose 0.2% MoM and came in at 2.9% YoY, again meeting estimates but keeping pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to stay cautious. Bitcoin Reacts Fast, Drops From Recent Highs Bitcoin took a hit soon. The world’s largest crypto fell nearly 6%, sliding from a recent peak of $123,300 to around $116,227. Investors quickly adjusted their expectations around the Fed’s next move. Just last week, the odds of a rate cut in September were over 80%. Now, they’ve dropped to 60%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. The sudden shift spooked risk markets. Crypto, being one of the most rate-sensitive assets, responded immediately. “BTC has undergone short-term liquidation following a series of breakouts,” analysts at Bitunix said. “Key support to watch: $117,000–$116,300. If this zone holds, a rebound may occur. If support breaks, the next key level lies at $110,500.” Politics Add to the Uncertainty Beyond the data, there’s growing talk about a possible shake-up at the Fed. President Donald Trump is reportedly unhappy with Fed Chair Jerome Powell, having called him “horrible” as well, and some analysts now see his removal as a real risk. Deutsche Bank’s George Saravelos warned that such a move could trigger a 3-4% drop in the dollar and a spike in U.S. Treasury yields. That would only add more volatility to an already tense market. What This Means for Crypto Inflation matters for crypto and not just because of rate cuts. Higher inflation keeps interest rates higher for longer. That usually means money flows back into safer, yield-bearing assets like bonds, and out of high-risk bets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. So while June’s numbers haven’t shocked the system yet, it’s a clear reminder that the path ahead won’t be smooth. With less chance of near-term easing and political noise rising, the crypto market could stay on edge in the weeks to come.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/june-cpi-report-released-inflation-at-2-7-bitcoin-price-reacts/,"BTC|MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T13:00:56,"Massive Bitcoin Transfer: $235 Million BTC Moves to Galaxy Digital, Signifying Crucial Institutional Shift","BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Transfer: $235 Million BTC Moves to Galaxy Digital, Signifying Crucial Institutional Shift The cryptocurrency world is always abuzz with activity, but few events capture attention quite like the movement of colossal sums of digital assets. Recently, a significant Bitcoin transfer has sent ripples across the market, highlighting the ever-evolving landscape of institutional involvement in crypto. This particular transaction, involving 2,000 BTC, has sparked considerable discussion among analysts and enthusiasts alike, underscoring the growing maturity of the digital asset space. It’s a vivid reminder that while Bitcoin started as a grassroots movement, it is increasingly becoming a playground for major financial players. What Exactly Happened with This Massive Bitcoin Transfer? The news broke through Whale Alert , a widely recognized blockchain tracking service that meticulously monitors large cryptocurrency movements across various networks. Their report indicated a substantial Bitcoin transfer of 2,000 BTC from an unidentified wallet to Galaxy Digital . At the time of the transaction, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $235 million, making it one of the most significant single movements of Bitcoin in recent memory. Such a large-scale shift of capital within the Bitcoin ecosystem immediately raises questions about its implications for market dynamics and the broader institutional landscape. Understanding the context of this transfer is crucial. Large transactions, often referred to as ‘whale movements,’ are keenly observed by market participants because they can sometimes signal strategic moves by major holders or institutions. Unlike smaller retail transactions, these gargantuan transfers possess the potential to influence market sentiment, liquidity, and even price action. The fact that the recipient was a known institutional entity like Galaxy Digital adds an extra layer of intrigue and importance to this particular event, differentiating it from routine exchange movements or individual rebalances. Who is Galaxy Digital and Why Are They Key to Institutional Crypto? For those navigating the complex world of digital assets, understanding the role of entities like Galaxy Digital is paramount. Founded by Mike Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager and a vocal proponent of cryptocurrencies, Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company exclusively dedicated to the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They operate at the cutting edge of the institutional crypto movement, providing a comprehensive suite of services that bridge the gap between traditional finance and the nascent digital asset economy. Their involvement in a transaction of this magnitude is not coincidental; it underscores their critical position as a trusted intermediary for large-scale digital asset operations. Galaxy Digital’s offerings are designed to cater specifically to institutional clients, who demand a higher level of security, compliance, and professional service than retail investors. Their robust infrastructure and regulatory adherence make them a preferred partner for traditional financial firms looking to gain exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Galaxy Digital’s comprehensive services include: Trading: Providing institutional-grade liquidity and execution services for a wide range of digital assets, allowing large players to buy and sell without significant market disruption. Asset Management: Managing various funds and investment products focused on cryptocurrencies, offering diversified exposure to the digital asset class. Investment Banking: Offering advisory services for mergers, acquisitions, and capital raises within the burgeoning blockchain and crypto industry. Mining: Engaging in proprietary Bitcoin mining operations, adding another layer of expertise and revenue stream to their portfolio. Principal Investments: Investing their own capital into promising blockchain companies, startups, and protocols, fostering innovation within the ecosystem. The reception of such a significant Bitcoin transfer by Galaxy Digital further solidifies the narrative that major financial players are not merely dabbling in crypto but are actively integrating it into their core business models, paving the way for broader institutional crypto adoption across the globe. The Enigma of the Crypto Whale: Who Holds Such Power? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ conjures images of powerful, anonymous entities capable of moving markets with a single transaction. In the cryptocurrency world, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or organization holding a substantial amount of a particular digital asset, often enough to influence its market price. When Whale Alert reports a 2,000 BTC transfer, the immediate question that arises is: who is behind the ‘unknown wallet’ that initiated this colossal move? The anonymity inherent in blockchain transactions, while a core tenet of decentralization, also fuels speculation about the identity and intentions of these large players. Several possibilities could explain the origin of this significant Bitcoin transfer : Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: Many large institutional transactions bypass public exchanges to minimize price impact. OTC desks facilitate these private deals, allowing institutions to buy or sell vast amounts of crypto without causing significant market fluctuations. The ‘unknown wallet’ could be an OTC desk moving funds to a client’s custodian, or vice-versa. Exchange Rebalancing or Cold Storage: While less likely given the destination, large exchanges frequently move funds between their hot (online, accessible) and cold (offline, secure) wallets for security and operational efficiency. However, the direct transfer to Galaxy Digital suggests an external transaction rather than an internal one. Another Major Institution or Corporate Treasury: A hedge fund, family office, pension fund, or even a large corporation could be making a strategic allocation into Bitcoin, utilizing Galaxy Digital’s institutional-grade services for custody or investment management. This signals a growing trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. A Long-Term Holder (HODLer) or Early Adopter: An individual who accumulated a large amount of Bitcoin in its early days might be moving a portion of their holdings to a regulated entity for secure custody, estate planning, or to facilitate a large private sale. Regardless of the precise identity, the fact that such a substantial crypto whale chose Galaxy Digital as the recipient speaks volumes about the growing trust, infrastructure, and demand for institutional-grade solutions in the digital asset space. It highlights the shift from purely speculative trading to more strategic, long-term investments by sophisticated players. How Does Whale Alert Keep Us Informed About Bitcoin Transfers? In a market that can often feel opaque and fast-moving, services like Whale Alert provide invaluable transparency. By continuously scanning and analyzing transactions across various blockchain networks, Whale Alert acts as a vigilant watchdog, notifying the crypto community about significant cryptocurrency movements in real-time. Their prompt reports, like the recent 2,000 BTC transfer, are crucial for traders, analysts, and enthusiasts seeking to understand the flow of capital and potential market impacts. The technology behind Whale Alert involves sophisticated algorithms that monitor specific thresholds for transaction sizes. When a transfer exceeds these predefined limits, the system flags it and disseminates the information through various channels, including Twitter and their website. This real-time data is more than just a novelty; it serves several critical functions for market participants: Market Sentiment Gauging: Large inflows to exchanges might suggest an intent to sell, potentially indicating bearish sentiment, while significant outflows from exchanges could signal accumulation and bullish sentiment. Identifying Institutional Activity: Transfers to known institutional wallets, such as those belonging to Galaxy Digital , provide clear indicators of growing professional engagement and adoption within the crypto space. Pre-empting Volatility: While not a direct predictor, large transfers can sometimes precede or coincide with significant price movements, allowing traders to adjust their strategies. Enhancing Transparency: In a decentralized ecosystem, tools like Whale Alert help democratize information, making large, potentially market-moving transactions visible to everyone, not just a select few. The prompt reporting by Whale Alert ensures that the crypto community is immediately aware of these potentially market-moving Bitcoin transfer events, fostering a more informed and reactive environment. It underscores the importance of data-driven insights in navigating the volatile yet opportunity-rich cryptocurrency markets. The Crucial Implications for the Institutional Crypto Market This particular Bitcoin transfer to Galaxy Digital is far more than an isolated event; it is a potent indicator of the ongoing maturation and legitimization of the institutional crypto market. As more traditional financial entities seek exposure to digital assets, the demand for secure, compliant, and robust infrastructure grows exponentially. Companies like Galaxy Digital are precisely what bridge the gap between the nascent, often chaotic, crypto world and the established, regulated financial system. Their ability to handle transactions of this scale with professionalism and security is paramount to fostering broader adoption. The implications of such a significant move are multifaceted and far-reaching: Increased Liquidity and Market Depth: Large transfers contribute to deeper liquidity pools, making it easier for institutions to enter and exit positions without causing undue market impact or slippage. This increased depth makes the market more resilient and attractive to even larger players. Enhanced Trust and Credibility: The involvement of reputable and regulated entities like Galaxy Digital in substantial transactions builds confidence among traditional investors, who are often wary of the perceived risks and unregulated nature of cryptocurrencies. It signals that the market is becoming more professionalized. Push for Regulatory Clarity: As more institutional players engage, there is a stronger collective push for clearer regulatory frameworks. This benefits the entire ecosystem by reducing uncertainty and providing a more stable environment for innovation and investment. Broader Adoption and Mainstream Integration: Each major institutional move, particularly a significant Bitcoin transfer to a well-known entity, paves the way for others. It creates a snowball effect of adoption across various financial sectors, from hedge funds and family offices to corporate treasuries and pension funds. Validation of Bitcoin as an Asset Class: When a substantial crypto whale moves such a large sum into an institutional custodian, it serves as a powerful validation of Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a legitimate and investable asset class, worthy of significant capital allocation. This transaction serves as a powerful testament to the fact that Bitcoin transfer activities are increasingly driven by strategic institutional maneuvers rather than purely speculative retail trading, signaling a significant shift in the market’s underlying dynamics. Challenges and Considerations in the Institutional Crypto Landscape While the growth of institutional crypto is overwhelmingly positive for the market’s long-term health, it is not without its challenges and considerations. The sheer size of these transactions means they can still influence market sentiment, even if the underlying intent is benign. The cryptocurrency market, despite its growing maturity, remains susceptible to rapid shifts based on perceived institutional moves or unexpected liquidity events. One key challenge lies in the inherent volatility of digital assets. Even with the backing of large institutions, Bitcoin’s price can experience significant swings, which can be a double-edged sword for institutional investors who operate under strict risk management protocols. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape, while improving, remains fragmented globally, posing compliance challenges for firms operating across different jurisdictions. Another consideration is the potential for information asymmetry. While Whale Alert provides transparency on the transaction itself, the ultimate purpose or strategy behind an ‘unknown wallet’ initiating such a large Bitcoin transfer to Galaxy Digital often remains speculative. This can lead to market participants reacting to incomplete information, potentially causing undue FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Actionable Insights for Navigating Large Bitcoin Transfers For individual investors, monitoring large Bitcoin transfer events reported by Whale Alert can offer valuable insights, but it’s crucial to interpret them carefully and avoid knee-jerk reactions. A single large transaction, while noteworthy, rarely dictates the entire market’s direction. Instead, look for patterns of sustained institutional interest and adoption, which provide a more reliable indicator of long-term trends. This particular move to Galaxy Digital could signal continued bullish sentiment among large players, but it’s part of a much larger narrative of mainstream adoption. Consider these actionable insights when encountering news of significant crypto movements: Stay Informed, But Verify: Follow reliable sources like Whale Alert for real-time data, but always cross-reference information and seek analysis from reputable experts. Avoid making hasty decisions based solely on a single transaction report. Analyze Context and Counterparties: Don’t just react to a headline. Understand who the parties involved are (e.g., Galaxy Digital ) and what their typical operations entail. Is the transfer to an exchange, a custodian, or an OTC desk? The destination often reveals more about the intent. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Institutional involvement, especially a significant Bitcoin transfer to a major player like Galaxy Digital , often points to a long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. This can be reassuring for long-term holders and investors looking beyond daily price fluctuations. Practice Prudent Risk Management: Regardless of large institutional moves, the crypto market remains volatile. Never invest more than you can afford to lose, and always maintain a diversified portfolio. Don’t let FOMO from a crypto whale transaction dictate your investment strategy. Focus on Fundamental Growth: While transfers are exciting, also pay attention to fundamental developments in the institutional crypto space, such as new regulatory frameworks, technological advancements, and the expansion of crypto financial products. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Bitcoin’s Institutional Future The recent 2,000 BTC transfer to Galaxy Digital , meticulously reported by Whale Alert , serves as a powerful testament to the accelerating integration of digital assets into the mainstream financial system. This significant Bitcoin transfer underscores the growing influence of the crypto whale and the undeniable momentum behind institutional crypto adoption. It highlights the increasing sophistication of the market and the growing trust placed in specialized financial entities like Galaxy Digital to handle vast sums of digital wealth securely and compliantly. As the market continues to mature, we can expect to witness more such large-scale movements, each contributing to Bitcoin’s journey towards becoming a globally recognized, adopted, and deeply integrated asset class. The bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world is not just being built; it’s actively being crossed by major players, signaling a profound and exciting shift in the global financial landscape. These transactions are not just about numbers; they are about the validation of a revolutionary technology and its inevitable place in our economic future.

2025-07-15T13:00:13,"Prison sentences and industry exodus fears: Hungary’s new rules threatens crypto traders","New regulations, tougher than the EU’s latest, are putting cryptocurrency traders in Hungary at risk of prison time while threatening to trigger an exodus of crypto companies from the country. Budapest’s highly restrictive rules come as Brussels is trying to implement unified regulatory standards across the bloc, something that other member states view as an opportunity to attract crypto business. Hungary to punish unauthorized crypto trading with prison Hungary’s updated Criminal Code threatens half a million Hungarians invested in cryptocurrencies with strong penalties, including prison sentences, global and local media noted, sounding the alarm about what’s taking place in the Central European nation. The amendments, which went into force earlier this month, introduce two new criminal offenses, namely “abuse of crypto assets” and “providing unauthorized crypto asset exchange services,” Forbes pointed out in an article published Monday. Under the legislation, private individuals using such services face up to two years in prison for smaller trades while “particularly high value” transactions, those exceeding 50 million Hungarian forints (over $145,000), can result in three-year sentences. Illegal trading of 500 million forints or more may be punished with up to five years behind bars. At the same time, service providers working without the required authorization will be subject to even harsher penalties, with sentences for large-scale operations potentially reaching eight years, the report detailed. According to analysts quoted by the Hungarian news outlet Telex, some 500,000 Hungarians have bought crypto assets using legitimate and taxed income. However, the new law’s language, which allows for broad interpretation, as well as the lack of guidelines for its implementation, leave the door open for prosecution of previously legal activities. Commenting on the gray area created by the recent changes in the Hungarian Criminal Code, an industry source, who chose to remain anonymous, summarized: “The problem is that this is legislation where nobody can comply when it takes effect.” The new provisions took effect on July 1. Hungary’s Financial Supervisory Authority, which has 60 days to develop a compliance framework, is yet to produce the guidelines for their implementation. Hungarian crackdown expected to spark exodus as Revolut suspends services The current uncertainty threatens to trigger the departure of companies in the fintech and crypto space, with members of the industry already warning that several Hungarian firms are considering transferring their operations to friendlier jurisdictions in Europe, such as the Baltic states. A source elaborated: “The startup ecosystem depends on foreign exits being readily available. These moves amount to a startup exodus that could devastate the sector.” Meanwhile, the UK-based neobank Revolut, quite popular among Europeans, announced before the weekend that it will temporarily halt crypto services in Hungary “with immediate effect until further notice.” The suspension affects all new cryptocurrency purchases, staking and deposits. “The legislation appears to be part of a broader regulatory crackdown by the Hungarian government, which has also implemented restrictions on foreign corporate acquisitions and other business activities,” Forbes commented, highlighting criticism that the rules target voters who do not support Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and may lead to capital flight. The magazine also noted that the enforcement of Hungary’s stricter measures coincides with that of the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. It remarked that Budapest’s approach diverges from Brussels’ goal to harmonize crypto rules in the EU. Another industry analyst told the publication: “It’s incomprehensible why Hungary would implement such restrictive rules just as the EU is establishing unified standards.” While Hungary’s stringent regulations are unlikely to affect the operations of global platforms such as Binance or Coinbase, who continue to serve the Hungarian market, they are creating unfavorable conditions for local crypto firms, preventing them from working legally. Similar concerns have been repeatedly expressed in Poland, arguably the largest crypto market in Central and Eastern Europe. Recently renewed efforts to transpose MiCA into national law sparked reactions from members of the country’s crypto industry who blamed Polish politicians for proposals that go beyond what the EU requires, threatening the survival of domestic crypto businesses.

2025-07-15T13:00:03,"Analyst Predicts Number of Days Left for XRP Bull Cycle","A well-followed analyst on X, known simply as Papa, has drawn fresh attention to XRP’s price history by identifying a repeating pattern in its past bull markets. According to his analysis, each of XRP’s major bull cycles has lasted approximately 274–275 days, and if history holds, the current cycle, which began in late 2024, could end in just 47 days, around late August 2025. Historical Bull Cycles: A Consistent Pattern? Papa’s theory is grounded in two previous XRP bull cycles: 2017 and 2021. In the 2017 cycle, XRP began its climb in March, trading below $0.01. By January 4, 2018, it had reached an all-time high of $3.84, marking one of the most explosive rallies in crypto history. This rally, from breakout to peak, spanned approximately 275 days, validating Papa’s timeline. The 2021 cycle followed a similar arc. After bottoming out in 2020, XRP began a fresh rally in July 2020, eventually peaking at $1.84 by mid-April 2021. Despite external headwinds, including the SEC lawsuit , Papa calculates that this cycle also lasted around 274 days, reinforcing the idea of a consistent XRP market rhythm. $XRP bull cycle only last about 274 days 2017 lasted 275 days 2021 lasted 274 days 2024+ 274 days end of august. XRP and the entire bull cycle may come to conclusion within 47 days pic.twitter.com/hZGKI4n60S — papa (@mamagucci) July 15, 2025 The Current Cycle: 47 Days and Counting? According to Papa, the current bull cycle began in late 2024, particularly following XRP’s breakout in November 2024, which was confirmed by a surge past long-standing technical resistance levels. XRP reclaimed the $3 mark by early 2025, echoing the breakout patterns seen in 2017 and 2021. If this cycle follows the same historical timeline of 274 days, it suggests that the end of this bullish phase could arrive by late August 2025. That leaves traders and investors with roughly 47 days before a potential trend reversal, peak, or transition into consolidation. XRP’s Current Position As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.90, just under the year’s high of $3.40 reached earlier in 2025. While the token has shown resilience and strong technical structure, it now sits in a critical window. Whether this is the final leg of the bull run or merely a pause before another surge remains to be seen. But Papa’s timing model adds a new layer of urgency. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What This Means for Traders and Investors For traders, this 47-day window is a crucial countdown. If Papa’s cycle theory holds, the coming weeks could present the last opportunities for profit-taking or strategic exits before a larger cooldown. Momentum indicators, volume shifts, and resistance levels near the $3.50 mark should be watched closely for signs of exhaustion or breakout continuation. Investors, particularly long-term holders, may also want to pay attention, not to panic sell , but to evaluate whether portfolio rebalancing is due. If the cycle peaks soon, price retracements could follow. Historically, XRP has experienced sharp corrections after cycle tops. However, strong fundamentals such as Ripple’s continued institutional expansion and XRPL development still offer longer-term upside beyond temporary price declines. Ultimately, Papa’s projection doesn’t predict doom; it signals a critical inflection point. Whether this becomes the top or merely a milestone in a longer supercycle depends on broader market dynamics, including Bitcoin’s trajectory, regulatory developments, and institutional adoption. Papa’s analysis of XRP’s 274-day bull cycles adds an intriguing lens through which to view current market conditions. With the 2024–2025 cycle nearing the end of its historical duration, the next 47 days could prove decisive. For those watching closely, this may be the final chapter in this cycle, or the beginning of a new phase altogether.

Here Are the Details","Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company in the US, is increasing its investments in institutional-grade Bitcoin yield strategies. Marathon Digital Deepens Bitcoin Yield Strategy with $20 Million Investment in Two Prime The company formalized the partnership by investing $20 million in SEC-registered investment advisor Two Prime. This investment also increases MARA's Bitcoin allocation to Two Prime from 500 BTC to 2,000 BTC. Susquehanna Crypto also participated in the round. With the new funding, MARA becomes not only a capital investor but also an equity owner in Two Prime's returns platform, specifically designed for corporate treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, and large Bitcoin holders. Two Prime CEO Alexander Blume commented on the strategic significance of the investment as follows: “Digital assets are now becoming an integral part of corporate and sovereign balance sheets. MARA's investment demonstrates a shift towards active, yield-focused Bitcoin strategies aligned with institutional standards. This alignment is driven by a long-term vision, risk management, and innovation.” MARA CFO Salman Khan evaluated the investment decision within the scope of the company's new treasury policy: “This investment builds on our existing collaboration, where we have a strong alignment on risk, transparency, and capital allocation. Our goal is to actively invest our Bitcoin holdings, rather than passively holding them solely for value appreciation.” Last month, the company announced that it mined 950 BTC in May 2025. This was MARA's highest monthly production in a year and brought its total reserves to 49,179 BTC. This gives MARA the second-largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded companies, behind Strategy. MARA's market capitalization currently stands at $6.2 billion, and its share price is trading around $19, up 25% in the last month. Meanwhile, Two Prime, with $1.75 billion in assets under management, is the largest decentralized finance (CeFi) lender in the US, according to Galaxy Research. This investment marks a significant milestone in the company's growth phase. *This is not investment advice.

With lawmakers advancing multiple digital asset-related bills during what’s being informally dubbed “Crypto Week”, analysts are raising short-term price targets, with projections now pointing toward $137,000. U.S. Lawmakers Fuel Bullish Sentiment The U.S. House of Representatives is actively debating a slate of crypto-related legislation aimed at clarifying the legal status of digital tokens, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Key bills under review include: Clarity for Digital Tokens Act, distinguishing securities from commodities; Genius Act, a regulatory framework for stablecoins; Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, restricting the Federal Reserve’s ability to issue retail digital dollars. The prospect of regulatory clarity is fueling renewed institutional interest and boosting sentiment across digital asset markets. Institutional Demand Resurfaces Companies including MicroStrategy, which now holds over 600,000 BTC, are once again increasing crypto exposure. Asset manager Grayscale has also filed for a U.S. IPO, underscoring mounting demand for compliant investment vehicles. The legislative momentum is seen as a catalyst for further corporate adoption. Technical Picture Aligns with Macro Backdrop Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 16.72% over six months, 10.69% over the past month, and 7.84% in the last week, trading between $111,134 and $122,428. The immediate resistance stands at $126,231, roughly 3% above the current range. A break above this threshold could trigger a move toward $137,525, representing a further 9% upside. On the downside, support levels are identified at $103,644 and $92,350. Key indicators: 10-day and 100-day SMAs: Hovering near $118,000, signaling price stability. RSI at 28.04 and Stochastic at 19.83: Indicate oversold conditions. MACD at -691.09: Suggests a potential bullish reversal.

This latest purchase brings SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings to roughly 280,706 ETH. The company’s aggressive buying activity signals a growing trend among corporations diversifying into digital assets beyond Bitcoin. The Ethereum acquisition reflects SharpLink’s long-term commitment to blockchain infrastructure, staking rewards, and decentralized finance applications. Nearly Entire Holdings Staked for Yield According to data shared by SharpLink, approximately 99.7% of its ETH holdings are currently either staked or restaked, contributing to onchain security while earning passive yield. Since June 2, SharpLink has earned approximately 415 ETH through staking activities. The company has not disclosed specific staking providers or restaking platforms used, though the scale of participation suggests involvement with major Ethereum infrastructure layers, possibly including liquid staking protocols. The yield strategy appears to be core to SharpLink’s treasury allocation, positioning Ethereum not just as a reserve asset, but as an income-generating component of its digital strategy. ETH Concentration Trends Upward Ethereum concentration among institutional players and corporate entities has been rising steadily. Since June 13, ETH concentration by top holders has increased by approximately 23%, a figure influenced in part by SharpLink’s large-scale acquisitions. With the Ethereum price hovering near $2,850 during the accumulation period, SharpLink’s entry adds weight to a broader narrative of institutional confidence in ETH as a long-term asset. While Bitcoin has historically dominated corporate balance sheets, Ethereum’s versatility—ranging from smart contracts and DeFi to tokenization—continues to attract strategic capital allocations. SharpLink trades under the ticker $SBET and has not yet commented on how this ETH position aligns with its broader corporate roadmap. However, the move is already drawing attention from analysts who view the purchase as maturing institutional interest in Ethereum’s infrastructure and yield potential. SharpLink Launches Ethereum Treasury Strategy SharpLink embarked on its Ethereum treasury strategy in late May. The move coincided with a $425 million private placement led by Consensys, the crypto infrastructure firm founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who also took on the role of SharpLink’s chairman. Beyond building its treasury, SharpLink has expressed its commitment to supporting Ethereum’s long-term strength and decentralization.

The NYSE Arca exchange posted its letter of approval for the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF. The approval is seen as an immediate green light for the ETF trading. The new fund will be launched in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The ProShares XRP ETF is considered approved and active after its prospectus filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. | Source: SEC The US Securities and Exchange Commission listed the fund as “Approved” from July 14 onward. The NYSE Arca has already set up a trading page with the UXRP ticker. The fund’s prospectus has also been filed with the SEC in preparation for imminent launch. The ProShares Ultra XRP ETF is expected to start trading on July 18. Based on the prospectus, the current ETF will not invest in XRP directly, thus not providing demand similar to the older BTC and ETH funds. The ProShares Ultra product will seek performance based on the Bloomberg XRP index, tracking the price without buying the underlying asset. The fund aims to reach 2X the performance of XRP within the span of a day, though not guaranteeing the performance. The 2X metric does not apply to longer time periods. The new leveraged ETF is seen as a more liquid option, suitable for institutions and large-scale investors. XRP breaks out following Proshares Ultra ETF news Following the news of the ETF approval, XRP rallied to $2.92, breaking out of its recent range. XRP has been anticipating the news of an ETF, but the actual announcement served as a trigger for the market price. XRP was bound in a range close to $2.80, while BTC set its new series of records. This time, XRP broke out again, setting expectations for recovering above $3. The asset was already showing liveliness following the launch of the leveraged 2x XXRP ETF. The XXRP ETF accrued assets of over $165M under management in the initial days of trading. The market is now anticipating a spot ETF, which could further boost the mainstream adoption of XRP. The asset has yet to recover its previous all-time high and enter price discovery. XRP notoriously skipped one bull cycle, hovering near its price minimum due to the protracted lawsuit against the SEC. XRP awaits multiple ETF launches XRP awaits multiple launches for funds in various stages of approval. In the past few months, XRP has been considered as one of the most probable assets for an ETF, alongside Solana (SOL). In July, multiple deadlines for XRP funds will draw attention to the asset. The Rex-Osprey XRP ETF is expecting approval on July 25, while the Turtle Capital ETF expects a statement as early as July 16. A series of approvals could bring XRP price to a higher range, especially after demand for spot funds comes in. At one point, XRP had over 19 active ETF applications, including a recent filing from Trump’s Truth Social.

2025-07-15T12:45:10,"Bank of America Sees S&P 500 Showing Bullish Signals, But Warns a Modest Pullback Could Be Near – Here’s When","Bank of America (BofA) is unveiling its outlook for the S&P 500 for the rest of the year as the stock market surges to new record highs. In a new CNBC interview, Paul Ciana – BofA’s head of fixed income, currency, commodity, and equity technical research – says he expects the S&P 500 to rally in the coming weeks after breaking out from a bullish reversal pattern. “Yes, the S&P 500 is getting a little bit overbought, and we’re seeing signs of tactical weakness. But that’s okay. We’re also seeing plenty of signs for a bullish trend. We think back to May, when we initiated our bullish outlook for this summer. We had that very nice [inverse] head and shoulders bottom in the daily chart of the S&P 500. That, like the technical textbooks would say, measures up to about 6,625. So we’ve been looking for a rally into the 6,500 this summer, maybe with a little upside risk to that.” Source: CNBC/YouTube While Ciana is bullish on the S&P 500, he warns that its ascent will not happen in a straight line. The BofA executive predicts that the stock market index will witness a correction once it hits his target level based on a technical analysis rule. “In technicals, we like to say that the rule of alternation occurs with corrections, and there are a lot of parallels between 2025 markets and macro with 2018. In 2018, we had that shallow correction in the first half, big rally to all-time highs and a deep correction at year-end. So I think the rule of alternation suggests we get this rally to new all-time highs, we have a mean reversion toward year-end. So maybe if we get up to 6,500, 6,600 toward year-end, maybe we come back down toward 6,200.” Ciana clarifies that the S&P 500 succumbed to a deep pullback earlier this year, and that a modest correction could occur in the coming months – an inverse scenario of what happened in 2018. As of Monday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,268.

2025-07-15T12:44:11,"MARA Holdings Invests $20M for Minority Stake in Two Prime, Increases BTC Allocation to 2,000","MARA Holdings, a leading Bitcoin mining company, has taken a minority stake in Two Prime, an institutional investment adviser managing $1.75 billion in assets. Key Takeaways: MARA Holdings acquired a minority stake in Two Prime, boosting its Bitcoin allocation to 2,000 BTC. The additional Bitcoin will be held in a Separately Managed Account to generate yield. MARA and other miners face profitability challenges post-halving, prompting pivot toward AI data centers. The acquisition includes a $20 million equity investment and significantly boosts MARA’s Bitcoin allocation managed by Two Prime, increasing it from 500 BTC to 2,000 BTC, according to a recent press release . The additional Bitcoin will be held in a Separately Managed Account (SMA) and used to generate yield for MARA. MARA Expands Bitcoin Treasury via Stock Sales MARA, known for one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries globally, initially built through its self-mining efforts, has been expanding its Bitcoin holdings through stock sales, a strategy reminiscent of Michael Saylor’s approach with Strategy. Salman Khan, MARA’s CFO, explained that the move reflects the company’s goal to activate its Bitcoin balance, aiming to use BTC as more than just a passive asset linked to price gains. Two Prime, registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specializes in helping institutional and professional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin. “As bitcoin becomes an integral part of corporate and sovereign balance sheets, institutions are reevaluating how to deploy it strategically,” said Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime. “MARA’s investment signals a broader shift toward active, yield-focused bitcoin strategies that meet institutional standards. This is a long-term alignment around vision, risk management, and innovation.” @MARA Leads $20 Million Investment in Two Prime to Advance Institutional Bitcoin Yield Strategies and Expands SMA to 2,000 BTC Read more below https://t.co/2sf99yc8HV — Two Prime (@Two_Prime) July 15, 2025 MARA, like many miners, is navigating a tough post-halving market. The recent Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, squeezing mining revenues while energy and equipment costs continue to rise. Despite a 30% revenue increase to $214 million in Q1, MARA reported a net loss of $533 million, highlighting the strain on mining profitability. To adapt, several mining firms, including Core Scientific and HIVE Digital, have shifted toward AI data center hosting and repurposing infrastructure for high-performance computing. Core Scientific’s future in Bitcoin mining remains uncertain following its $9 billion acquisition by CoreWeave , which plans to potentially repurpose or divest crypto operations. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

2025-07-15T12:39:55,"Standard Chartered Launches Trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum","Standard Chartered Bank has enabled institutional clients to trade Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to a press release . The largest British financial conglomerate has become the first among systemically important organizations to launch regulated spot cryptocurrency trading with physical delivery. Standard Chartered's corporate clients, investment funds, and asset managers can trade XBT/USD and ETH/USD pairs via the standard FX interface at the bank’s UK division. ”Demand for regulated digital asset solutions is growing, and we are ready to offer clients the tools they need,” said Standard Chartered Chief Executive Bill Winters. For settlement, both third-party vaults and Standard Chartered's own custodial service, Zodia Custody—which launched in 2020—are available. The bank also plans to add settlement of non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts soon. There is a notable divergence in asset preferences between institutional and retail investors. According to The Block, Wintermute experts have observed that large players are ramping up their investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum: these two highly capitalized cryptocurrencies now make up approximately 70% of institutional portfolios, whereas for retail investors, the figure has fallen to 37%. ”This is not a temporary trend, but a sign of market maturity. Institutions view cryptoassets as macro assets, while retail continues to look for high-yielding but risky opportunities,” said Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy. Newer meme coins such as BONK, WIF, and POPCAT are especially popular among retail investors, while more established coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE remain leaders of the GMCI MEME index. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission currently has several applications pending for spot Dogecoin ETFs. Wintermute analysts believe that a positive decision from the regulator could further boost retail demand for meme coins.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9947/standard-chartered-launches-trading-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum,"BTC|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T12:34:28,"Standard Chartered Launches Institutional Crypto Spot Trading in the UK","Standard Chartered has launched a new trading service enabling institutional and corporate clients to trade Bitcoin and Ether directly through its UK branch, marking another step in the bank’s steady integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. The multinational bank announced on Tuesday that it is rolling out spot trading for major cryptocurrencies, with plans to expand the service to include crypto non-deliverable forwards (NDFs), a type of derivatives contract, in the near future. This launch positions Standard Chartered among the few global banks providing direct crypto trading access within its regulated frameworks for institutional investors. “Digital assets are a foundational element of the evolution in financial services. They’re integral to enabling new pathways for innovation, greater inclusion, and growth across the industry,” said Bill Winters, Standard Chartered group chief executive, in the statement shared with Cointelegraph. Integrated Custody and Flexible Storage Options Standard Chartered’s crypto spot trading service is fully integrated with its existing platforms, allowing clients to trade crypto assets via the bank’s familiar foreign exchange interfaces. This seamless integration is designed to lower operational friction for institutions seeking crypto exposure while ensuring compliance with existing regulations. The service also provides clients with flexibility in crypto custody options. Investors can select their preferred third-party custodian or utilize Standard Chartered’s proprietary custody solutions for storing their crypto assets securely. Last year, the bank expanded its regulated custody offering for Bitcoin and Ether in the United Arab Emirates, demonstrating its commitment to building a comprehensive crypto infrastructure for institutional clients. Standard Chartered Bullish Bitcoin, Cautious on Ethereum Standard Chartered’s crypto service rollout aligns with its bullish outlook on Bitcoin. The bank projects that Bitcoin will reach $135,000 by the end of Q3 2025, driven by strong ETF inflows and rising corporate treasury demand. Furthermore, it anticipates Bitcoin could climb to $200,000 by the end of 202 5, and even reach $500,000 before the end of 2028 as institutional adoption accelerates and macro diversification continues. However, the bank has taken a more cautious stance on Ethereum, recently reducing its end‑2025 ETH price forecast from $10,000 to $4,000 due to structural pressures, including the migration of activity to Layer-2 networks impacting Ethereum’s fee capture. Despite this adjustment, Standard Chartered maintains a positive long-term view on Ethereum, projecting prices could recover to around $7,500 by 2028–2029.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, Robinhood’s U.S. staking launch continues to push olana. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $159.03 with an intraday drop of 4.67%. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

2025-07-15T12:33:03,"U.S. June CPI Rose an In Line 0.3%; Core Rate Slightly Better Than Hoped at 0.2%","Inflation in the U.S. perked up in June but was mostly in line with expectations, perhaps helping to set the stage for another Federal Reserve rate cut as soon as September. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% last month versus economist forecasts of 0.3% and just 0.1% in May. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 2.7% against 2.7% expected and 2.4% in May. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, climbed 0.2 % in June versus 0.3% expected and 0.1% in May. Core CPI year-over-year was higher by 2.9% compared to 3.0% anticipated and 2.8% in May. In the midst of a steep decline from record highs of nearly $124,000 just a bit over 24 hours ago, the price of bitcoin (BTC) gained a bit back to $117,300 just following the release of the data. A check of traditional markets finds U.S. stock indices futures adding a bit to gains, with the S&P 500 higher by 0.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield has dipped two basis points to 4.41%. The new data comes as investors watch for signs of whether inflation is easing enough for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates later this year. Though at least two Fed members have agitated for a rate cut as soon as the central bank's late July meeting, there's doesn't seem to be wide support from either Fed Chair Jerome Powell or the rest of the central bank policymakers. That's led to the Fed's subsequent meeting — in September — as the leading candidate for the possible resumption of rate cuts. Prior to this morning's inflation data, the odds of a September move were just shy of 62%, according to CME FedWatch .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/us-june-inflation-rose-an-in-line-03-core-rate-slightly-better-than-hoped-at-02,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Inflation|CPI|News",cryptocompare

While the price recently broke a record by exceeding $123,000, it fell to $117,000 due to increased profit-taking. While it was stated that this correction was normal and the rise would continue, critical inflation data that the FED attaches importance to in its interest rate decision was announced today. Here is the data disclosed: Consumer Price Index Annual: Announced 2.7% – Expected 2.6% – Previous 2.4% Consumer Price Index Monthly: Announced 0.3% – Expected 0.3% – Previous 0.1% Core Consumer Price Index Annual: Announced 2.9% – Expected 3.0% – Previous 2.8% Core Consumer Price Index Monthly: Announced 0.2%–Expected 0.3%–Previous 0.1% The consumer price index (CPI) is a key variable used to measure consumer purchasing trends and changes in US inflation. According to The Kobeissi Letter, US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has increased for the first two months since January 2025.

2025-07-15T12:30:06,"TD Cowen Projects Bitcoin At $155K By Year-End, Raises Strategy’s Price Target","Global investment bank TD Cowen has recently revised its price target for Strategy’s (previously MicroStrategy) stock, MSTR, raising it from $590 to $680 per share and a bullish prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which could soar to $155,000 by December. Possible 53% Drop For Bitcoin The firm’s study outlines a base-case scenario for Bitcoin at $128,000 by year-end, with a more pessimistic outlook placing it as low as $55,000, which could mean a major 53% crash from current prices. TD Cowen analysts assert that a significant increase in Bitcoin prices is expected to positively impact Strategy’s share price, given its status as the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst On July 14, Strategy purchased an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, averaging $111,827 per coin. This latest acquisition brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 601,550 BTC. Analysts at TD Cowen noted that what began as a defensive measure to preserve the value of its assets has evolved into a proactive strategy aimed at enhancing shareholder value. Strategy plans to continue acquiring Bitcoin through proceeds from upcoming debt and equity offerings. The firm anticipates that Strategy will raise around $84 billion through its innovative “42/42” plan, which involves an equal mix of debt and equity, potentially increasing its Bitcoin reserves to 900,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Strategy As Strong Investment Option TD Cowen has initiated buy ratings on Strategy’s preferred shares, emphasizing their attractive income potential and price appreciation, which are expected to be less volatile than common shares or Bitcoin itself. This endorsement comes after the firm first recognized Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy in 2023, describing it as a “paradigm shift.” At that time, they highlighted the company’s approach of utilizing cash from its software business to invest in Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against dollar inflation. Analysts believe that Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it a more reliable store of value compared to traditional currencies or gold, presenting Strategy as an appealing option for investors looking to gain Bitcoin exposure. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions—Is Real-World Use Finally Here? As institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies accelerates, Strategy’s acquisition strategy has become a blueprint for other corporate treasuries. The company’s total investment in Bitcoin now stands at $29.27 billion, yielding substantial unrealized gains with a cost basis of $71,268 per BTC. The latest report and Strategy’s recent purchase coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high, surpassing $123,000, underscoring the growing acceptance and adoption of BTC in the financial landscape. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency has retraced to $117,000 in an attempt to find its next support level before moving on to uncharted territory once again if buying demand persists among investors.

2025-07-15T12:22:04,"BTC Gains Near Climax? Peter Brandt Sounds the Alarm","TL;DR Peter Brandt says BTC isn’t failing yet, but gains may slow without major macroeconomic change. BTC’s long-term chart shows strength, but Brandt warns of capital strain for future breakouts. Peter Brandt Pushes Back on Bitcoin Collapse Talk Peter Brandt has addressed growing speculation about a potential breakdown in Bitcoin’s long-term trend. In a post shared on July 13, the seasoned trader said that while BTC appears to be nearing a key stage, it does not show signs of a structural failure. It the entire price history of Bitcoin was a fruit, what fruit would you say it was? pic.twitter.com/FPEU1bUvnf — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 13, 2025 His chart, based on a parabolic regression model that covers Bitcoin’s full history, raised questions from followers. One user suggested that another major breakout would require capital inflows in the tens of trillions—something they viewed as unlikely. Brandt responded : “Short of a complete re-ordering of the global reserve currency structure, I believe we will soon reach a climax in this advance.” Price Arc Still Holding, But Gains May Slow Brandt’s take signals that Bitcoin may be approaching the upper bounds of its long-term price path. While there may still be room for growth, he indicated that further moves higher will likely demand more capital and may hinge on broader shifts in global markets. Rather than warning of an incoming crash, his comment suggests Bitcoin is moving into a slower phase of its cycle. The trend is intact, but the pace and ease of gains could change. Rising Costs, Slower Returns Some investors argue that Bitcoin is becoming harder to accumulate at scale. As institutional buyers and treasuries commit larger sums, they are receiving less BTC in return. This rising cost has led some to doubt whether sharp price moves are still realistic. Brandt’s view doesn’t rule that out. He points out that without large macroeconomic changes, the next breakout could be tougher to sustain. In May, Peter Brandt also sparked debate with a poll on X, asking followers which token they would invest $100,000 in—XRP or SOL. While some highlighted Solana’s recent chart strength, Brandt noted that he considers more than just price movement. The post BTC Gains Near Climax?
