2025-07-15T14:59:10,"Donald Trump Launches Official Process for Fed Chair! US Treasury Secretary Calls for ""Extension"" to Powell!","As is well known, US President Donald Trump has been calling on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates and resign for some time. Powell stated that interest rate cuts should wait a little longer, while Trump stated that the time has come for interest rate cuts and that delaying them would harm the US economy. As interest and resignation tensions continued between the two, Trump began to look for another candidate to replace Powell. At this point, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the process of selecting Fed Chair Powell's successor has begun. Speaking to Bloomberg's Surveillance program, Scott Bessent said the official process has begun to identify Powell as a potential replacement for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The Treasury Secretary stated that the process will proceed at President Trump's pace. “The official process has begun. There are many great candidates and we will see how quickly the process moves.” Bessent also noted that uncertainty surrounding Powell's tenure could have a negative impact on markets and warned that Powell's continued presence beyond his term could create confusion in the markets. “Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down from his or her position on the board. If he or she acts as a shadow Fed chair, it could create confusion. It would be very misleading for the market,” Bessent said. Powell's term as chairman expires in 2026, but her board membership continues until January 2028. This means she can continue to influence decision-making even after her chairmanship ends. However, Powell has consistently avoided any questions about her continued board membership. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Donald Trump Launches Official Process for Fed Chair!

2025-07-15T14:41:38,"Best Presales to Invest In as New Buyers Stockpile Bitcoin at All Costs, Outpacing Supply","Demand for Bitcoin ($BTC) has once again overtaken the monthly issuance rate of the cryptocurrency, according to a report. While institutional investors and ETFs have driven much of the demand, a huge chunk also came from smaller investors and high-net-worth individuals. This growing acceptance of digital currencies among mainstream buyers is a huge plus for other crypto presales, like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) . Investors Quickly Snapping Up Bitcoin at Any Price A report by digital asset trading platform Bitfinex revealed that smaller investors are buying up $BTC at a rate of 19.3K $BTC per month, while only 13.4K new $BTC are issued during the same period. Bitfinex also cited data from Jan3 that Bitcoin ETFs bought 22.3x more $BTC than was mined on July 9, while demand outpaced the supply created by 19.53x the following day. According to the platform, this level of $BTC accumulation shows that the market is so bullish that new buyers are willing to buy the world’s most valuable crypto at a faster rate and at any price. Bitcoin’s spectacular rise over the past several weeks means that it has overtaken silver and Amazon in terms of market capitalization. It is now ranked #5, only next to Apple’s market cap of $3.1B. With Bitcoin Dominating, What Presales are Worth the Shot? While $BTC seems a good buy at any price for now, another good news is that there are still plenty of cryptocurrencies that are up for grabs at super low prices. Here are some of the best presales worth considering: 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Delivering Speed, Low Fees, and Flexibility to Bitcoin Bitcoin may be the world’s top crypto, but it has its flaws. Its transactions are slow and expensive, and it only offers limited programmability. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) addresses these limitations with its Bitcoin Layer 2. Once launched, the L2 will deliver Solana-level speeds and smart contracts to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Plus, it features a decentralized and non-custodial Canonical Bridge. This allows you to transfer your $BTC securely and easily between Layers 1 and 2. This project has a native token called $HYPER. Holding this will let you pay for transaction and smart contract fees, access exclusive features, and enjoy governance rights. Alternatively, you can lock in your $HYPER to the staking pool and get passive rewards. At the moment, you can buy tokens for only $0.012275 each via the Bitcoin Hyper presale page . For step-by-step instructions, you can check out our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide . 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Getting Ahead of Bots and Whales Made Easy The more crypto demand ramps up, the more difficult it gets to find the next big project. That’s because the market is rife with scams, while bots and whales often beat small investors to the punch. Snorter Token ($SNORT) wants to level the playing field with Snorter Bot. It’s a Telegram-native crypto bot that lets you find the most promising presales before anyone else with its automated sniping capability. Aside from that, it lets you manage your portfolio, copy trades, swap crypto, and even detect malicious tokens before you buy them. Getting its $SNORT tokens through its official presale website will allow you to make the most out of Snorter Bot via low transaction fees, unlimited snipes, and governance rights. Staking is available with a reward rate of 205%. But if you want to HODL, then it can be a great strategy too, as $SNORT could reach as much as $3.25, according to our Snorter Token price prediction . 3. Neo Pepe Protocol ($NEOP) – Bringing Back Decentralization to Cryptocurrencies Decentralization has been one of the most attractive characteristics of cryptocurrencies in the market’s early days. But increased adoption by institutional buyers and governments means that decentralization is quickly fading into the background. Neo Pepe Protocol ($NEOP) is a presale that wants to fight against centralized control. At its core is its community governance. As a $NEOP token holder, you’ll have direct influence over strategic decisions, such as exchange listings and important project developments. Costing only $0.083153, it’s a great investment while supporting a worthy cause. There’s No Stopping the Bitcoin Train The way it currently stands, it seems that Bitcoin has nowhere to go but up. Of course, a few downtrends are expected along the way, but the market overall seems bullish about its long-term value. This is why it’s also essential to always be on the lookout for the best presales before they blow up and go mainstream, such as Snorter Token ($SNORT) and Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . These projects offer a lot of potential upside as their underlying concepts are solid and strong communities to back them up. If you’re planning on buying crypto, be sure to do your research first.

The comprehensive analysis of June 2025 revealed that BTC had entered historically low volatility territories driven by significant spot ETF inflows. BTC’s implied volatility is dropping to just 28%, with realized volatility hitting levels not seen in nearly 20 months. Institutional investment, the report noted, is fundamentally reshaping BTC’s price behavior and creating a more stable trading environment, departing from its historical pattern through spot ETFs. The report covers trading data in June and is released as BTC momentarily touched a new all-time-high of $120K overnight. Key Insights: BTC Market Matures as Volatility Drops: BTC’s implied volatility has reached a remarkable milestone, reaching the lowest level since October 2023 and well below the significant 30% threshold. This dramatic decline continues a downward trend that began in 2020, reflecting growing asset maturity as BTC gains mainstream acceptance. The report shows that both implied and realized volatility have dropped simultaneously, with realized volatility hitting 22-25% at 20-month lows, creating exceptional calm that persists even amid broader macroeconomic turbulence. The “ETF Effect” Stabilized BTC Prices : The analysis reveals a clear correlation between the January 2024 launch of US spot BTC ETFs and the subsequent volatility decline, with ETF flows appearing to stabilize BTC’s price movements and create more frequent small, positive daily returns as institutional buyers help soften sell-offs and anchor demand. The data shows that 2025 has demonstrated a notable shift toward smaller, more positive daily price movements, indicating that institutional ETF buyers are providing consistent support during market downturns and creating a more stable price floor. This stabilization mechanism has resulted in fewer and milder volatility spikes compared to BTC’s pre-ETF era, fundamentally altering the cryptocurrency’s risk profile. ETH Volatility Remains High Despite ETF Launch : While BTC experiences historic stability, ETH has not followed the same pattern despite its own spot ETF launch in July 2024, with the ETH/BTC realized volatility ratio steadily climbing since July 2024 and ranging from 1.68 to 2.34 in June, indicating ETH continues to trade with significantly higher volatility than BTC. The divergence extends beyond ETH, with Solana showing even more pronounced volatility spikes – the SOL/BTC ratio hit 2.96 in June 2025, matching January’s high and representing levels not seen since January 2024. The report attributes this divergence to the relative strength of institutional demand, with BTC spot ETFs consistently representing a far larger share of total trading volume than ETH ETFs – before the 2024 US election, BTC ETF inflows were 36 times greater than ETH relative to their respective trade volumes. #Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BybitReport About Bybit Bybit is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

2025-07-15T14:35:13,"GameStop bought Bitcoin to guard against inflation, not to copy MicroStrategy","GameStop boss Ryan Cohen said Tuesday on CNBC’s Squawk Box that the company’s recent crypto play is strictly about protecting itself from inflation, not trying to copy other firms. “I look at it as a hedge against inflation and global money printing, and we’ll see what happens,” Ryan said. The statement came days after GameStop bought 4,710 bitcoins, worth over $500 million, during a market rally that saw Bitcoin cross $120,000 for the first time. According to CNBC, Ryan was direct about not following the model of MicroStrategy, now called Strategy, which over the past few years spent billions loading up on Bitcoin to become the biggest corporate holder of it. Strategy’s decision sent its stock flying but also brought big volatility. Ryan said that GameStop isn’t interested in chasing the same outcome. “We have our own unique strategy, and we have a very strong balance sheet, over $9 billion of cash and marketable securities,” he told the network. Ryan Cohen says crypto buy isn’t about hype Ryan said the company will treat capital deployment the same way he treats his own money. “We will deploy that capital responsibly as I would my own capital,” he said. “And only look for opportunities where the downside is limited and there’s a lot of upside. We’ll be opportunistic when we see those opportunities.” The Bitcoin buy, according to him, is based on macroeconomic risks. He pointed to the fact that Bitcoin’s limited supply and decentralized structure make it useful as a store of value when fiat currencies keep getting devalued. He also made clear that this isn’t some new path into full-on crypto speculation. It’s part of a larger plan to keep GameStop stable as it fights through rough retail headwinds. Ryan took over during the meme-stock craze of 2020 and 2021 after buying a large stake and joining the board. He made his name building Chewy, the pet food company, and retail investors saw him as the guy who could bring GameStop into the e-commerce world. Over the past year, he’s been cutting costs, changing operations, and pulling GameStop away from its old hardware/software focus. The company is now leaning more into trading cards and collectibles, with Ryan confirming on Thursday at the company’s annual meeting that this is the new direction. “It’s a natural extension,” he said, noting that cards are embedded in physical retail and have “high margin potential.” Wall Street isn’t buying it, and revenue numbers back that up On Tuesday, the company posted weak results. Revenue in the first quarter fell 17% year over year to $732.4 million. The stock dropped 5% the next day. That dip came after the Bitcoin news and suggests that investors still aren’t convinced by the crypto angle, or by GameStop’s path forward in general. Shares are down 24% in 2025, after rising 79% last year. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter isn’t impressed. He stuck with his underperform rating, saying the company has always depended on hype and retail FOMO. He criticized the Bitcoin move, pointing out that GameStop is already trading at 2.4 times cash, and he doesn’t see how throwing more money into crypto will boost the premium. “Greater fools” is the phrase he used, accusing the company of depending on people who overpay for shares. Despite all that, Ryan isn’t shifting gears. He said trading cards are gaining fast and that GameStop’s collectibles revenue grew 54% year over year in Q1. That jump was mainly powered by Pokémon cards, which he sees as a core part of the business going forward. It’s not just kids either. Circana data shows 19% of adults bought Pokémon cards for themselves in the last six months. These aren’t just being used for play either; many are collecting them or decorating with them. Circana also said that grown-ups spent the most money on toys in Q1 compared to every other age group. GameStop is betting that trading cards and collectibles are where the real profits are now, not game consoles or physical disks. That movement is already underway, whether Wall Street wants to believe it or not.

2025-07-15T14:30:53,"Unraveling The Bitcoin Boom: Experts Decode Record $123,000 Surge","In a major display of bullish momentum, the market’s leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), surged to a new record high on Monday, surpassing $123,000 for the first time. US House Kicks Off ‘Crypto Week The Bitcoin price climbed more than 90% year-to-date with Monday’s rally, reaching $123,200, and reflecting a nearly 15% increase over the past month. This upward momentum coincides with the US House of Representatives’ “crypto week,” which will feature debates on legislation aimed at reducing regulatory hurdles that have long been viewed as obstacles for the cryptocurrency sector. Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23—Is It Too Far-Fetched? One of the key pieces of legislation set for discussion in the House is the GENIUS Act, which aims to establish regulatory frameworks for stablecoins. Proponents of the GENIUS Act argue that it is a groundbreaking initiative that formalizes a critical aspect of the cryptocurrency industry. They believe it will enhance consumer protections, facilitate the entry of traditional financial institutions, and contribute to the growth of the digital currency market. Conversely, critics assert that the bill represents a “weak set of regulations” that may not adequately safeguard consumers or prevent illicit trading activities involving stablecoins. Growing Support For Crypto Regulation In addition to the GENIUS Act, the House will also debate measures to clarify the federal government’s regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies and proposals that could prevent the Federal Reserve from issuing its own digital currency. Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research at Morningstar, remarked that this legislative push reflects a series of favorable developments for the crypto industry since President Donald Trump’s election in November. Since then, Bitcoin’s price has surged nearly 80%. As “crypto week” unfolds, Armour suggests it signals a continuation of supportive policies under the Trump administration. However, Trump’s involvement in the cryptocurrency space has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest. For instance, his backing of World Liberty Financial’s stablecoin, USD1, has led to significant investments in major exchanges like Binance, which critics say creates opportunities for Trump’s business to profit. Despite these concerns, Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and a White House spokesperson has stated that his financial assets are managed in a trust to avoid conflicts. Bitcoin ETFs Propel Price Surge The recent surge in Bitcoin prices has also been fueled by the US approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) last year. These investment vehicles have proven to be successful, with record-breaking amounts of capital moving into them. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst The overall asset value of Bitcoin ETFs has reached a record high of over $158 billion, driven by a wave of investments that included over a billion dollars flowing into these funds on consecutive days last week. Nikhil Bhatia, a finance professor at the University of Southern California, noted that the approval of Bitcoin ETFs has contributed significantly to institutional adoption of Bitcoin, signaling a return to a bullish market sentiment. As of this writing, BTC’s price has retraced back to the $117,000 level, 4.3% below its recently achieved all-time high.

The initiative represents a significant move toward enabling global asset trading, ranging from equities to futures, to be priced, traded, and settled entirely in Bitcoin. Scheduled for launch in September 2025, Roxom is currently accepting early access registrations via a waitlist. Its flagship offering, Bitcoin Treasuries, will provide users with a unified platform to access publicly traded companies that hold substantial Bitcoin reserves. This includes entities such as MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, and Nakamoto. Currently listed across various fiat-based exchanges, these assets will now be consolidated into a single, borderless venue, fully denominated in Bitcoin. Roxom aims to streamline access, simplify valuation in BTC terms, and align with the original vision outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper, as a global, permissionless store of value. “The launch of our Bitcoin Treasuries Product is about architecting a Bitcoin-native financial future,” said Borja Martel Seward, Cofounder and CEO of Roxom. “By providing the critical infrastructure that gives investors exposure to BTC treasury stocks without tradfi barriers – such as the need to convert Bitcoin and navigate brokerages – we’re building on the legacy of Bitcoin pioneers like Mircea Popescu (MPEX) and Erik Voorhees (Satoshi Dice). The era of Bitcoin-native businesses and capital formation starts now.” A growing number of corporations, such as Metaplanet, The Smarter Web Company, Nakamoto, Semler Scientific, XXI Cap, and ProCapBTC (founded by Anthony Pompliano), have adopted Bitcoin as a key component of their treasury strategies, following the lead of Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy. While investors are expected to be the primary users of Roxom’s BTC-denominated market, other stakeholders, including miners, pension funds, and Bitcoin-native businesses, may also benefit from expanded use cases and enhanced utility of Bitcoin as a financial base layer. The announcement follows Roxom’s recent $17.9 million funding round, backed by Draper Associates, Borderless Capital, Ego Death Capital, and Kingsway Capital. The investment signals increasing institutional support for Bitcoin-focused financial infrastructure. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-15T14:30:16,"Top 4 Meme Coins to Watch in 2025: Bitcoin Hyper, FloppyPepe, Snorter Bot, LilPepe","Meme Coins 2025: Still Just Hype, or Ready to 100x? The meme coin market continues to evolve in 2025. What began with Dogecoin and Shiba Inu has transformed into a vibrant, utility-driven meme-fi movement. Traders are now backing projects with real use cases, community strength, and tokenomics designed to incentivize long-term holding. If you’re looking for tokens with moonshot potential, these four names deserve your attention. Meme-Fi, a combination of meme culture and decentralized finance, has introduced a new class of tokens that go beyond jokes. These tokens now offer staking, NFT utilities, AI tools, and gamified ecosystems to keep investors engaged and value flowing. As traditional altcoins lose some speculative steam, meme coins are once again capturing headlines—and capital. Bitcoin Hyper: Bringing Energy to the OG Brand Bitcoin Hyper takes the iconic BTC brand and injects meme culture, speed, and community vibes. Built on Solana, the token delivers lightning-fast transaction times and ultra-low fees. It also rides on Bitcoin nostalgia, but reimagines it for the meme-fi generation. Network: Solana Current Price: ~$0.01225 Incentive: NFT airdrops + staking boosts Notable Feature: Combines BTC lore with DeFi speed Its community is one of the most rapidly growing among Solana-based meme projects, and several NFT collaborations are underway. With recurring staking rewards and occasional governance events, Bitcoin Hyper blends nostalgia and tech innovation. FloppyPepe (FPPE): More Than Just a Meme FloppyPepe is one of the breakout meme-fi tokens of the year. While it sports meme aesthetics, its core appeal lies in its tools: FloppyAI for trading signals, Meme-o-matic for meme creation, and FloppyX, a decentralized exchange launching later this year. Network: Ethereum Current Price: ~$0.00000035 (Presale) Incentive: 100% bonus with FLOPPY100 code Notable Feature: Meme-Fi tools + AI integration FloppyPepe also has a growing base on X and Telegram, with over $2.4 million raised in its presale. Analysts see this project as one of the few meme coins combining real DeFi tools with organic community buzz, and its Ethereum foundation provides interoperability with major platforms. Snorter Bot: Wild Branding, Real Utility Snorter Bot has risen from meme chaos to utility-driven innovation.

2025-07-15T14:30:16,"$12,950,000,000,000 Crypto Market Cap Incoming As Massive Euphoria Phase Unfolds, Predicts Economist Henrik Zeberg – Here’s His Outlook","An economist known for calling a blow-off top for the markets predicts that the total crypto market cap will skyrocket over 250% from current levels. Henrik Zeberg tells his 186,700 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on the TOTAL chart, which tracks the total market cap of crypto, excluding stablecoins. The economist predicts that TOTAL will soar to $12.95 trillion in a wave five rally, supported by rising momentum as indicated by the relative strength index (RSI) and the relative vigor index (RVGI). His chart also notes that the moving average convergence divergence indicator (MACD) is on the up and up, suggesting that the asset class is amid a strong uptrend. Both the RSI and the RVGI are momentum indicators, while the MACD is a trend-following oscillator. Zeberg says that the rally will be fueled by a massive euphoria phase as witnessed in 2017 and 2021. “12 Trillion USD Crypto Market? Just imagine….” Source: Henrik Zeberg/X At time of writing, TOTAL is trading at $3.681 trillion. Looking at Bitcoin, Zeberg says that BTC is in the midst of a wave three surge, a period when an asset witnesses a steep rally based on the Elliott Wave theory. The Elliott Wave theory is an advanced technical analysis approach that attempts to predict future price action by following crowd psychology that tends to manifest in waves. “BTC pumped, and we are now very clearly in a wave three setup. This is what I think we may see. A pump which continues much higher for the coming weeks. Then likely a STRONG PULLBACK into late-summer. Finally, the last pump into the autumn.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $119,476. Zeberg also believes that altcoins will ignite rallies in the coming weeks as Ethereum ( ETH ) flashes signs of life. “ETH making the expected move. Soon it will be leading the alts rally. This is what we want to see in Altseason. I expect much higher for ETH – BEFORE the onset of the Summer Doldrum for Alts. A lot of money can and will be made over the coming weeks. BUT ….. YES – there will very likely be a strong pullback into late Summer.” At time of writing, ETH is trading for $2,984.

2025-07-15T14:27:27,"Crypto Week: A Historic Pivot in U.S. Digital Asset Legislation","The Legislative Trifecta GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Establishes the first federal regulatory framework for payment stablecoins. Requires stablecoins to be fully backed by U.S. dollars or cash equivalents and enforces transparency through audits. Permits private companies to issue stablecoins, opening possibilities for major corporations to create digital currencies usable in everyday transactions. Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (Clarity Act) Provides clear criteria on whether digital assets are classified as securities or commodities. Limits regulatory overreach, assigning definitional authority to Congress. Creates transparent rules for exchanges, brokers, and asset disclosures to protect investors and foster innovation. Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act Prevents the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). Addresses concerns about potential government financial surveillance. Reinforces the preference for private-sector, dollar-backed stablecoins over a government-issued digital dollar. Market Impact and Industry Reaction Bitcoin surged to a record high above $120,000 amid market momentum and optimism for regulatory clarity. Stablecoins are anticipated to see greater adoption as both payment vehicles and programmable money for e-commerce, remittances, and financial services. The new legal clarity may attract capital from previously hesitant investors, encourage mainstream adoption, and strengthen the U.S. leadership in digital finance. Global Implications By acting decisively on digital asset regulation, the United States positions itself as a global leader in crypto innovation. The comprehensive nature of these bills sets a new benchmark for privacy, clarity, and innovation worldwide, reversing years of regulatory uncertainty and potential capital outflows. Timeline and Next Steps The House plans to vote on the Clarity Act, followed by the GENIUS Act and the Anti-CBDC Act throughout the week. If passed, the bills will proceed to the Senate and, upon approval, to the President’s desk, with some senators aiming for completion by September 30. The bills’ enactment would represent the most significant set of crypto regulations ever passed by a congressional chamber, signifying a generational shift in digital markets. Conclusion Crypto Week marks a pivotal turning point for digital assets in the United States and possibly the world. These long-awaited legislative reforms promise to unlock new opportunities, strengthen consumer protections, and reinforce America’s role as a leader in digital innovation. As the reforms advance, the global crypto community eagerly watches for signs of a new era in market growth, innovation, and financial inclusion.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-week-a-historic-pivot-in-u-s-digital-asset-legislation,"REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|BTC","",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T14:23:40,"Why Did Bitcoin’s Price Crash by $6K Daily and Where Is BTC Heading Next?","The largest digital asset by market cap experienced a historic price surge since last Wednesday as it skyrocketed by over $15,000 within less than a week. On its way up, it broke all barriers and previous all-time high and set a new record at just over $123,000. It briefly became the fifth-biggest global asset by surpassing silver, Alphabet (Google), and Amazon, before it settled at sixth position following a somewhat expected price correction. Why Was That Correction? Nothing really goes up in a straight line. All price pumps are accompanied by corrections, and this is particularly true for the ever-volatile cryptocurrency market. During the aforementioned rally , BTC was in a “up only” mode for days, and this correction seemed overdue, according to some experts. When an asset jumps by roughly 10% in such a relatively short period, certain investors might want to secure some profits, especially when they have been waiting for it to break out of consolidation for months. Data from some of the largest cryptocurrency analytics platforms confirms this narrative. CryptoQuant repoted that large investors had realized profits of more than $1.5 billion within a day or so. Glassnode went even further, indicating that all investors have booked profits of somewhere up to $3.5 billion. Data from Arkham shows that even the government of Bhutan started to sell off some of its BTC holdings. Glassnode also said the ratio between Long-Term Holders (LTH) and Short-Term Holders (STH) has signaled a trend reversal, which suggests early signs of profit taking. Sharp drop in the $BTC LTH/STH Supply Ratio and a flip in 30D % change from accumulation to distribution suggest early signs of profit-taking. After months of steady LTH inflows and rising price, this could mark a turning point. Key metric to watch for trend reversal. pic.twitter.com/eLj8DL3X1C — glassnode (@glassnode) July 15, 2025 Before the correction started to materialize, CryptoPotato outlined four potential factors that could lead to such a retracement. What we didn’t mention at the time was the looming US CPI data, which went live today and was slightly higher than expected – a development typically regarded as bearish for riskier assets like crypto. Where to Next? As usual, the community is split when it comes to predicting where the cryptocurrency market (and especially its leader) is heading next. Some are envisioning price pumps to $200,000, claiming that the bullish trend remains intact, while others warned that BTC’s gains have neared their climax. Santiment also weighed in on the matter, noting that BTC’s social media dominance had risen to over 43% of all discussions following its meteoric rise to over $123,000. Such a sudden spike suggests that many traders are “FOMO-ing in,” which could be concerning. Consequently, the analytics resource advised people to “wait for the euphoria to cool down some, and you’ll likely find another key entry point coming up.” As Bitcoin’s market value crept above $123.1K for the first time in its 17+ year history, there was an equally historic social dominance spike. 43.06% of all crypto discussions were about $BTC just as the coin’s market value was peaking.

""Institutions Flocked to Bitcoin and Ethereum, While Indiv...","In a recent report, major market maker Wintermute analyzed investment trends among institutions and individual investors during the bull market in the first half of 2025. Wintermute noted a clear and stark difference between institutional and individual investors. Analysts said that institutional investors are more likely to focus on large-cap assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), while individual investors are more likely to focus on memecoins. According to Wintermute, institutional investors are focusing on BTC and ETH while maintaining their allocations in major cryptocurrencies up to 67% through inflows such as ETFs. In contrast, retail investors are flocking to altcoins and memecoins. Institutions hold major cryptocurrencies in their portfolios at 67%, while retail investors hold only 37%. Emerging memecoins like Bonk (BONK), Dogwifhat (WIF), and Popcat (POPCAT) have attracted significant interest among retail investors. This new trend is beginning to challenge the dominance of traditional memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The report also noted that a potential SEC approval decision on spot Dogecoin ETFs in October could further increase interest from individual investors. Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy said the growing gap between institutional and individual investors is a sign of market maturation. “Investors are no longer following the same trend. While institutions view cryptocurrencies as macro assets, individual investors continue to gravitate towards innovation.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-15T14:10:52,"Trader Highlights Importance of This XRP Breakout Against Bitcoin","Crypto trader and analyst known as Crypto Michael shared a technical analysis on social media, highlighting what he identified as a significant breakout for XRP against Bitcoin. According to his post, XRP has broken out of a falling wedge pattern on the daily chart relative to Bitcoin. He accompanied his analysis with a chart showing the XRP/BTC pair on Binance, plotted on a daily timeframe, where price action can be seen breaking above the upper trendline of a downward-sloping wedge. At the time of his post, the ratio stood at approximately 0.00002393 BTC, with a daily gain of about 2.92 percent. In his brief commentary, Crypto Michael questioned the bearish sentiment still surrounding XRP despite the technical development. He wrote: “XRP just broke out of a falling wedge against Bitcoin on the daily chart, and you’re still bearish? Higher.” His statement suggests he views the breakout as a bullish signal and expects the XRP/BTC ratio to move higher from here. The falling wedge pattern is often interpreted by technical traders as a potential reversal or continuation pattern, depending on the context. XRP just broke out of a falling wedge against Bitcoin on the daily chart, and you’re still bearish? Higher. pic.twitter.com/HAersdSz9h — Crypto Michael (@MichaelXBT) July 12, 2025 Community Reactions Emphasize Key Levels and Volume Other crypto community members also weighed in on the analysis in the comments under Michael’s post. Gevcrypto Official provided additional perspective on potential price levels to watch, writing : “i think….if xrp breaks through $2.90….the price will quickly reach $3….this is a key level…..above it the impulse will start….if it doesn’t break through….a pullback to $2.70 is possible…” This comment highlights the importance of $2.90 level as a resistance point, beyond which a larger upward move could materialize. The mention of a possible pullback to $2.70 reflects a cautious view that acknowledges the risk of a short-term reversal if $2.90 cannot be surpassed. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Another user, Wind Blows Tenderness, pointed out the role of trading volume in confirming the breakout, stating : “If volume picks up this can increase the validity of the breakout.” This reflects a common principle in technical analysis where a breakout accompanied by strong volume is generally considered more reliable than one occurring on light volume. Implications of the Breakout The breakout highlighted by Crypto Michael appears to have strengthened bullish sentiment around XRP, at least in the context of its performance relative to Bitcoin . The chart he shared shows a multi-month wedge formation that started earlier in 2025, culminating in the recent move above the resistance trendline. With the XRP/BTC ratio now moving higher, traders are watching closely to see if momentum can build and whether key price levels on the USD pair, such as $2.90 and $3.00, can also be tested in the near term. The observation regarding trading volume remains important, as confirmation of a breakout typically depends on stronger participation by market participants. Overall, the analysis by Crypto Michael, as well as the supporting commentary from other users, reflects cautious optimism about XRP’s technical outlook in both its Bitcoin and dollar valuations.

2025-07-15T14:03:56,"Ripple’s XRP in the Spotlight — What’s Going On?","TL;DR The XRP Army, which is a part of the cryptocurrency community known for its affiliation and enthusiasm for Ripple’s ecosystem and native token, has gone viral once again on social media platforms. Santiment lists the reasons behind this online presence increase and one of them, expectedly, is related to the price pump that drove the asset to just over $3: “XRP has experienced significant price surges nearing all-time highs, with analysts forecasting potential rallies amid favorable market conditions and regulatory developments. Investors are closely watching XRP’s market behavior and its relationship with Bitcoin, reflecting both optimism and skepticism about its place in crypto portfolios,” – reads the post . Recall that Ripple’s cross-border token was confined in a tight range between $2.2 and $2.3 for weeks before the breakout that began last week. At the time, the token soared past the upper boundary and kept climbing to the first major resistance at $2.6. It fell without much of a fight, and XRP continued its ascent in the following days. The culmination, for now at least, took place yesterday when the token surged to a four-month peak of just over $3. Thus, XRP came around 12-3% away from its all-time high registered in January 2018 and matched in January 2025. This led to enhanced predictions from analysts that XRP is “screaming new all-time highs,” as reported. Nevertheless, the asset retraced slightly in the following hours, alongside the rest of the market, and now sits below that coveted resistance. According to Santiment, though, there are other, more profound reasons behind the growing online discussions about Ripple and its native cryptocurrency: “XRP is trending due to extensive discussions about its role and future in the cryptocurrency market, including Ripple’s launch of RLUSD on the XRPL, debates on its value and long-term potential, and comparisons with other major cryptocurrencies.” The company behind it has notched several big partnerships and acquisitions in the past few years, including the purchase of Hidden Road for over $1.2 billion announced in April 2025. RLUSD has gained traction in terms of market cap as the stablecoin, which is built for enterprise utility instead of retail engagement, recently exceeded $500 million.

Roxom will debut the new exchange in September with a waitlist now open for early access, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Tuesday. The San Francisco-based project said the exchange will ""reflect the Bitcoin white paper's original vision of a global, permissionless store of value."" The bitcoin treasuries exchange will allow BTC-denominated buying and selling of shares in companies with significant bitcoin holdings, such as Strategy (MSTR) and Metaplanet (3350). Following the lead of these two companies, there has been a glut of publicly-listed firms building bitcoin treasuries in recent months. Just last week, three such companies raised a combined $278 million toward the goal of boosting their BTC holdings . Roxom's aim is to provide exposure to bitcoin using BTC treasury companies as a proxy, without the need to convert bitcoin or navigate brokerages. The project raised $17.9 million in funding from Draper Associates, Borderless Capital, ego death and Kingsway Capital earlier this year, with which it began building a bitcoin treasury of its own. Roxom held 84.72 BTC ($9.9 million) as of May and has plans to acquire a further 30, which would take its treasury value to nearly $13.5 million. Alongside its securities exchange, Roxom is also building a 24/7 media network dedicated entirely to bitcoin.

Vanguard's passive funds are required to track these indexes by purchasing the corresponding assets. The investment firm's management has repeatedly expressed its aversion to cryptocurrencies. The company called them ”unsuitable” for long-term investors and refused to add a spot Bitcoin ETF to its platform. ”We don't believe this asset has a place in the portfolio,” said Vanguard's former CEO Tim Buckley. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas called the situation ironic. ”God has a sense of humor. By choosing the path of index funds, Vanguard is obligated to own all stocks—whether it likes them or not,” he explained. Strategy founder Michael Saylor sees the event as ”a powerful signal of growing institutional support for Bitcoin.” In his opinion, it reflects the acceptance of digital gold as a reserve asset by the traditional financial community. Strategy is the largest corporate holder of the first cryptocurrency. At the time of writing, the company owns 601,550 BTC, representing over 2.8% of Bitcoin's total supply and valued at more than $73 billion. The company recently acquired an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, highlighting its ongoing aggressive accumulation strategy. As Bitcoin prices hover near all-time highs, Strategy's total unrealized gains exceed $30 billion, illustrating both the scale and impact of its bold treasury approach.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9949/vanguard-bitcoin-critic-invests-9-b-in-strategy-stocks,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T13:50:15,"Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit Surge: Glassnode Reveals $3.5B Realized Gains","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit Surge: Glassnode Reveals $3.5B Realized Gains The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode: Bitcoin investors have just experienced an astounding period of profit-taking, realizing a staggering $3.5 billion in gains within a mere 24-hour window. This monumental event marks the largest daily Bitcoin profit realization observed so far this year, underscoring a pivotal moment in the current market cycle. But what does this massive inflow of cash mean for the broader market, and who exactly is driving this surge? Understanding Realized Profit: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Investors? Before diving into the specifics, let’s clarify what ‘ realized profit ‘ truly signifies in the world of Bitcoin. Essentially, it refers to the total amount of profit taken by investors when they sell their BTC for a price higher than their acquisition cost. This metric is crucial because it provides a clear picture of actual capital flowing out of the Bitcoin network and into fiat or other assets, rather than just paper gains. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform, meticulously tracks these movements by analyzing transactions directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. Their comprehensive Glassnode data offers invaluable insights into investor behavior, market sentiment, and potential shifts in supply and demand dynamics. When Glassnode reports such a significant figure, it’s a strong indicator of market activity and investor confidence, or perhaps, strategic repositioning. Glassnode Data Unveils Key Insights: Who’s Cashing In? The recent $3.5 billion profit realization isn’t just a big number; it’s a story of different investor cohorts making strategic moves. According to the detailed analysis provided by Glassnode, the profits were not evenly distributed among all market participants. Here’s the breakdown: Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are the seasoned Bitcoin investors who have held their BTC for more than 155 days. They accounted for a substantial $1.96 billion of the total realized profits, representing approximately 56% of the overall sum. Short-Term Holders (STHs): In contrast, STHs are newer entrants or more active traders who have held their Bitcoin for 155 days or less. They contributed $1.54 billion to the realized profits, making up around 44% of the total. The fact that long-term holders are leading this profit-taking spree is particularly noteworthy. It suggests a degree of conviction and strategic decision-making from those who have weathered previous market cycles and held through significant volatility. This trend offers critical insights into the current market structure. The Dominance of Long-Term Holders: A Sign of Strength or Caution? When long-term holders decide to realize profits on such a grand scale, it can be interpreted in multiple ways. On one hand, it indicates that these investors are seeing substantial gains, which validates their long-term conviction in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Their willingness to sell at current prices suggests they believe the market has reached a point where it’s opportune to lock in gains. Historically, significant profit realization by LTHs can precede periods of market consolidation or even minor corrections, as large amounts of supply re-enter circulation. However, it can also be a healthy sign of a mature market where strong hands are distributing assets to new demand, preventing overheating and allowing for sustainable growth. The market’s ability to absorb such a large amount of selling pressure from LTHs without a significant price drop would indicate robust underlying demand. Are Short-Term Holders Following Suit? Analyzing Recent Bitcoin Profit-Taking While long-term holders took the lion’s share, the contribution from short-term holders to the overall Bitcoin profit realization is also significant. STHs are often more reactive to price movements, and their profit-taking can signal a more immediate response to recent price surges. Their behavior can sometimes indicate a ‘top’ in the short-term, as newer investors or traders cash out quickly. However, the fact that LTHs’ realized profits surpassed STHs’ by a notable margin suggests that the market isn’t solely being driven by speculative short-term trading. It implies a more fundamental distribution from long-held supply, which could be absorbed by new demand coming into the market, eager to buy Bitcoin even at higher prices. Navigating the Market: What Does This Glassnode Data Imply for Your Strategy? For investors, understanding this latest Glassnode data is paramount. It provides a clearer picture of who is selling and why, allowing for more informed decision-making. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Demand: The key question now is whether there’s enough new demand to absorb this influx of realized profits without a significant price correction. Strong institutional and retail interest would be crucial. Volatility Expectation: Large profit-taking events can sometimes lead to increased market volatility as supply re-enters the market. Investors should be prepared for potential price swings. On-Chain Metrics are Key: This event highlights the importance of on-chain analytics. Platforms like Glassnode offer unparalleled transparency into market dynamics that traditional financial metrics simply cannot provide. Long-Term vs. Short-Term Perspective: Evaluate your own investment horizon. If you’re a long-term holder, this might be a healthy distribution. If you’re a short-term trader, it might signal a need for caution. The $3.5 billion in realized profits over 24 hours is a testament to Bitcoin’s incredible performance and the substantial gains accumulated by its investors. Led primarily by long-term holders, this event showcases a significant redistribution of wealth within the Bitcoin ecosystem. While such large-scale profit-taking warrants careful observation, it also underscores the maturity of the Bitcoin market and the effectiveness of on-chain analytics in providing a transparent view of investor behavior. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these underlying dynamics will be crucial for navigating the path ahead.

Posting on X, he addressed growing concerns about Bitcoin’s long-term future, offering a grounded take based on decades of trading experience and a solid grasp of macroeconomic trends. His latest comments are changing the conversation. Instead of predicting a crash, Brandt suggests Bitcoin may be nearing the natural end of its current growth cycle. It’s a realistic yet hopeful message, and one that matters for investors, traders, and crypto watchers alike. Is Bitcoin’s Parabolic Growth Still Realistic? The debate started when Brandt shared a parabolic regression chart of Bitcoin’s price history on July 13. The chart tracks BTC’s rise since inception, but not everyone was convinced by what it showed. One user pointed out that for Bitcoin to keep following the same steep upward path, it would need capital inflows in the tens of trillions of dollars, a level that feels unlikely in the current economic environment. They also noted that institutional and corporate buyers are now paying more while getting less, raising doubts about whether Bitcoin can keep breaking out like it used to.

He agreed that Bitcoin could be nearing the peak of its current growth arc unless there’s a major shift in the global reserve currency system. I tend to agree. Short of a complete re-ordering of the global reserve currency structure I believe we will soon reach a climax in this advance — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 14, 2025 This moment marks a rare intersection where technical charts and macroeconomic realities align. And coming from someone as seasoned as Brandt, it carries weight. He isn’t saying Bitcoin will crash. But he is pointing out that the fast, exponential growth we’ve seen over the past decade might be slowing down, at least for now. Not the End But Definitely a New Phase Brandt’s response shifts the narrative. While critics argue that rising inefficiencies and long-term resistance levels suggest a blow-off top, he sees something different. Bitcoin is going forward but gains won’t come easy.

2025-07-15T13:40:11,"Hilbert Group’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Signals Growing Institutional Confidence","BitcoinWorld Hilbert Group’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Signals Growing Institutional Confidence In a significant move that underscores the growing confidence of traditional finance in the digital asset space, Nasdaq-listed Hilbert Group has announced a substantial increase in its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. This development isn’t just another headline; it’s a powerful indicator of how established financial entities are strategically integrating cryptocurrencies into their portfolios. Let’s delve into what this means for the market and the future of institutional engagement with Bitcoin. What Does This Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Mean for Hilbert Group? The news, initially shared by @btcNLNico on X, reveals that Hilbert Group , a prominent digital asset investment firm listed on Nasdaq, has successfully acquired an additional 233 Bitcoin from Deus X Capital, a well-known operator in the crypto and fintech sectors. This latest purchase brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 430 BTC. But why is this particular Bitcoin acquisition so noteworthy? Increased Exposure: By nearly doubling its BTC reserves, Hilbert Group is signaling a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role as a core asset in a diversified portfolio. Strategic Positioning: This isn’t a speculative gamble; it’s a calculated move by a publicly traded company to deepen its commitment to the digital asset class, potentially leveraging Bitcoin’s deflationary characteristics and growth potential. Market Confidence: When a Nasdaq-listed entity makes such a public and substantial move, it sends a powerful message to the broader market, potentially encouraging other institutional players to follow suit. This expansion of their BTC holdings is a clear testament to Hilbert Group’s strategic vision, positioning them as a key player in the evolving landscape where traditional finance meets decentralized innovation. Why Are Institutional Crypto Investments on the Rise? The trend of institutional adoption in the cryptocurrency market is undeniable, and Hilbert Group’s latest move is a prime example. What’s driving this surge in institutional crypto interest? Several factors contribute to this growing appetite among major financial players: Bitcoin as a Store of Value and Inflation Hedge In an economic climate marked by inflation concerns and volatile traditional markets, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a viable store of value, akin to digital gold. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative for institutions seeking to preserve capital and hedge against economic uncertainties. The narrative around Bitcoin’s scarcity continues to resonate with investors looking beyond conventional assets. Maturing Market Infrastructure and Regulatory Clarity The cryptocurrency market has come a long way from its nascent days. We now see more robust infrastructure, including regulated exchanges, secure custody solutions, and clearer regulatory frameworks emerging in various jurisdictions. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year, for instance, significantly lowered the barrier to entry for institutional investors, providing a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for gaining exposure to Bitcoin holdings . Diversification and Growth Potential Institutions are constantly seeking new avenues for diversification and growth. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, offer a unique risk-reward profile that can complement existing portfolios. While volatility remains a factor, the long-term growth trajectory and potential for significant returns make them an appealing asset class for those with a strategic, forward-looking investment horizon. How Does a Digital Asset Firm Navigate the Volatile Crypto Market? Being a dedicated digital asset firm in the cryptocurrency space requires a unique blend of expertise, risk management, and foresight. For companies like Hilbert Group, increasing their Bitcoin reserves isn’t a spur-of-the-moment decision but a result of careful analysis and strategic planning. How do they manage to thrive in such a dynamic environment? Robust Risk Management Frameworks Institutions employ sophisticated risk management strategies to mitigate the inherent volatility of the crypto market. This includes diversification beyond just Bitcoin, setting clear allocation limits, utilizing advanced trading algorithms, and implementing stringent security protocols to protect their digital assets. Deep Market Research and Expertise A successful digital asset firm invests heavily in research and development, maintaining a deep understanding of market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory shifts. This allows them to identify promising opportunities and make informed decisions, such as a strategic Bitcoin acquisition , that align with their long-term objectives. Long-Term Vision Over Short-Term Fluctuations While daily price movements grab headlines, established firms like Hilbert Group typically adopt a long-term investment philosophy. They focus on the fundamental value proposition of assets like Bitcoin and the transformative potential of blockchain technology, rather than reacting to every market swing. This patient approach is crucial for accumulating substantial BTC holdings and realizing significant returns over time. What Does This Signal for the Future of Bitcoin and Institutional Adoption? The actions of firms like Hilbert Group provide valuable insights into the evolving perception of Bitcoin within mainstream finance. Their latest Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a transaction; it’s a harbinger of things to come. So, what might the future hold? Continued Institutional Inflow As more firms like Hilbert Group demonstrate successful integration of digital assets, we can anticipate a ripple effect. The increased transparency and regulatory clarity will likely attract even more pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries to allocate a portion of their portfolios to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Mainstreaming of Digital Assets The distinction between ‘traditional’ and ‘digital’ assets will continue to blur. Cryptocurrencies will increasingly be viewed as a legitimate and essential component of a well-rounded investment strategy, moving beyond niche status to become a staple in institutional portfolios. Impact on Market Liquidity and Stability Greater institutional participation typically brings increased liquidity and potentially reduced volatility to a market. As larger, more stable entities commit capital, the market could become more resilient to sudden price swings, fostering a more mature and predictable environment for all participants. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor While most individual investors don’t operate on the scale of a Nasdaq-listed digital asset firm , there are valuable lessons to be learned from Hilbert Group’s strategic moves: Embrace a Long-Term Perspective: Institutions focus on the bigger picture. Consider Bitcoin as a long-term investment rather than a short-term trade. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure it aligns with your personal financial goals. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin is dominant, explore other promising digital assets. However, always conduct thorough research. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market developments, regulatory changes, and institutional moves. Knowledge is power in this rapidly evolving space. A Bold Step Forward for Digital Assets Hilbert Group’s decision to significantly boost its Bitcoin holdings with an additional 233 BTC from Deus X Capital is a powerful statement. It underscores the growing legitimacy and strategic importance of Bitcoin within the financial landscape. As a Nasdaq-listed digital asset firm , their actions provide a clear signal of confidence, not just in Bitcoin, but in the entire future of institutional crypto investment. This move highlights a broader trend where traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the undeniable value and potential of decentralized assets. It’s a fascinating time to witness the convergence of established financial powerhouses and the revolutionary world of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for a more integrated and digitally-driven financial future.

2025-07-15T13:38:31,"XRP Price Prediction For July 15","The post XRP Price Prediction For July 15 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP holders have had a bumpy ride over the past week. After showing a strong bullish trend and briefly testing the $3 resistance level, the price has pulled back slightly. According to recent analysis , XRP is currently holding up better than Bitcoin on the lower timeframes, despite the overall market cooling down. While a breakout above $3 seemed possible earlier, the odds now hint it might be a bit too soon for that move. If XRP can find strong support around $2.70 to $2.60, there’s a good chance the token will consolidate in that zone, a positive sign for the next possible push higher. Market sentiment will also hinge on upcoming inflation data, which has the potential to shake up crypto prices in the short term. If the broader market stays steady and XRP manages to hold above $2.70, a move past $3 could still happen later this month. But for now, the focus is on whether XRP can defend key support levels before attempting another breakout. Here’s what to expect: Short-term: Likely to dip towards $2.70–$2.60 Medium-term: Consolidation above $2.70 could open doors for a future breakout Watch for: Inflation data impact and overall crypto market sentiment Analyst Casi Trades shared that over the weekend, XRP perfectly retested the $2.69 support level and is now challenging the crucial $3 resistance. The $3 level is a key Fibonacci retracement from XRP’s all-time high, and reclaiming it would signal serious momentum. The ideal scenario next would be a breakout above $3.04, a quick retest turning it into support, and a sharp rally toward $3.40 and beyond. If XRP breaks past its all-time high, Casi expects the price to surge rapidly, with little resistance ahead, and plenty of time for this move to play out before the end of July.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-july-15/,"XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC","News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

SEC Settlement: The Seal of Approval for Central Banks to Use XRP","Crypto Researcher SMQKE has drawn attention to the broader significance of the ongoing legal proceedings between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. In a recent tweet, SMQKE stated that the conclusion of the Ripple v. SEC case would serve as a “seal of approval” for central banks and other financial institutions to begin adopting XRP through the XRP Ledger. SMQKE pinpoints that such an outcome would reduce regulatory uncertainty around the asset, which has been a key concern for institutional players considering the use of XRP in cross-border settlement and liquidity operations. A visual accompanying the tweet elaborated that settlement of the case is likely to make XRP usage by central banks and other large financial actors far less speculative than other notable cryptocurrency-related events, such as corporate bitcoin purchases. The document noted, by way of contrast, that even Tesla’s high-profile Bitcoin acquisition lacked the regulatory clarity that central banks and regulated financial entities require before adopting digital assets at scale. Ripple v. SEC conclusion —> “Seal of Approval for Central Banks to use XRP through the XRP Ledger.” https://t.co/rCUcHjCiX5 pic.twitter.com/OzslSbdBfD — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 13, 2025 Settlement Process Still Underway As of July 2025, the Ripple v. SEC case is still active. However, substantial progress has been made toward a resolution. In March 2025, Ripple and the SEC announced an agreement that would reduce Ripple’s civil penalty to $50 million, with the company no longer pursuing its appeal of the court’s earlier rulings. In return, the SEC agreed to withdraw its appeal and indicated that it would not pursue further litigation on the same issues. However, the proposed settlement is still subject to approval by the presiding judge, and key procedural steps remain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to a Times Tabloid report, Judge Analisa Torres declined in June to vacate the injunction against Ripple immediately, citing procedural and jurisdictional reasons. The SEC still needs to complete its internal voting process, which is expected to take several weeks, before filing a formal motion to dismiss its appeal and finalize the settlement. Both parties are expected to submit an update to the court by August 15, making it the likely timeframe for the formal closure of the case. Impact of Institutional Adoption of XRP SMQKE’s remarks reflect a widely held view among XRP advocates that the resolution of the SEC lawsuit will eliminate a major obstacle to institutional adoption. Since the SEC filed its complaint in late 2020, accusing Ripple of selling unregistered securities, many U.S.-based exchanges delisted XRP, and financial institutions hesitated to incorporate it into their operations. A completed settlement, with no further legal challenge from the SEC, would confirm that XRP can be used without fear of additional regulatory enforcement, which could make it a viable option for central banks exploring distributed ledger technology for cross-border settlement.

2025-07-15T13:30:31,"Dogecoin Poised For A Monster Rally Amid Brewing Altcoin Season","In livestream that stretched beyond the hour‑mark, technical analyst Kevin (Kev Capital TA) laid out the most compelling bullish case for Dogecoin since the meme‑coin’s April lows. Speaking to a cross‑platform audience, Kevin argued that the market is standing “right on the verge of a genuine altcoin season,” and that the textbook double‑bottom visible on Dogecoin’s higher‑time‑frame chart positions the asset for what he called “a monster move” once resistance levels yield. Dogecoin Chart Turns Bullish Kevin began by situating Dogecoin inside a broader macro chessboard. This week’s cascade of inflation data—CPI and PPI prints bracketed by near‑continuous Federal Reserve commentary—could inject volatility, he conceded, but the direction of trend is already set by structural forces. “Trueflation is sitting at 1.71 percent,” he noted, adding that the crowdsourced gauge routinely prints about sixty to seventy basis points beneath official Bureau of Labor Statistics data. “Anything under two is good. It means inflation isn’t the story.” Related Reading: Fibonacci Maps Dogecoin Path To $23—Is It Too Far-Fetched? With macro risks in check, his focus narrowed to USDT dominance, the metric he has used all cycle to time rotations into riskier assets. Tether’s market‑share chart has completed a bear‑flag breakdown and is now pressing the 0.786 Fibonacci support band at roughly 4.14 percent. “When money‑flow is deep red on USDT‑D, that’s the green light for altcoins,” he said, emphasising that fresh downside in the stablecoin gauge would coincide almost mechanically with upside in DOGE. A hotter‑than‑expected CPI could deliver a short, counter‑trend bounce in USDT‑D, “but the path of least resistance is lower,” he insisted. The anchor for Kevin’s bullish thesis is an unmistakable double‑bottom on Dogecoin’s weekly chart that formed exactly on the macro 0.382 retracement of the 2024–25 advance and directly atop a multi‑year down‑trend line. “Flip the chart upside‑down,” he told viewers, “and you’d run from it—it looks like a perfect double‑top. Flip it back and it’s a gift.” Volume profiles confirm the pattern: sellers exhausted themselves on the second dip, while relative‑strength momentum created a higher low, an early signal that bulls are wresting control. Kevin’s conviction draws added weight from what is unfolding in the aggregate altcoin indices. Total 3—market‑cap ex‑Bitcoin and ex‑Ether—has slammed into a resistance “yellow box” that capped rallies all spring, yet the analyst believes the ceiling will crack soon. A pending daily golden cross on Total 2 (market‑cap ex‑Bitcoin) marks the fourth of the cycle; each prior cross generated a brief pullback of 9‑19 percent before giving way to fresh highs. “Golden crosses are lagging, so you manage risk here—pay yourself a little—but the trend is higher once the dust settles,” he said. For Dogecoin specifically, Kevin identified a hierarchy of breakout objectives: the local range high at $0.21, the $0.48 pivot from 2024, and the former all‑time high near $0.74. Beyond that he flagged extensions at $1.32 and $2.00, noting that targets lose utility if projected too far in advance. “We analyse the here and now; we let the chart earn the next level,” he cautioned, before reminding newcomers that DOGE is already a ten‑bagger off its June 2024 trough—a feat matched by few large‑cap tokens. Related Reading: Dogecoin To $3.94 This Cycle? This Chart Says It’s No Meme While audience questions repeatedly drifted towards Elon Musk and X and Tesla integration rumors, Kevin waved off the cult of personality. “Dogecoin doesn’t need Elon,” he said bluntly. The meme‑coin’s 10× rebound happened “with zero help from the world’s richest man,” and any future endorsement would likely serve as accelerant rather than spark. What matters, in his view, is liquidity: specifically, the Federal Reserve’s balance‑sheet trajectory and the timing of its eventual pivot away from quantitative tightening. “When QT ends, Bitcoin dominance tops. Then you get the real alt‑season,” he said, pointing to a perfect inverse correlation between Fed asset‑runoff periods and historical altcoin booms. Ending the session, the analyst projected that a decisive weekly close above Bitcoin’s 1.886 fib at $120,000—and a simultaneous rollover in USDT dominance—would ignite the next leg. In that scenario, Dogecoin’s double‑bottom would evolve into a full trend‑reversal, vaulting price into territory last visited during the meme‑mania of 2021. “You haven’t seen anything yet,” he concluded. “Stay calm, stay cool, and let the chart do the work.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.19126.
