Here Are the Details","Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA), the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company in the US, is increasing its investments in institutional-grade Bitcoin yield strategies. Marathon Digital Deepens Bitcoin Yield Strategy with $20 Million Investment in Two Prime The company formalized the partnership by investing $20 million in SEC-registered investment advisor Two Prime. This investment also increases MARA's Bitcoin allocation to Two Prime from 500 BTC to 2,000 BTC. Susquehanna Crypto also participated in the round. With the new funding, MARA becomes not only a capital investor but also an equity owner in Two Prime's returns platform, specifically designed for corporate treasuries, sovereign wealth funds, and large Bitcoin holders. Two Prime CEO Alexander Blume commented on the strategic significance of the investment as follows: “Digital assets are now becoming an integral part of corporate and sovereign balance sheets. MARA's investment demonstrates a shift towards active, yield-focused Bitcoin strategies aligned with institutional standards. This alignment is driven by a long-term vision, risk management, and innovation.” MARA CFO Salman Khan evaluated the investment decision within the scope of the company's new treasury policy: “This investment builds on our existing collaboration, where we have a strong alignment on risk, transparency, and capital allocation. Our goal is to actively invest our Bitcoin holdings, rather than passively holding them solely for value appreciation.” Last month, the company announced that it mined 950 BTC in May 2025. This was MARA's highest monthly production in a year and brought its total reserves to 49,179 BTC. This gives MARA the second-largest Bitcoin treasury among publicly traded companies, behind Strategy. MARA's market capitalization currently stands at $6.2 billion, and its share price is trading around $19, up 25% in the last month. Meanwhile, Two Prime, with $1.75 billion in assets under management, is the largest decentralized finance (CeFi) lender in the US, according to Galaxy Research. This investment marks a significant milestone in the company's growth phase. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-15T12:48:34,"Bitcoin Eyes $137,000 as “Crypto Week” Spurs Legislative Tailwinds, Technical Momentum","Bitcoin is testing key resistance levels amid rising investor optimism driven by U.S. legislative developments and improving technical indicators. With lawmakers advancing multiple digital asset-related bills during what’s being informally dubbed “Crypto Week”, analysts are raising short-term price targets, with projections now pointing toward $137,000. U.S. Lawmakers Fuel Bullish Sentiment The U.S. House of Representatives is actively debating a slate of crypto-related legislation aimed at clarifying the legal status of digital tokens, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Key bills under review include: Clarity for Digital Tokens Act, distinguishing securities from commodities; Genius Act, a regulatory framework for stablecoins; Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, restricting the Federal Reserve’s ability to issue retail digital dollars. The prospect of regulatory clarity is fueling renewed institutional interest and boosting sentiment across digital asset markets. Institutional Demand Resurfaces Companies including MicroStrategy, which now holds over 600,000 BTC, are once again increasing crypto exposure. Asset manager Grayscale has also filed for a U.S. IPO, underscoring mounting demand for compliant investment vehicles. The legislative momentum is seen as a catalyst for further corporate adoption. Technical Picture Aligns with Macro Backdrop Bitcoin (BTC) has gained 16.72% over six months, 10.69% over the past month, and 7.84% in the last week, trading between $111,134 and $122,428. The immediate resistance stands at $126,231, roughly 3% above the current range. A break above this threshold could trigger a move toward $137,525, representing a further 9% upside. On the downside, support levels are identified at $103,644 and $92,350. Key indicators: 10-day and 100-day SMAs: Hovering near $118,000, signaling price stability. RSI at 28.04 and Stochastic at 19.83: Indicate oversold conditions. MACD at -691.09: Suggests a potential bullish reversal.

NEW: SharpLink becomes the largest $ETH holder among corporate entities Between July 7 and July 13, SharpLink acquired ~74,656 ETH for ~$213M at an average price of ~$2,852 per ETH Total holdings now stand at ~280,706 ETH ~99.7% of ETH is staked, earning ~415 ETH since June 2… pic.twitter.com/2yknUWgkLJ — SBET (SharpLink Gaming) (@SharpLinkGaming) July 15, 2025 Between July 7 and July 13, the company purchased approximately 74,656 ETH at an average price of $2,852, totaling an investment of around $213 million. This latest purchase brings SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings to roughly 280,706 ETH. The company’s aggressive buying activity signals a growing trend among corporations diversifying into digital assets beyond Bitcoin. The Ethereum acquisition reflects SharpLink’s long-term commitment to blockchain infrastructure, staking rewards, and decentralized finance applications. Nearly Entire Holdings Staked for Yield According to data shared by SharpLink, approximately 99.7% of its ETH holdings are currently either staked or restaked, contributing to onchain security while earning passive yield. Since June 2, SharpLink has earned approximately 415 ETH through staking activities. The company has not disclosed specific staking providers or restaking platforms used, though the scale of participation suggests involvement with major Ethereum infrastructure layers, possibly including liquid staking protocols. The yield strategy appears to be core to SharpLink’s treasury allocation, positioning Ethereum not just as a reserve asset, but as an income-generating component of its digital strategy. ETH Concentration Trends Upward Ethereum concentration among institutional players and corporate entities has been rising steadily. Since June 13, ETH concentration by top holders has increased by approximately 23%, a figure influenced in part by SharpLink’s large-scale acquisitions. With the Ethereum price hovering near $2,850 during the accumulation period, SharpLink’s entry adds weight to a broader narrative of institutional confidence in ETH as a long-term asset. While Bitcoin has historically dominated corporate balance sheets, Ethereum’s versatility—ranging from smart contracts and DeFi to tokenization—continues to attract strategic capital allocations. SharpLink trades under the ticker $SBET and has not yet commented on how this ETH position aligns with its broader corporate roadmap. However, the move is already drawing attention from analysts who view the purchase as maturing institutional interest in Ethereum’s infrastructure and yield potential. SharpLink Launches Ethereum Treasury Strategy SharpLink embarked on its Ethereum treasury strategy in late May. The move coincided with a $425 million private placement led by Consensys, the crypto infrastructure firm founded by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who also took on the role of SharpLink’s chairman. Beyond building its treasury, SharpLink has expressed its commitment to supporting Ethereum’s long-term strength and decentralization.

The NYSE Arca exchange posted its letter of approval for the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF. The approval is seen as an immediate green light for the ETF trading. The new fund will be launched in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The ProShares XRP ETF is considered approved and active after its prospectus filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. | Source: SEC The US Securities and Exchange Commission listed the fund as “Approved” from July 14 onward. The NYSE Arca has already set up a trading page with the UXRP ticker. The fund’s prospectus has also been filed with the SEC in preparation for imminent launch. The ProShares Ultra XRP ETF is expected to start trading on July 18. Based on the prospectus, the current ETF will not invest in XRP directly, thus not providing demand similar to the older BTC and ETH funds. The ProShares Ultra product will seek performance based on the Bloomberg XRP index, tracking the price without buying the underlying asset. The fund aims to reach 2X the performance of XRP within the span of a day, though not guaranteeing the performance. The 2X metric does not apply to longer time periods. The new leveraged ETF is seen as a more liquid option, suitable for institutions and large-scale investors. XRP breaks out following Proshares Ultra ETF news Following the news of the ETF approval, XRP rallied to $2.92, breaking out of its recent range. XRP has been anticipating the news of an ETF, but the actual announcement served as a trigger for the market price. XRP was bound in a range close to $2.80, while BTC set its new series of records. This time, XRP broke out again, setting expectations for recovering above $3. The asset was already showing liveliness following the launch of the leveraged 2x XXRP ETF. The XXRP ETF accrued assets of over $165M under management in the initial days of trading. The market is now anticipating a spot ETF, which could further boost the mainstream adoption of XRP. The asset has yet to recover its previous all-time high and enter price discovery. XRP notoriously skipped one bull cycle, hovering near its price minimum due to the protracted lawsuit against the SEC. XRP awaits multiple ETF launches XRP awaits multiple launches for funds in various stages of approval. In the past few months, XRP has been considered as one of the most probable assets for an ETF, alongside Solana (SOL). In July, multiple deadlines for XRP funds will draw attention to the asset. The Rex-Osprey XRP ETF is expecting approval on July 25, while the Turtle Capital ETF expects a statement as early as July 16. A series of approvals could bring XRP price to a higher range, especially after demand for spot funds comes in. At one point, XRP had over 19 active ETF applications, including a recent filing from Trump’s Truth Social. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

In a new CNBC interview, Paul Ciana – BofA’s head of fixed income, currency, commodity, and equity technical research – says he expects the S&P 500 to rally in the coming weeks after breaking out from a bullish reversal pattern. “Yes, the S&P 500 is getting a little bit overbought, and we’re seeing signs of tactical weakness. But that’s okay. We’re also seeing plenty of signs for a bullish trend. We think back to May, when we initiated our bullish outlook for this summer. We had that very nice [inverse] head and shoulders bottom in the daily chart of the S&P 500. That, like the technical textbooks would say, measures up to about 6,625. So we’ve been looking for a rally into the 6,500 this summer, maybe with a little upside risk to that.” Source: CNBC/YouTube While Ciana is bullish on the S&P 500, he warns that its ascent will not happen in a straight line. The BofA executive predicts that the stock market index will witness a correction once it hits his target level based on a technical analysis rule. “In technicals, we like to say that the rule of alternation occurs with corrections, and there are a lot of parallels between 2025 markets and macro with 2018. In 2018, we had that shallow correction in the first half, big rally to all-time highs and a deep correction at year-end. So I think the rule of alternation suggests we get this rally to new all-time highs, we have a mean reversion toward year-end. So maybe if we get up to 6,500, 6,600 toward year-end, maybe we come back down toward 6,200.” Ciana clarifies that the S&P 500 succumbed to a deep pullback earlier this year, and that a modest correction could occur in the coming months – an inverse scenario of what happened in 2018. As of Monday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,268.

Key Takeaways: MARA Holdings acquired a minority stake in Two Prime, boosting its Bitcoin allocation to 2,000 BTC. The additional Bitcoin will be held in a Separately Managed Account to generate yield. MARA and other miners face profitability challenges post-halving, prompting pivot toward AI data centers. The acquisition includes a $20 million equity investment and significantly boosts MARA’s Bitcoin allocation managed by Two Prime, increasing it from 500 BTC to 2,000 BTC, according to a recent press release . The additional Bitcoin will be held in a Separately Managed Account (SMA) and used to generate yield for MARA. MARA Expands Bitcoin Treasury via Stock Sales MARA, known for one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries globally, initially built through its self-mining efforts, has been expanding its Bitcoin holdings through stock sales, a strategy reminiscent of Michael Saylor’s approach with Strategy. Salman Khan, MARA’s CFO, explained that the move reflects the company’s goal to activate its Bitcoin balance, aiming to use BTC as more than just a passive asset linked to price gains. Two Prime, registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specializes in helping institutional and professional investors gain exposure to Bitcoin. “As bitcoin becomes an integral part of corporate and sovereign balance sheets, institutions are reevaluating how to deploy it strategically,” said Alexander Blume, CEO of Two Prime. “MARA’s investment signals a broader shift toward active, yield-focused bitcoin strategies that meet institutional standards. This is a long-term alignment around vision, risk management, and innovation.” @MARA Leads $20 Million Investment in Two Prime to Advance Institutional Bitcoin Yield Strategies and Expands SMA to 2,000 BTC Read more below https://t.co/2sf99yc8HV — Two Prime (@Two_Prime) July 15, 2025 MARA, like many miners, is navigating a tough post-halving market. The recent Bitcoin halving cut block rewards in half, squeezing mining revenues while energy and equipment costs continue to rise. Despite a 30% revenue increase to $214 million in Q1, MARA reported a net loss of $533 million, highlighting the strain on mining profitability. To adapt, several mining firms, including Core Scientific and HIVE Digital, have shifted toward AI data center hosting and repurposing infrastructure for high-performance computing. Core Scientific’s future in Bitcoin mining remains uncertain following its $9 billion acquisition by CoreWeave , which plans to potentially repurpose or divest crypto operations. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last week, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

Standard Chartered's corporate clients, investment funds, and asset managers can trade XBT/USD and ETH/USD pairs via the standard FX interface at the bank’s UK division. ”Demand for regulated digital asset solutions is growing, and we are ready to offer clients the tools they need,” said Standard Chartered Chief Executive Bill Winters. For settlement, both third-party vaults and Standard Chartered's own custodial service, Zodia Custody—which launched in 2020—are available. The bank also plans to add settlement of non-deliverable forward (NDF) contracts soon. There is a notable divergence in asset preferences between institutional and retail investors. According to The Block, Wintermute experts have observed that large players are ramping up their investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum: these two highly capitalized cryptocurrencies now make up approximately 70% of institutional portfolios, whereas for retail investors, the figure has fallen to 37%. ”This is not a temporary trend, but a sign of market maturity. Institutions view cryptoassets as macro assets, while retail continues to look for high-yielding but risky opportunities,” said Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, Robinhood’s U.S. staking launch continues to push olana. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $159.03 with an intraday drop of 4.67%. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Will Solana Go Back Up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our latest Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030. We’ll address these queries using our analyses, market sentiments, and regular updates from the crypto world.

The RSI at 61.62 shows growing strength but not yet overbought. Increased volume (+36.32%) and a breakout from consolidation hint at renewed investor interest. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $145 $170 $195 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $6.94 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $750M–$540M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

He attributes this to Solana’s advanced blockchain technology, growing ecosystem, and rising investor interest. If Pal’s prediction holds, Solana’s price could exceed $400 in the coming months, a significant surge from its previous peak. Despite market trends, Solana has shown resilience, maintaining a strong performance with consistent buying pressure.

2025-07-15T12:33:03,"U.S. June CPI Rose an In Line 0.3%; Core Rate Slightly Better Than Hoped at 0.2%","Inflation in the U.S. perked up in June but was mostly in line with expectations, perhaps helping to set the stage for another Federal Reserve rate cut as soon as September. The headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% last month versus economist forecasts of 0.3% and just 0.1% in May. On a year-over-year basis, CPI rose 2.7% against 2.7% expected and 2.4% in May. The core CPI, which strips out food and energy costs, climbed 0.2 % in June versus 0.3% expected and 0.1% in May. Core CPI year-over-year was higher by 2.9% compared to 3.0% anticipated and 2.8% in May. In the midst of a steep decline from record highs of nearly $124,000 just a bit over 24 hours ago, the price of bitcoin (BTC) gained a bit back to $117,300 just following the release of the data. A check of traditional markets finds U.S. stock indices futures adding a bit to gains, with the S&P 500 higher by 0.4%. The 10-year Treasury yield has dipped two basis points to 4.41%. The new data comes as investors watch for signs of whether inflation is easing enough for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates later this year. Though at least two Fed members have agitated for a rate cut as soon as the central bank's late July meeting, there's doesn't seem to be wide support from either Fed Chair Jerome Powell or the rest of the central bank policymakers. That's led to the Fed's subsequent meeting — in September — as the leading candidate for the possible resumption of rate cuts. Prior to this morning's inflation data, the odds of a September move were just shy of 62%, according to CME FedWatch .",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/15/us-june-inflation-rose-an-in-line-03-core-rate-slightly-better-than-hoped-at-02,"BTC|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Inflation|CPI|News",cryptocompare

While the price recently broke a record by exceeding $123,000, it fell to $117,000 due to increased profit-taking. While it was stated that this correction was normal and the rise would continue, critical inflation data that the FED attaches importance to in its interest rate decision was announced today. Here is the data disclosed: Consumer Price Index Annual: Announced 2.7% – Expected 2.6% – Previous 2.4% Consumer Price Index Monthly: Announced 0.3% – Expected 0.3% – Previous 0.1% Core Consumer Price Index Annual: Announced 2.9% – Expected 3.0% – Previous 2.8% Core Consumer Price Index Monthly: Announced 0.2%–Expected 0.3%–Previous 0.1% The consumer price index (CPI) is a key variable used to measure consumer purchasing trends and changes in US inflation. According to The Kobeissi Letter, US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has increased for the first two months since January 2025.

2025-07-15T12:30:06,"TD Cowen Projects Bitcoin At $155K By Year-End, Raises Strategy’s Price Target","Global investment bank TD Cowen has recently revised its price target for Strategy’s (previously MicroStrategy) stock, MSTR, raising it from $590 to $680 per share and a bullish prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) prices, which could soar to $155,000 by December. Possible 53% Drop For Bitcoin The firm’s study outlines a base-case scenario for Bitcoin at $128,000 by year-end, with a more pessimistic outlook placing it as low as $55,000, which could mean a major 53% crash from current prices. TD Cowen analysts assert that a significant increase in Bitcoin prices is expected to positively impact Strategy’s share price, given its status as the world’s largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‘XRP Train Has Left The Station – Analyst On July 14, Strategy purchased an additional 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, averaging $111,827 per coin. This latest acquisition brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 601,550 BTC. Analysts at TD Cowen noted that what began as a defensive measure to preserve the value of its assets has evolved into a proactive strategy aimed at enhancing shareholder value. Strategy plans to continue acquiring Bitcoin through proceeds from upcoming debt and equity offerings. The firm anticipates that Strategy will raise around $84 billion through its innovative “42/42” plan, which involves an equal mix of debt and equity, potentially increasing its Bitcoin reserves to 900,000 BTC by the end of 2027. Strategy As Strong Investment Option TD Cowen has initiated buy ratings on Strategy’s preferred shares, emphasizing their attractive income potential and price appreciation, which are expected to be less volatile than common shares or Bitcoin itself. This endorsement comes after the firm first recognized Strategy’s Bitcoin strategy in 2023, describing it as a “paradigm shift.” At that time, they highlighted the company’s approach of utilizing cash from its software business to invest in Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against dollar inflation. Analysts believe that Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it a more reliable store of value compared to traditional currencies or gold, presenting Strategy as an appealing option for investors looking to gain Bitcoin exposure.

The latest report and Strategy’s recent purchase coincided with Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high, surpassing $123,000, underscoring the growing acceptance and adoption of BTC in the financial landscape. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency has retraced to $117,000 in an attempt to find its next support level before moving on to uncharted territory once again if buying demand persists among investors.

2025-07-15T12:22:04,"BTC Gains Near Climax? Peter Brandt Sounds the Alarm","TL;DR Peter Brandt says BTC isn’t failing yet, but gains may slow without major macroeconomic change. BTC’s long-term chart shows strength, but Brandt warns of capital strain for future breakouts. Peter Brandt Pushes Back on Bitcoin Collapse Talk Peter Brandt has addressed growing speculation about a potential breakdown in Bitcoin’s long-term trend. In a post shared on July 13, the seasoned trader said that while BTC appears to be nearing a key stage, it does not show signs of a structural failure. It the entire price history of Bitcoin was a fruit, what fruit would you say it was? pic.twitter.com/FPEU1bUvnf — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) July 13, 2025 His chart, based on a parabolic regression model that covers Bitcoin’s full history, raised questions from followers. One user suggested that another major breakout would require capital inflows in the tens of trillions—something they viewed as unlikely. Brandt responded : “Short of a complete re-ordering of the global reserve currency structure, I believe we will soon reach a climax in this advance.” Price Arc Still Holding, But Gains May Slow Brandt’s take signals that Bitcoin may be approaching the upper bounds of its long-term price path. While there may still be room for growth, he indicated that further moves higher will likely demand more capital and may hinge on broader shifts in global markets. Rather than warning of an incoming crash, his comment suggests Bitcoin is moving into a slower phase of its cycle. The trend is intact, but the pace and ease of gains could change. Rising Costs, Slower Returns Some investors argue that Bitcoin is becoming harder to accumulate at scale. As institutional buyers and treasuries commit larger sums, they are receiving less BTC in return. This rising cost has led some to doubt whether sharp price moves are still realistic. Brandt’s view doesn’t rule that out. He points out that without large macroeconomic changes, the next breakout could be tougher to sustain. In May, Peter Brandt also sparked debate with a poll on X, asking followers which token they would invest $100,000 in—XRP or SOL. While some highlighted Solana’s recent chart strength, Brandt noted that he considers more than just price movement. The post BTC Gains Near Climax?

2025-07-15T12:20:06,"German Giant Deutsche Bank Reveals Five Main Reasons for Bitcoin's Recent Rally! Shares Expectations!","Bitcoin (BTC) broke record after record yesterday, falling to over $123,000, while increasing profit-taking and selling pressure pushed the price down to $117,000. A new report from Deutsche Bank came as analysts stated that the decline in Bitcoin is a healthy correction and preparation for further rise. According to Coindesk, Deutsche Bank analysts said that Bitcoin's volatility has decreased, and this decline indicates that the market is maturing and on the rise. Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank, said that the recent explosive performance in Bitcoin is due to a unique combination of five elements, including institutional, macroeconomic and technological factors, and that BTC is now entering a phase of maturation and institutional integration. At this point, analysts noted that increased ETF inflows, greater regulatory clarity, increasing mass adoption, milder macroeconomic conditions, and technological advancement are driving the Bitcoin price higher. The bank noted that despite Bitcoin's record rally, its volatility has fallen significantly, a sign of a maturing market. Analysts added that Bitcoin's volatility continues to decline as BTC adoption increases. “As institutional adoption increases, the regulatory environment stabilizes, and its use by investors and governments becomes more widespread, Bitcoin is solidifying its position as a new digital reserve asset. This new reality lays the foundation for long-term sustainable growth in BTC price.” *This is not investment advice.

According to blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, Wynn placed a leveraged bet on the memecoin PEPE, using capital derived from a referral bonus. The trader reportedly claimed 6,792.53 USDC in bonuses before opening a new 10x leveraged long position on PEPE via the decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid. James Wynn is back again! After claiming a referral reward of 6,792.53 $USDC , he went long on $PEPE with 10x leverage. https://t.co/FX6sISVWOh pic.twitter.com/seMcAfAhWg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 15, 2025 Lookonchain shared two images showing Wynn’s activity under the wallet address 0x5078C2fBeA2b2aD61bc840Bc02335Fce56BeDb6. The leverage trader had allocated nearly his entire portfolio, valued at $11,840.99, to perpetual futures, with just $3.46 in spot assets and nothing staked. Wynn bets on the PEPE market run James Wynn made a concentrated bet on KPEPE-USD through five long entries starting from 18,153 to over 6 million units, opened within a 95-minute window. Entry prices were between $0.011999 and $0.012015, and trade values were from $217 to more than $72,000. Another screenshot from Lookonchain, timestamped later the same day, updated Wynn’s total portfolio value to $12,011.35, with his PEPE-related perpetual contract clocking $12,007.89. His long position on KPEPE-USD had grown to 851,765 tokens, at $0.01201. With the token trading at $0.00001221 at the time of capture, Wynn’s portfolio had counted an unrealized gain of $1,708.16. Yet, the leveraged trader faces a funding rate risk of -7.22% and a liquidation price of $0.00001137. According to Coingecko updates, PEPE is trading at $0.00001213, 3.7% less than its value 24 hours ago. The token’s intraday lows came close to Wynn’s liquidation level, at $0.00001175. Record losses did not keep Wynn out of markets for long James Wynn was the most talked about X account in May 2025 when his trading choices led to one of the heaviest collapses in the Hyperliquid trading community. He saw $100 million in long-Bitcoin positions wiped out when BTC’s price dropped below $105,000, equivalent to 949 BTC. Shortly before the liquidation, Wynn had posted on X that he did not practice risk management and didn’t consider himself a professional. In a now-deleted message, he asserted: “I’m effectively gambling, and I stand to lose everything. I strongly advise people against what I’m doing.” Wynn doubled down on his long bets days later with another $100 million bet on Bitcoin, while accusing market makers of targeting his trades to force liquidations. The trader turned to the crypto community for donations to keep his positions alive, and at least 24 addresses responded with funds. Not long after receiving community support, Wynn announced he had liquidated 240 BTC, worth approximately $25 million at the time, to improve the viability of his remaining positions. Crypto market now in the red, pullback precedes CPI data release Wynn’s return comes after Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $122,000, then tanked by 4.3% in the last day, pulling its price down to around $117,060. Even though the largest coin by market cap has retained an 8% weekly gain, the retracement has caused most assets in the top 10 to trade in the red. Total crypto market capitalization dropped by 3.33% to $3.68 trillion, while trading volume spiked 31% to $257 billion. In the past 24 hours alone, roughly $501 million worth of positions were liquidated . Longs accounted for $389 million of that total, after bullish speculators were caught off guard by the sudden correction. Bitcoin led the liquidation tally with $181 million in positions erased, $142 million from longs and $39 million from shorts.

2025-07-15T12:00:50,"Crypto Reserve For Confiscated Assets On Kazakhstan’s Agenda, Report","Kazakhstan is exploring a significant move into the cryptocurrency arena, contemplating the establishment of its first-ever cryptocurrency reserve. This, amid a record-breaking rally in Bitcoin (BTC) and an increasing adoption of digital assets by institutions, public companies, and nations. Reports from local media indicate that the country’s gold and foreign exchange reserves, alongside the assets of the National Fund, are being considered for investment in crypto assets. Kazakhstan Eyes Crypto Assets For National Fund During a recent press conference, Timur Suleimenov, the head of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, outlined the country’s intentions. He mentioned that Kazakhstan is developing an alternative investment portfolio for its gold and foreign exchange reserves, as well as for the National Fund. This portfolio reportedly aims to employ more aggressive strategies to enhance investment returns. Suleimenov noted that the country is looking at successful models from the Norwegian fund, American practices, and strategies used by Middle Eastern funds, many of which include investments in digital assets, either directly or through related exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stocks. Suleimenov emphasized that while the potential for high returns from such investments is appealing, the inherent volatility of digital assets necessitates a cautious approach. He stated, “This is not an easy question, so you can’t rush here. Yes, such assets can bring high returns, but at the same time, they are characterized by high volatility.” Evolving Digital Asset Regulations In addition to the investment plans, the National Bank is also considering the creation of a state reserve for crypto assets. This reserve would be designated for storing digital assets that have been confiscated by law enforcement agencies. To facilitate this, a separate infrastructure would be established, illustrating Kazakhstan’s commitment to not only participating in the digital asset economy but also managing it responsibly. Furthermore, Suleimenov mentioned that if certain enterprises engage in mining cryptocurrencies on behalf of the state, a portion of those assets could be directed into the crypto reserve through taxes or mandatory payments. The regulatory landscape in Kazakhstan is also evolving. Recently, there have been discussions about implementing administrative and criminal penalties for transactions involving crypto assets on the “gray market.” Currently, digital asset trading is permitted only on licensed exchanges within the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC). The National Bank is also planning to impose restrictions on advertising related to digital assets, aiming to create a more controlled environment for crypto transactions. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $117,450. However, the market’s largest cryptocurrency saw its price reach a new record earlier on Monday of $123,000, registering an 11% surge in the monthly time frame.

2025-07-15T12:00:00,"ETFs and Treasuries Drive Fresh Ethereum Demand","Leading the charge are SharpLink, which holds over 255,000 ETH, and BitMine Immersion Technologies with 163,142 ETH. This wave of buying is very similar to the strategies seen with corporate Bitcoin adoption and is accompanied by strong inflows into Ethereum investment products. ETH also very briefly reclaimed $3,000 on July 11, fueled by rising demand, bullish sentiment, and increasing corporate confidence. ETH Treasury Holdings Explode Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a big surge in institutional demand. In fact, top corporate treasuries bought more than $1.6 billion worth of ETH over the past month. This means that more than 545,000 ETH was accumulated by Ethereum treasury companies in the last 30 days alone. It seems like rising prices and market optimism are drawing in some institutional interest. BitMine Immersion Technologies , which is chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, now holds 163,142 ETH valued at approximately $480 million. This makes it one of the largest Ethereum treasuries. Lee drew a comparison to Michael Saylor’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy, and suggested that Ethereum treasuries could similarly benefit from what he called a “Wall Street put,” a reference to rising institutional confidence. Quote from Tom Lee Joseph Lubin’s gaming platform, SharpLink , is the largest corporate holder of ETH. With recent purchases totaling more than 50,000 ETH in just a few days, SharpLink’s holdings now exceed 255,000 ETH. Lubin is also the founder of Consensys, and humorously referred to himself as a “self-appointed representative of The League of Extraordinary ETH Accumulator Gentlemen.” Some of the other entrants into the ETH treasury trend include Bit Digital , which now holds over 100,000 ETH, and BTCS, which raised $62.4 million to expand its treasury to 29,122 ETH. GameSquare also announced plans to build a $100 million Ethereum treasury. This wave of accumulation coincides with the large capital flows into Ethereum investment products. According to CoinShares, Ethereum-based funds recently logged their 12th straight week of inflows. The attracted $990 million in just the last week, which made it the fourth-largest weekly inflow on record. (Source: strategicethreserve.xyz ) So far in 2025, ETH funds have seen over $4 billion in inflows, with almost 30% of that taking place over the past two weeks alone. This momentum pushed Ethereum inflows to represent 19.5% of total global Ether fund assets under management, which is nearly double Bitcoin's 9.8% over the same period. ETH briefly topped $3,000 on July 11 for the first time since February, before pulling back slightly. Still, the price is up 15% on the week, thanks to growing institutional interest and a swelling chorus of bullish sentiment.

In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm explains with this latest update Telegram’s 1 billion-plus users will gain direct access to Ethereum-based decentralized finance applications. 15+ top-tier DeFi protocols 50+ Integrations 1B+ Telegram users Full-stack DeFi on @ton_blockchain . Deep liquidity from Day 1. Kicking off DeFi Summer on Telegram Here’s what’s launching on Day 1 pic.twitter.com/PgZrNC1tv3 — TAC ( , ) (@TacBuild) July 15, 2025 The launch includes immediate integration of multiple DeFi protocols such as Morpho, Curve, Bancor, Euler, ZeroLend, IPOR Fusion, and Market.win. These applications will now be operational within the Telegram interface via TAC, a link to decentralized finance. The infrastructure aims to support both crypto-native and non-crypto-native users, This direct connection between Ethereum protocols and Telegram users positions TAC as a conduit for expanded access and usability. What is TAC Mainnet? TAC Mainnet is a new blockchain designed to connect Ethereum DeFi applications with Telegram’s 1 billion+ users. It allows Ethereum-based apps to run directly within Telegram, giving both crypto and non-crypto users access to decentralized finance tools. In short, TAC Mainnet is the bridge between Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem and Telegram’s user base, bringing crypto utility to mainstream messaging. According to the announcement the TAC Summoning campaign, organized alongside liquidity protocol Turtle Club, brought in over $800 million in total value locked (TVL). This early liquidity aims to prevent the usual slow uptake that affects many new blockchain projects, giving the mainnet functional depth from the outset. Structured Mainnet Deployment and Developer Integration TAC’s mainnet rollout has taken place in two phases. The Developer Mainnet, launched in June, allowed developers to deploy and test applications ahead of the full public release. This is followed by the Public Mainnet, now active, which allows Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developers to launch decentralized applications. Security and scalability have been a main update through TAC’s integration with Babylon, which introduces Bitcoin staking. The firm explains that further technical support has also been formed through partnerships with infrastructure firms including LayerZero, RedStone, Blockscout, Dune, and Thirdweb. Wallet in Telegram Launches Multi-Asset Trading Earlier this year, the wallet in Telegram announced a number of latest updates to its crypto wallet, introducing multi-asset trading and permanent earn options.

The crypto market cap (TOTAL) currently sits at $3.646 trillion at time of writing and is down 1.39% in the past 24 hours. Pizzino notes that he’s been looking at 150% of the crypto market cap range in the bull market between late 2022 and the February 2024 high, projected off the August 2024 low. “It’s been working very, very well throughout the market. This is part of the analysis that we use to project price targets and support and resistance levels as well. And the next range we’re looking at is the 2022-2024 range, that 50% level, which often can be a resistance level, comes in at $3.8 trillion, so very close to the market action right now… Further up, looking at around $5.3 trillion.

2025-07-15T11:44:03,"Ripple CTO Makes Big Clarity on Bitcoin and XRP Price","Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has offered a timely and thought-provoking perspective on recent developments in the crypto market, particularly XRP’s rise above the $3 mark and Ethereum’s reclaiming of $3,000. In a series of posts on X, Schwartz addressed the enthusiasm surrounding these price movements while urging the community to look beyond market speculation and focus on long-term utility. Price Milestones and Market Sentiment At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $2.90, slightly below the $3 milestone it recently surpassed. The token’s move above $3 sparked a wave of excitement among investors, with some comparing its performance to Ethereum, which also climbed past $3,000. Responding to the buzz, Schwartz remarked, “It’s nice to see ETH over $3,000 again.” When asked about XRP’s price, he responded with measured optimism: “I always feel good when prices are high because I hate to think that people are losing money. But I’m truly not sure how much focus on price is the right amount, especially since price doesn’t seem to correlate very much with other good things like solving real-world problems.” A good analogy is XRP being used as a currency on the EVM sidechain. It's not a direct use of XRP on XRPL, but it's still part of the utility and value or XRP as a currency. Bitcoin is being used in far more places than just on the bitcoin blockchain itself. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 14, 2025 Price vs. Real Value Schwartz went on to clarify that short-term price movements don’t always reflect an asset’s intrinsic value. “Price doesn’t seem to correlate with true value, utility, or ability to solve real-world problems in the short term. It’s certainly possible that it does over longer terms,” he explained. His comments serve as a reminder that real innovation and real-world adoption are what ultimately drive lasting value in crypto, not just market hype or temporary spikes. This view echoes Ripple’s mission to enable real-time, low-cost international payments powered by XRP. With use cases expanding in tokenization, settlement, and decentralized finance, XRP’s value proposition extends well beyond price charts. Bitcoin’s Role in a Multi-Layered Ecosystem In response to a question about Bitcoin’s current use case, Schwartz acknowledged the limited number of real-world problems that cryptocurrencies are solving today. However, he emphasized Bitcoin’s foundational strength. “The hope for Bitcoin is that its solid Layer 1 and early start will secure it a position as a currency of choice in an evolving digital asset ecosystem, even if most of its transactions don’t take place on Bitcoin’s Layer 1.” He stressed that Bitcoin can still derive significant value from its use across secondary layers, exchanges, and financial services platforms, despite the limitations of its base protocol. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Expanding Cross-Chain Utility Schwartz drew a parallel between Bitcoin’s off-chain utility and XRP’s evolving role across different blockchain environments. “A good analogy is XRP being used as a currency on the EVM sidechain. It’s not a direct use of XRP on XRPL, but it’s still part of the utility and value of XRP as a currency,” he explained. His point highlights XRP’s broader relevance in a multi-chain ecosystem where value and function extend beyond native networks. Whether used on XRPL, sidechains, or in cross-border liquidity flows, XRP continues to build momentum through real-world integration. XRP’s recent price surge above $3 marks an important psychological milestone for its supporters. But as Ripple’s CTO points out, price should not be the sole focus. Real value comes from solving problems, creating utility, and enabling new financial possibilities. Whether through Layer 1 innovation or cross-chain adoption, both XRP and Bitcoin are shaping a digital future that goes far deeper than daily price action.

Over the past 24 hours, it declined by over 4%. On-chain signals reveal increased miner activity, which suggests short-term selling pressure. Miners Cashing Out? As the price approached new highs, the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) – which gauges the ratio of miner outflows to their one-year moving average – spiked to levels last seen during major sell-off periods. This means that some of them may have begun taking profits into strength, a pattern often seen when the MPI reading rises above 2, hinting at larger-than-usual Bitcoin outflows from miners to exchanges. While such moves can introduce short-term selling pressure, CryptoQuant explained that historical patterns indicate they do not always derail broader bullish trends when demand from other investor cohorts remains strong. At the same time, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, recorded net inflows of nearly 6,000 BTC between July 12 and July 14. This activity reversed a period of predominantly neutral or negative netflows. The sudden influx alongside the recent price rally points to potential arbitrage activity, derivative hedging, or preparations for large-scale transactions rather than outright panic selling. Considering all these factors together, the uptick in miner activity and increased exchange deposits mean that while some market participants are realizing gains, others may be positioning for continued price action. Amid these miner outflows and Binance inflows, Glassnode recorded one of the year’s largest profit-taking days. Bitcoin Logs One of Its Largest Profit-Taking Days According to the blockchain intelligence platform’s findings, Bitcoin investors collectively realized $3.5 billion in profits over the past 24 hours. This is one of the largest profit-taking days for BTC this year. Interestingly, long-term holders accounted for approximately $1.96 billion, or 56% of the realized gains, while short-term holders captured around $1.54 billion and accounted for the rest. The significant wave of profit realization, led predominantly by long-term holders, demonstrated how seasoned investors are seizing the opportunity to lock in gains as Bitcoin hit a fresh peak while still allowing room for fresh capital to enter.

Here's His First Move!","James Wynn, known for his high-leverage Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and altcoin transactions and known as the Hyperliquid (HYPE) whale, earned $100 million with the leveraged transactions he opened in recent months. But Wynn lost the $100 million just as easily as he had won it in late June, completely wiping out his money. Following a major loss, James Wynn's short position on Bitcoin went awry again a few days ago, losing all his money as Bitcoin continued to rise, surpassing $116,000. Wynn then changed his X profile to “bankrupt” and closed his account. The Hyperliquid Whale is Back! James Wynn's break didn't last long, and the Hyperliquid whale returned to the stock market. According to Lookonchain's post, Wynn first opened a long position in PEPE after a short break. Accordingly, the whale opened a long position in PEPE with 10x leverage. The position size was approximately $10,000, with an average entry price of $0.012 and a liquidation price of $0.0114. “James Wynn is back! After claiming the referral reward of 6,792.53 USDC, he took a long position on PEPE with 10x leverage. Following his long PEPE trade, James Wynn also opened a long position in Bitcoin (BTC). It was revealed that Wynn had opened a long position in Hyperliquid with 40x leverage. The position size was found to be $18,430,000, the entry price was $117,069, and the liquidation price was $115,554. “James Wynn deposited 468K USDC into Hyperliquid and opened another 40x leveraged long position on BTC.” James Wynn deposited 468K $USDC into #Hyperliquid and opened a 40x leveraged long on $BTC again.

2025-07-15T11:37:56,"Pi Network (PI) Bull Run Dead? Analyst Reveals the Breaking Point","TL;DR PI continues to struggle, with some analysts naming several reasons why its bull run could be over. Among the factors is the increased number of token unlocks. $10 Isn’t Happening Despite the pullback witnessed over the past several hours, the cryptocurrency market has been booming in the last week or so. Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of approximately $123,000, Ethereum (ETH) surged by 17% weekly to cross $3,000, while Ripple (XRP) briefly surpassed $3. Nonetheless, Pi Network’s PI did not follow the overall rally. It remains in red territory on a seven-day scale and currently trades at around $0.45 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its weak performance has drawn attention from some market observers who believe the asset’s bull run may be over. Recall that PI reached an ATH of roughly $3 towards the end of February, but since then, it has been on a steep decline. The X user pinetworkmembers support s the thesis that the token has no chance to post substantial gains during this bull cycle. “I would be the first one who would like to see PI at $10, but that isn’t happening this bull market,” they predicted. According to them, the coin’s price has hit lower lows on higher time frames, which shows weakness. The X user also noted that PI managed to rise only to $0.53 amid BTC’s explosion and later retraced well below $0.50. The analyst believes the asset’s downtrend is the result of “no presence of liquidity, increased amount of unlocks, low demand, low buy pressure, and a CT that keeps all the control in their hands instead of accepting the help from decentralized community devs.” It is worth noting that approximately 200 million PI tokens are scheduled for release over the next 30 days. The development doesn’t guarantee a mass exit, but it will allow investors to offload assets they have been waiting for a long time. PI Token Unlocks, Source: Piscan.io Lastly, the X user assumed that some might see PI’s downfall as “the end,” while others could interpret it as an opportunity to increase their exposure. The Flow to Exchanges The amount of PI tokens stored on crypto exchanges continues to rise. The netflow for the past 24 hours stands at almost 500,000 new coins, bringing the total number to over 385 million. Gate.io leads the way on that front, with approximately 181 million tokens, followed by Bitget with 134 million. Shifting from self-custody methods to centralized platforms is typically viewed as a bearish factor, as it increases the immediate selling pressure.
