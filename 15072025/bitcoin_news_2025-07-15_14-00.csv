In a press release shared with CryptoNews, the firm explains with this latest update Telegram’s 1 billion-plus users will gain direct access to Ethereum-based decentralized finance applications. 15+ top-tier DeFi protocols 50+ Integrations 1B+ Telegram users Full-stack DeFi on @ton_blockchain . Deep liquidity from Day 1. Kicking off DeFi Summer on Telegram Here’s what’s launching on Day 1 pic.twitter.com/PgZrNC1tv3 — TAC ( , ) (@TacBuild) July 15, 2025 The launch includes immediate integration of multiple DeFi protocols such as Morpho, Curve, Bancor, Euler, ZeroLend, IPOR Fusion, and Market.win. These applications will now be operational within the Telegram interface via TAC, a link to decentralized finance. The infrastructure aims to support both crypto-native and non-crypto-native users, This direct connection between Ethereum protocols and Telegram users positions TAC as a conduit for expanded access and usability. What is TAC Mainnet? TAC Mainnet is a new blockchain designed to connect Ethereum DeFi applications with Telegram’s 1 billion+ users. It allows Ethereum-based apps to run directly within Telegram, giving both crypto and non-crypto users access to decentralized finance tools. In short, TAC Mainnet is the bridge between Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem and Telegram’s user base, bringing crypto utility to mainstream messaging. According to the announcement the TAC Summoning campaign, organized alongside liquidity protocol Turtle Club, brought in over $800 million in total value locked (TVL). This early liquidity aims to prevent the usual slow uptake that affects many new blockchain projects, giving the mainnet functional depth from the outset. Structured Mainnet Deployment and Developer Integration TAC’s mainnet rollout has taken place in two phases. The Developer Mainnet, launched in June, allowed developers to deploy and test applications ahead of the full public release. This is followed by the Public Mainnet, now active, which allows Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) developers to launch decentralized applications. Security and scalability have been a main update through TAC’s integration with Babylon, which introduces Bitcoin staking. The firm explains that further technical support has also been formed through partnerships with infrastructure firms including LayerZero, RedStone, Blockscout, Dune, and Thirdweb. Wallet in Telegram Launches Multi-Asset Trading Earlier this year, the wallet in Telegram announced a number of latest updates to its crypto wallet, introducing multi-asset trading and permanent earn options. Updates include a dedicated Trade section, initially supporting assets like TON, BTC, and USDT, with more to follow.

In a new YouTube video , Jason Pizzino tells his 353,000 subscribers there is a “nice psychological level” for the overall crypto market cap at the $4 trillion point. The crypto market cap (TOTAL) currently sits at $3.646 trillion at time of writing and is down 1.39% in the past 24 hours. Pizzino notes that he’s been looking at 150% of the crypto market cap range in the bull market between late 2022 and the February 2024 high, projected off the August 2024 low. “It’s been working very, very well throughout the market. This is part of the analysis that we use to project price targets and support and resistance levels as well. And the next range we’re looking at is the 2022-2024 range, that 50% level, which often can be a resistance level, comes in at $3.8 trillion, so very close to the market action right now… Further up, looking at around $5.3 trillion. So we have $3.8 trillion, $4 trillion is the psychological, $4.7 trillion, then $5 trillion and $5.3 trillion.” Source: Jason Pizzino/YouTube Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at $118,828 at time of writing and set a new all-time high of $122,838 early Monday morning.

2025-07-15T11:44:03,"Ripple CTO Makes Big Clarity on Bitcoin and XRP Price","Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has offered a timely and thought-provoking perspective on recent developments in the crypto market, particularly XRP’s rise above the $3 mark and Ethereum’s reclaiming of $3,000. In a series of posts on X, Schwartz addressed the enthusiasm surrounding these price movements while urging the community to look beyond market speculation and focus on long-term utility. Price Milestones and Market Sentiment At the time of writing, XRP is trading at approximately $2.90, slightly below the $3 milestone it recently surpassed. The token’s move above $3 sparked a wave of excitement among investors, with some comparing its performance to Ethereum, which also climbed past $3,000. Responding to the buzz, Schwartz remarked, “It’s nice to see ETH over $3,000 again.” When asked about XRP’s price, he responded with measured optimism: “I always feel good when prices are high because I hate to think that people are losing money. But I’m truly not sure how much focus on price is the right amount, especially since price doesn’t seem to correlate very much with other good things like solving real-world problems.” A good analogy is XRP being used as a currency on the EVM sidechain. It's not a direct use of XRP on XRPL, but it's still part of the utility and value or XRP as a currency. Bitcoin is being used in far more places than just on the bitcoin blockchain itself. — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 14, 2025 Price vs. Real Value Schwartz went on to clarify that short-term price movements don’t always reflect an asset’s intrinsic value. “Price doesn’t seem to correlate with true value, utility, or ability to solve real-world problems in the short term. It’s certainly possible that it does over longer terms,” he explained. His comments serve as a reminder that real innovation and real-world adoption are what ultimately drive lasting value in crypto, not just market hype or temporary spikes. This view echoes Ripple’s mission to enable real-time, low-cost international payments powered by XRP. With use cases expanding in tokenization, settlement, and decentralized finance, XRP’s value proposition extends well beyond price charts. Bitcoin’s Role in a Multi-Layered Ecosystem In response to a question about Bitcoin’s current use case, Schwartz acknowledged the limited number of real-world problems that cryptocurrencies are solving today. However, he emphasized Bitcoin’s foundational strength. “The hope for Bitcoin is that its solid Layer 1 and early start will secure it a position as a currency of choice in an evolving digital asset ecosystem, even if most of its transactions don’t take place on Bitcoin’s Layer 1.” He stressed that Bitcoin can still derive significant value from its use across secondary layers, exchanges, and financial services platforms, despite the limitations of its base protocol. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Expanding Cross-Chain Utility Schwartz drew a parallel between Bitcoin’s off-chain utility and XRP’s evolving role across different blockchain environments. “A good analogy is XRP being used as a currency on the EVM sidechain. It’s not a direct use of XRP on XRPL, but it’s still part of the utility and value of XRP as a currency,” he explained. His point highlights XRP’s broader relevance in a multi-chain ecosystem where value and function extend beyond native networks. Whether used on XRPL, sidechains, or in cross-border liquidity flows, XRP continues to build momentum through real-world integration. XRP’s recent price surge above $3 marks an important psychological milestone for its supporters. But as Ripple’s CTO points out, price should not be the sole focus. Real value comes from solving problems, creating utility, and enabling new financial possibilities. Whether through Layer 1 innovation or cross-chain adoption, both XRP and Bitcoin are shaping a digital future that goes far deeper than daily price action.

2025-07-15T11:38:45,"Large Bitcoin Investors Realize $1.54 Billion in Profits but Rally Still Intact: CryptoQuant","Bitcoin’s climb above the coveted $120,000 level was short-lived, as the cryptocurrency pulled back to below $117,000 amidst renewed volatility. Over the past 24 hours, it declined by over 4%. On-chain signals reveal increased miner activity, which suggests short-term selling pressure. Miners Cashing Out? As the price approached new highs, the Miners’ Position Index (MPI) – which gauges the ratio of miner outflows to their one-year moving average – spiked to levels last seen during major sell-off periods. This means that some of them may have begun taking profits into strength, a pattern often seen when the MPI reading rises above 2, hinting at larger-than-usual Bitcoin outflows from miners to exchanges. While such moves can introduce short-term selling pressure, CryptoQuant explained that historical patterns indicate they do not always derail broader bullish trends when demand from other investor cohorts remains strong. At the same time, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, recorded net inflows of nearly 6,000 BTC between July 12 and July 14. This activity reversed a period of predominantly neutral or negative netflows. The sudden influx alongside the recent price rally points to potential arbitrage activity, derivative hedging, or preparations for large-scale transactions rather than outright panic selling. Considering all these factors together, the uptick in miner activity and increased exchange deposits mean that while some market participants are realizing gains, others may be positioning for continued price action. Amid these miner outflows and Binance inflows, Glassnode recorded one of the year’s largest profit-taking days. Bitcoin Logs One of Its Largest Profit-Taking Days According to the blockchain intelligence platform’s findings, Bitcoin investors collectively realized $3.5 billion in profits over the past 24 hours. This is one of the largest profit-taking days for BTC this year. Interestingly, long-term holders accounted for approximately $1.96 billion, or 56% of the realized gains, while short-term holders captured around $1.54 billion and accounted for the rest. The significant wave of profit realization, led predominantly by long-term holders, demonstrated how seasoned investors are seizing the opportunity to lock in gains as Bitcoin hit a fresh peak while still allowing room for fresh capital to enter.

2025-07-15T11:37:56,"Pi Network (PI) Bull Run Dead? Analyst Reveals the Breaking Point","TL;DR PI continues to struggle, with some analysts naming several reasons why its bull run could be over. Among the factors is the increased number of token unlocks. $10 Isn’t Happening Despite the pullback witnessed over the past several hours, the cryptocurrency market has been booming in the last week or so. Bitcoin (BTC) reached a new all-time high of approximately $123,000, Ethereum (ETH) surged by 17% weekly to cross $3,000, while Ripple (XRP) briefly surpassed $3. Nonetheless, Pi Network’s PI did not follow the overall rally. It remains in red territory on a seven-day scale and currently trades at around $0.45 (per CoinGecko’s data). Its weak performance has drawn attention from some market observers who believe the asset’s bull run may be over. Recall that PI reached an ATH of roughly $3 towards the end of February, but since then, it has been on a steep decline. The X user pinetworkmembers support s the thesis that the token has no chance to post substantial gains during this bull cycle. “I would be the first one who would like to see PI at $10, but that isn’t happening this bull market,” they predicted. According to them, the coin’s price has hit lower lows on higher time frames, which shows weakness. The X user also noted that PI managed to rise only to $0.53 amid BTC’s explosion and later retraced well below $0.50. The analyst believes the asset’s downtrend is the result of “no presence of liquidity, increased amount of unlocks, low demand, low buy pressure, and a CT that keeps all the control in their hands instead of accepting the help from decentralized community devs.” It is worth noting that approximately 200 million PI tokens are scheduled for release over the next 30 days. The development doesn’t guarantee a mass exit, but it will allow investors to offload assets they have been waiting for a long time. PI Token Unlocks, Source: Piscan.io Lastly, the X user assumed that some might see PI’s downfall as “the end,” while others could interpret it as an opportunity to increase their exposure. The Flow to Exchanges The amount of PI tokens stored on crypto exchanges continues to rise. The netflow for the past 24 hours stands at almost 500,000 new coins, bringing the total number to over 385 million. Gate.io leads the way on that front, with approximately 181 million tokens, followed by Bitget with 134 million. Shifting from self-custody methods to centralized platforms is typically viewed as a bearish factor, as it increases the immediate selling pressure.

The 11th largest token closely followed the BTC price rally, which surged past $122,000 , marked highs close to $50, but failed to surpass the psychological barrier. As the token is experiencing a pullback, the question arises whether the bears will maintain significant pressure over the token. If this happens, will HYPE price fail to enter the top 10 cryptos? What’s Driving the HYPE Price Surge? Hyperliquid has been attracting significant attention in the past few days, due to which it is one of the trending tokens. The volume over the platform has been rising consistently since the last week of May, which points towards the growing confidence of the investors. With the rise in trading activity, Hyperliquid became the top blockchain in terms of revenue during the last month, surpassing Tron, Base, Solana and the giant, Ethereum. On the other hand, the open interest has also surged over $10 billion, validating a rise in the traders’ participation. According to the data from Coinalyze, Binance and Bybit hold the largest share of the open interest. The OI is rising along with the rise in the price, and hence it suggests the traders are buying into the price rise and support the bullish trend. How High Can the Hyperliquid Price Go in 2025? The HYPE price has recently hit a new ATH very close to $50 at $49.84, which has kept the market momentum extremely high. The token experienced a small pullback but has remained stuck close to the highs, above $47. This suggests the bulls continue to remain in control and hence the price is due for a massive rise. The current price action HYPE suggests the token is within a bullish range as the RSI remains stuck along the upper threshold. Moreover, the rally has risen above the trend line of the FIB extensions, which suggests it may resume with a strong upswing. The price could reclaim $50 anytime from now, as the BTC price gains strength. Once the token secures this range, the next target for the Hyperliquid price could be around $61. When Will Hyperliquid Enter the Top 10 To enter the top 10 cryptos, Hyperliquid must surpass Cardano’s market capitalization, which is over $25 billion, compared to the $15.75 billion market cap of Hyperliquid. There is a huge gap between these ranges, which could make it a tedious job. However, if the Open Interest continues to rise, then there is the possibility of a continued upswing, which may unlock higher targets.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/apart-from-bitcoin-this-popular-altcoin-also-marked-a-new-ath-will-it-enter-the-top-10/,"TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS","Price Analysis|Altcoins",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T11:30:39,"XRP Countdown Begins—Analyst Predicts Explosive Run To $11","In his June 14 video analysis, the market commentator CryptoInsightUK argued that XRP is on the verge of a “parabolic expansion” reminiscent of its performance in late 2017, contending that a price of $11 per token is attainable this cycle once Bitcoin finishes its latest impulse leg. The analyst built his case on a blend of historical fractals, liquidity-mapping, and derivatives-market data, concluding that “people are under-estimating where XRP is going to go this cycle.” Is $11 XRP Inevitable? CryptoInsightUK opened the session by noting that Bitcoin had just logged the highest weekly close in its history and that the total crypto-asset market capitalisation had set a record: “We got the highest ever close for total market cap as well now, and I’m looking to see this expansionary period.” With Bitcoin pushing into a “deep area of liquidity” on the daily chart but not yet reaching the next concentration of sell-side orders, he believes the set-up mirrors the early-November 2024 breakout that preceded a six-day, 31 percent surge. “Bitcoin’s done most of its move in the six days following the breakout,” he recalled, overlaying that sequence on today’s structure to infer that a similar window could open imminently. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Signal That Last Time Preceded A 464% Rally, Analyst Says For XRP, the key inflection lies a few cents above the psychological $3 mark. On the 15-minute chart, he observed that “XRP is starting to build some strong liquidity above us… up to about 3.10,” describing that overhead cluster as potential fuel for a decisive push. Although the token briefly touched $3.03 in intraday trading, repeated attempts have stalled just below resistance. The analyst juxtaposed this behaviour with the way XRP lagged Bitcoin during the 2024 breakout: the coin “stalls out a little bit” while Bitcoin rips, then “really catches up,” moving from roughly $0.70 to $2.70 in nineteen days, before extending to $3.30. Translating that fractal forward, he warned: “It’s not going to be exactly the same, but if it’s six to ten days [for Bitcoin]… what happens next? Altcoins take over.” He bolstered the thesis with derivatives metrics. During the last XRP rally, a flip from negative to positive contract premium coincided with a sharp rise in open interest. That pattern is repeating: “Premium actually went green… on an increase in open interest and that is happening again now.” Funding rates remain subdued, implying that shorts still constitute a meaningful share of outstanding positions; as price pressure builds, those shorts could be “squeezed to the downside,” providing what he called “really aggressive price action to the upside… pretty soon probably for XRP.” In his base case, an explosive move would coincide with Bitcoin reaching roughly $125,000, at which point capital rotation would funnel into XRP and other large-capitalisation altcoins. Related Reading: Pundit Reveals The Two Things That Will Drive XRP Price To All-Time Highs On higher-time-frame charts, the weekly close in the XRP/BTC pair reclaimed levels not seen since early March and printed what the analyst dubbed a “lovely green weekly candle,” propelling the pair through the resistance band tracked by trader CredibleCrypto’s so-called “Gandalf line.” XRP dominance, he argued, has completed a Wyckoff-style accumulation: the “sign of strength” and “last point of support” suggest a new up-leg is underway. Technical momentum is corroborated by a bullish cross forming in the XRP/ETH ratio on the weekly relative-strength index. The analyst conceded that timing remains uncertain and that elevated contract premiums can foreshadow long-side liquidation cascades, yet he maintained that the interplay between resurgent spot buying, rising open interest, and building liquidity clouds above $3 creates a self-reinforcing backdrop for a squeeze higher. “That is what I expect will come at some point,” he said, framing a breach of the all-time high as a trigger for acceleration toward his $11 objective. At press time, XRP traded at $2.8671.

A recent KPMG and AIMA (Alternative Investment Management Association) report emphasizing the realness of this demand found that nearly 91% of hedge funds were either already invested in crypto or planned to invest in it in the next five years. Biconomy also revealed that over 135 public firms included Bitcoin on their balance sheets. The institutions jointly controlled over 848K BTC, with BlackRock’s IBIT ETF holding 700K BTC. Blockware estimated that 36 more public companies plan to join the trend by the end of this year, an increase of about 25%. Rene Michau, StanChart’s Global Head of Digital Assets, said the bank’s new offering is available during trading hours in Europe and Asia. Michau also claimed bragging rights that the bank is the first traditional financial institution to offer crypto trading. “We define institutional clients as financial institutions such as asset managers and investors, and large multinational companies who are clients of our corporate and investment banking division.” – Rene Michau , Global Head of Digital Assets at Standard Chartered StanChart also disclosed that the new service integrates its existing trading platforms, allowing institutional clients to settle trades through the bank’s in-house FCA-approved custodial services. Customers also have the option to choose their preferred custodian(s). The focus will remain on BTC and ETH spot trading before expanding to other crypto assets. Crypto becomes foundational in financial services The Standard Chartered group’s CEO claims crypto is a “foundational element” of financial service evolution. He added that digital assets enable greater inclusion, growth, and new innovative pathways across the industry. StanChart previously announced that it had secured licensing to offer regulated crypto custodial services in the UAE (last September) and Luxembourg (last January). A representative of the multinational bank said the institution is currently focused on investment banking clients and corporates, with no solid plans to extend beyond this scope. The bank’s Global Head of Trading and XVA, Tony Hall, also claimed that the financial institution is well-positioned to meet its clients’ needs while capturing the industry’s opportunities. StanChart’s new service is built on its regulated banking infrastructure, integrating a strong balance sheet and institutional-grade controls for risk management.

2025-07-15T11:30:08,"Altcoin Season Ignites as Ethereum Outperforms and Bitcoin Dominance Fades","The post Altcoin Season Ignites as Ethereum Outperforms and Bitcoin Dominance Fades appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets are heating up, and all signs point to the start of a full-blown altcoin season. With Bitcoin holding above its all-time highs and money rotating into smaller-cap tokens, traders are witnessing a shift in momentum. Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, the Altseason Index is flashing early signals , and Bitcoin dominance is weakening, all classic signs that a major alt rally is underway. Crypto analyst Altcoin Gordon takes a deep insight and reveals that window of opportunity is open now, not in Q4, and he’s backed his claim with five strong technical charts. Also Read : Cardano Price Pauses After Breakout, But Bullish Structure Holds Altseason isn’t coming. It’s here. You either position yourself now… or become exit liquidity in Q4. 5 charts that prove the biggest Altseason just began: pic.twitter.com/ALUWJfB3N2 — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 14, 2025 Golden Cross Ignites Big Moves Another bullish signal comes from the altcoin market cap (excluding Ethereum). Here, the MACD indicator has formed a “golden cross” for the first time this year, a signal that led to a month-long surge back in November 2024. At that time, Ethereum hit $4,000, XRP reached new highs , and many mid-cap alts also hit 10x, suggesting history may repeat itself. Bitcoin’s Weekly Strength Triggers Momentum Shift Gordon notes that Bitcoin has already closed two consecutive weeks above its previous all-time high (ATH), and a third could seal the deal. If BTC closes this week strongly, altcoins are expected to “enter turbo mode,” especially with Crypto Week kicking off in Washington and pro-crypto regulations in discussion. Bitcoin Slips, Alts Climb Bitcoin dominance dropped from 66% to 64% even as BTC reached new highs, confirming capital is shifting toward altcoins. Gordon points out that when the Altseason Index climbs above 35, it often marks the turning point before mainstream investors pile in, and that’s exactly what just happened. When the index later exceeds 80, the big gains have usually already occurred. With the index breaking that 35 threshold, Gordon argues that altcoin season is off to an early and promising start. Well-known analyst TechDev believes altcoins have been suppressed for four years and are now ready to rally. Similarly, Michaël van de Poppe calls this the best entry point for altcoins, expecting profits to unfold over the next 12 to 24 months. Ethereum Shows Relative Strength to BTC Last but not least, Gordon highlights that the ETH/BTC ratio’s weekly RSI has broken a three-year downtrend, and a golden cross is also forming. These technical shifts suggest Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin , which often happens when altseason accelerates. In short, with technical indicators flashing green, Bitcoin dominance softening, and institutional sentiment shifting, altcoin season might not just be on the horizon, it could be here already.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/altcoin-season-ignites-as-bitcoin-dominance-fades/,"BTC|ALTCOIN|ETH|TRADING|MARKET","News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T11:24:06,"U.S. interest in buying Bitcoin spikes 76% in one month","Amid Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) ongoing rally to a new all-time high, interest in buying the cryptocurrency has surged across the United States, particularly over the past month. Specifically, search interest for the phrase “buy bitcoin” jumped by 76% in 30 days. On June 15, the search index stood at 49. It climbed to 90 by July 15, reaching a peak of 100 on July 14, according to Google Trends data retrieved by Finbold. One-month search interest in ‘buy Bitcoin’ in U.S. Source: Google Trends Regionally, the highest search volumes came from the District of Columbia, followed by New Hampshire, Nevada, New Jersey, and Washington, highlighting strong interest across the Northeast and West Coast. The surge in public interest tracks closely with Bitcoin’s price action . In this case, over the past month, BTC gained around 10%, briefly topping $123,000. The spike in searches likely reflects growing retail curiosity, with fear of missing out (FOMO) setting in as prices soared. However, such sentiment can be risky, especially in a volatile market like crypto, where quick corrections are common. Bitcoin price analysis At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $116,945, down more than 4% in the past 24 hours, though still up 5.5% on the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The pullback snapped a seven-week winning streak and came as technical indicators, including a Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) above 70, signaled overbought conditions. Analysts also noted that profit-taking likely contributed to the decline. Additionally, geopolitical tensions have added to the selling pressure. Particularly, Bitcoin slid alongside global markets after President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Russia to end the Ukraine war within 50 days, sparking a broader risk-off mood. At the same time, the news triggered $140 million in Bitcoin liquidations and a 3.43% drop in total crypto market cap, mirroring similar declines seen in June amid U.S.-China tensions. Adding to the volatility, a long-dormant Bitcoin whale, who had held 80,000 BTC since 2011, transferred 18,643 BTC, worth approximately $2 billion, to Galaxy Digital on July 15. While not confirmed as a sale, large whale transfers have previously preceded sharp market swings.

2025-07-15T11:20:59,"Rethinking CONY As Coinbase Rallies - Tactical Use, Not Income Plan","Summary Coinbase's recent momentum, Deribit acquisition, and regulatory clarity have strengthened its outlook, supporting a bullish-to-cautiously-bullish stance on the stock. CONY's option income strategy consistently underperforms in flat or rallying markets, offering limited downside protection and capping upside potential. Tactically, CONY suits investors seeking cautious exposure to Coinbase or opportunistic short-term income, but direct COIN ownership offers higher potential returns. Given CONY's structural flaws and risk profile, I maintain a Hold rating, with tactical use cases only for risk-tolerant, short-term investors. Since I last wrote on the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ), Coinbase Global ( COIN ) has rallied by 95%. Coinbase has acquired Deribit , expanding into high-volume crypto derivatives. Coinbase's payments launch has strengthened its non trading revenue. The crypto world is also starting to see clearer legislation like the GENIUS and Clarity Acts. A lot has happened, and Coinbase's positioning now will have a lot of bearing on how CONY works out from here. In my last article, I had mainly talked about the structural deficiencies of CONY as a long-term market-agnostic income vehicle. It is a smoother alternative to owning Coinbase at best, and therefore Coinbase's moves in the last couple of months make for a review of what to expect from CONY now. The Option Layer's Workings A recap of the frailties of the option strategy and the alpha it brings. I have compared how CONY's total returns (i.e., yields included and reinvested in CONY) have fared in almost one and a half years of net zero movement in the underlying - Coinbase. Remember, by definition, the strategy is theoretically supposed to capture the premiums, as income and total returns should be ideally higher than the underlying in this case. However, what we see is that CONY's total returns are 9% down when overall Coinbase has been flat. That is the real-life alpha of the option layer. The net zero path of Coinbase has obviously been volatile, and so is expected. We cannot expect a really smooth flat market graph in which scenario CONY may outperform and deliver the alpha it is designed to deliver in flat markets. In fact, from my observations of other income ETFs' behavior, I can tell you that even if the volatility has been in the case of CONY, you may see the drawdown a little better for CONY, but the elusive alpha is not usually seen, even if markets overall remain flat - CONY's theoretically strong territory. Data by YCharts The upside cap is a feature of the strategy, not a bug, but I still highlight how Coinbase (or most underlying assets for that matter) will usually move up in sharp short bursts rather than a smooth, stable, slow-up move spread over months. In just 2-3 months, the gap in performance in CONY is huge. CONY investors may be led to believe in such markets that CONY is working, but it is Coinbase that has worked, and you have actually not captured the deserved upside for riding all the risks when it was down or flat. Data by YCharts So, CONY is acceptable in a rally in the underlying, but you may have ridden Coinbase for that with greater returns. Flat markets, we have seen how CONY underperforms in reality (but may match in some other era or Coinbase regime, but alpha is not easy). So, does CONY become the tactical asset for a correction? It does show a lower drawdown than Coinbase, but hardly by 4 percentage points over a two and a half month period. For those who are expecting the difference to be magnified proportionately if the fall is steeper, the fact is it won't. The option strategy by design is great at capping upsides, as seen before, but the downside protection is limited to a fixed amount - that is, the premium earned per month - usually ~2% depending on the volatility levels. Data by YCharts Coinbase Fundamentals Clearly, I struggle to see why an income-seeking investor would not ride Coinbase instead of CONY, with almost all of the same risks, but pick up far less if Coinbase rallies. That leaves me only with potential tactical uses for CONY. Here again, its only use case is when a correction is due, where you might gain a few percentage points of outperformance in CONY. Flat markets are also not a stronghold for CONY. So where does Coinbase stand today? The momentum right now is very strong, and the rally may very well continue. Bitcoin has gained heavily (~25% since I last wrote about CONY and ~55% from the April lows). Record inflow into bitcoin ETFs has reduced bitcoin supply and pushed up prices. Below I have plotted IBIT AUM over IBIT prices to get an indicative bitcoin ownership explosion trajectory. A 25-30% jump in inflows is seen in the last 2-3 months alone. And there are other Bitcoin ETFs to account for far higher Bitcoin demand - enough to pressure supply and drive up prices further. Data by YCharts Bitcoin as a hedge is also supportive as equity markets await the next move after recovery from the April lows and another bout of tariff-related news. Importantly, the Clarity for Digital Tokens Act and GENIUS Act have clarified when a digital asset transitions from a security to a commodity, helping firms like Coinbase operate without fear of sudden SEC enforcements. These laws establish a clear path for token registration, exemption, and transition, reducing uncertainty for the Bitcoin ecosystem. In addition to the Bitcoin bullishness, Coinbase has added its own set of fundamental triggers that materially strengthen its position. Most notably, the Deribit acquisition, instantly becoming the global leader in crypto options, gaining access to over 80% of BTC and 94% of ETH options market share. This significantly expands Coinbase’s institutional derivatives offering and adds a high margin revenue stream. Coinbase has also launched its USDC-based payments platform, enabling stablecoin checkout for merchants via integrations with Shopify and Stripe. This moves Coinbase further into the infrastructure layer of global crypto payments and helps diversify revenue beyond trading. Analyst ratings also reflect the bullish view on Coinbase. Only 2 of 33 Wall Street ratings in the past 90 days have been a Sell (and only 1 in 14 from Seeking Alpha analysts ). The Seeking Alpha quant rating does show a more conservative Hold on the back of valuation concerns and earnings downgrades - probably cautious of the timing impact of the new developments' adoption to the monetization cycle. I take that as an input to remain cautious (which is always the case with Coinbase), but remain fairly bullish on Coinbase tactically, as Coinbase is largely a momentum stock, and that remains in its favor until the trend breaks. Case for CONY With a bullish to cautiously bullish outlook for Coinbase, here is how CONY fits in tactically. Investors who are comfortable with owning Coinbase and have a fear of heights can use CONY now to ride a cautious bullish stance. If Coinbase rallies further, such positions will gain. Although such gains will be far lower than entering Coinbase directly, it is still better than not entering due to fear of heights. This is a use case I call handholding Coinbase entries. If there are corrections, investors can choose to enter Coinbase at 4-5% lower prices than they would have paid for now. A psychological edge - somewhat like a Wheel strategy. For more aggressive income-minded investors, comfortable with the risks of timing Coinbase rallies, entry now is tactically supported. This use case is what I call a low-touch opportunistic income strategy. Low touch because CONY's high yields will re-risk exposure to the underlying fairly quickly, and investors do not need to look beyond 6-12 months to earn almost all their investments as yields. As long as they believe in the bullish Coinbase thesis for the tactical short term of 6–12 months, this play will return great yields that can be deployed elsewhere. However, it is risky. If it works, investors will completely de-risk themselves and still keep a small bit of invested capital on the table to ride Coinbase the CONY way. For conservative income-focused investors, the risks far outweigh the benefits. First there is a Coinbase thesis that needs to be bought into (not only equity risk but bitcoin and high volatile equity risk - the highest end of the spectrum). Then there are the structural shortcomings of the CONY strategy that need perfect scenarios to work out. I rate CONY still a Hold, but the Coinbase positioning now opens up a few tactical use cases for investors with a risk appetite.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801285-rethinking-cony-as-coinbase-rallies-tactical-use-not-income-plan?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC|TRADING","CONY|COIN",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T11:20:44,"Spot Ethereum ETFs See Historic $259M Inflow Surge","BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETFs See Historic $259M Inflow Surge The digital asset landscape is buzzing with exciting news that underscores a significant shift in mainstream finance. U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs have just recorded a monumental milestone, pulling in a staggering $259 million in net inflows on July 14th. This isn’t just a fleeting moment of interest; it marks the seventh consecutive day of positive flows, signaling a growing wave of institutional confidence and a powerful endorsement of Ethereum as a formidable investment asset. Understanding Spot Ethereum ETFs: A Gateway to Innovation For those navigating the complexities of the cryptocurrency market, understanding what a Spot Ethereum ETF represents is crucial. Essentially, a spot Ethereum ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Ethereum (ETH) as its underlying asset. Unlike futures ETFs, which track the price of Ethereum futures contracts, a spot ETF aims to provide investors with direct exposure to the current market price of ETH without the need to actually buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies access, reduces custodial risks, and makes investing in Ethereum as straightforward as buying shares in a traditional stock market. The introduction and rapid adoption of these investment vehicles are transformative. They bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto economy, offering a regulated and familiar pathway for institutional investors and retail traders alike to gain exposure to Ethereum. Ethereum itself is more than just a digital currency; it’s the foundational blockchain for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Its utility and innovation are key drivers of its value, making it a compelling asset for long-term portfolios. Decoding the Historic Surge in Ethereum ETF Inflows This recent surge, which saw Ethereum ETF inflows reach $259 million on a single day, paints a clear picture of escalating investor interest and conviction. The data from Farside Investors highlights not only the magnitude of the inflows but also the broad participation across various issuers. Let’s break down the contributions: BlackRock’s ETHA: Leading the charge with a substantial $151.4 million in inflows, BlackRock’s strong market presence and reputation continue to attract significant capital. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Garnered $43.8 million, indicating a healthy appetite for Grayscale’s new, potentially more accessible offering. Fidelity’s FETH: Pulled in $31.4 million, showcasing Fidelity’s growing influence in the digital asset space. Bitwise’s ETHW: Added $11.2 million, demonstrating continued interest in diversified crypto investment products. Grayscale’s ETHE: Saw $8.9 million, suggesting ongoing conversion and interest in its flagship Ethereum product. VanEck’s ETHV: Contributed $6.6 million. Franklin Templeton’s EZET: Recorded $5.7 million. The fact that this marks the seventh straight day of positive flows underscores a powerful and consistent trend. It suggests that these inflows are not merely speculative, but rather indicative of sustained demand from a diverse range of investors who are strategically allocating capital to Ethereum via these new ETF products. This consistent influx of capital provides a strong foundation for Ethereum’s market stability and growth. What’s Fueling This Remarkable ETH ETF Performance? Several factors are converging to drive this impressive ETH ETF performance . Understanding these catalysts is key to appreciating the broader implications for the crypto market: Regulatory Clarity and Approval: The landmark approval of spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a game-changer. This regulatory nod provides a stamp of legitimacy that many institutional investors require before committing significant capital. It reduces perceived risk and opens doors for funds and asset managers who previously faced compliance hurdles. Growing Institutional Confidence: Large financial institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers are increasingly recognizing the long-term potential of digital assets. Ethereum, with its robust ecosystem and deflationary tokenomics (post-Merge), presents a compelling investment thesis. ETFs offer them a familiar, regulated, and liquid vehicle to gain exposure without dealing with the complexities of direct crypto custody. Market Maturity and Infrastructure: The crypto market has evolved significantly, building more robust infrastructure, security measures, and liquidity. This maturity makes it a more attractive and less volatile environment for large-scale investments, contrasting with its earlier, more nascent stages. Diversification Benefits: For many traditional portfolios, adding exposure to digital assets like Ethereum offers diversification benefits. Cryptocurrencies often exhibit low correlation with traditional asset classes, which can help reduce overall portfolio risk and potentially enhance returns. The Broader Impact on the Crypto ETF Market The success of these new Ethereum products has significant implications for the wider Crypto ETF market . Following the successful launch and substantial inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the strong performance of Ethereum ETFs further validates the demand for regulated crypto investment products. This trend suggests a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly integrated into mainstream financial portfolios. The availability of both spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs means investors now have diversified options within the crypto sector, allowing them to choose exposure to the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization through familiar investment vehicles. This accessibility is likely to attract a new wave of capital from investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto space directly. Furthermore, the positive reception of these ETFs could pave the way for other single-asset crypto ETFs or even multi-asset crypto ETFs in the future, further expanding the market’s reach and sophistication. Navigating Institutional Crypto Adoption: Opportunities and Challenges The increasing trend of institutional crypto adoption through ETFs presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges for investors and the market as a whole. Opportunities: Enhanced Liquidity: As more institutional capital flows into ETFs, the underlying assets (like Ethereum) gain deeper liquidity, making the market more stable and less prone to extreme price swings. Mainstream Acceptance: ETFs act as a bridge, legitimizing crypto assets in the eyes of traditional finance and the broader public, fostering greater trust and understanding. Accessibility for All: Retail investors can also benefit from these products, gaining exposure to Ethereum through their brokerage accounts, often with lower minimums and simpler processes than direct crypto purchases. Diversification and Growth Potential: For portfolios seeking exposure to high-growth, innovative sectors, Ethereum offers a unique opportunity, distinct from traditional equities or bonds. Challenges: Market Volatility: While ETFs offer a regulated wrapper, the underlying asset (Ethereum) remains subject to significant price volatility. Investors should be prepared for potential fluctuations. Regulatory Evolution: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. While ETF approvals are a step forward, future regulations could impact the market. Education is Key: Despite the ease of access, investors should still understand the fundamentals of Ethereum, its use cases, and the risks involved before investing. For investors considering these new opportunities, actionable insights include conducting thorough due diligence on the specific ETF product, understanding its fee structure, and aligning the investment with their personal risk tolerance and financial goals. A long-term perspective is often beneficial when investing in nascent but promising asset classes like digital currencies. A New Era for Ethereum Investment The impressive $259 million in net inflows into U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs on July 14th, coupled with a seven-day streak of positive flows, marks a pivotal moment for the crypto industry. It signals growing institutional confidence and mainstream acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate investment asset. This surge in interest, driven by regulatory clarity and the increasing maturity of the crypto market, is not just about numbers; it represents a significant step towards the broader integration of digital assets into global financial systems. As these ETFs continue to gain traction, they are poised to unlock new avenues for investment and reshape how both institutions and individuals engage with the future of finance.

2025-07-15T11:15:00,"Bitcoin Euphoria Cools as Whales Wake Up: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin's (BTC) bull run stalled, with prices falling 5% from the record high in a classic bull-market pullback. The adverse price action took the wind out of the broader market, too, though exceptions like BONK and PUMP — up 5% on a 24-hour basis — bucked the trend. The pullback was characterized by long-dormant BTC whales moving coins to centralized exchanges, often a precursor to a sale. According to blockchain sleuth Lookonchain, an OG wallet with 80K BTC moved about half to Galaxy Digital, which then deposited 6,000 BTC into Binance and Bybit. The on-chain flow occurred after BTC notched Monday's record high above $123,000. ""A spike in Coin Days Destroyed metric and a rise in large exchange inflows suggest potential profit-taking. Yet despite the historic sell pressure, bitcoin has remained resilient, reinforcing confidence in sustained institutional support and strong structural market demand,"" Tagus Capital said in a market update.

Meanwhile, inflows into spot ETH ETFs rose to $259 million from $204 million. Valentin Fournier, the lead research analyst at BRN, called the slowdown in bitcoin inflows a sign of weaker buyer conviction at elevated levels. Today's consumer price index and Wednesday's producer price index could set the tone for the next price move, he said. ""Elevated inflation expectations due to tariffs could rattle investor confidence. However, a positive surprise in the data could help calm the current sell-off,"" he noted. Other analysts focused on the House of Representatives votes on the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, which, if passed, could accelerate broader institutional participation in the crypto market beyond bitcoin. In other news, Coinbase's shares hit a record high of $398.50 Monday, with its market cap surpassing $100 billion. According to Arkham Intelligence, SharpLink Gaming bought an additional 24,371 ETH. In traditional markets, the Japanese 30-year government bond yield briefly rose to 3.20%, matching the multi-decade high set in May. The MOVE index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility in the U.S. Treasury market, turned up from a long-held support, warning of renewed turbulence in bonds. Stay alert.

PUMP began trading at $0.00756 and soon began to feel the pressure, sliding to as low as $0.051 before settling at $0.0056. The ICO price was $0.004, meaning that investors has an opportunity to quickly flip the tokens for a profit, creating a wave of selling pressure. The token debut coincided with a decline across the wider crypto market, with bitcoin (BTC) losing 4% as it slipped to $117,000 from $123,000, while ether (ETH) and sol (SOL) fell 2% and 4.7%, respectively. Crypto exchange Binance also made an attempt to take the limelight, announcing the release of its own token launcher that will rival Pump.fun. Derivatives Positioning Open interest in XRP futures hit all-time highs alongside record activity in BTC futures, both pointing to elevated price volatility ahead. Funding rates for major coins are holding above an annualized 10%, suggesting bullish market sentiment. The reading, however, is far from signaling overheated conditions typically seen at market tops or record high prices. The cumulative volume delta for the top 25 coins for the past 24 hours is negative, a sign of sellers becoming more aggressive. The pullback might deepen in the short-term. Risk reversals tied to short-term BTC and ETH options now show a bias for protective puts, which is common during price declines. The long-end remains bullish.

2025-07-15T11:13:56,"$PUMP Token Launched with $5.6B Market Cap after $500M ICO: What Will $SNORT Do?","Pump Fun, the Solana-based meme coin launchpad, recently debuted its own token, $PUMP, which reached a staggering $5.6B market cap on the very first day of trading. At the time of writing, the market cap sits around $5.04B . The Initial Coin Offering (ICO) lasted just 12 minutes on July 12, raising $500M by selling 125B tokens, reaching a $4B valuation in the process. While many initially called this valuation excessive, the explosive listing has largely silenced those concerns. This historic launch not only validates the potential of meme coin infrastructure projects, but also signals the beginning of another major rally in the meme coin space, especially on Solana. If you’re looking to ride the next wave, Snorter Token ($SNORT) deserves your attention. $PUMP’s Pump Proves the Next Meme Coin Bull Run Is Brewing The pre-market valuation was even higher, peaking at $7.2B, according to recent coverage by DeFi information platform The Defiant. The token’s perpetual futures ranked third in volume on Hyperliquid, trailing only $BTC and $ETH, and that, too, with just 3x leverage. $PUMP currently dominates Solana’s meme coin mindshare, commanding 28.47% of the ecosystem. It’s closely followed by $PENGU, which holds a 23.08% share. It’s also worth noting that: Whales showed strong interest in the $PUMP ICO. While the average spend was around $44,209, the median was just $550. Over 200 wallets accumulated at least $1M worth of $PUMP. Since its launch in early 2024, Pumpfun’s revenue has grown steadily , now sitting at around $630M, with the 30-day revenue alone at $6.1M. Lastly, the total number of cumulative addresses on the platform has also surpassed 20M. This explosive demand and performance underline a clear market signal: investor appetite for the best meme coins and altcoins is back in full force. A token launchpad achieving this level of traction only strengthens the belief that the next meme coin bull run is just around the corner. With one viral meme coin after another launching on Solana, it’s time to look at a new trading bot that could actually help you capitalize on these pumps. Enter one of the newest projects around: Snorter Token ($SNORT) . What is Snorter? So, what is Snorter ? In short, Snorter is a new Telegram-native trading bot built to offer retail meme coin traders on Solana a seamless and secure experience, equipping them with all the tools needed to make a killing in the markets. For example, Snorter Bot comes with automated sniping, allowing users to place buy/sell limit and stop orders, which the bot then executes at lightning speed, automatically. This gives retail traders the ability to snipe liquidity in new meme coins – in other words, to buy tokens as soon as liquidity arrives, positioning themselves just before potential pumps. It’s worth noting that the first pumps in new meme coins are often the most profitable, and until now, institutional players have been the ones eating up that early liquidity using advanced trading tools. Snorter levels the playing field. At launch, Snorter Bot will only be compatible with Solana, though it’ll soon expand support to Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, and Base. How Snorter’s Security & Simplicity Set It up for Success The current crypto landscape is unfortunately rife with scams and theft. But Snorter features airtight security, covering virtually every nook and corner. In addition to independently verifying each token before allowing users to trade it, Snorter also comes equipped with front-running protection and advanced detection mechanisms to sniff out honeypots and rug pulls. Additionally, the bot is also capable of protecting you against sophisticated MEV (or sandwich) attacks, which are often used by other bockchain bots to manipulate transaction order and extract profits at the trader’s expense. Despite being laced with high-end features, Snorter remains one of the easiest-to-use trading bots out there. As mentioned above, it’s built natively on Telegram, meaning you can simply interact with it (place buy/sell orders, copy trades from crypto pros, and even manage your portfolio) through the app’s chat interface. No need for complicated dashboards or clunky browser extensions. Buy $SNORT to Ride This Trading Bot’s Market Adoption Snorter is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growing crypto footprint, particularly in the meme coin segment, where demand for reliable trading tools is only set to increase. You can be part of Snorter Bot’s rising momentum by purchasing Snorter Token ($SNORT) , the platform’s native cryptocurrency. The token is currently in presale, with over $1.8M raised in early investor funding so far. And right now, one $SNORT is available for a low price of $0.0983. The best part? Our Snorter Token price prediction suggests that it could be the next crypto to explode , potentially surging 1,850% to hit $1.92 by 2026. If this is your first crypto presale purchase, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $SNORT . And for additional information on the project, check out its whitepaper .

The user, who mined the cryptocurrency during the earliest days of the industry — a period known as the Satoshi era after the pseudonymous bitcoin creator — sold 9,000 BTC ($1 billion) via Galaxy Digital, Lookonchain posted on X. Users with particularly large amounts of BTC, known as whales, have the ability to move the market when they buy or sell bitcoin because of the substantial number of tokens involved. Satoshi-era bitcoin whales are closely monitored by traders for market signals, particularly when the BTC in their wallets has not moved for a number of years. The Satoshi era refers to a loose period of between 2009 and 2011 when bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, was active in the community and BTC was generally priced in cents. The world's largest cryptocurrency fell from Monday's high, dropping below $117,000 . Such a slide is quite common following a surge as many users sell coins to bank some profits.

2025-07-15T11:10:39,"Galaxy Digital’s Astonishing Bitcoin Deposits: What This Means for BTC Price and the Crypto Market","BitcoinWorld Galaxy Digital’s Astonishing Bitcoin Deposits: What This Means for BTC Price and the Crypto Market The cryptocurrency world is currently abuzz with intense speculation following a series of significant on-chain movements. At the heart of this unfolding drama is Galaxy Digital , a prominent crypto financial services firm, whose recent substantial Bitcoin deposits to centralized exchanges have sent ripples through the digital asset community. This intriguing development gains even more weight when considered alongside the awakening of a long-dormant crypto whale , whose massive transfer preceded Galaxy Digital’s actions. What do these powerful transactions truly signify for the broader crypto market , and how might they influence the immediate and long-term trajectory of BTC price ? The Unfolding Drama: What Did Galaxy Digital Do? In a move that caught the attention of on-chain analysts, Galaxy Digital executed a series of noteworthy transactions. According to insights from Odaily, leveraging data from Arkham, the firm deposited 260 Bitcoin (BTC) to various centralized exchanges (CEXs) within a remarkably short span of just 30 minutes. This wasn’t an isolated event, but rather a chapter in a larger, more complex narrative. Crucially, this action by Galaxy Digital occurred shortly after a monumental transfer from a wallet that had been inactive for an astonishing 14.3 years. This particular address, a relic from Bitcoin’s early days, previously held over 80,000 BTC. It transferred a staggering 9,000 BTC to an address that on-chain sleuths have confidently linked to Galaxy Digital . Further adding to the intricate web of transactions, the firm also separately sent 280 BTC and 250 BTC to two other distinct addresses, indicating a multi-faceted approach to their recent movements. Key Transactions in Focus: 260 BTC Deposited to CEXs: Directly by Galaxy Digital, signaling potential liquidity provision or selling intent. 9,000 BTC Received from Dormant Whale: A 14.3-year-old wallet transferred funds to a Galaxy Digital-associated address. This is a rare and significant event. 280 BTC & 250 BTC Sent to Other Addresses: Additional transfers by Galaxy Digital, suggesting internal rebalancing or further strategic deployments. These precise and substantial movements, meticulously tracked by on-chain analytics platforms, provide a rare glimpse into the operational mechanics of major institutional players in the crypto space. They compel us to ask: what strategic imperatives drive such actions, and what implications do they hold for the volatile world of digital assets? Why Do These Bitcoin Deposits to Crypto Exchanges Command Attention? The transfer of large quantities of Bitcoin to crypto exchanges is always a significant event for market observers. It’s often interpreted as a precursor to selling, as exchanges are the primary venues where users convert their digital assets into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies. However, the full picture is more nuanced, especially when an institutional player like Galaxy Digital is involved. Understanding the Mechanics: When BTC flows into exchanges, it typically increases the available supply on order books. If this increased supply is met with insufficient demand, it can exert downward pressure on the BTC price . This is a basic principle of supply and demand dynamics in any market. For retail investors, a large deposit might indeed signal an individual preparing to liquidate their holdings. However, for institutions, the motivations can be far more complex: Liquidity Provision for OTC Desks: Firms like Galaxy Digital operate robust over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks. These desks facilitate large block trades for institutional clients, often without impacting the public order books of centralized exchanges. However, to fulfill these large orders, the firm needs readily available liquidity, which might necessitate moving BTC to an exchange wallet for efficient execution or settlement. Market Making Activities: Institutions often act as market makers, simultaneously quoting buy and sell prices to facilitate trading and earn from the bid-ask spread. This requires holding substantial inventories of assets on exchanges to ensure they can meet client demands quickly. Hedging Strategies: In a volatile market, large firms might move assets to exchanges as part of a broader hedging strategy to manage risk exposure, especially if they have derivatives positions. Custodial Services: While less likely for direct CEX deposits, some movements could relate to client custody solutions where assets are being prepared for a specific transaction or re-allocation. Historically, significant inflows to exchanges have often preceded periods of increased volatility or price corrections. However, differentiating between a simple sell-off and a sophisticated institutional maneuver is key to accurate market interpretation. The involvement of a firm like Galaxy Digital leans heavily towards the latter, suggesting a strategic, rather than panic-driven, action. The Enigmatic Whale: A Blast from Bitcoin’s Past Perhaps the most captivating element of this story is the reawakening of the long-dormant crypto whale . A wallet that has remained untouched for 14.3 years represents a true relic of Bitcoin’s nascent days. These ‘Satoshi-era’ wallets, often containing coins mined or acquired when Bitcoin was virtually worthless, hold immense historical and financial significance. Why Dormant Whale Movements Matter: Rarity and Historical Value: Very few wallets from Bitcoin’s early years remain inactive. Their activation is a rare event that instantly captures the attention of the entire crypto ecosystem. These coins are often associated with early miners or true believers who held onto their assets through countless cycles. Potential for Massive Market Impact: The sheer volume of BTC held by such whales means that any significant movement, let alone a transfer of 9,000 BTC (worth hundreds of millions of dollars at current prices), has the potential to cause significant ripples. The primary concern is always a large-scale sell-off that could flood the market and crash the BTC price . Mystery and Speculation: Who owns these wallets? Is it an individual, a group, or perhaps even an early exchange’s cold storage that was forgotten? The transfer to a Galaxy Digital -linked address, while not fully revealing the owner, strongly suggests an institutional or high-net-worth individual engaging a professional service. Psychological Effect: The mere fact that a long-dormant whale has moved funds can trigger a psychological response in the market. It can instill fear, as investors worry about potential selling, or it can spark curiosity and a renewed focus on Bitcoin’s early history and long-term holding potential. Past instances of dormant whale movements have indeed caused temporary market jitters. However, in many cases, these transfers were for reasons other than immediate selling, such as moving funds to new custody solutions, engaging in OTC deals, or consolidating holdings. The link to Galaxy Digital in this instance points strongly towards a managed, strategic decision rather than a random, isolated event. Galaxy Digital’s Strategic Play: Decoding the Institutional Mindset Galaxy Digital , founded by the visionary Mike Novogratz, stands as a diversified financial services and investment management company dedicated to the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. Understanding their business model is crucial to interpreting their recent actions. Galaxy Digital’s Business Lines & Potential Motivations: The firm operates across several key verticals, each of which could necessitate large Bitcoin deposits and transfers: Trading: This includes sophisticated quantitative trading, over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and market making. Receiving 9,000 BTC from a whale and subsequently moving 260 BTC to CEXs could be a classic OTC transaction, where Galaxy facilitates a large trade for a client without putting pressure on public exchanges. They might then use the CEX deposits for hedging or to rebalance their own books. Asset Management: Galaxy manages various investment vehicles and funds that hold digital assets. Transfers could be related to fund rebalancing, redemption requests, or strategic portfolio adjustments. Investment Banking: They advise and execute transactions for clients in the crypto space, which might involve large asset transfers as part of mergers, acquisitions, or capital raises. Mining: While less directly related to these specific transactions, their involvement in the mining sector means they have deep operational knowledge of large-scale BTC movements. Given Galaxy Digital’s multifaceted operations, their actions are unlikely to be impulsive. Instead, they are typically part of a well-thought-out strategy. This institutional involvement often means that even if assets are moved to exchanges, they might not immediately be sold into the open market. They could be used for derivatives trading, collateral for loans, or simply to provide liquidity for large private trades. The fact that a prominent, regulated entity like Galaxy Digital is involved lends a layer of legitimacy and structure to these otherwise potentially alarming whale movements, differentiating them from arbitrary, retail-driven selling. Navigating the Ripples: Potential Impact on BTC Price and Market Sentiment The ultimate question on everyone’s mind is, of course, what does this mean for the BTC price ? While no single event dictates the market’s direction, large institutional and whale movements certainly contribute to the overall sentiment and liquidity dynamics. Interpreting the Price Impact: Short-Term Volatility: Any news of large Bitcoin deposits to crypto exchanges can induce short-term volatility as traders react to the perceived increase in selling pressure. Algorithmic trading systems are also programmed to respond to such on-chain signals. Bearish Interpretation: The most immediate, often knee-jerk, reaction is that these deposits signal an impending sell-off, which would naturally drive the BTC price down. This fear is amplified by the sheer size of the transfers and the awakening of a long-dormant whale. Neutral/Bullish Interpretation: A more nuanced view, especially given Galaxy Digital’s involvement, suggests these are likely OTC deals or market-making activities. In this scenario, the direct impact on exchange spot prices might be minimal or even positive in the long run, as it signifies healthy institutional liquidity and activity in the crypto market . It could even be interpreted as a whale choosing to offload a portion of their holdings to a reputable firm, which then manages the sale in a structured manner, preventing market shock. Market Psychology: Regardless of the underlying intent, the public knowledge of such large transfers can influence market psychology. If the narrative shifts towards these being strategic institutional moves, it can reinforce confidence in Bitcoin’s growing maturity and institutional adoption. Conversely, if fear takes hold, it could lead to a temporary dip. It’s crucial to remember that the BTC price is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological developments, and broader investor sentiment. While on-chain data provides valuable insights, it’s just one piece of a very complex puzzle. Investors should avoid making hasty decisions based solely on these movements and instead consider the broader context. Empowering Your Crypto Journey: Actionable Insights from On-Chain Events In a dynamic and often unpredictable crypto market , staying informed and understanding the underlying mechanics of large-scale movements is paramount. For both seasoned and novice investors, here are some actionable insights derived from events like Galaxy Digital ‘s recent activities: Practical Steps for Investors: Master On-Chain Analytics: Tools like Arkham Intelligence, Glassnode, and CryptoQuant offer invaluable transparency into the blockchain. Learning to interpret metrics like exchange inflows/outflows, whale movements, and miner flows can provide early signals of potential market shifts. This empowers you to move beyond mere price charts and understand the fundamental supply and demand dynamics. Differentiate Between Retail and Institutional Flows: Not all large transfers are created equal. Understand that institutional movements, especially those involving reputable firms like Galaxy Digital, often have different implications than a sudden surge of retail deposits. Institutions frequently engage in OTC deals, market making, or strategic rebalancing that may not directly translate to immediate selling pressure on spot markets. Adopt a Holistic View: Never rely on a single data point. Combine on-chain analysis with macroeconomic indicators (inflation, interest rates), technical analysis (chart patterns, indicators), and fundamental analysis (project developments, regulatory news). A comprehensive approach leads to more robust decision-making. Practice Prudent Risk Management: The inherent volatility of the crypto market means that even the most insightful analysis can be overtaken by unexpected events. Always invest only what you can afford to lose, diversify your portfolio across different assets, and set clear stop-loss and take-profit levels. Avoid emotional trading reactions to sudden news. Stay Patient and Long-Term Focused: While short-term movements can be captivating, Bitcoin ‘s history is defined by its long-term growth trajectory. Major institutional involvement, even if it causes temporary ripples, often signifies growing adoption and maturation of the asset class, which are positive indicators for long-term holders. By integrating these insights into your investment strategy, you can navigate the complexities of the crypto market with greater confidence and make more informed decisions, rather than reacting purely to fear or hype. The Grand Tapestry of the Crypto Market: A Concluding Perspective The recent confluence of Galaxy Digital ‘s strategic Bitcoin deposits to crypto exchanges and the dramatic awakening of a long-dormant crypto whale serves as a powerful reminder of the intricate and evolving dynamics within the digital asset landscape. These events underscore the increasing sophistication of institutional participation, moving beyond mere speculation to encompass complex financial strategies like OTC trading, market making, and sophisticated portfolio management. While the immediate impact on BTC price will continue to be a subject of intense debate and real-time market reactions, the broader narrative points towards a maturing ecosystem. The transparency offered by on-chain data allows us to peer into the movements of even the largest players, offering unparalleled insights into the forces shaping supply, demand, and sentiment. As the crypto market continues its journey towards mainstream adoption, understanding these institutional flows will become an increasingly vital skill for anyone seeking to thrive in this exciting frontier of finance.

2025-07-15T11:06:28,"Will Solana Price Hold $152 or Is $179 Still in Play?","The post Will Solana Price Hold $152 or Is $179 Still in Play? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana saw its price tumble 4.66% over the last 24 hours, now holding ground at $159.74. This price action followed a $400 million liquidation cascade, which was triggered by large Bitcoin sell-offs. While leveraged ETF approvals were expected to bring institutional inflows, they also raised near-term volatility concerns that unsettled altcoin traders. As SOL navigates a decisive resistance zone, technical and on-chain signals indicate conflicting cues about what’s next. Join me as I derive the possible Solana price prediction for the short term. Active Addresses Paint a Bullish Backdrop While the price went south, Solana’s daily active addresses have been on a strong uptrend, currently standing at ~16.93 million. As the chart shows, user activity on the Solana network rebounded sharply after July 5 and has consistently climbed ever since. Source: Santiment This growing on-chain numbers indicates rising adoption and usage, which often comes before price recoveries. It highlights that the recent correction may be liquidity-driven rather than fundamentally bearish, offering bulls a reason to stay optimistic. Solana Price Analysis: On the 4-hour chart, SOL faces immediate resistance at the $165–$168 range. It is a zone that coincides with the 24-hour high of $168.34 and the upper Bollinger Band. SOL’s price action shows multiple rejections from this level, making it a critical barrier for bulls to reclaim. It is worth noting that a successful breakout above $168 could trigger the Solana price to rally toward $179.77 . However, if SOL fails to sustain support above $158, it could slide further to test the $152.5 zone, which is a key psychological and technical support. FAQs Why is Solana price falling today? SOL price fell due to broader market liquidations driven by Bitcoin whale activity, amplified by ETF-related volatility concerns. What do Solana’s active addresses indicate? Active addresses have climbed to 16.93M, suggesting healthy network usage and potential for price recovery. Where is SOL price heading next? The key breakout point for SOL price is $168, failure to reclaim it could result in a drop toward the $152.5 support.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/will-solana-price-hold-152-or-is-179-still-in-play/,"TRADING|SOL|BTC|MARKET|ALTCOIN","Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-07-15T11:01:45,"Macro Analyst Reveals Why XRP Fails to Hold $3","XRP’s recent surge past the $3 threshold was a significant moment for holders and market observers alike, as the token briefly touched $3.02 before facing a swift pullback. While many attributed this retracement to typical market resistance or profit-taking, macro analyst Versan of Black Swan Capitalist presents a deeper, more controversial perspective. According to him, XRP’s consistent struggle to maintain levels above $3 isn’t a result of weak fundamentals but a product of deliberate suppression rooted in the asset’s disruptive potential. XRP’s Brief Flirtation with $3 On July 14, XRP broke above the $3 mark for the first time in years, reaching an intraday high of $3.02. However, this breakout was short-lived. Within 24 hours, the price dropped sharply by nearly 8%, falling to $2.78 before rebounding to the $2.90 range. $XRP can’t even stay above $3, not because it lacks value, but because it threatens everything. It ends the fraud. Exposes the system. That’s why it’s suppressed. That’s why it still follows Bitcoin’s 4-year debt cycle. When it decouples from the shadow market… it’s over. — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) July 14, 2025 This sharp correction coincided with heightened anticipation for the upcoming launch of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF, scheduled for July 18. Analysts believe institutional players may have offloaded positions near $3 in anticipation of market volatility ahead of the ETF debut, locking in gains while retail excitement peaked. Despite the sell-off, on-chain data revealed that accumulation resumed quickly. Wallet activity remained high, and open interest in XRP futures stabilized, indicating that the pullback was likely a temporary reset rather than a breakdown of bullish momentum. Deliberate Suppression or Market Mechanics? Versan’s argument centers on the idea that XRP’s real value remains intentionally obscured. He claims XRP represents an existential threat to legacy financial institutions and centralized intermediaries. In his words, “It ends the fraud. Exposes the system.” From this standpoint, XRP is not just a digital asset; it is a tool capable of dismantling opaque and inefficient financial infrastructure. This assertion is supported by XRP’s unique positioning in global finance. Unlike most cryptocurrencies, XRP is engineered for real-time settlement and cross-border liquidity . It’s already being piloted or adopted by several financial institutions worldwide. However, its association with ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny, particularly from the SEC, has slowed its full institutional integration. To Versan, these barriers aren’t just procedural; they are strategic moves to delay what he describes as the inevitable collapse of the outdated financial order. The Role of Bitcoin’s Four-Year Cycle Another point raised by Versan is XRP’s continued correlation with Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle. Despite XRP’s utility-based model and enterprise adoption, its price behavior still mimics Bitcoin’s boom-and-bust rhythm. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Versan attributes this to a broader market structure designed to keep XRP tethered to speculative assets, such as Bitcoin, rather than allowing it to move independently based on its fundamental value. In his view, only when XRP decouples from Bitcoin and “the shadow market” will it be free to reflect its true worth. The Road Ahead: ETF Launch, Accumulation, and Price Outlook The upcoming ProShares XRP Futures ETF is expected to serve as a key catalyst. While the recent pullback suggested cautious positioning ahead of the launch, XRP’s recovery above $2.85 signals that institutional and retail buyers remain confident. Analysts now watch for a decisive close above $3.10, which could unlock a move toward higher resistance levels near $3.60 and beyond. Meanwhile, on-chain activity remains robust. Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently identified what he called a “compound fulcrum” pattern in XRP’s chart, predicting a potential 60% rally toward $4.47. Whale accumulation has also increased, and address activity has soared to levels not seen since March, adding further weight to the bullish thesis. XRP’s inability to hold above $3 is not a reflection of weakness but a symptom of larger systemic forces at play, at least according to macro analyst Versan. His analysis suggests that XRP is caught in a tug-of-war between its revolutionary potential and the inertia of a financial system desperate to maintain control. With rising adoption, strong on-chain metrics, and the looming ETF launch, XRP appears poised at a tipping point. Whether it finally escapes the gravitational pull of Bitcoin’s cycle and legacy market suppression may determine if the next break above $3 will be short-lived or the beginning of a new era.

2025-07-15T11:00:34,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unveiling a Crucial $135K Target Before Expected Correction","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Prediction: Unveiling a Crucial $135K Target Before Expected Correction The cryptocurrency market is a whirlwind of innovation, speculation, and groundbreaking predictions. Few assets capture the world’s attention quite like Bitcoin, the pioneering digital currency. As investors and enthusiasts eagerly watch its movements, a significant forecast has emerged from a reputable source, suggesting an exhilarating ascent followed by an anticipated cool-down. Are you ready for the next phase of Bitcoin’s journey? Understanding the Bold Bitcoin Price Prediction from Fairlead Strategies In the dynamic world of financial analysis, few voices carry as much weight as those from independent research firms. Katie Stockton, the visionary founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, recently made headlines with a compelling Bitcoin price prediction . As reported by Cointelegraph on X, Stockton conveyed to CNBC her belief that BTC is poised for a significant rally, potentially reaching an impressive $135,000 in the medium term. Fairlead Strategies is renowned for its technical analysis approach, which involves studying past market data, primarily price and volume, to identify patterns and predict future price movements. Stockton’s insights are not based on mere speculation but on rigorous chart analysis and proprietary indicators that have proven effective in various markets. This makes her projection particularly noteworthy for anyone tracking the BTC market analysis . But what exactly does ‘medium term’ signify in this context? While specific timelines are rarely set in stone, in financial markets, ‘medium term’ typically refers to a period ranging from a few months to a year or more. This suggests that the journey to $135,000 might not be instantaneous but rather a sustained upward trend driven by underlying market forces and continued investor interest. What Drives the Optimism Towards a $135,000 Target? Reaching a six-figure valuation like $135,000 for Bitcoin is an ambitious target, yet it’s not without its foundational support. Several factors could contribute to such a powerful surge, aligning with the technical indicators Fairlead Strategies likely observes: Halving Event Impact: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC entering the market, have preceded significant bull runs. The most recent halving occurred in April 2024, and its full effects on supply-demand dynamics often play out over the subsequent 12-18 months. Institutional Adoption: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds are now able to gain exposure to Bitcoin more easily, leading to substantial inflows. This increased demand from sophisticated investors provides a robust foundation for price appreciation. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: A shift in global monetary policy, such as potential interest rate cuts by central banks, could make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive. When traditional investments offer lower returns, investors often seek higher-growth opportunities in the digital asset space. Network Effects and Utility: Beyond speculation, Bitcoin’s underlying technology continues to evolve, with improvements in scalability, security, and integration into various financial products. The growing utility and acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value and a medium of exchange contribute to its long-term appeal. Stockton’s analysis likely factors in these broader market dynamics alongside specific technical patterns, such as breakout levels, Fibonacci extensions, and momentum indicators, which suggest the path of least resistance is currently upwards. The Inevitable Reality: Why a Crypto Correction is Expected While the prospect of Bitcoin hitting $135,000 is exhilarating, Stockton’s forecast comes with a crucial caveat: following this peak, she anticipates BTC will enter a crypto correction phase. This isn’t a pessimistic outlook but rather a realistic acknowledgment of market cycles. All financial markets, especially volatile ones like cryptocurrencies, move in waves of expansion and contraction. What is a market correction? A correction is typically defined as a rapid decline of 10% or more from a recent peak. For highly volatile assets like Bitcoin, corrections can often be much steeper, sometimes exceeding 30-50%. These pullbacks are a natural and often healthy part of a bull market for several reasons: Profit-Taking: After a significant rally, early investors and traders will naturally take profits, selling their holdings to lock in gains. This selling pressure contributes to a downward movement. Market Rebalancing: Corrections help to shake out ‘weak hands’ – investors who bought purely out of FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and are quick to sell at the first sign of trouble. This allows the market to rebalance and consolidate before the next leg up. Cooling Overheated Sentiment: Extended rallies can lead to irrational exuberance and an overheated market. A correction brings a dose of reality, tempering speculative fervor and allowing prices to find more sustainable levels. Technical Reset: From a technical analysis perspective, corrections often involve retesting previous support levels, filling gaps, or resetting overbought indicators, preparing the asset for its next upward move. Historically, Bitcoin has experienced numerous corrections, even during its most impressive bull runs. For instance, during the 2017 bull market, Bitcoin saw multiple pullbacks of 30% or more on its way to its then-all-time high. Similarly, the 2021 bull run also featured significant corrections. These events are not necessarily signs of a market collapse but rather necessary pauses in a larger uptrend. Navigating the Digital Asset Forecast: Actionable Insights for Investors Understanding Stockton’s dual prediction – a massive rally followed by a correction – offers valuable insights for both seasoned and novice investors. Preparing for both scenarios is key to prudent investment strategy in the volatile world of digital asset forecast . For Those Holding Bitcoin: Consider Profit-Taking Strategies: If Bitcoin approaches the $135,000 target, or a level you deem significant, consider taking partial profits. This could involve selling a small percentage of your holdings to secure gains, while still maintaining exposure to potential further upside. Set Stop-Loss Orders: To protect your capital during a potential correction, consider setting stop-loss orders below key support levels. This automatically sells your Bitcoin if it drops to a predetermined price, limiting your downside. Rebalance Your Portfolio: A significant increase in Bitcoin’s value might make it an oversized portion of your overall investment portfolio. Rebalancing involves selling some Bitcoin to invest in other assets, maintaining your desired asset allocation and reducing concentration risk. Stay Informed, Not Emotional: During a correction, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) can be rampant. Stick to your long-term investment thesis and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price movements. For Those Looking to Buy Bitcoin: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, which is notoriously difficult, consider investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging, averages out your purchase price over time and can be effective in volatile markets. Prepare for the Dip: If you believe a correction is coming, having capital ready to deploy during a downturn can be a strategic move. Buying during a correction allows you to acquire more Bitcoin at a lower price point. Research Entry Points: Use technical analysis tools (or follow reputable analysts) to identify potential support levels where Bitcoin might bounce after a correction. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin is highly volatile. Only invest what you can afford to lose and ensure your investment aligns with your personal risk tolerance. Broader BTC Market Analysis: Beyond a Single Prediction While Katie Stockton’s prediction provides a compelling outlook, it’s essential to place it within the broader context of BTC market analysis . Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a multitude of factors, not just technical indicators. These include: Global Economic Climate: Inflation and Interest Rates: In periods of high inflation, Bitcoin is sometimes viewed as a hedge due to its finite supply. However, rising interest rates can make riskier assets less attractive as safer investments yield better returns. Geopolitical Events: Global conflicts or political instability can drive investors towards or away from perceived safe havens, including Bitcoin. Regulatory Developments: Government Stance: Regulatory clarity or crackdowns in major economies can significantly impact market sentiment and institutional participation. Taxation: Changes in tax laws related to cryptocurrencies can influence investor behavior. Technological Advancements and Adoption: Layer-2 Solutions: Developments like the Lightning Network improve Bitcoin’s scalability and usability for everyday transactions, increasing its utility. Integration into Traditional Finance: As more financial products and services incorporate Bitcoin, its legitimacy and accessibility grow. Stockton’s prediction, therefore, serves as a significant data point within a much larger, complex ecosystem. It highlights a potential trajectory based on technical strength, but investors must remain vigilant to the ever-changing landscape of macroeconomics, regulation, and technological innovation. The Credibility Factor: Why Fairlead Strategies Matters In a market often characterized by hype and speculation, the insights from firms like Fairlead Strategies offer a beacon of data-driven analysis. Katie Stockton’s long-standing reputation in financial markets, coupled with Fairlead’s focus on independent, objective research, lends significant weight to their digital asset forecast . Independent research firms typically operate without the conflicts of interest that can sometimes influence analysis from institutions that also engage in trading or investment banking. Their primary goal is to provide unbiased insights to their clients, empowering them to make informed decisions. This commitment to objectivity is crucial when navigating the often-turbulent crypto waters. Moreover, technical analysis, when applied rigorously, can cut through the noise of daily news and social media chatter. It focuses on the pure supply and demand dynamics reflected in price action, which often anticipates fundamental changes or reactions to news events. This systematic approach is what makes Fairlead Strategies a respected voice in the financial community. Conclusion: Preparing for Bitcoin’s Next Big Move Katie Stockton’s bold prediction of Bitcoin soaring to $135,000 before an anticipated correction paints a clear picture of the exciting yet challenging road ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. It underscores the incredible potential for growth that still exists within the digital asset space, while also serving as a vital reminder of market realities. As investors, the key is not just to celebrate potential highs but to also prepare for the inevitable ebb and flow of the market. Understanding that corrections are a natural, healthy part of any bull cycle allows for strategic planning rather than reactive panic. Whether you’re a long-term HODLer or an active trader, staying informed, practicing disciplined risk management, and diversifying your portfolio will be crucial in navigating Bitcoin’s journey towards and beyond the $135,000 mark. The future of Bitcoin promises continued volatility, but also unparalleled opportunities for those who are prepared.

2025-07-15T10:57:47,"Ripple News : Is It the Right Time to Buy XRP?","The post Ripple News : Is It the Right Time to Buy XRP? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Search interest in “Buy XRP” is rising sharply, just as the XRP community gears up for the launch of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 18 . With the token already up more than 445% over the past year, many are wondering if now is the right time to get in. But looking at past trends, spikes in search volume have often followed big rallies, not preceded them, raising doubts about whether this is a good entry point. Why XRP Price Is Down Today Despite Proshares ETF Launch ? Google Trends Spike: “Buy XRP” Back on the Radar According to Google Trends, global searches for “Buy XRP” have climbed to a score of 32 out of 100 on a five-year scale the highest level in recent months. However, this is still far below the December 2024 peak , when search interest was near its highest levels ever. Interestingly, back in November 2024 , the XRP price delivered an explosive 281.7% monthly return . But by the time search interest peaked in December, the price gains had slowed to just 6.94% . This illustrates a classic pattern in crypto markets: retail interest often surges after the rally, not before . So while search spikes may indicate increased curiosity, they don’t necessarily confirm a fresh breakout. Should You Buy XRP Now? This is the most searched question right now: Is this the right time to buy XRP? Historical data suggests that when fewer people were searching “Buy XRP,” the best gains occurred . Between mid-2022 and late 2023, search activity remained low, yet XRP quietly delivered outsized returns. In Q3 2022, XRP gained 44.5% . The first quarter of 2023 saw a dramatic turnaround, with the token jumping from -29.2% to +58.8% . By the end of 2023, XRP had delivered 82.5% growth , and in 2024, it added another +235.7% . These figures suggest that the best opportunities often appear when the crowd is quiet , not when search interest is peaking. XRP Price Performance: What’s Happening Right Now? At the start of July, XRP traded around $2.17 . It has since surged nearly 33% , hitting a high of $3.02 on July 14. Over the past 7 days, the price is up 26.5% , but a modest 2.7% dip in the last 24 hours shows that institutional investors may be taking profits ahead of the ETF launch . Still, there are signs of stability and possible re-entry from larger players, especially in the $2.82 to $2.87 price zone . This could hint at accumulation, or just temporary relief buying. How XRP Stacks Up Against Top Cryptos XRP’s 445.8% growth over the past year stands out sharply when compared to its peers. Bitcoin gained 86.3% , BNB rose 21.1% , and Ethereum declined by 10.9% . Even Solana, often seen as a strong altcoin, only posted a 4.5% gain in the same period. This outperformance highlights XRP’s unique momentum, which may be fueled by ongoing institutional interest, legal clarity, and upcoming ETF exposure. Is XRP A Good Investment ? Search spikes don’t always lead to price spikes. When retail FOMO kicks in, smart money is often already taking profits. So, the current rise in “Buy XRP” searches may reflect growing interest, but not necessarily signal a fresh rally. That said, if you’re buying for the long term, not just chasing short-term gains, this could still be a reasonable time to enter, especially with the ETF launch approaching and strong institutional momentum behind XRP.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-it-the-right-time-to-buy-xrp-ripple/,"XRP|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BNB|BTC","News|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP)",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T10:57:36,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 15, 2025","After several days of significant increases and new all-time highs, the crypto market is down today. The vast majority of the top 100 coins per market cap have dropped over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 6.7% to $3.74 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $217 billion, nearly double that of yesterday. TLDR: The crypto market sees a pullback; 95 of the top 100 coins dropped today; BTC fell below $117,000, while ETH dropped below $3,000 mark; Market sentiment sits firmly in the greed zone; Both US BTC and ETH spot ETFs recorded inflows, with the latter performing better; ”In terms of juice in the Bitcoin tank, it feels like there’s still plenty left”; ”This isn’t hype, it’s confirmation that Bitcoin is here to stay.” Crypto Winners & Losers As the market experiences a pullback, all top 10 coins per market cap have dropped since this time yesterday. Bitcoin (BTC) is down 4.4%, decreasing back below the $117,000, now trading at $116,999. This is also the second-highest drop in this category. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 1.4% and below the $3,000 mark. It’s currently changing hands at $2,986. The highest decrease in this category is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s is 7.6%. It now trades at $0.1919. Tron (TRX) fell the least. It’s down 1.2% to $0.2992. Looking at the top 100 coins, we find that five are green.

It’s down 9.3% to $1.63. XDC Network (XDC) is in the second place, having dropped 8.9% to the price of $0.07409. This drop is neither surprising nor exceptional. Decreases tend to follow market surges, particularly those that lead to new ATHs. Pullbacks are typical, which is why investors are not panicking. Meanwhile, coinciding with the drop in prices, a long-dormant wallet linked to a “Satoshi-era whale” transferred a whopping 17,000 BTC to Galaxy Digital .

Despite geopolitical instability, inflation, and financial uncertainty, it has remained unfazed, acting as a kind of economic anomaly.” We are seeing its core use case as a store of value and hedge during uncertain times playing out in real time, he adds. “So, in terms of juice in the Bitcoin tank, it feels like there’s still plenty left. That said, while [the latest] sharp upward momentum isn’t likely to last forever, it might still continue for a while longer.” Meanwhile, the US provided most of the favourable fuel for this latest run. This included bipartisan support, ETF inflows, increasing institutional adoption, and expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. Despite pullbacks or consolidation near ATH levels, “macro headwinds like rising debt, sticky inflation, and geopolitical tension continue to erode confidence in TradFi. From my perspective, Bitcoin’s role as a scarce, maturing, and in-demand asset has never been clearer,” Toledano says. Moreover, Seamus Rocca, CEO of Xapo Bank, commented that BTC surged 14.65% over the past week, hitting a fresh ATH, while investors poured more than $2.7 billion into Bitcoin ETFs, marking the fifth-largest weekly inflow since their launch in January 2024. “This isn’t hype, it’s confirmation that Bitcoin is here to stay.” Rocca continued. BTC surpassed Amazon to become the world’s fifth-largest asset by market cap. “A structural six-figure bottom looks as though it is starting to take shape, and the asset is now firmly positioned alongside the giants of traditional finance. With inflows like we’ve seen in the last week, Bitcoin is no longer on the fringe; it’s part of the global financial system, and the question now is what role it will play in shaping its future.” Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $116,999. In comparison, at this time yesterday, it stood at $122,273. The day’s highest point was $122,838, with the price dropping since. Notably, this daily high was also the latest all-time high for the coin. Bitcoin Price Chart. Source: TradingView Katie Stockton, a crypto analyst and founder at Fairlead Strategies , argues that Bitcoin will reach $135,000 in the medium term . This “seemed pretty aggressive a few days ago, maybe now a little less so.” Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $2,986. The coin rose to the intra-day high of $3,074 nearly 24 hours ago, then decreasing to $2,942, before recovering slightly to the current level. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-listed crypto infrastructure firm Bit Digital announced plans to raise $67.3 million through a direct offering of 22 million ordinary shares aimed at institutional investors. The goal is to use the proceeds to buy Ethereum and expand the company’s growing ETH treasury. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment did not move since yesterday, still sitting in greed territory. The Fear and Greed Index is again 70 today , the highest it’s been in more than a month. Unsurprisingly, given today’s pullback, this greed may signal that the market is overheated and ready for a correction.

They saw inflows of $297.4 million , significantly lower than $1.03 billion and $1.18 billion recorded on the two prior trading days. BlackRock saw the highest share of this amount, taking in $394.71 million. While Grayscale , Bitwise , and VanEck saw minnow inflows, Fidelity and Ark & 21Shares saw outflows. US ETH ETFs also saw inflows for the seventh days in a row, with $259.04 million on 14 July. This is higher than $204 million seen on Friday. Seven of the nine funds saw positive flows, while none saw outflows. BlackRock recorded the majority of this amount again: $151.45 million. Grayscale follows with $43.79 million. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered launched spot trading services for Bitcoin and Ether through its UK branch. “As client demand accelerates further, we want to offer clients a route to transact, trade and manage digital asset risk safely and efficiently within regulatory requirements,” said group chief executive Bill Winters. Moreover, Kazakhstan’s national bank plans to move part of its gold and foreign exchange reserves, along with National Fund assets, into digital asset-related investments. Kazakhstan plans to allocate part of its national reserves to crypto assets and set up a national crypto reserve for confiscated assets, while exploring state-owned enterprises’ involvement in mining. https://t.co/KsrtgpATUe — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 14, 2025 Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market has seen a decrease over the past 24 hours. However, the US stock market closed on Monday with some uptick. For example, the S&P 500 is up by 0.14%, the Nasdaq-100 increased by 0.33%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.2%. The stocks went up as investors had some time to digest the latest tariff threats coming from the US. Additionally, they are awaiting earnings reports and economic data set to be published this week. Is this dip sustainable? A dip is both expected and typical following a significant market surge and new all-time highs. Analysts argue that there is still room for additional growth this year.

2025-07-15T10:56:28,"10 firms bought 550k ETH worth over $1.6 billion in 30 days","The race to accumulate Ether as a treasury asset is heating up with more than ten companies buying 550,000 ETH worth $1.65 billion in the last 30 days. Crypto entrepreneur Kyle Reidhead disclosed this on X. According to Reidhead , who is co-owner of crypto newsletter Milk Road, this highlights the massive demand for Ether as more companies continue to pivot to the ETH treasury playbook. The move to adopt ETH as a treasury asset is inspired by what Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has done with Bitcoin. While over 100 companies have bought BTC for their treasury, others are turning to other crypto assets, including ETH. Reidhead noted that this is still in the early stages, with more companies looking to get involved, while those involved also want to buy more ETH. Thus, he expects the accumulation rate to only increase in the coming months. He said: “There are new $ETH treasury companies launching every week (sounds like the biggest is yet to come), and each company is looking to buy more $ETH than they did the previous week. So if the last 30 days is $1.65 billion, then will the next month be $2B and then $3B after that?” However, he acknowledged that demand will eventually slow down, but added that that will not come anytime soon, given that ETH treasury companies are still in their early stages. Reidhead also noted that ETH treasury companies do not sell, unlike exchange-traded funds, at least for now, and expect their accumulation to impact ETH performance. Sharplink is now the biggest ETH holder after accumulation spree Interestingly, the Milk Road founder highlighted Sharplink Gaming as one of the biggest buyers of ETH, noting that the company has bought 75,000 ETH in the past five days alone. Sharplink’s most recent purchases only continue a trend that has seen it become the biggest ETH holder. The company, which became an ETH treasury company in early June, has already spent over $700 million on buying Ether in less than two months. Its latest purchase was 24,371 ETH bought from Coinbase Prime less than 24 hours ago for $73 million. Sharplink latest ETH purchase (Source: Onchain Lens). With its accumulation, Sharplink ETH holdings are now above 290,000 ETH, more than enough to flip the Ethereum Foundation as the biggest Ether holder. The Foundation holds around 242,000 ETH and recently sold 10,000 ETH to Sharplink. Meanwhile, Sharplink is not the only company on an ETH accumulation spree. Bitmine Immersion has also been buying, with the company holding over 163,000 in ETH, while former Bitcoin miner BitDigital has more than 100,000 ETH after converting its Bitcoin to ETH. Interestingly, there appears to be a healthy competition between the top ETH treasury companies, with executives of those companies praising the accumulation rate of one another. Sharplink chairman Joe Lubin described the group as “The League of Extraordinary ETH Accumulator Gentlemen” and praised Tom Lee of Bitmine, San Tabar of Bit Digital, and Charles Allen of BTCS. He added that competition and coordination between the companies will strengthen and improve them. ETH slips 2% to fall below $3k again Meanwhile, the massive accumulation rate of ETH, coupled with a market-wide rally, is impacting Ether performance, with the token going above $3,000 twice in the past few days. Although it has fallen below $3,000 on both occasions, with a recent 2% drop that saw it trade $2,972, there are positive signs that it would soon recover and find its support above that price level. Over the past seven days, ETH has climbed up more than 16% and the turnaround is more evident in the long term, with a 90% gain in the past 3 months. However, it is still trading 11% below its price at the start of the year. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-15T10:50:57,"Unveiling a Colossal Bitcoin Transfer: $472M Moves to Galaxy Digital","BitcoinWorld Unveiling a Colossal Bitcoin Transfer: $472M Moves to Galaxy Digital A ripple of intrigue has swept through the cryptocurrency world, as a significant movement of digital assets caught the attention of market observers. We’re talking about a massive Bitcoin transfer , specifically 4,000 BTC, which has been tracked from an unknown wallet directly to Galaxy Digital. This isn’t just any transfer; at an approximate value of $472 million, it represents a substantial sum that warrants a closer look into its potential ramifications for the broader market. What Did Whale Alert Uncover? The cryptocurrency tracking service, Whale Alert, is renowned for its vigilance in monitoring large movements of digital assets across various blockchains. Their recent report highlighted this particular BTC transaction , signaling its movement from an unidentified source to a well-known institutional player. Whale Alert’s timely notifications often serve as an early warning system, drawing attention to significant shifts in supply or demand dynamics that could influence market sentiment. The Transaction: 4,000 BTC moved. Recipient: Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management firm in the digital asset space. Value: Approximately $472 million, making it one of the more notable transfers in recent times. Origin: An unknown wallet, which adds a layer of mystery and fuels speculation about the sender’s identity and motives. Why Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer to Galaxy Digital Matter? When an institutional entity like Galaxy Digital receives such a substantial amount of Bitcoin, it rarely goes unnoticed. These movements are often indicative of deeper market trends or strategic plays. Galaxy Digital, founded by Mike Novogratz, is a key player in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the nascent digital asset economy. Their activities often reflect institutional interest and sophisticated investment strategies. Several reasons could underpin such a large Bitcoin transfer : Over-the-Counter (OTC) Trading: Large institutional trades often occur off-exchange to minimize market impact. Galaxy Digital could be facilitating an OTC deal for a high-net-worth individual or another institution. Custody Solutions: The BTC might be moving into Galaxy Digital’s custody services for safekeeping on behalf of a client. This indicates long-term holding intentions rather than immediate selling. Portfolio Rebalancing: Galaxy Digital manages various funds and investment vehicles. This transfer could be part of a larger portfolio rebalancing act, adjusting their Bitcoin exposure. Proprietary Trading: The firm might be acquiring Bitcoin for its own balance sheet or for use in its trading operations, signaling a bullish or bearish stance depending on subsequent actions. What is the Potential Crypto Market Impact ? The immediate reaction to such a large BTC transaction is often speculation about its potential impact on price. While 4,000 BTC is a significant sum, its direct market impact depends heavily on whether these funds are intended for sale on an open exchange or for long-term holding/OTC operations. If the Bitcoin is destined for an exchange, it could increase selling pressure; however, if it’s for custody or OTC, the market impact would be minimal or even positive as it signals growing institutional adoption. Key Considerations for the Market: Liquidity: Such large movements can test the market’s liquidity, especially if a portion of the BTC is eventually sold. Sentiment: The transfer, particularly to a reputable firm like Galaxy Digital, can bolster institutional confidence in Bitcoin as an asset class, potentially attracting more traditional investors. Transparency vs. Opacity: The ‘unknown wallet’ origin adds an element of opacity, which can sometimes lead to uncertainty, but the known destination (Galaxy Digital) provides a degree of reassurance regarding institutional involvement. This event underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market, where large institutional players are actively involved in moving substantial amounts of digital assets. It highlights the increasing integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial structures, moving beyond retail speculation to serious institutional investment. Actionable Insights for Investors For investors keeping an eye on the market, large transfers like this offer valuable insights: Stay Informed: Services like Whale Alert are crucial for real-time data on significant movements. Look Beyond the Headlines: A large transfer isn’t automatically a sell signal. Consider the recipient and their typical operations. Observe Follow-Up Actions: What Galaxy Digital does with this Bitcoin next will be key. Does it sit in cold storage, or is it distributed to various addresses? Institutional Adoption: View these transfers as a sign of continued institutional interest, which is generally a positive long-term indicator for Bitcoin’s price and stability. In conclusion, the 4,000 BTC transfer to Galaxy Digital is more than just a large number; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the increasing involvement of institutional players, the growing sophistication of digital asset management, and the ongoing shift towards Bitcoin’s broader acceptance. While the ‘unknown wallet’ adds a touch of mystery, the known destination to a reputable firm like Galaxy Digital suggests a calculated move within the institutional crypto ecosystem, rather than a cause for immediate alarm.

2025-07-15T10:41:40,"Samson Mow Says Bitcoin Bull Market Is Just Starting as BTC Hits $123K","The post Samson Mow Says Bitcoin Bull Market Is Just Starting as BTC Hits $123K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin just shattered its previous all-time high, briefly reaching $123,091.61 on Monday. This explosive move has reignited bold predictions across the crypto world, especially from Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3 and a well-known Bitcoin advocate. Mow believes this is only the beginning. “The Bitcoin bull market hasn’t even started yet,” he said, signaling that the real rally may still be ahead. His recent comments also highlight a powerful milestone – Bitcoin has now outpaced inflation by 19%, proving itself as a strong hedge against long-term financial uncertainty. If you take a real inflation rate of say 11% (eggs) and apply it to the ATH price in November 2021 ($68,789), that gives us an inflation adjusted 2021 high of $0.1M. $0.12M is just beating inflation by 19%, or 4.8% annually. The Bitcoin bull market hasn’t even started yet. — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 14, 2025 Bitcoin vs Inflation: How BTC Holds Its Value Over Time Samson Mow compared the current price action to Bitcoin’s peak of $68,789 in November 2021. Adjusted for a real inflation rate of 11%, based on everyday items like eggs, this would bring the inflation-adjusted high to around $100,000. However, Mow argues that the true inflation rate is likely even higher, possibly between 15% and 20%. This makes Bitcoin’s recent climb to $116,778 even more impressive, showing a 4.8% annual gain above inflation. Mow, who famously predicts Bitcoin will reach $1 million through what he calls “Omega candles” (massive price surges), sees this moment as an early sign of a much larger rally to come. Strategy’s Massive Bitcoin Purchase Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), made headlines again with another huge Bitcoin buy. On Monday, the company added 4,225 BTC to its holdings, spending $472.5 million. This brings Strategy’s total stash to 601,550 BTC, now worth over $70.2 billion. The purchase was funded through a $330.9 million sale of MSTR shares, along with the sale of Bitcoin-backed convertible stocks – STRK, STRF, and STRD. Saylor reported a 20.2% return on Bitcoin year-to-date and continues to push the idea that Bitcoin is not just an investment but the future of money. He repeated his now-iconic line that Bitcoin is “going up forever.” JAN3 also commented on the transaction, pointing out how these strategic moves are helping drive broader market activity. Price Correction Is a Positive Sign, Says Rochard Not everyone sees the pullbacks as negative. Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, shared his thoughts on the recent dip after Bitcoin briefly touched its new highs. Bitcoin’s retracement is healthy: it slows leverage, resets funding rates and implied volatility, and moves open interest from speculative upside calls into fresh strikes and maturities, giving the next leg of the bull market a sturdier foundation. — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) July 15, 2025 He described the correction as “healthy,” explaining that it reduces excessive leverage, resets funding rates and implied volatility, and helps move open interest into new strike prices and maturities. In his view, these shifts lay a stronger foundation for the next phase of the bull run. Momentum Builds as Institutions Double Down With Bitcoin now trading above its inflation-adjusted all-time high and institutional interest continuing to grow, the momentum is clearly building. Voices like Mow and Saylor remain confident that Bitcoin’s best days are still ahead. Whether the price continues to rise in the short term or takes a breather, Bitcoin’s growing dominance, inflation resistance, and increasing adoption are signs of a deeper shift taking place in global finance.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/samson-mow-says-bitcoin-bull-market-is-just-starting-as-btc-hits-123k/,"BTC|TRADING|MARKET|STRK","News",cryptocompare
2025-07-15T10:40:52,"Bitcoin-Backed Loans Soar: Coinbase Achieves Remarkable $1 Billion Collateral Milestone","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin-Backed Loans Soar: Coinbase Achieves Remarkable $1 Billion Collateral Milestone Imagine having significant wealth tied up in Bitcoin, but needing immediate cash without wanting to sell your precious digital assets. This common dilemma is precisely what Bitcoin-backed loans aim to solve, and a recent announcement from Coinbase has truly underscored their growing importance in the crypto ecosystem. The leading crypto exchange has now seen the total collateral for its Bitcoin-backed loans surge past a staggering $1 billion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the evolving utility of Bitcoin beyond a mere speculative asset, showcasing its increasing role as a financial instrument for liquidity. Understanding the Phenomenon of Bitcoin-Backed Loans So, what exactly are Bitcoin-backed loans ? In simple terms, they allow Bitcoin holders to borrow traditional currency (like USD or USDC) by using their BTC as collateral. This means you don’t have to sell your Bitcoin, potentially incurring capital gains taxes or losing out on future price appreciation. Instead, your Bitcoin is temporarily held by a lender (in this case, Coinbase), and you receive a loan based on a percentage of its value. The concept is similar to a traditional secured loan, where you might use your house or car as collateral. For crypto, it provides a crucial bridge between the volatile world of digital assets and the stable needs of everyday finance. Borrowers typically receive loans at a specific Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, which determines how much they can borrow relative to their collateral’s value. For instance, a 50% LTV on $100,000 worth of Bitcoin would allow you to borrow $50,000. Coinbase’s Strategic Play in Crypto Loans Coinbase , one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, launched its Bitcoin-backed USDC loans on January 16. This move was a strategic expansion of its services, aiming to cater to a demographic of long-term Bitcoin holders who prefer to ‘hodl’ rather than sell. The initial offering came with certain caps, but the rapid demand quickly led to adjustments. On April 30, Coinbase reportedly raised its loan cap from $100,000 to an impressive $1 million, signaling strong confidence in the product and the market’s appetite for such offerings. The platform’s reputation for security and regulatory compliance makes it an attractive option for users seeking crypto loans . Unlike some decentralized alternatives, Coinbase offers a centralized and user-friendly experience, often preferred by those new to crypto lending or who prioritize institutional-grade security. The seamless integration within their existing exchange platform makes the process of obtaining a loan straightforward for their vast user base. The Power of BTC Collateral: Unlocking Your Bitcoin’s Potential The core appeal of these loans lies in the ability to leverage your BTC collateral without liquidating your holdings. This is particularly appealing for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value appreciation. Consider these key advantages: Accessing Liquidity Without Selling: Need cash for an emergency, a down payment, or an investment? Instead of selling your Bitcoin and potentially missing out on future gains, you can borrow against it. Maintaining Bitcoin Exposure: You continue to own your Bitcoin (albeit pledged as collateral), meaning you benefit if its price increases. Potential Tax Advantages: In many jurisdictions, a loan is not considered a taxable event, unlike selling an asset. This can offer significant tax efficiencies for long-term holders. However, it’s crucial to understand the risks associated with using BTC collateral . Bitcoin’s price volatility means that if its value drops significantly, you might face a ‘margin call,’ requiring you to add more collateral or risk liquidation of your pledged Bitcoin to cover the loan. Centralized vs. Decentralized Finance: Where Do Coinbase Crypto Loans Stand? The world of crypto loans broadly divides into two main categories: Centralized Finance (CeFi) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Coinbase’s offering falls squarely into the CeFi camp. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Centralized Finance (CeFi – e.g., Coinbase) Decentralized Finance (DeFi – e.g., Aave, Compound) Custody of Collateral Held by the platform (e.g., Coinbase) Managed by smart contracts (non-custodial) Counterparty Risk Present (you trust the platform) Minimal (you trust the code) KYC/AML Requirements Mandatory Often not required User Experience Generally more user-friendly, traditional interface Can be complex for newcomers, requires self-custody knowledge Interest Rates/Fees Set by the platform, can be competitive Determined by supply/demand in protocols, can be volatile Transparency Internal operations are private All transactions and code are public on the blockchain Coinbase’s success with its loan product highlights that a significant portion of the market prefers the simplicity, regulation, and perceived security of a centralized entity, even as the decentralized finance space continues to innovate. This doesn’t mean one is inherently better than the other; rather, they serve different user preferences and risk appetites. Actionable Insights: Navigating the World of BTC Collateral For anyone considering leveraging their BTC collateral for a loan, here are some actionable insights: Understand the Terms: Always read the fine print. Pay close attention to interest rates, LTV ratios, liquidation thresholds, and any fees involved. Manage Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be dramatic. Have a clear strategy for managing potential margin calls. This might involve keeping extra collateral ready or setting stop-loss limits if possible. Purpose of the Loan: Borrow responsibly. A loan should ideally be for productive purposes or to cover short-term liquidity needs, not for speculative trading, especially with volatile collateral. Tax Implications: While borrowing isn’t typically a taxable event, what you do with the borrowed funds might be. Consult a tax professional regarding your specific situation. Compare Providers: Even within CeFi, different platforms offer varying terms. Shop around before committing. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin’s Utility The remarkable achievement of Coinbase surpassing $1 billion in collateral for its Bitcoin-backed loans marks a significant milestone for the broader cryptocurrency market. It solidifies Bitcoin’s position not just as ‘digital gold’ but as a versatile financial asset capable of unlocking liquidity for its holders. As the crypto space matures, we can expect to see even more innovative financial products emerge, further blurring the lines between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This trend underscores a growing demand for sophisticated financial tools that allow users to maximize the utility of their crypto holdings, paving the way for a more integrated and dynamic financial future.

I continue to like the STRF preferred shares far better than the common. STRF has an 8.4% effective yield and has outperformed MSTR since my last article. STRF is less risky than MSTR in both bull and bear Bitcoin scenarios, as dividends are realized returns and not dependent on BTC price appreciation. With potential rate cuts ahead, STRF may gain favor with income investors. I see it as the best way to gain exposure to Strategy at this time. Strategy ( MSTR )( STRF )( STRK )( STRD ) has officially surpassed the 600,000 Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) threshold after announcing the purchase of another 4,225 BTC between July 7th and July 14th. The exact number of coins that the company now holds is 601,550. It's a staggering number of coins and Strategy currently owns over 3% of Bitcoin's 19.9 million circulating supply and 2.8% of the total supply that will ever be in existence. Data by YCharts It's been an absolutely incredible run for both MSTR shareholders and BTC-USD holders with each seeing intense rallies from the 'tariff tantrum' in early-April. The relationship between Strategy and Bitcoin itself has become quite symbiotic over the last year; with Strategy's ability to raise capital benefiting from the ever-increasing valuation of its Bitcoin collateral and Bitcoin's price rising, in part, due to Strategy's seemingly never-ending bid. I've actually been bullish MSTR in the past but flipped to a more cautious view when the shares started trading at a significant premium to the value of the BTC on the balance sheet last year. More recently, I've taken a liking to the preferred offerings, specifically the senior STRF shares, and have opined that the existence of the preferred stocks may even be to the long term detriment of the common stock. I closed my May Strategy piece with this: I won't pay a premium for BTC through MSTR when I can just buy an ETF instead. But I have no problem letting Saylor pay me 10% while he dilutes his common stockholders. I'm long STRF. 5/3//25-7/14/25 (Seeking Alpha) Long STRF rather than MSTR has worked out considerably well since that early-May piece with the senior preferred stock generating a 35% total return in a little over two months. In this update, I'll get into why I'm increasingly of the opinion that the common stock is the wrong way to play Strategy's Bitcoin flywheel at this point in time. Lackluster STRD ATM Demand? In that same article I referenced from May, I compared the three different preferred shares currently offered by Strategy. At that time, I came to the conclusion that even though it was an interesting capital appreciation play, STRD was the inferior investment of the three senior shares for long term income-minded investors. I won't re-write that entire piece, but my primary argument against STRD was that the dividends are not mandatory and not cumulative. Thus, Strategy could simply opt to not pay STRD shareholders at all if it felt it benefited the company. Subsequent to that May piece, Strategy announced a $4.2 billion ATM for STRD shares and had what I think is an alarming addition to the 'use of proceeds' section from the prospectus . The bold text below is my emphasis: We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital, and may also use the net proceeds for the payment of cash dividends on our STRF Stock and STRK Stock . Higher yields aside, the idea that proceeds could be raised from a tranche of preferred shares lacking mandatory dividend payments and then used to pay the dividends of an entirely different shareholder group had to give potential STRD buyers at least a little bit of pause. One week following the announced ATM, I think we have some possible signals from Strategy's first July 2025 BTC purchases: ATM Program Used Shares Sold Notional Proceeds MSTR 797,008 - $330.9m STRK 573,976 $57.4m $71.1m STRF 444,005 $44.4m $55.3m STRD 158,278 $15.8m $15.0m Source: Strategy, July 7th-14th ATM sales In the first week following the announced STRD ATM, Strategy was able to bring in just $15 million through that offering and $101.8 million from the mandatory payment preferred tranches. I think there are two ways to look at this: Demand for Strategy's junk tranche has diminished Strategy would rather raise capital from the products where proceeds exceed notional Number two is probably only true if the company believes the share prices of STRK and STRF are too high. I don't think that is the case and I'll get into why in the next section. Thus, I believe the lack of STRD issuance is likely more indicative of a demand problem. By itself, this is potentially concerning since the company intends to raise up to $4.2 billion with this product for the expressed purpose of paying previous investors. But perhaps the bigger signal in Strategy's ATM use through the first half of July 2025 is that 70% of the capital used to buy Bitcoin this month has come from the MSTR ATM. Currently, there is $17.8 billion remaining on the MSTR ATM and a combined $26.2 billion left on the preferred share ATMs. Between the shares issued already from the ATMs and the initial offerings, Strategy owes $326.5 million in annualized dividend payments. Most of which is through the mandatory products. ATM Product MSTR STRK STRF STRD Remaining Availability $17,779.8 $20,450.9 $1,881.3 $4,185.0 Total ATM $21,000.0 $21,000.0 $2,100.0 $4,200.0 % Used 15.33% 2.61% 10.41% 0.36% Dividend % - 8% 10% 10% Annualized Payments of Remaining - $1,636.1 $188.1 $418.5 Source: Strategy, dollars in millions Importantly, if the company were to fully raise through all three preferred share product ATMs, the annual liability to those stock holders from the available shares would be an additional $2.24 billion - or a total of $2.56 billion counting the shares that have already been issued. Since these are annual payments in perpetuity, they pose a significant long term risk to Strategy's BTC stack if the company can't continue to dilute the common stock or raise capital through additional means. Of course, the rebuttal to this is the expectation that Bitcoin's price will continue rising at a faster annualized rate than the 10% payments. Yet, even if we take that as a base case, it might still make more sense to long STRF over MSTR. Valuation Considerations It's been mentioned many times before through Seeking Alpha pieces - my own included - that MSTR continues to trade at a sizable premium to the market valuation of the Bitcoin that Strategy holds. At a mNAV rate of 1.96, MSTR trades at nearly double the value of the company's BTC: MSTR mNAV (StrategyTracker) While well below mNAV highs, some believe 1.96 is a rich valuation for the common; I'm clearly in that camp. Others see no issue with the premium. To each their own. I'm not going to dwell on it because readers likely already know where I stand and it's a simple difference in philosophy. Rather, let's explore the capital appreciation potential of STRF. STRF Appreciation Potential At $10 Annual Dividends Share Price Share Price at 7% Effective Yield $143 Share Price at 6.6% Effective Yield $152 Share Price at 6% Effective Yield $167 Share Price at 5% Effective Yield $200 Share Price at 4.44% Effective Yield $227 Share Price at 4% Effective Yield $250 Source: Author's Calculations The table above shows the potential share price appreciation for STRF under different effective yield scenarios. At a 7% effective yield, the stock is worth $143. If STRF were to trade in line with the 12 month trailing yield of the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF ( PFF ), the stock would be worth $152. The US 10-year is currently yielding 4.44%. At par with the US 10-yr, STRF is worth $227 per share. And if we actually see rates go down in longer term US debt, the price of STRF could potentially re-rate even higher if income investors view BTC-collateral as a viable alternative to government bonds. But let's just assume STRF can grow the stock price to an effective yield of 6.6%. I think this would be reasonable as it is in-line with other preferred stocks. At a closing share price of $118.5, STRF would see price appreciation of 28.3% before dividends at a 6.6% effective yield. If the mNAV of MSTR remains constant, Bitcoin would have to get to $154k per coin to justify MSTR over STRF on price appreciation. This is admittedly a hypothetical situation. However, I think STRF is misunderstood. Unlike MSTR, STRF can work in both Bitcoin bear and Bitcoin bull scenarios. Closing Takeaways One of the criticisms that I've seen online from MSTR longs who don't hold Strategy's preferred shares is the claim that 10% in fiat yield is trumped by the presumed 'BTC Yield' of the common stock equity. I don't actually think that's the correct way to compare the common with the preferred stock. First, dividends paid to STRF stockholders are realized returns. The 'BTC yield' of the common stock could actually go negative if Strategy is ultimately forced by the market to sell BTC to raise the capital for preferred share dividend payments. Second, BTC Yield is fundamentally an argument for assessing MSTR relative to the Bitcoin backing of each share. If that truly has any significance, why should the market pay double for the BTC held by the company through the common when the BTC is unproductive? Many expect the MSTR mNAV to go much higher. My base case is that it won't. In a truly bearish Bitcoin scenario , mNAV could realistically go negative as it did in the past. And Strategy would still have to pay the STRF dividends with a preferred to BTC NAV collateral ratio of 5%. Finally, the market is expecting no less than two rate cuts through the remainder of the year by the Federal Reserve. If short term rates go down, investors may begin to get bullish longer duration debt. I would imagine a strong bid for STRF in such an environment. At this point, STRF is my only exposure to Strategy.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4801274-strategy-still-sticking-with-series-a-preferreds?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|STRK","MSTR|STRF",cryptocompare
