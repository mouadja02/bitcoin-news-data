2025-06-05T13:46:40,"Is Ozak AI the Next Altcoin Superstar After Bitcoin and Ethereum?","The post Is Ozak AI the Next Altcoin Superstar After Bitcoin and Ethereum? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Cryptocurrency market evolves, investors constantly seek the next breakout project—one that offers real-world utility, disruptive technology, and explosive growth potential. While Bitcoin and Ethereum have long dominated the space, delivering both innovation and immense returns, a new player is beginning to turn heads: Ozak AI (OZ) .

In an era where AI is rapidly transforming every industry—from finance to healthcare—Ozak AI is positioning itself at the convergence of two explosive sectors: AI and blockchain. What makes it even more attractive to early investors is its low entry point. Currently priced at $0.005 in its third Ozak AI presale phase, Ozak AI has already raised over $1 million, reflecting rising investor confidence. If the token hits its projected $1 target, that would represent a 300x gain—a return that would rival the early days of Ethereum or Solana. Why It Could Be the Next Big Thing Several factors make Ozak AI a serious contender for the next altcoin superstar: Real-World Utility: It solves real problems—helping investors make better, faster decisions using AI-generated insights. Scalability: Its architecture is built to handle massive data volumes and user growth without compromising performance. Decentralization and Security: By integrating DePIN and secure vaults, Ozak ensures data integrity and user control. Customizability: Prediction Agents allow users to shape the AI model around their specific needs and strategies—a major innovation in personalized finance. Of course, becoming the next Bitcoin or Ethereum isn’t easy. Ozak AI will need to continue hitting its roadmap milestones, deliver consistent utility, and build a thriving user base. But with a solid foundation, growing visibility, and market demand for predictive analytics, Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most promising new projects in the space. In a sea of speculative tokens, Ozak AI stands out with purpose and potential. It might not replace Bitcoin or Ethereum in market cap any time soon, but it could very well become the next superstar altcoin—delivering major returns to early believers and reshaping how we interact with financial data. If users are scouting the market for the next big thing, Ozak AI deserves a serious look.

2025-06-05T13:43:10,"Retail traders dumped $258m in Nvidia stock: Will they buy Bitcoin instead?","Several reports suggest that retail investors who bought the Nvidia dip are now selling. Traders are asking whether they will use their profits to buy crypto. Retail investors are taking profits from their Nvidia purchases, while institutions continue to buy. According to a report by Vanda Research, retail investors dumped $258 million of Nvidia stock during the week ending on June 4. Many retail investors made significant gains from their Nvidia investments between 2023 and 2024. Now, they appear to be searching for new opportunities, according to a sentiment survey by Vanda Research. Retail sentiment has sharply dropped in 2025, shifting from 10 points leaning to buy to over 15 points leaning toward sell. Retail sentiment in Nvidia, 10-day average | Source: CNBC This analysis is in line with a report by Sherwood, which recorded $4.9 billion in retail outflows during the third week of May. It was the largest dollar outflow for Nvidia since 2015 and marked the longest retail selling streak, two consecutive weeks, since March 2022. The report also notes similar activity in another retail favorite, Tesla. You might also like: AI crypto tokens at risk as Nvidia faces restrictions on China exports Why are retail investors dumping Nvidia? Retail investors who bought the dip after Nvidia shares fell on the DeepSeek launch are now looking for more lucrative opportunities. Analyst Ben Bajarin notes that Nvidia stock has already priced in much of its growth potential. As a result, traders are seeking higher upside elsewhere. Additionally, many are concerned about the impact of U.S. tariffs and chip restrictions on China. In this environment, investors with higher risk tolerance are turning to AI stocks and crypto. According to Vanda Research , retail investors are now eyeing more volatile small-cap AI stocks to chase further gains. Nvidia and Bitcoin (BTC) have historically shared a strong connection. A 2024 study found a consistent correlation above 0.80 between the two assets, largely due to Nvidia’s role in powering crypto mining infrastructure. This suggests that many Nvidia investors are already familiar with, or actively involved in, the crypto market. At the same time, retail investors are taking a back seat when it comes to Bitcoin, letting institutions accumulate. The most established crypto asset has actually underperformed Nvidia in the last five years, returning 992% vs Nvidia’s 1,523.1%. Still, there is no clear indication yet of a broad retail pivot from Nvidia into Bitcoin. While historical correlations and overlapping investor profiles suggest a potential bridge between the two, current sentiment doesn’t make the case for a clear rotation into Bitcoin. Whether those taking profits on Nvidia will ultimately move into crypto may depend on broader macro signals. This includes interest rate decisions, regulatory developments, and trade policies.

2025-06-05T13:34:22,"Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Nears $85B, More Than Doubling in a Year","Bitcoin BTC has taken deeper root in corporate treasuries, with 116 public companies now holding a combined 809,100 BTC, worth around $85 billion based on current prices, at the end of May. That’s a dramatic rise from 312,200 BTC held a year ago in corporate treasuries, according to Binance Research’s latest report . Nearly 100,000 BTC has been added since early April alone. The surge appears driven by a mix of rising prices and structural tailwinds. Donald Trump adopted a pro-crypto stance during his 2024 presidential campaign, vowing to make the U.S. a global hub for the asset class and create a “crypto capital of the planet.” Since Trump took office he has moved to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile , while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped numerous lawsuits against major crypto firms.. Binance’s report shows that bitcoin treasury accumulation grew in November, when Trump won the election . Adding to that, new fair-value accounting rules introduced by the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) this year allow companies to recognize gains on BTC holdings, removing a longstanding deterrent. Newer entrants including GameStop (GME) and PSG have recently started accumulating BTC as a well, yet Strategy still holds the lion’s share of BTC in corporate treasuries, with over 70% of holdings. Some companies are also tiptoeing into other assets. SharpLink holds $425 million in ETH, while DeFi Development and Classover are betting on solana SOL. China-based firm Webus recently filed for a $300 million XRP strategic reserve. Still, these altcoin holdings remain relatively small and are often tied to firms trying to rebrand as token-forward entities, Binance noted. Binance’s report also flagged the rapid rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), which have climbed more than 260% from $8.6 billion to $23 billion this year.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/05/corporate-bitcoin-holdings-nears-85b-more-than-doubling-in-a-year,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB","Markets|Bitcoin|Treasury|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T13:30:39,"Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming?","Ethereum is trading at critical levels after breaking past the $2,500 mark earlier this quarter, now attempting to reclaim momentum and push into higher resistance. Despite global macroeconomic pressures—including rising US Treasury yields and persistent trade tensions between the US and China—ETH continues to show resilience. Market analysts believe that Ethereum could be leading the charge into a long-anticipated altseason, provided it holds key levels and breaks above current supply. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? Top analyst Ted Pillows recently pointed to a compelling technical pattern: Ethereum has now posted four consecutive two-week green candles, a formation that mirrors Bitcoin’s price structure in early 2020 following the March crash. That period marked the beginning of Bitcoin’s legendary bull run to $69,000. According to Pillows, the similarities between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025 are “just mind blowing,” sparking renewed interest from traders who see Ethereum’s current consolidation as a bullish continuation. With investor sentiment slowly recovering and technicals turning favorable, the market is watching ETH closely. If history is any guide, this consolidation could mark the calm before Ethereum’s next major leg higher. However, macro risks still linger, and timing will be critical. Ethereum Resilience Sparks Hopes Of 2020-Like Rally Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,600 level, showing resilience amid global macro uncertainty and volatile market conditions. This consolidation around key support has many investors and analysts anticipating a breakout that could lead Ethereum into a new rally phase, potentially triggering a broader altseason. Despite growing concerns around systemic risk in the bond market and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, Ethereum continues to attract buyers, signaling confidence in its long-term strength. Analysts are watching this range closely. Many believe that if Ethereum can maintain support and break above near-term resistance, it could gain serious momentum. One of the more compelling arguments for a bullish outlook comes from Ted Pillows, who highlights a striking similarity between Ethereum’s current structure and Bitcoin’s behavior in 2020. According to Pillows, Ethereum has now printed four consecutive two-week green candles since bottoming, just as Bitcoin did after the March 2020 crash. That pattern marked the start of BTC’s legendary run to $69,000. The comparison has sparked optimism that ETH may be preparing for a similar breakout, especially if it clears resistance near $2,700–$2,800. While the macro environment remains tense, this technical structure—paired with rising confidence in ETH’s strength—keeps bulls hopeful that a major move is on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Consolidation Above Support Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,607, consolidating just above the 34-period EMA on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near $2,594. After the strong surge in early May that saw ETH rally from under $2,000 to highs near $2,850, the price has moved into a tight consolidation range. This sideways action reflects market indecision as buyers and sellers battle for control. Despite the recent volatility, ETH has continued to post higher lows, indicating ongoing bullish pressure. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are aligned below the current price, all trending upward, signaling that the broader trend remains intact. The price is finding consistent support from the 50-period SMA around the $2,590–$2,600 zone, which is a key level to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst A decisive break above the short-term resistance near $2,680 would be needed to confirm continuation toward $2,800 and potentially retest previous highs. On the downside, a break below $2,590 could trigger a pullback toward $2,500 or lower, especially if BTC shows weakness.

(DJT) has filed an S-1 registration with the SEC for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF (B.T.). This ETF, if approved, would let regular investors buy into Bitcoin in a simpler way, even though the market is already crowded with many other Bitcoin investment funds. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF could become the next big thing for retail investors eager to get a piece of Bitcoin. Truth Social File For Bitcoin ETF Application Trump Media isn’t just about social media anymore. After building the Truth Social platform and exploring other tech projects like Truth+ streaming and Truth.Fi fintech, it’s now setting its sights on Bitcoin. The ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, which calls itself an “America-First” asset manager. Crypto.com will play a key role too, acting as the Bitcoin custodian, main executor, and liquidity provider. But before any of this happens, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has to give the green light. If the SEC approves the plan, the ETF will be listed on NYSE Arca. That’s when investors will have a new, easy way to bet on Bitcoin’s ups and downs—using Trump’s trusted brand name. A Small Company Entering a Big Field This new ETF shows Trump Media’s big push into the crypto world, using the Truth Social brand name to grab attention. The New York Stock Exchange Group has already filed regulatory paperwork for this ETF, signaling that things are moving forward quickly. Support and Criticism Over BTC ETF President Trump has spoken many times in support of Bitcoin, calling it a sign of financial freedom. Many of his supporters might see this ETF as a trusted way to get involved in Bitcoin investing. However, some critics worry that this could personally benefit Trump because of his name’s connection to the fund. The White House has said Trump himself is no longer directly tied to the businesses that use his name. Still, there are concerns about the ethics of such a close link. What Next? Trump Media’s move comes at a time when there are already plenty of Bitcoin ETFs out there. But the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF stands out because of Trump’s name and the way it’s packaged to appeal to his loyal base. If the SEC gives the green light, this new ETF could quickly become a favorite for retail investors who trust Trump’s vision—and who want an easier way to invest in Bitcoin",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trumps-truth-social-files-s-1-for-a-bitcoin-etf/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

While the current intraday price action may seem dull, the real excitement lies in the activities of crypto whales operating in the shadows. In the past 24 hours, the whale alert’s official X account has posted 10 different BTC transfers by 12:16 PM UTC on June 5th. Among them, 8 posts indicate that nearly 12,907 BTC, amounting to $1.3 billion, was transferred to wallets from exchanges. Moreover, the data from Santiment highlighted that over the past week, the whales have added 79,244 BTC, which amounts to over $8.3 billion. The whale activity in early June is hinting that a market resurgence in June seems more likely than ever. The whales are getting active was confirmed by Cryptoquant’s analysis, too, which says a fresh cohort of Bitcoin whales, with an average coin age under six months, has been stacking at a record pace. Keep reading to know more, as whale activity is set to send the Bitcoin price higher in June. Will June Bitcoin Price Rally Be Triggered By New Money In The Market?

This increase of 600K BTC is worth $63 billion. The increase clearly shows that positions have been built recently, assuming around Q2 of 2025, and this is the new money. This increase in supply share indicates that newly minted BTC crypto’s are getting absorbed rapidly, which is tightening the float. Therefore, clearing the all-time high is more in demand than ever, once pierced, then $134K is the number for June 2025. But if it falls, then $95K is the level, BTC price could take as support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T13:11:17,"Bitcoin consolidates above key support: is a breakout imminent?","Bitcoin has spent the majority of the week trading within a tight consolidation range. But unlike previous consolidations, this one carries a bullish undertone. With price action holding above major support levels and forming potential structural shifts, traders are on alert for a breakout move. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent price action has been marked by low volatility and declining volume, but this may not be a sign of weakness. Instead, the technical structure and support dynamics suggest that the market is coiling before its next move. Price remains above critical support zones, and volume behavior is characteristic of accumulation, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Key technical points Point of Control Support: Bitcoin is holding above the POC, which aligns with both the bullish channel low and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Rounded Bottom Formation: Price structure on the 4-hour chart is morphing into a rounded bottom pattern, often a precursor to upward momentum. Volume Decline Indicates Accumulation: Volume has been declining as price compresses above support — a common signal of accumulation before expansion. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin has been consolidating within a narrow range, but the location of this range is what makes it significant. Instead of compressing beneath resistance or within a neutral zone, price is resting on a technically strong support cluster. The Point Of Control, the price level with the highest traded volume, coincides with the channel low support and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, creating a robust zone that has held through multiple retests. You might also like: Lightchain AI grabs watchlist spots while Litecoin waits for a market shift that never comes On the 4-hour timeframe, candles have been consistently closing above this level, signaling that buyers are defending the zone. The price structure is gradually forming what appears to be a rounded bottom, suggesting a possible reversal pattern and strength building at support. Volume has been tapering off during this period, a common feature in accumulation phases. Typically, such low-volume compressions resolve in sharp, directional breakouts once volume re-enters the market. In Bitcoin’s case, a reclaim of the value area high will be the first signal of strength. This level has acted as a ceiling in recent weeks and marks the upper boundary of the current volume profile. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin continues to hold above the POC and confirms a breakout with volume, a push toward a new all-time high is likely. Until then, traders should monitor volume closely, a spike could signal the end of this accumulation phase and the beginning of a major move.

2025-06-05T13:10:29,"Bitcoin Exchange Holdings Drop to Seven-Year Low as HODLing Grows","Bitcoin’s presence on cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped to its lowest level in nearly seven years, falling below 11% of total supply for the first time since March 2018. This trend, revealed in new Glassnode data, points to a rising preference for long-term holding and institutional custody. HODLers Show Long-Term Conviction The decline from a 17.2% peak in March 2020 suggests a shift in investor behavior. Over 1.26 million BTC, or about 6% of the total supply, has moved away from exchanges during that time. According to CryptoQuant, the Exchange Flows to Network Activity Ratio has reached its lowest level since early 2023. This indicates that even as Bitcoin prices climb, fewer coins are being deposited on trading platforms. The current 30-day moving average of the ratio sits at around 1.2—well below its 365-day average and nearing -1 standard deviation. Such levels often signal strong holding sentiment and a reduced willingness to sell. Rise of Institutional Custodians Much of Bitcoin’s migration away from exchanges is being driven by institutional players favoring third-party custody over public platforms. Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton are now using platforms like Coinbase Prime, which reported $212 billion in assets under custody in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s exchange recorded over $500 million in BTC outflows during the same period, with another $761 million in withdrawals on June 5. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are also absorbing large amounts of BTC. As of June 5, ETF holdings had ballooned to $44.54 billion, up from just $1 billion at their launch in January 2024. Trust in Exchanges Falters Post-FTX The collapse of FTX in late 2022 appears to have triggered a long-lasting erosion of trust in centralized exchanges. Glassnode data shows consistent outflows from November 2022 to May 2023, including several weeks with more than 10,000 BTC withdrawn. In total, more than 200,000 BTC left exchanges during that six-month stretch. This indicates a lasting shift toward self-custody and alternative trading platforms. A 2025 joint survey by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto exposure, with nearly 60% allocating over 5% of assets under management to digital assets. Standard Chartered estimates that 61 public companies already control more than 3% of the total 21 million BTC supply. With growing confidence in self-custody and institutional infrastructure, exchange balances may continue to decline—even as Bitcoin aims for new highs.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-exchange-holdings-drop-to-seven-year-low-as-hodling-grows/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare

On Wednesday, June 4, 2025, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia announced its crackdown on the BidenCash marketplace, a darknet platform that facilitated illegal acts of buying and selling stolen credit cards and associated personal information. The bust resulted in the confiscation of cryptocurrency funds associated with the platform, and 145 darknet and traditional internet domains.

2025-06-05T13:07:10,"Pay Taxes in Bitcoin? California’s Bold Crypto Bill Explained","California lawmakers just sent a shockwave throughout the crypto space. It occurred in a string of unanimous votes this week when the State Assembly signed into law two bills that would revolutionize the way digital assets are handled and used in America's biggest state. The first, AB 1052, allows California to take custody of abandoned crypto sitting on exchanges after three years. The second, AB 1180, opens the door to state agencies accepting Bitcoin and other digital currencies for taxes and fees. Both now head to the Senate, where the nation and a great deal of crypto hangs on each step. Dormant Crypto: Seized, But Not Sold Under AB 1052, if you simply leave your coins sitting on a centralized exchange for three years — no trades, no withdrawals, no logging in the state gets to step in and send those funds to a state wallet. But unlike ordinary unclaimed property, California cannot sell your cryptocurrency. Instead, the coins remain there in their original form, waiting for you to return and claim them. Satoshi Action Fund policy director and bill co-author Eric Peterson explained it on X: “Since @SimplyBitcoinTV and @TFTC21 have had some misunderstandings on AB 1052 which passed the California Assembly last night, I have put together an explainer thread about how this protects #bitcoin for the citizens of California. … The cryptocurrency remains in its native form, without conversions to dollars.” Peterson stressed that the law applies only to exchange-listed assets, and not to self-custody wallets. ”Crypto assets are returned to the owner once they reach out to them,” echoed Hailey Lennon, a regulatory counsel at Coinbase, noting that similar legislation already operates for bank accounts and safe deposit boxes in most states. Pay Your Taxes in Bitcoin? The State Pilot The second bill, AB 1180, is just as groundbreaking. It allows the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to implement a pilot program to accept payments in cryptocurrency as payment for state taxes and fees, starting July 2026. The pilot program will run until 2031, with the DFPI required to report on the transaction volume, technical issues, and consumer feedback by 2028. Assemblymember Avelino Valencia, who authored the bill, erupted into celebrations on X: “Very excited about this. … I firmly believe this will be fully integrated into our society in the near future.”— Assemblymember Avelino Valencia Crypto Twitter lit up as word went out. “California Assembly passes bill to regulate Digital Assets under ‘Unclaimed Property’ law. Assets left on an exchange for 3 years will be transferred to the state, and can then be claimed by the owner.” — @Bitcoin_Laws June 4, 2025 “California approved a bill to accept crypto for state payments” — @InstitutionalFi June 4, 2025 What's Next? National Ripple Effects Should these bills become law with the Senate and Governor Newsom's approval, California will join Colorado, Utah, and Louisiana in accepting cryptocurrencies for governmental payments, but set a new precedent for managing dormant digital assets. Other states are watching closely, with industry lobbyists anticipating a wave of copycat laws if California's experiment succeeds. Response has been tepid. Supporters label the bills a long-overdue update, protecting consumers and supporting innovation. Critics are worried about overreach by the government and privacy, some arguing that the state has no business with stuck crypto. However, the promise that coins will be held back, not sold, until they are redeemed has gained provisional support from many in the community. While California creeps closer to enacting such innovative crypto legislation, the rest of America holds its breath to understand whether digital assets will ever be included in day-to-day government and what occurs when the state gets stuck on misplaced coins.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9455/pay-taxes-in-bitcoin-california-s-bold-crypto-bill-explained,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION","News|Legal",cryptocompare

In a new interview with Brian Rose on Real London TV , the best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad repeated his bold prediction: Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin within the next decade . But behind this forecast is a much bigger warning. Kiyosaki believes the U.S. is heading toward the greatest financial collapse in history, and he’s urging people to turn to Bitcoin, gold, and silver to survive it. Robert Kiyosaki – The Greatest Financial Collapse In History Is Coming https://t.co/p8Pm8cXSs2 — Brian Rose, Founder & Host of London Real (@LondonRealTV) June 4, 2025 Kiyosaki’s $1M Bitcoin Prediction According to Kiyosaki, the crash has already begun. He blames the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury for printing what he calls “worthless money” to cover up a system that’s already falling apart. He warns that billions of people could face financial disaster if they keep relying on fiat currency, stocks, or bonds. Instead, he says the smart move is to switch to real assets. His price outlook is aggressive: Bitcoin: $1 million within the next 10 years Gold: $30,000 per ounce Silver: 3x this year from the current $35 price For Kiyosaki, the message is clear: Get out of fiat and into assets that actually hold value. U.S. Debt Concerns Grow: Kiyosaki and Musk Speak Out Kiyosaki also raised alarms about America’s national debt. A proposed tax-and-spending package backed by Republicans could add another $5 trillion to the country’s already massive deficit. He’s been outspoken on X, urging Americans to reject the bill and “kill the bill” before it causes more damage.

Once a vocal Bitcoin supporter, Musk used to tweet about BTC often and even adopted the famous “laser eyes” profile photo trend back in 2020. His latest stance aligns with Kiyosaki’s – both see the growing debt as a major red flag for the U.S. economy. Will Bitcoin Become a Lifeboat in a Sinking Economy? Kiyosaki’s warning combined with Musk’s concerns is sparking debate across the financial world and the crypto space. Many Americans are beginning to feel that something is wrong with the economy and it doesn’t take an economist to notice.

South Africa’s Crypto Laws Just Got Exposed! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has filed an appeal challenging a recent Pretoria High Court ruling , which criticized the use of outdated, apartheid-era legislation to regulate cryptocurrency . The central bank is pushing back against a legal loophole that could potentially allow unlimited funds to exit South Africa via crypto , a move SARB warns could undermine national financial security. SARB Accuses the High Court of Misjudging Crypto Regulations In a statement on June 2 , the SARB argued that the High Court erred in a prior ruling that allowed Standard Bank to seize Bitcoin holdings belonging to clients. The court, SARB says, failed to recognize cryptocurrencies as either money or foreign currency , a critical omission in interpreting South Africa’s exchange control regulations . The dispute stems from a case in May , where Standard Bank filed against SARB, the Minister of Finance , Nedbank , and the liquidators of Leo Cash and Carry (LCC) . The bank sought to recover funds lent to LCC in 2022 before the company was placed under liquidation. LCC was later flagged by SARB’s Financial Surveillance Department (FinSurv) after it was revealed the company transferred 4,400 Bitcoins (valued at R566 million) to Seychelles-based Huobi Global exchange. The SARB maintains this action violated South Africa’s foreign exchange control laws . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Ban in Europe? EDPB Guidelines Could Outlaw BTC Over GDPR Conflict , SARB Defends Use of Regulation 22C The Pretoria High Court , led by Judge Mandlenkosi Motha , ruled that Regulation 22C — introduced during South Africa’s apartheid era — was not applicable for cryptocurrency regulation in 2025. Motha criticized the use of outdated laws to govern modern financial technology. However, the SARB strongly disagreed, asserting that Regulation 22C remains valid and empowers the Reserve Bank to block suspicious crypto transactions , especially when potential violations of exchange control laws are involved. Experts Weigh In: Did SARB Misstep? Harry Scherzer , a leading industry voice, says the SARB’s stance is flawed. He explained: “It was relatively clear that the Reserve Bank made an error in the sense that it allows people to evade exchange control, which basically makes the whole of exchange control redundant. You can essentially take out as much money as you want as crypto and send it into dollars abroad, and I’m sure there are some people that did exactly that.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T13:04:24,"Leveraged Bitcoin Longs on Bitfinex Weakest Since December and It Could Mean Rally Time","Those who have followed financial markets for some time may have heard of contrary indicators. These metrics are often misleading at first glance – some appear positive but tend to signal a market downtrend, while others that seem negative mark price upswings. One such contrary indicator is leveraged bitcoin longs on the crypto exchange Bitfinex. Historically, the number of leveraged longs on the exchange has tended to slide during bull runs and rise during bearish trends. As of writing, the number of BTCUSD longs on Bitfinex had fallen to 47,691, the lowest since December, offering bullish cues for bitcoin, according to data source TradingView. The tally of longs peaked in the first half of April and has been declining since then, characterizing BTC's rapid recovery from around $75K to record highs of over $110K. ""When Bitfinex Long Positions rise, the price tends to fall. When Long Positions drop, the price usually goes up,"" crypto analytics firm Alphractal said on X . Explaining the conundrum, Alphractal said that traders are typically wrong about the market direction. That leads to forced or discretionary liquidations, which drive the price in the opposite direction. ""As long as Bitfinex Long Positions keep dropping, Bitcoin will continue to rise,"" João Wedson, CEO of Alphractal, noted . The chart shows the contrary nature of the BTCUSD longs on Bitfinex. Since 2021, every major BTC rally, including those seen in November-December last year and the latest one from early April lows, has coincided with the slide in BTCUSD longs on the exchange. On the other hand, BTC's bear trends, including the 2022 crash and the decline from $100K to $75K seen early this year, occurred as BTC/USD longs surged.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/05/leveraged-bitcoin-longs-on-bitfinex-weakest-since-december-and-it-could-mean-rally-time,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|Bitcoin|Bitfinex|market analysis|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T13:02:19,"Here’s why Ravencoin price is rising, and why it may crash soon","Ravencoin, a Bitcoin clone, formed a God candle on Thursday, June 5, soaring to its highest point since December. Ravencoin ( RVN ) jumped to a high of $0.027, up 155% from its opening price and 210% from its lowest level in April. It then pulled back and settled at $0.016, giving it a market cap of $255 million. Ravencoin’s price spike followed its listing on Upbit, the largest South Korean crypto exchange. This listing triggered a surge in interest from South Korean traders, who can now buy the token using their local currency. CoinMarketCap data shows that most of Ravencoin’s trading volume occurred on Upbit. Its daily volume spiked to $445 million, with Upbit accounting for $170 million of that total. Ravencoin’s rally mirrored the performance of other cryptocurrencies after their Upbit listings. For example, Orca ( ORCA ) price surged by over 200% , while Arkham and Kaito rose 55% and 25%, respectively, following their listings. Most recently, tokens like Livepeer and Pocket Network also posted sharp gains after being listed. You might also like: Cardi B’s WAP memecoin pump ends in another rug pull … again This pattern stems from South Korea’s significance in the crypto market. A report from February showed that the country ranks as the third most active market after the United States and China, with average daily trading volume across South Korean exchanges climbing to $12 billion. However, these post-listing pumps often prove short-lived. Orca, for instance, jumped to $5.57 after its listing, only to plunge 70% to $1.698 within days. Similarly, Pocket Network rallied to $0.0898 last week but has since dropped 41% to $0.052. Ravencoin is a Bitcoin ( BTC ) fork optimized for lower transaction costs and faster speeds. One key difference is its supply cap: Ravencoin has a maximum supply of 21 billion coins, compared to Bitcoin’s 21 million. Ravencoin price analysis RVN price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that RVN bottomed at $0.008977 in April and then moved within an ascending channel. It dipped to the lower boundary of this channel earlier this week before forming a God candle following the Upbit listing. The price initially surged to $0.02573 before easing to $0.0166 as hype around the listing faded. Ravencoin remains above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, as well as the upper side of the ascending channel. Therefore, the most likely scenario is a continued pullback, potentially to $0.0125, its lowest swing point from August of last year. Such a move would imply a 25% decline from current levels.

2025-06-05T13:00:32,"Unwavering Crypto Market Resilience: Institutional Adoption Fuels Optimism Despite Weak US Data","BitcoinWorld Unwavering Crypto Market Resilience: Institutional Adoption Fuels Optimism Despite Weak US Data Are you wondering why the cryptocurrency market seems to be shrugging off disappointing economic news? You’re not alone. Despite recent reports indicating Weak US Economic Data , the crypto landscape, particularly Bitcoin, has demonstrated remarkable Crypto Market Resilience . This counter-intuitive strength is a hot topic among analysts, and a recent report from Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital sheds light on the underlying factors at play. Understanding the Impact of Weak US Economic Data Traditionally, weaker-than-expected economic data, such as employment figures or manufacturing indices, often signals potential economic slowdowns. In conventional financial markets, this can lead to uncertainty and sometimes a pullback in risk assets like stocks. Cryptocurrencies, while distinct, have historically shown some correlation with broader market sentiment and liquidity conditions. Recent data points that caught attention include: ADP Non-Farm Employment Change: This report provides an estimate of private-sector employment changes. A figure lower than forecasts can suggest a cooling labor market. ISM Manufacturing PMI: The Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers’ Index indicates the health of the manufacturing sector. A reading below 50 typically signals contraction. When these key indicators come in below expectations, it might prompt central banks to consider pausing or even cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy. While lower interest rates can sometimes be bullish for risk assets by making borrowing cheaper and increasing liquidity, the initial reaction to weak data can be negative due to growth concerns. However, the crypto market’s reaction this time has been notably different, highlighting its evolving dynamics. QCP Capital Analysis : Why the Market Remains Strong QCP Capital, through its official Telegram channel, provided a detailed analysis of the current market situation. Their key observation is the apparent disconnect between the negative macro signals and the positive price action and sentiment within the crypto space. They attribute this resilience to several powerful factors: According to QCP Capital, the market’s ability to absorb negative news stems from fundamental shifts and growing confidence: Growing Institutional Crypto Adoption : This is perhaps the most significant driver identified. As more corporations and large investment firms allocate capital to Bitcoin and other digital assets, it creates a steady demand floor that can offset selling pressure from macroeconomic fears. Bullish Market Structures: The firm noted positive technical indicators and price patterns that suggest upward momentum is building. Increasing Demand for Bitcoin Call Options: Call options give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy Bitcoin at a specific price in the future. High demand for these options signals that traders are betting on higher Bitcoin prices ahead, indicating bullish sentiment. This combination of structural demand from institutions and positive sentiment reflected in derivatives markets appears to be outweighing the immediate impact of concerning economic statistics. The Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption The narrative around Institutional Crypto Adoption has shifted dramatically over the past few years. What was once a fringe asset class is now becoming a legitimate consideration for corporate treasuries, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds. QCP Capital specifically mentioned companies like K Wave Media and Treasure Global adopting Bitcoin treasuries. These aren’t isolated incidents; they represent a broader trend: Type of Institution Examples of Adoption Impact on Market Public Companies Adding Bitcoin to balance sheets (e.g., MicroStrategy, Tesla – though holdings fluctuate), accepting crypto payments. Creates persistent demand, validates asset class. Asset Managers Launching crypto funds, offering crypto exposure to clients (e.g., Grayscale, traditional firms launching ETFs). Brings significant capital pools, increases accessibility for investors. Payment Processors Integrating crypto into payment networks (e.g., PayPal, Visa exploring stablecoins). Increases utility and mainstream acceptance. Investment Banks Offering crypto trading services, research, custody (e.g., Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan). Legitimizes the asset class, improves market infrastructure. This influx of institutional capital provides a robust foundation for Crypto Market Resilience . Unlike retail investors who might be more reactive to short-term news cycles, institutions often have longer-term investment horizons and perform extensive due diligence, suggesting a deeper conviction in the asset class’s future. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Price Prediction ? QCP Capital’s analysis, pointing to bullish market structures and strong call option demand, suggests optimism for the future price trajectory of Bitcoin. While no analysis is a guarantee, these indicators are often seen as positive signs by traders and analysts looking for clues about potential price movements. Factors contributing to a potentially positive Bitcoin Price Prediction include: Supply Halving: The recent Bitcoin halving event reduced the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, a factor historically associated with price appreciation due to reduced supply pressure. ETF Inflows: Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets continue to see significant inflows, directly translating institutional and retail investment into buying pressure on Bitcoin. Network Fundamentals: The Bitcoin network’s hash rate and security remain strong, reflecting underlying health and confidence in the protocol. Growing Utility: Development in the Lightning Network and other layers continues to enhance Bitcoin’s potential for faster, cheaper transactions. While Weak US Economic Data could theoretically introduce headwinds, the narrative from QCP Capital and other observers is that the internal crypto market dynamics, particularly adoption and structural demand, are currently more dominant forces shaping the immediate Bitcoin Price Prediction . Challenges and Actionable Insights Despite the positive outlook highlighted by the QCP Capital Analysis , it’s crucial to remain aware of potential challenges: Persistence of Weak Data: If weak economic data continues or worsens significantly, it could eventually impact corporate earnings, institutional investment budgets, and overall market liquidity, potentially creating headwinds for crypto. Regulatory Uncertainty: Regulatory developments in major economies can still introduce volatility and uncertainty into the market. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Even with bullish signals, sharp price swings are possible. For investors, the key takeaway from this analysis is that focusing solely on traditional macro indicators might not provide the full picture for cryptocurrency markets today. The increasing influence of Institutional Crypto Adoption and the unique supply/demand dynamics of assets like Bitcoin are powerful counter-forces. Actionable Insights: Diversify Information Sources: Look beyond traditional economic news and consider crypto-native analysis, like that from QCP Capital, which focuses on on-chain data, market structure, and adoption trends. Understand Institutional Flows: Pay attention to reports on ETF inflows, corporate treasury announcements, and investment bank activities in the crypto space, as these are significant demand drivers. Monitor Derivatives Markets: While complex, indicators like call option demand can offer clues about professional trader sentiment and expectations for Bitcoin Price Prediction . Maintain a Long-Term Perspective: The increasing institutional involvement suggests a maturing market, but short-term volatility remains. A long-term view is often beneficial. Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Market Resilience ? The recent demonstration of Crypto Market Resilience in the face of discouraging Weak US Economic Data , as highlighted by the comprehensive QCP Capital Analysis , suggests a potential shift in how external macro factors influence digital asset prices. The growing wave of Institutional Crypto Adoption appears to be creating a more robust market structure, less susceptible to the immediate jitters caused by traditional economic reports. While challenges and volatility persist, the underlying trend of increasing institutional interest and bullish technical indicators points towards continued optimism for the future Bitcoin Price Prediction and the broader crypto market. This period might well be marking a new era where internal market strength and institutional demand play a more decisive role in shaping the crypto landscape.

The very first life insurance company, The Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, was founded in London in 1706, he noted, and Meanwhile essentially follows the same blueprint today. Clients pay for their life insurance in bitcoin and receive a bitcoin payment once the insurance kicks in. Payouts aren’t impacted by any shifts in the dollar value of a bitcoin. The audit, performed by Harris & Trotter, shows that Meanwhile had 220.4 BTC in total assets and had net income of 25.29 BTC for the year ended December 31, 2024. Meanwhile is a Bitcoin Treasury company, Townsend said, but it’s of a different breed from firms such as Strategy or Metaplanet, which use elaborate financial products to grow their bitcoin stash. Meanwhile accumulates bitcoin by operating a bitcoin business and generating bitcoin revenue. Besides, Bermuda regulation prohibits Meanwhile from selling its assets, since most of the firm’s bitcoin is held on behalf of its clients. “Owning life insurance is a bit like having savings,” Townsend said, adding that it matters to pick a currency that won’t suffer from strong inflation, as happened to — for instance — the Argentinian peso. A bitcoin-denominated life insurance eliminates that risk, although policyholders may suffer losses if, say, bitcoin’s value crashes and fails to recover. “This [audit] is an important, foundational step in reimagining the financial system based on a single, global, decentralized standard outside the control of any one government,” Townsend added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/05/bitcoin-life-insurance-firm-meanwhile-shares-first-audit,"BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION","Finance|Bitcoin|Insurance|News",cryptocompare

Core Foundation, which leverages Bitcoin's security and infrastructure to create a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) layer and a DeFi ecosystem, announced BitGo and KODA as validator sets for the Core network, marking a significant step forward in institutional adoption of Bitcoin-native DeFi. The onboarding of BitGo, a U.S.-qualified institutional-grade custodian and financial services company, brings a legacy of regulatory credibility and security-first principles to the validator set, now comprising 29 members, the press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk stated. Integrating with KODA, the South Korean institutional custodian powered by Nodeinfra, will expands Core's footprints in Asia. In Korea, over 20% of the population owns crypto, and KODA's presence on Core is expected to accelerate the latter's growth in staking and institutional yield in the region. ""Adding BitGo and KODA as validators on Core marks a significant expansion of the validator set. These two leading custodians will further support Core's efforts to scale Bitcoin utility and drive institutional adoption of scalable Bitcoin yield products,"" Brendon Sedo, Core's initial contributor, said. Nodeinfra's CEO, John Youngseok Yang, stated that the strategic partnership will lay the groundwork for institutional BTC staking in Korea. The Core blockchain ( CORE ) is a scaling and programmability solution for Bitcoin powered by its Satoshi Plus consensus, a hybrid mechanism that allows BTC miners, BTC holders and CORE stakers to participate in consensus. It combines elements of Proof of Work and Proof of Stake to ensure security while maintaining scalability without compromising decentralization. As of writing, more than $500 million in BTC is staked with the network, supposedly secured by approximately 75% of the Bitcoin hashrate, making it the most Bitcoin-aligned Layer 1, according to the press release. Core powers institutional-grade products such as lstBTC, a liquid and yield-bearing representation of BTC that can be used as collateral across major exchanges, and Valour’s Yield-Bearing BTC ETP, which provides regulated exposure to Bitcoin yield. Core is among the leading projects addressing the Bitcoin blockchain's limited programmability and lack of native yield to accelerate BTC DeFi.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/05/core-foundation-bitcoin-layer-1-with-over-usd500m-staked-btc-adds-bitgo-and-koda-as-validators,"ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|SPONSORED|CORE","Finance|Bitcoin|Core dao|Markets|DeFi|BitGo|KODA|Exclusive|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T12:50:52,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Bluebird Mining Makes Bold Shift Using Gold Revenue","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Bluebird Mining Makes Bold Shift Using Gold Revenue In a move that bridges the gap between traditional industry and the digital asset world, Bluebird Mining Ventures, a publicly listed UK mining company, recently announced a significant shift in its financial approach. The company, known for its gold mining projects, is set to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy , leveraging revenue generated from its gold operations to acquire and hold Bitcoin (BTC) on its balance sheet. This announcement, made via the company’s official X account, signals a growing trend of companies exploring digital assets as a component of their corporate finance and investment strategies. For a gold mining company to pivot towards Bitcoin in this manner is particularly noteworthy, given gold’s historical status as a premier store of value. What is Bluebird Mining’s Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Bluebird Mining Ventures operates primarily in the gold sector. Their core business involves extracting gold, a tangible asset valued globally for centuries. The traditional path for a mining company’s revenue is reinvestment in operations, debt reduction, dividends, or holding fiat currency reserves. However, Bluebird is charting a different course. Their new Bitcoin treasury strategy involves allocating a portion of the income derived from their gold sales towards purchasing Bitcoin. This means that as they mine and sell gold, instead of keeping all the proceeds in traditional cash or short-term investments, they will be converting some of that value into the leading cryptocurrency. This approach is a form of corporate treasury management that seeks to diversify asset holdings beyond traditional fiat and potentially hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. It’s a strategic decision that reflects a belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and growth asset. How Gold Mining Revenue Fuels Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The connection between gold mining revenue and institutional Bitcoin adoption is fascinating. Gold has long been considered a safe-haven asset and a hedge against economic uncertainty. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by many as ‘digital gold’ – a scarce, decentralized asset with similar properties, but with the advantages of digital transferability and a verifiable, fixed supply cap (21 million coins). For a company whose business is centered around extracting one store of value (gold) to invest in another (Bitcoin) using the revenue from the first, it creates a unique synergy. It suggests that even players deeply entrenched in traditional safe assets see value and potential in the emerging digital asset class. This move by Bluebird Mining could serve as a case study for other traditional commodity-based companies considering similar strategies. It demonstrates a potential pathway for businesses with significant physical asset revenue streams to gain exposure to digital assets, contributing to the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . The Mechanics: How Does a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Work? Implementing a corporate Bitcoin strategy involves more than just buying BTC. Companies need to consider several operational and financial aspects: Custody: How will the Bitcoin be securely stored? This requires robust security protocols, potentially using multi-signature wallets or engaging with institutional-grade custodians. Accounting: How will Bitcoin holdings be accounted for on the balance sheet? Current accounting standards often treat Bitcoin as an intangible asset, which can lead to volatility in reported earnings due to impairment rules if the price drops below the purchase cost. Purchasing: How will large amounts of Bitcoin be acquired? This might involve over-the-counter (OTC) desks or executing trades on regulated exchanges to minimize market impact. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets in their operating jurisdictions. Risk Management: Developing strategies to manage price volatility risk, security risks, and potential regulatory changes. For Bluebird Mining, integrating these considerations into their existing financial and operational framework, which is built around physical asset management and sales (gold), will be key to the success of their corporate Bitcoin strategy . Benefits and Challenges of Holding Bitcoin in Treasury Adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy comes with potential upsides and significant risks. Companies weigh these carefully: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Like gold, Bitcoin is seen by many as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its fixed supply. Store of Value: Its scarcity and global accessibility make it an attractive potential long-term store of value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional treasury portfolio can offer diversification benefits, as its price movements may not be perfectly correlated with traditional assets. Potential Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s value continues to grow, the company’s treasury holdings could increase significantly. Attracting Investors: A forward-thinking approach to treasury management, particularly involving digital assets, might appeal to a new class of investors interested in both traditional sectors and cryptocurrency. Key Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings, which can impact the reported value of treasury holdings and create financial uncertainty. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, which could introduce unforeseen challenges. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of digital assets requires extremely robust cybersecurity measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules can make holding Bitcoin challenging for public companies, potentially leading to non-cash impairment charges that affect earnings reports. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, Bitcoin still carries some stigma or misunderstanding for traditional investors. Bluebird Mining’s decision indicates they believe the potential benefits outweigh these challenges, or that they have developed strategies to mitigate the risks effectively. Examples: Who Else is Adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Bluebird Mining is not the first company to implement a corporate Bitcoin strategy , but they are a notable addition, particularly from the traditional mining sector. The trend was significantly popularized by companies like: MicroStrategy: Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been a pioneer and arguably the most aggressive corporate adopter, holding billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Tesla: Elon Musk’s company famously purchased a significant amount of Bitcoin, though they have also sold some holdings since. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also invested in Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury. These examples highlight that companies across various sectors – from software (MicroStrategy) and automotive/tech (Tesla) to financial services (Block) – are exploring or have adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Bluebird Mining’s entry adds the traditional resource sector to this growing list, further demonstrating the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Actionable Insights: What This Means for Investors? Bluebird Mining’s adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy provides several insights for investors: Cross-Industry Adoption is Growing: This move reinforces the idea that Bitcoin’s appeal is broadening beyond the tech and finance sectors, penetrating traditional industries like gold mining . Potential for Other Miners: If successful, this strategy could inspire other mining or commodity companies to consider similar approaches, potentially increasing corporate demand for Bitcoin. Understanding Company Strategy: Investors in Bluebird Mining now need to understand not just the dynamics of gold markets but also the implications of holding a volatile digital asset like Bitcoin. The company’s performance will be influenced by both gold prices and BTC prices. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: This case further validates the narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset for corporations, alongside cash, bonds, and other traditional holdings. For those interested in the intersection of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies, Bluebird Mining’s strategy offers a compelling case study to watch. Conclusion: A Golden Bridge to Digital Assets Bluebird Mining Ventures’ decision to use gold mining revenue for a Bitcoin treasury strategy is a landmark development. It signifies a forward-thinking approach that leverages the value generated from a traditional, tangible asset (gold) to invest in a modern, digital asset (Bitcoin). This move contributes significantly to the narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption and highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate component of corporate finance. While challenges remain, Bluebird’s bold step could pave the way for other companies in traditional sectors to explore the potential benefits of holding digital assets. It’s a fascinating evolution in corporate treasury management, demonstrating how even industries built on centuries-old foundations are beginning to embrace the future of finance.

2025-06-05T12:50:47,"Ethereum stalls at $2,650 while Bitcoin Pepe eyes post-listing breakout","Ethereum (ETH) is currently hovering around $2,607 as the market digests a wave of developments ranging from internal protocol restructuring to mounting whale activity. At the same time, Bitcoin Pepe, a meme-fueled Layer 2 project on Bitcoin, is riding strong presale momentum as it inches closer to a listing announcement expected on June 17. Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow Presale AnnouncementWe’ve been working closely with exchanges, but as these things go, they need a bit more time to finalise. Therefore, our listing announcement is now set for June 17th, with more info coming 🗓️To thank our early supporters, we’re giving a 30% bonus to 6:00 PM · Jun 2, 2025 48 Reply Copy link Read 14 replies Investors are watching both assets closely, with Ethereum struggling to reclaim bullish ground and Bitcoin Pepe preparing for a potential breakout ahead of its exchange debut. Ethereum price amid cautious whale accumulation after restructuring Ethereum has faced repeated resistance at the $2,680 level, even after the Ethereum Foundation launched its new initiative called Protocol, aimed at scaling the network and improving user experience. Protocol is the result of a significant internal restructuring within the Ethereum Foundation , including layoffs and a rebranding of its core research and development division. The reorganization reflects Ethereum’s growing urgency to streamline how core upgrades are delivered, with the Foundation now focused on scaling Layer 1, boosting Blobspace for data availability, and enhancing UX. Despite the positive narrative shift, Ethereum price action remains limited by a key rising trendline resistance and has failed to sustain its gains above $2,680. On Wednesday, ETH was seen consolidating within a narrow band between its 200-day EMA at $2,461 and daily resistance at $2,680 for over 26 days, suggesting a breakout is imminent. There is also a rising wedge, which further supports the bullish outbreak scenario, especially seeing that it has been forming higher highs and higher lows. Technical indicators also show a bullish tilt, with the RSI at around 62 and both the MACD and Stochastic Oscillator in bullish territory, pointing to growing momentum. Ethereum price target |Source: TradingView If Ethereum can break and hold above $2,680, it could target $2,824 in the short term, a level that would mark a psychological and structural recovery. However, a drop below its 200-day EMA would open the doors for a decline toward $2,340, where the 50-day EMA offers secondary support. Adding to the cautious optimism is notable whale accumulation, with $364 million in ETH purchased by three key addresses in a 24-hour span, including a $320 million acquisition by a wallet linked to Consensys. While these high-value buys reflect strategic confidence, broader whale activity remains muted, with large transactions falling sharply from earlier this year. Data from IntoTheBlock shows a drastic decline in ETH transactions over $100,000, suggesting many large holders remain on the sidelines. Still, the Whale Netflow Ratio is currently negative, indicating more ETH is moving off exchanges than onto them, which is typically a bullish signal for price stability. The overall picture points to selective institutional confidence, with the Ethereum mainnet gradually reclaiming DeFi market share due to a $480 billion surge in stablecoin volume driven by automated bots. Bitcoin Pepe rallies on presale success as it approaches key listing milestone Bitcoin Pepe, the meme-driven Layer 2 ecosystem building on Bitcoin, has become one of the most talked-about crypto projects in 2025. The project’s presale has already reached its final stage, attracting thousands of investors and building hype ahead of its first major listing announcement scheduled for June 17. Only 12 days remain until the anticipated announcement, and interest continues to build as Bitcoin Pepe’s retail-focused narrative, high APYs, and Solana-style scalability on Bitcoin draw wider attention. Unlike other meme coins, Bitcoin Pepe combines a viral, culturally rich brand with actual utility through its Layer 2 architecture and a DeFi-ready roadmap . The presale’s staged pricing model has rewarded early entrants while increasing FOMO for those trying to secure tokens before the public launch. With its staking pools offering aggressive yields and a community that is growing by the day, Bitcoin Pepe stands out as more than just a speculative meme play. Its Layer 2 design positions it as a scalable DeFi contender on Bitcoin, an ecosystem that has long lacked meme-native infrastructure with serious traction. Momentum continues to build as retail sentiment shifts in favour of high-potential low-cap assets, especially those with a viral edge and an upcoming catalyst. Bitcoin Pepe’s combination of narrative, timing, and community engagement makes it a project to watch as the listing announcement nears. Investors looking for early-stage exposure before exchange listings are viewing this final presale window as a rare entry point ahead of broader market discovery. As Ethereum consolidates and broader markets wait for confirmation of trend reversals, Bitcoin Pepe is capturing attention with strong upside potential heading into mid-June.

2025-06-05T12:49:38,"Top 3 Altcoins Whales Are Buying Right Now","The post Top 3 Altcoins Whales Are Buying Right Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto field is poised for a potential rebound, major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are becoming choice’s of major crypto whales. The smart money’s move for these assets, is fiercely hinting that a market resurgence in June, seems more likely then ever. Similarly, the top crypto BTC also showered optimism, as its spot ETFs faced three consecutive days of outflows, and data from Santiment shows that whales have a worth of over $8.3 billion, just last week. Meanwhile, its strong correlation with the Global M2 money supply has increased experts’ conviction for its price to hit $150,000. These growing bullish factors suggests that the next crypto sector’s brewing alt season could be even more parabolic than previous cycles. As, BTC aside, Whales are stacking altcoins in anticipation of a rally. In late May, the sector saw a slowdown, but this dip has not deterred major investors, who are seizing the opportunity to accumulate promising altcoins. Keep reading as crypto whales are setting the stage for a significant shift as we have moved already into June. Ethereum (ETH) According to data from Lookonchain , a crypto whale utilized Galaxy Digital’s OTC wallet to obtain 108,278 ETH, amounting to $283 million. Before several hours of this move, this whale had already withdrawn 89,000 ETH, amounting to $233 million. Now, all combined 139,476 ETH amounting to $365 Million in total sits in a wallet address “0x0b26”. This move is not any reckless move, the way address moved his assets clearly showed a well-devised accumulation strategy that has been made for future increase in Ethereum’s price . Additionally, on the daily chart, the ETH price is above major EMAs and seems the Fibonacci 50% zone is set to break in June for the Fibonacci 78.6% and 100% targets (Q4 2024’s High). Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Apart from the second most dominant crypto, which has attracted significant attention from Crypto whales, is Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). According to data from Lookonchain , three whales purchased 9.2 million FARTCOIN, amounting to $9.5 million, showing a highly optimistic vision for FARTCOIN’s growth potential. At the time of writing, FARTCOIN is trading at $0.8910, down 5.7% over the past 24 hours. However, some traders remain quite optimistic after knowing the whale’s activity, the long-term price of this meme could go to the Fibonacci 100% level around ATH $2.7321, but a crash would lead to its lowest demand zone. Hyperliquid (HYPE) The recent surge in HYPE is due to the hype around a trader named James Wynn on Hyperliquid and the BINANCE listing announcement. Amid this optimism, data from OnchainLens highlights that one crypto whale spent an amount worth $6 million over a consistent three days to buy over 170,000 HYPE. Taking into account all bullish factors of recent times, the participation of large investors has increased, which indicates strong confidence in the HYPE price’s long-term potential. Per the Fibonacci, if ATH is broken, then $58 is likely next. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin’s price reacted immediately with a surge of $1,000, taking it from $104,500 to $105,500. The European Central Bank cut rates and further widened a gap with the Federal Reserve that has fueled President Trump’s calls for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to follow suit https://t.co/Lq7suXwqxJ — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) June 5, 2025 The current interest rates in the Eurozone have dropped to 2%, the lowest level since early 2023. This comes amid a slowing of inflation in the region and despite the threat of tariffs by US President Donald Trump. This is the eighth rate cut from the ECB, which is a stark contrast to what the US Federal Reserve is doing. Recall that the US central bank lowered the rates twice in late 2024, but has maintained them unchanged ever since. This has prompted US President Donald Trump to urge Fed Chair Powell to start cutting the rates, otherwise the risk of a macro crisis grows.

Here Are the Details","According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine, UK publicly traded gold mining company Bluebird Mining Ventures is taking a significant step into the digital asset space by announcing plans to adopt the Bitcoin treasury strategy. UK-Based Bluebird Mining Ventures Decides to Adopt Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The company said it will begin converting future revenues from its gold mining projects into Bitcoin, signaling a strategic transformation to align with the growing trend of businesses using BTC as a long-term store of value. Bluebird Mining Ventures owns three major gold mining projects — two in South Korea and one in the Philippines — with a combined gold resource of about 1.8 million ounces. The company’s decision reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and global economic uncertainty. By integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury, Bluebird joins a growing list of companies seeking to diversify their balance sheets with tangible assets that provide portability, transparency, and resistance to monetary depreciation. The move is particularly notable given Bluebird’s roots in the traditional commodities sector, and signals that there could be greater convergence between traditional natural resource companies and digital financial infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T12:40:52,"Japan Blockchain Investment: SMBC Nikko Backs Hashed Ventures Fund in Pivotal Institutional Move","BitcoinWorld Japan Blockchain Investment: SMBC Nikko Backs Hashed Ventures Fund in Pivotal Institutional Move Hey crypto enthusiasts and finance watchers! Get ready for some significant news straight out of Japan. We’ve just seen a major move that signals how traditional finance giants are increasingly looking towards the future of digital assets and blockchain technology. This isn’t just any news; it’s about a heavyweight player making a strategic bet in the evolving world of crypto venture capital. Let’s dive into what this Japan blockchain investment means. A Major Japanese Financial Group Makes a Pivotal Move So, what exactly happened? SMBC Nikko Securities, which is a key subsidiary of the massive Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates, has officially invested in a prominent blockchain venture capital firm. This isn’t a small, experimental fund; they’ve backed Hashed Ventures’ Hashed Venture Fund III. Think of SMFG as a pillar of the Japanese financial system, managing vast amounts of capital and involved in banking, securities, leasing, and more. For a group of this stature to put capital into a dedicated blockchain fund is a powerful statement. While the specific amount of the SMBC Nikko investment hasn’t been publicly disclosed, the fact that it happened at all is the headline here. It shows a tangible commitment to exploring and potentially capitalizing on the growth within the blockchain ecosystem, moving beyond just observing from the sidelines. Understanding the Hashed Ventures Fund Now, who is Hashed Ventures, and what makes their fund attractive to a traditional financial giant like SMBC Nikko? Hashed is a well-regarded venture capital firm with a strong focus on the blockchain and Web3 space. They’ve been active players, identifying and supporting startups building the next generation of decentralized applications, infrastructure, and protocols. The Hashed Ventures fund , specifically Fund III in this case, is designed to deploy capital into promising projects within this rapidly expanding sector. Their expertise lies in navigating the complexities of the crypto market, understanding emerging trends like DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), gaming, and underlying blockchain infrastructure. For SMBC Nikko, investing in a specialized fund like Hashed Venture Fund III offers a way to gain exposure to this high-growth, albeit volatile, market segment without having to build the internal expertise from scratch. It’s a common strategy for traditional institutions looking to dip their toes into new asset classes: partner with or invest in those already deeply embedded in the space. The Growing Wave of Institutional Crypto Adoption This development isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a broader, accelerating trend: institutional crypto adoption . We’ve seen banks, asset managers, corporations, and even governments around the world start to engage with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in various ways. This ranges from offering crypto-related services to clients, investing directly in digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, building blockchain infrastructure, or, as in this case, investing in venture funds focused on the space. Why the sudden interest? Institutions are recognizing the potential of blockchain to revolutionize finance, improve efficiency, and create new investment opportunities. They also face pressure from clients and competitors who are already moving into the space. While retail interest often drives headlines, institutional capital brings significant resources, legitimacy, and long-term potential to the market. The SMBC Nikko investment is a clear indicator that this trend is not slowing down and is reaching into major economies like Japan. What This Japan Blockchain Investment Signifies Let’s unpack the significance of this particular Japan blockchain investment . Firstly, it’s a strong vote of confidence from a major traditional financial player in the future of blockchain technology and the crypto ecosystem. SMBC Nikko isn’t just exploring; they are putting capital at risk through a dedicated fund investment. Secondly, it highlights the increasing convergence between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) or Web3. These worlds, once seen as entirely separate, are finding points of connection and collaboration. Thirdly, it positions Japan, which has sometimes been seen as cautious in the crypto space despite being an early adopter, as a market where major financial institutions are actively participating in the ecosystem’s growth. This could potentially pave the way for more investments and collaborations between traditional Japanese firms and crypto-native companies. Potential Benefits and Implications: Increased Legitimacy: An investment from a firm like SMBC Nikko lends credibility to the blockchain space and Hashed Ventures specifically. Capital Inflow: More institutional capital means more resources available for promising blockchain startups to build and innovate. Network Effects: Hashed Ventures gains access to the vast network and expertise of SMBC Nikko and SMFG, potentially opening doors for portfolio companies. Future Collaboration Potential: This could be a precursor to deeper partnerships or SMBC Nikko exploring direct blockchain applications within their own business. Boost for the Japanese Ecosystem: Encourages other Japanese firms to consider similar moves, fostering growth within the local blockchain scene. Challenges and Considerations for a Japanese Financial Group Crypto Move While the investment is positive news, it’s important to consider the potential challenges and nuances involved when a large Japanese financial group crypto investment occurs. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain is still evolving globally, and particularly in Japan, which has a relatively clear but strict framework. Future regulatory changes could impact the performance of the fund or the operations of the portfolio companies. The crypto market itself is known for its volatility, which can pose risks to investment returns. Furthermore, integrating the culture and operational models of traditional finance with the fast-paced, often less formal world of crypto startups can present challenges. However, by investing through a specialized VC fund like Hashed, SMBC Nikko is mitigating some of these direct operational risks while still gaining exposure. Key Considerations: Regulatory Environment: Staying ahead of potential shifts in Japanese and global crypto regulations. Market Volatility: Managing the inherent risks associated with investments in a volatile asset class. Due Diligence: The importance of rigorous evaluation of blockchain projects by the fund managers. Long-Term Vision: This is likely a long-term play, and returns may take time to materialize. Actionable Insights for Readers What can you take away from this development? If you’re interested in the intersection of traditional finance and crypto, keep a close eye on major financial institutions like SMBC Nikko and SMFG. Their strategic moves provide valuable insights into how the mainstream financial world views and is approaching the blockchain space. Monitor the types of projects that Hashed Ventures Fund III invests in, as this can indicate areas of anticipated growth within the ecosystem. This Japan blockchain investment is a signal that despite market fluctuations, the underlying technology and its potential continue to attract serious capital from powerful traditional players. It reinforces the narrative that blockchain and crypto are becoming increasingly integrated into the global financial landscape. Conclusion: A Significant Step Forward The investment by SMBC Nikko Securities, a subsidiary of the influential SMFG, into Hashed Venture Fund III is a significant milestone. It underscores the growing confidence among major traditional financial institutions in the potential of blockchain technology and the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic move by a prominent Japanese financial group crypto investment vehicle not only provides valuable capital to the space but also adds a layer of legitimacy that can encourage further institutional participation. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized technology continue to blur, investments like the SMBC Nikko investment in the Hashed Ventures fund highlight the irreversible trend of institutional crypto adoption .
