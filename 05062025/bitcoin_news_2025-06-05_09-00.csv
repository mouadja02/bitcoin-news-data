2025-06-05T06:55:06,"What to Expect in Bitcoin Price in the Next Three Months, What to Watch Out For?","QCP, one of the leading analysis companies in cryptocurrency markets, has published its market report today. While unexpectedly strong employment data increased risk appetite, eyes turned to the critical non-farm employment data to be released on Friday. While the upward movement in the US stock markets is drawing attention, the S&P 500 index is gradually advancing towards 6,000 points, a psychologically important level. According to the analyst firm, stable nonfarm payrolls data will strengthen the Fed's rhetoric about the resilience of the labor market and increase expectations that interest rates will remain steady. According to QCP’s analysis, on the trade front, markets are focused on the upcoming talks between the US and China. This cautious wait is also reflected in the crypto market. While Bitcoin’s short-term volatility has declined, spot prices are trading sideways in the $105,000 band. One-month implied volatility has fallen below 40%. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Adds a Surprise Altcoin to its Listing Roadmap Bitcoin continues to trade in a narrow price range, while the low open interest and the normalization of the skew indicate that the market is indecisive about the direction. Since May, the volatility curve has flattened, especially in the medium and long term. This situation parallels the decline in the VIX index and causes some investors to take long volatility positions. In particular, the purchase of the September term $130,000 call option with 47 percent volatility reveals a partial increase expectation for the third quarter. According to QCP, the third quarter could be more challenging. While the effects of customs duties are expected to be reflected in macroeconomic data, uncertainties about the fiscal package called the “Big Beautiful Bill (BBB)” and the debt ceiling could cause volatility. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T06:51:32,"Bitcoin Sees Surge in Profit-Taking and Whale Accumulation Amid ETF Outflows","The recent all-time high Bitcoin achieved in its market has sent ripples of fresh activity across the crypto scene. Those who thought the wave of profit-taking seen in September and October was the peak of that wave were mistaken. Bitcoin ETF inflows had finally returned after long being absent, and now that trend is in reverse with leading ETFs experiencing outflows. With prices moving to unprecedented heights, the typical Bitcoin investor is watching their stake ascend into profitable territory—with coins now locked in at an average profit of 16%. Historically, the average trading day has offered fewer than 8% of trading days that have been more profitable for investors. That signals a shift. Not all market participants are piling in, but the ones who are seem to be taking advantage of the price movement and securing profitable exits. Profit-Taking Begins as Market Reaches Overbought Levels The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value has prompted an increased amount of profit-taking among investors. According to blockchain data, the average Bitcoin that changed hands carried a gain of 16% as of last week. That means a lot of people who have held onto their coins are finally cashing in after many months of accumulation. And this profit-taking, by our estimate, puts today’s trading environment among the top 8% of all days in Bitcoin’s history in terms of investor gains. The recent #Bitcoin ATH breakout has led to a notable uptick in profits locked in, with the average coin capturing a +16% profit. Fewer than 8% of trading days have been more profitable for investors, suggesting a meaningful transition into profit-taking activity is underway. pic.twitter.com/3Fz1A6Ccis — glassnode (@glassnode) June 3, 2025 Profits taken at such high realized levels tend to put downward pressure on prices, so it’s no surprise to see local price corrections occurring after such a big move. Our earlier work has shown that when overheated markets experience this kind of profit-taking activity, they typically cool off for a bit before they’re potentially able to make new highs. Even so, the overall mood is still quite positive. The long-term case for investing in Bitcoin continues to pull in backing from both institutions and individuals, even as those who trade in it for short-term gains have just spent a few days adjusting their positions. Whales and Mid-Sized Holders Step Up Accumulation Even with the recent profit-taking surge, crucial Bitcoin investors are sticking around. Indeed, wallets that hold between 10 and 10,000 BTC have seen substantial inflows in the past week. They now total 151,820 on the Bitcoin network, and these accreting wallets have collectively added around 79,244 BTC over just the last seven days, which breaks down to an average of over 11,321 coins per day. There are now 151,820 wallets holding between 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin. These key stakeholders have aggressively been accumulating over the past week, collectively adding 79,244 $BTC (11,321 coins accumulated per day). pic.twitter.com/jWUtqOFaPO — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 3, 2025 This assertive accumulation highlights that strategic investors are still confident in the market and are positioning themselves ahead of potential future market changes. These wallets—often seen as sorts of ecosystem stakeholders—act as early indicators of investor bullishness. Significantly, certain of the biggest whales in the network have seized this moment to load up on Bitcoin. Just in the last 96 hours alone, these high-net-worth entities have bought more than 30,000 BTC. They seem to be on a buying spree, perhaps indicating that they view the recent all-time high (ATH) as a market high not. Rather, it looks like they see the recent price action as a further step toward price discovery. Whale accumulation at this scale has historically been a powerful signal of long-term market strength, often occurring just before or during major upward movements. Their continued accumulation, even as ETFs show signs of weakening demand, hints at a possible divergence between retail or institutional ETF flows and direct, on-chain holdings. Some of the biggest whales on the network have bought over 30,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/Z0Ujszhdnc — Ali (@ali_charts) June 3, 2025 ETF Outflows Hit $1.21 Billion Amid Uncertainty Unlike on-chain Bitcoin accumulation, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing the opposite trajectory. Over the last three days of trading, the U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs have seen an unprecedented $1.21 billion in net outflows. That’s the largest volume of capital that has exited the Bitcoin ETF market since mid-March. The current outflows could be a combination of profit-taking by investors, general economic uncertainty, or perhaps a shift back to direct Bitcoin holdings and other crypto assets. Bitcoin's ETF's have seen significant money outflowing for three straight days now. There has been a total of $1.21B in net outflows, marking the first time we've seen $1B or more moving out of ETF's since the 2nd week of March. pic.twitter.com/Gz4cj60Dh1 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 4, 2025 Before this year, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs had been tepid. But ETF providers had driven significant recent inflows into Bitcoin itself, bringing the price up toward recent highs. When those inflows began to reverse in late August and early September, it marked the first time in a while that institutional repositioning. Either way, this is a reported example of Bitcoin ETFs reversing recent inflows and going into outflows. Yet, some analysts say that the ETF outflows might be temporary and are linked to bigger financial market adjustments and not necessarily to any dwindling confidence in Bitcoin. They point to the fact that some major holders have been buying up Bitcoin aggressively just lately (and that on-chain fundamentals are still looking pretty strong) as evidence that the current development is a healthy, rebalancing state of affairs and not the opening act of some larger downturn. Conclusion Bitcoin has recently hit a new all-time high, and this has set the stage for something potentially major in the market. Traders have taken this opportunity to book some profits. But what has been far more interesting is the behavior of long-term holders and larger investors, who seem to be the very same individuals that have largely been absent from this market since its last high in late 2021. Long-term investors and notable “whales” in this space have been steadily buying, which signals that these entities might have a fortified belief in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Blending caution with conviction, the current landscape has Bitcoin on the verge of a new chapter. Three forces shape this next sequence for Bitcoin. First is reduced supply on exchanges—an unfriendly development for sellers. Second is expanding institutional adoption, with big players like Blackrock banging down the door to get in on the action. Third is growing global awareness, with everything from Google searches to nationwide protests in your face inducing even more people to notice Bitcoin.

The drop comes as concerns over U.S. trade tariffs and a weaker economy weigh on investor confidence. After reaching record highs in late May, Bitcoin has struggled to move higher. Recent profit-taking has also added pressure, leading to questions about whether the bull run is slowing down or just taking a break. In a recent interview, crypto expert and “Wolf of All Streets” host Scott Melker confirmed that Bitcoin is still in a bull market, fueled by unprecedented institutional interest. Melker emphasized that even amid global volatility and rising bond yields, Bitcoin’s strength signals a major shift in how investors view the asset. Top 4 Catalysts Fueling Bitcoin’s 2025 Rally When asked about the most impactful developments driving Bitcoin’s adoption and price surge in 2025, Melker ranked the following: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approvals – The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s pro-Bitcoin stance marked a pivotal moment. Melker called Fink’s public support a “turning point,” highlighting how major institutions now view Bitcoin as a credible and strategic asset. Donald Trump’s Pro-Crypto Pivot – The U.S. president’s public embrace of crypto and NFTs gave the space significant political backing. His influence, Melker said, created a “massive catalyst” for mainstream attention and regulatory momentum. Sovereign Wealth Fund Inflows – Investments from the Middle East and other regions are just beginning, with Melker predicting that a 1% allocation from global sovereign funds could trigger a massive surge due to Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Corporate Treasury Adoption – While not new, companies following MicroStrategy’s lead in holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets continue to validate Bitcoin’s utility as a hedge and long-term asset. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: $150K to $300K? Looking ahead, Melker predicts Bitcoin could climb conservatively to $130K–$150K , with a more optimistic ceiling of $230K to $300K this cycle. While cautious due to prior overestimations, he noted that Bitcoin is already trading above $100K, making further gains feasible. “To go to $150K is a rounding error from here,” said Melker, pointing out that current ETF flows and institutional accumulation are likely to continue. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Chamath Palihapitiya Predicts Ripple, Coinbase, and Stripe Will Fight for USDC Dominance , Melker also questioned the sustainability of the traditional four-year crypto cycle, suggesting that drawdowns may now be smaller , with Bitcoin becoming a more stable and institutionalized asset. Rather than sharp 80% crashes followed by massive rallies, he sees the market evolving into a “grind up and dip” cycle—gradually increasing over time with less extreme volatility. Time To Buy Bitcoin? While acknowledging the “sell in May and go away” mantra from traditional markets, Melker advised long-term investors to keep buying: “Buy in May, buy in June, buy in July,” he said. “Use the dips to dollar-cost average—this is a long game.”Despite the seasonal lull, Melker believes Bitcoin’s downside is increasingly limited , especially compared to stocks, and ETF investors are more likely to hold than trade on daily price movements. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T06:38:25,"XRP Primed To Move Higher As Chinese Company Plans $300 Million XRP Treasury Plan","China-based Webus International (WETO) submitted a Form 6-K with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, setting the stage for a potential corporate treasury based on the Ripple-linked XRP token. Foreign private issuers with securities traded on US exchanges use Form 6-K to disclose material updates to U.S. investors. According to the filing, the Nasdaq-listed automotive and hospitality company is exploring a financing strategy of up to $300 million to build an XRP reserve to support international payment solutions. Specifically, Webus plans to incorporate Ripple’s blockchain-based payment network into its business to streamline cross-border transactions and bolster transparency across its travel and hospitality booking services. The firm teamed up with investment advisor Samara Alpha Management to facilitate the creation of its XRP treasury, as per the filing. XRP is changing hands at $2.21 as of press time, down roughly 1.6% over the past 24 hours but up 320.5% over the past year, CoinMarketCap data shows. The Ripple-affiliated coin rocketed after President Donald Trump’s election victory, almost reaching its all-time high price milestone from January 2017 in the process. The filing comes as a growing number of public companies have also begun stacking cryptocurrencies in their treasuries, emulating Michael Saylor-led software firm Strategy’s push to amass over $60 billion in Bitcoin over the past few years. Like Webus, several companies are also increasingly imitating Strategy’s playbook and adapting it for Ripple’s XRP, indicating increasing interest from corporations in the industry’s fourth-largest token by market capitalization. Earlier in May, Florida-based healthcare logistics company Wellgistics announced that it would add millions of dollars worth of XRP to its balance sheet and adopt it for payments infrastructure. And last week, Nasdaq-listed energy firm VivoPower International disclosed plans to create a $121 million XRP treasury.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-to-move-higher-as-chinese-company-plans-300-million-xrp-treasury-plan/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T06:30:30,"Trump Family To ‘Legally Challenge’ Magic Eden’s ‘Official’ Crypto Wallet – Report","Amid the controversial announcement of an “official” TRUMP crypto wallet, the Trump family is allegedly considering taking legal action against the project for using the likeness of the US President. Trump Family Denies Crypto Wallet Involvement On Tuesday, the crypto community was taken by storm after the announcement of an upcoming “official” Trump crypto wallet by non-fungible Token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden in partnership with the team behind the president’s official memecoin , TRUMP. According to the official website, the wallet will be “the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans,” supporting the trade of the TRUMP token and other digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). Users who join the wallet’s waitlist will reportedly have an opportunity to share $1 million worth of the memecoin’s rewards. Magic Eden’s CEO, Jack Lu, confirmed the news, affirming that with the project, “DeFi can finally support seamless UX and regulatory clarity is finally allowing crypto to thrive in the US. The time to take big bets & onboard mainstream is now.” Nonetheless, the Trump family distanced itself from the wallet, with the President’s sons taking to social media to clarify the family’s involvement. Eric Trump said in a post that he knows “nothing about this project,” despite running The Trump Organization. He affirmed that the Magic Eden crypto wallet “is not authorized” by the Trump Family, warning their team to be “extremely careful” using the Trump name in an unauthorized project that is unknown to their organization. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr also denied any involvement with the wallet and announced that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is working on launching an official wallet soon. The New York Times reported that Eric Trump “escalated the dispute,” affirming that the Trump family would “legally challenge the creation” of the unofficial wallet in a series of texts to the news media outlet. “There is no deal for this product,” he stated, reaffirming that “There is no agreement for this product. It has not been approved.” Since then, the “TrumpWalletApp” X account has been suspended, despite reportedly having a Magic Eden verification badge. A ‘Bizarre’ Miscommunication? Journalist and podcast host Eleanor Terret shared a response from Magic Eden’s team regarding the claims of being the “official” wallet. In the Tuesday statement , the NFT marketplace affirmed that “It is the official $TRUMP Wallet carrying the official Trump branding and IP. Magic Eden has historically worked with the $TRUMP project to support their prior NFT launches and are excited that we’re working on a much larger project now with $TRUMP Wallet.” Molly White, who first reported the story, called the announcement an “absolute chaos,” noting that “Trump memecoin team is Fight Fight Fight LLC (Bill Zanker), though the Trump Organization-affiliated CIC Digital also holds a substantial quantity of tokens.” To White, “It seems like the breakdown is between the Zanker team and the Trump sons, but pretty incredible they claim never to have even heard of it.” Similarly, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, called the incident “a very bizarre situation,” suggesting that the most likely explanation is a miscommunication or misunderstanding. He theorized that the TRUMP token team possibly didn’t need approval from or to inform CIC Digital or The Trump organization to launch the project, which could explain the Trump family’s remarks about the wallet: Depending on the deal The Trump Organization negotiated here, Fight Fight Fight LLC might be trying to use its connection to $TRUMP (which it seems to have bought for 80% of the supply) to connect Trump to other projects (like this wallet) which only benefit Trump through possible appreciation of $TRUMP. Fight Fight Fight LLC is heavily incentivized to monetize these products other ways since Trump owns 80% of $TRUMP. Schwartz concluded that, “If this is correct, The Trump Organization may be very unhappy with this announcement — especially if they planned to launch their own wallet.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-family-to-legally-challenge-magic-edens-official-crypto-wallet-report/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Crypto wallet|Eric Trump|Magic Eden|Ripple CTO|The Trump Organization|Trump|TRUMP crypto wallet|Trump memecoin|TRUMP token|TRUMP Wallet|TRUMPUSDT|US President Donald Trump|WLFI",cryptocompare

The proceeds from this financing will be used to support the company’s Bitcoin (BTC)-focused digital asset reserve strategy, working capital, and M&A activities, as well as expanding its content production and K-POP businesses. As part of the strategic plan, K Wave will invest the majority of the funding raised for the purpose of long-term holding of Bitcoin under certain restrictions and optimization of returns. Thus, K Wave will become one of the first public media companies in the world to integrate BTC directly into its core fund management.

2025-06-05T06:02:12,"Dogecoin Struggles to Reclaim $0.19 Threshold as Bearish Sentiment Persists","Dogecoin DOGE fell as much as 4.3% over the past 24 hours, dropping from $0.196 to $0.189 as profit-taking continues across majors. The meme-inspired token broke below key support at $0.194 during heavy selling between 11:00-14:00, establishing a new resistance zone while finding a temporary bottom at $0.187. News Background Dogecoin’s price struggles come amid a shifting landscape in the meme coin sector and a general capital preference for stablecoins or bitcoin. Recent whale transfers have moved significant DOGE amounts to major exchanges, sparking speculation about potential sell-offs or accumulation phases. On a broader scale, geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns continue to impact investor sentiment across risk assets, with cryptocurrency markets particularly sensitive to global trade policy shifts. These macroeconomic headwinds are keeping DOGE on the defensive as traders search for signs of a sustainable reversal. Price-Action According to CoinDesk Research’s technical analysis model, DOGE’s price action now consolidates between $0.188 and $0.190, with some technical indicators suggesting potential exhaustion of sellers after the high-volume flush at the $0.187 level. Analysts are watching the descending triangle pattern forming on the charts, as its resolution could dictate DOGE’s next move. While some traders have noted a series of higher lows after DOGE hit $0.188 around 01:50, any recovery attempts have so far lacked conviction. The token’s inability to reclaim the $0.19 threshold underscores persistent market caution, particularly with broader risk assets under pressure from ongoing trade disputes and inflation concerns. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE declined 4.3% from $0.196 to $0.189 over the past 24 hours, with a price range of $0.010 (5.1%). Key support at $0.194 was broken on above-average volume, establishing a new resistance zone. A temporary bottom formed at $0.187 during the 20:00 hour, with the day’s highest volume of 223M suggesting potential seller exhaustion. DOGE consolidated between $0.188 and $0.190, showing weak recovery attempts. A small rally occurred between 02:00-02:01, where DOGE climbed 0.18% on increased volume. Higher lows formed after 01:50 indicate some short-term bullish sentiment, but broader bearish momentum persists.

2025-06-05T06:00:07,"Ethereum Eyes 15% Move Amid Key Resistance Retest – Breakout Or Rejection Next?","Ethereum (ETH) is retesting a crucial resistance level amid its daily 3% recovery. The cryptocurrency has been rejected from this area since last month’s market recovery, failing to continue its bullish rally. As its price continues its sideways trajectory, an analyst suggests that a 15% move is coming. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Face ‘One Last Speed Bump’ Before Rally To $140,000 – Analyst Ethereum Price Compressing Within Key Levels Since its early May breakout, Ethereum has been trading between the $2,475-$2,680 price range, failing to turn the range’s upper boundary as support for nearly a month. Amid last week’s market pullback, the cryptocurrency retraced around 11% from its three-month high of $2,788 to the range’s lower boundary, bouncing from this area on Monday. At the start of the week, ETH reclaimed the $2,500 mark and continued its recovery rally toward the $2,600 resistance. On Wednesday, the King of Altcoins saw a 3.2% daily surge toward the local range high resistance before retracing to the $2,635 level. Carl Runefelt from The Moon Show highlighted the cryptocurrency’s recent performance, affirming that Ethereum is “showing confidence” by staying inside a key formation in the daily timeframe. According to the chart, Ethereum has been forming an ascending triangle since the May rally, with the upper line around the $2,680-$2,700 mark. Moreover, ETH’s price has been compressing between the support and resistance lines, suggesting a potential 15% move if the price breaks out of the pattern. Runefelt forecasted a surge toward the $3,100 level if the Altcoin reclaims the crucial resistance level. However, if the price is rejected once again from this level, the analyst considers that Ethereum could drop to the $2,300 support zone. Crypto Bullet pointed out a similar pattern on multiple ETH charts, suggesting that a 15%-20% breakout is imminent for the cryptocurrency. Per the post, the ETH Dominance is “about to break out” from an ascending triangle pattern in the 12H chart, while the ETH/BTC and ETH/USD trading pairs are nearing the upper boundary of a one-month symmetrical pattern. ETH Preparing For Liftoff? Analyst Crypto Jelle asserted that once ETH reclaims the major resistance area, between $2,680-$2,850, “everything flies higher.” Notably, a reclaim of this zone would send the cryptocurrency above its multi-year ascending support trendline, which was along amid the Q1 2025 retraces, and set the stage for a surge toward the cycle highs. Meanwhile, Ted Pillows noted that ETH’s performance this cycle resembles Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action in 2020. According to the analyst, Ethereum has formed four consecutive 2-week candles since the April 7 bottom, which mimics BTC’s movement after the March 2020 crash. “The similarities between BTC 2020 and ETH 2025 are just mind-blowing,” he stated, suggesting that Ethereum could reach a new all-time high (ATH) in the coming months if it continues to follow BTC’s 2020-2021 trajectory. Related Reading: Monero (XMR) Jumps 11.5% Amid Crucial Support Retest – Analyst Eyes $420 Resistance Market watcher Merlijn The Trader highlighted the same similarities between the flagship cryptocurrency and Ethereum, adding that the King of Altcoins also “just nailed the Spring & Test phase of Wyckoff.” According to the trader, ETH’s structure “screams one thing: Jump. Across. The. Creek. The breakout is coming.” As of this writing, Ethereum trades at $2,632, a 44.2% increase in the monthly timeframe.

Meanwhile, Ripple is expected to go as high as $3.00 with the help of strong market adoption. However, a new contender is catching the eye of analysts. Unilabs (UNIL) , thanks to its AI advancements, gives users the ability to maximize their earnings. There is a chance that this rising star will accomplish more next year than both Ripple and Cardano. Cardano (ADA) Expected To Hit $1.6 As Transaction Volume Spikes The Cardano price might see a rebound in the coming days as trading volume increases. TapTools reports that Cardano DEXs have processed over 11.4 billion ADA in transaction volume. This new milestone comes as the Cardano price struggles to reclaim the $0.70 level. On June 3, the Cardano price tried to break out of the region, but bulls failed to sustain the uptrend. The price of Cardano has bounced off the $0.68 level and is trying to go up again. If successful, the Cardano price could skyrocket to $1 in the coming weeks. Lucky notes the Cardano price might rally to $1.6 in the coming weeks. The analyst thinks that the Cardano price is ready for a big move very soon. According to CoinMarketCap data, the ADA price has dropped 9.9% on the weekly timeframe. It is also down 7.8% on the biweekly chart, signifying strong bearish pressure. Ripple (XRP) Price Eyes Breakout as Double Bottom Pattern Gains Strength The Ripple price is on the verge of confirming a powerful bullish pattern, says top analyst Egrag Crypto. He says a strong close above $2.30 on the 3-day chart and a close above the 21 EMA would confirm a double-bottom formation. This is a pattern that often leads to a major upside for the Ripple price. The Ripple price could target some key levels at $2.50, $2.65, and even $3.00 in the short term if confirmed. Bulls have been defending the crucial support zone at $2.07, and the price of Ripple has shown resilience. Holding above this level maintains the bullish structure and sets the stage for further Ripple price momentum. The XRP price has been building strength, and this technical setup could act as the trigger for the next surge. Presently, the Ripple price has been on an uptrend since the start of the month. The Ripple price has risen from $2.10 to $2.28, according to CoinMarketCap data. Unilabs (UNIL): Harnessing AI to Revolutionize DeFi Investment Unilabs (UNIL) is a cutting-edge DeFi platform that combines AI with blockchain technology to offer investors a smart, automated way to grow their crypto portfolios.

2025-06-05T05:52:31,"Semler Scientific Adds More BTC Despite Falling Stock Price","Semler’s move is part of a broader corporate trend, with firms like South Korea’s K Wave Media also adopting aggressive Bitcoin treasury strategies. As a result, K Wave’s stock jumped 162% after announcing a $500 million crypto-focused share issuance. While this growing wave of corporate Bitcoin accumulation mirrors Metaplanet and Strategy’s playbook, Standard Chartered warned of potential risks, including valuation bubbles and future sell pressure if prices fall. Semler Scientific Bets Bigger on Bitcoin Medical technology company Semler Scientific continued to double down on its Bitcoin investment strategy with a new $20 million purchase of 185 BTC between May 23 and June 3. This latest acquisition brings Semler’s total Bitcoin holdings to 4,449 BTC, which was bought at an average price of $107,974 per coin. As of June 3, the company’s total investment in Bitcoin reached $410 million, with a market value of roughly $472.9 million. This is a 26.7% increase since Semler began accumulating the cryptocurrency in May of 2024. The new investment was disclosed in a June 4 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company previously added $50 million to its Bitcoin treasury in May and reported a separate $10 million BTC acquisition spread between February and April. Semler Scientific YTD stock price (Source: Google Finance ) Despite these purchases, Semler’s strategy has not resulted in a strong boost in investor confidence. Year-to-date, the company’s stock is down 33%, according to Google Finance. Still, since its initial Bitcoin strategy pivot announcement on May 29, 2024, its share price managed a modest 16% recovery. This could mean that investor sentiment remains cautious but somewhat responsive to Bitcoin’s performance. Across the broader market, firms betting on Bitcoin reserves are experiencing mixed results. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has seen its share price climb 33% in 2025, while Japan-based Metaplanet’s stock soared by an impressive 265%. Bitcoin itself experienced a lot of volatility this year. While it is up 11.8% year-to-date and reached a record high of $112,000, it also faced sharp pullbacks by dipping below $77,000 due to macroeconomic concerns and trade tensions. BTC holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that around 3.4 million BTC are currently held in various treasuries. Exchange-traded funds and public companies account for the majority of these holdings, followed by national governments. K Wave Media Stock Soars on Bitcoin Pivot Meanwhile, South Korean entertainment powerhouse K Wave Media also recently took a bold leap into the world of digital assets by unveiling a major Bitcoin-centric strategy funded through a large securities purchase agreement. According to a June 4 announcement , the company secured a deal with Bitcoin Strategic Reserve KWM for the sale of up to $500 million in ordinary shares. The proceeds of this sale will be earmarked for building a crypto treasury heavily focused on Bitcoin. Co-interim CEO Ted Kim explained the philosophical foundation behind the move, and stated that embedding Bitcoin into the company's core strategy reflects a commitment to decentralization, agility, and creating future-facing value. This pivot is very similar to the playbook of Japanese firm Metaplanet, whose share price skyrocketed after adopting a similar Bitcoin reserve model. The influence of these kinds of firms seems to be reshaping corporate finance in Asia, with K Wave Media now aiming to position itself as the “Metaplanet of Korea.” K Wave Media stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Market reaction to the announcement was very quick. After the announcement was made, K Wave Media’s stock surged by 162% on Nasdaq, reaching $5.04. This means that there is certainly some investor enthusiasm around the company’s new direction. Since then, the company’s stock dropped back to a price of $4.48. The proceeds from the share issuance will be directed primarily toward the purchasing, long-term holding, and yield optimization of Bitcoin, though the company also indicated potential interest in other cryptocurrencies. Beyond treasury accumulation, K Wave Media’s broader vision includes operating Bitcoin Lightning Network nodes and investing in the infrastructure that is necessary to reward on-chain activity and drive decentralization. Overall, these moves aim to deepen the company’s integration into the Bitcoin ecosystem and further solidify its digital asset footprint. Part of K Wave’s announcement In addition to its crypto treasury initiative, K Wave Media also plans to leverage the funding for mergers and acquisitions to boost its core entertainment and K-POP ventures. The fusion of digital assets with cultural exports places K Wave Media at the forefront of a growing list of public companies that are embracing Bitcoin as a strategic financial reserve. Standard Chartered Warns of Bitcoin Treasury Risks The trend of publicly traded companies adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset continues to grow as there are now 61 firms holding a combined 673,897 BTC, or 3.2% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. This is according to a report by Standard Chartered. The data was shared on June 3 by the bank’s global head of digital asset research, Geoff Kendrick, and it revealed both the accelerating pace of institutional Bitcoin accumulation and the emerging risks tied to this strategy. Standard Chartered’s Bitcoin report Kendrick explained that while corporate Bitcoin treasuries are currently contributing to buying pressure, they could eventually become a source of downside price risk and increased volatility. One of the reasons for this is that 50% of these companies purchased Bitcoin at an average price of more than $90,000. This is far above the average acquisition price of Strategy’s massive 580,955 BTC reserve, which was obtained at around $70,023 per coin. If Bitcoin experiences another extended downturn, many of these new holders could find themselves underwater, which could trigger sell pressure. Standard Chartered’s analysis also pointed out that 58 of the 61 companies studied have net asset value (NAV) multiples above 1. This means that their market valuation exceeds the value of their underlying assets. While this may currently be sustained by market inefficiencies like regulatory limitations and institutional hesitance, Kendrick warned that once these inefficiencies diminish, the valuations could adjust unfavorably. Interestingly, Kendrick also shared that “Strategy imitators” have greatly increased their pace of acquisition by doubling their collective holdings from under 50,000 BTC to about 100,000 BTC in just two months. Though Strategy itself added 74,000 BTC during the same period, the volume and speed of purchases from new entrants caught his attention. New companies continue to join the movement. On June 3, Canadian renewable energy firm SolarBank disclosed its Bitcoin treasury plans, including the opening of a Coinbase Prime account for custody and stablecoin services. On the same day, Paris-based Blockchain Group announced a $68 million Bitcoin acquisition, and Norwegian brokerage K33 revealed a $6.2 million raise to purchase BTC in late May. Although Standard Chartered’s study included 61 public companies, the broader data from BitcoinTreasuries.net suggests over 124 companies are currently holding Bitcoin. This includes a growing number of international firms seeking to emulate Strategy’s high-profile approach. Despite the concerns that were raised, people like Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, remain steadfast. Saylor insists that even in a scenario where Bitcoin’s value drops by 90% for several years, Strategy’s capital structure will remain resilient enough to withstand the downturn. Similarly, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao weighed in on the topic by saying that while adopting Bitcoin carries risks, the greater risk lies in avoiding risk altogether.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9445/semler-scientific-adds-more-btc-despite-falling-stock-price,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T05:50:23,"Unlock Productivity: ChatGPT Business Features Introduce Meeting Recording and Cloud Connectors","BitcoinWorld Unlock Productivity: ChatGPT Business Features Introduce Meeting Recording and Cloud Connectors In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, tools are constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, not just in creative tasks but also in enhancing core business operations. As AI’s influence continues to grow, impacting sectors like finance and cryptocurrency, platforms like OpenAI’s ChatGPT are rolling out significant updates aimed squarely at the enterprise user. These new ChatGPT business features signal a strong move towards making AI an indispensable part of the daily workflow, offering powerful new capabilities for accessing, analyzing, and utilizing company data. Expanding Reach with ChatGPT Integrations One of the most impactful additions to ChatGPT for business users is the introduction of robust integrations with popular cloud storage services. This allows ChatGPT to access and process information stored within an organization’s existing files and documents. Imagine being able to query your company’s entire knowledge base just by asking ChatGPT. The newly added connectors include: Dropbox Box SharePoint OneDrive Google Drive This capability is a game-changer for tasks requiring access to internal data. For instance, a financial analyst could leverage ChatGPT to sift through company reports, presentations, and spreadsheets stored in Google Drive or SharePoint to quickly draft an investment thesis, citing specific documents. OpenAI emphasizes that these integrations respect existing organizational access controls, ensuring data security and compliance. Seamless Workflow: AI Meeting Recording and Transcription Meeting management has become a central focus for productivity tools, and ChatGPT is now stepping into this arena with its own AI meeting recording and transcription features. This brings a crucial, table-stakes functionality to the platform, allowing users to capture meeting audio and convert it into text. Beyond simple transcription, the feature offers intelligent capabilities: Generates concise notes with timestamped citations linking back to the original audio. Suggests actionable items identified during the discussion. Allows users to query the meeting notes, just like they can query integrated documents. Enables conversion of action items directly into a Canvas document, OpenAI’s tool for collaborative projects. This move positions ChatGPT in direct competition with established players like Zoom and ClickUp, as well as newer entrants like Notion, which have also integrated similar AI-powered meeting summarization features. The ability to easily search meeting content and turn discussions into tangible tasks significantly streamlines post-meeting workflows.

2025-06-05T05:49:51,"Bitcoin’s ‘Boring’ 2025 Hides the Most Important Shift in Crypto History: Analysts","“Something strange is happening with this Bitcoin cycle,” said analysts at BTC financial services firm Swan on X on June 5. We should be in the final year of the four-year trend, but corporations are buying more than ever, they said, adding that the asset price is “boring people.” While Bitcoin typically experiences explosive growth in its “third green year,” 2025 has seen more measured movements with sideways trading. However, this signals a crucial transition rather than a broken cycle, the analysts argued. Bitcoin Cycle Pattern Shift Under the surface, “a massive shift is playing out,” they said, adding that some long-time holders are cashing out above $100,000. Still, there are new buyers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Bitcoin treasury companies , and corporations building strategic long-term positions, and “they’re not here to sell.” “People less committed to the long term are exiting… and a whole new class of investors is entering,” said Bitcoin permabull Michael Saylor. This represents a “rotation into stronger hands” from individual speculators to institutional allocators who view Bitcoin as a permanent balance sheet asset. Something strange is happening with this Bitcoin cycle. We should be in the final year of the 4-year trend. Corporations are buying more than ever. But the price? It’s boring people. Here’s why we could be witnessing the final Bitcoin rotation before everything changes. pic.twitter.com/rcJWLFQZjP — Swan (@Swan) June 4, 2025 The analysts also highlighted a generational wealth transfer, with Millennials entering peak earning years and choosing Bitcoin over traditional assets like their predecessors chose gold or stocks. Combined with concerning macro signals such as a weakening dollar amid rising bond yields, this creates conditions for potential explosive price movement as the tradeable supply shrinks , they stated before concluding this was a “final rotation” and adding: “So if you’re selling now, understand this: You’re likely handing your Bitcoin to an institution or entity that plans to hold it indefinitely.” Glassnode echoed the sentiment, stating that entity-adjusted unspent realized price distribution “shows a clear institutional skew in the Bitcoin market over the past 6 months.” Entity-adjusted URPD shows a clear institutional skew in the #Bitcoin market over the past 6 months.

It has remained tightly range-bound since its fall from over $108,000 in late May but appears to have found strengthening support at current levels. However, CryptoQuant reported that new whales were accumulating. “A fresh cohort of Bitcoin whales … with an average coin age under six months has been stacking at a record pace,” analysts said on June 4.

The venture capitalist has been sticking to his earlier price prediction of $250,000 for Bitcoin, although this time, he listed several factors that would drive the price up. He said that the world’s largest crypto might surpass “infinite against the dollar,” a prediction that he already made last month . The US dollar wouldn’t exist in 10 years, as Bitcoin would replace it, he added. “On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year,” he wrote on X, Wednesday. Bitcoin might go infinite against the dollar. On the heels of the recent surge, I’m still expecting Bitcoin to reach $250,000 this year. Whether Bitcoin will keep gaining ground that fast, who knows. But the main factors pushing it forward right now are: → General optimism… pic.twitter.com/EiD36iYbRy — Tim Draper (@TimDraper) June 4, 2025 Tim Draper first predicted this level in 2018, originally targeting 2022. The timeline did not materialize as 2022 was a brutal year for crypto, defined by the collapse of FTX exchange and a deeper winter market. Trump Trade Deals, Regulatory Frameworks, Web3 Apps to Foster BTC Price: Tim Draper The American billionaire listed several major factors that would push the price of Bitcoin to that level of his prediction. He stated that there is “general optimism” as President Trump continues to work out trade deals. A significant catalyst emerged recently, when Trump’s Media & Technology Group announced that it is one step closer to launching its own Bitcoin exchange-traded fund . Another factor highlighted by Tim Draper includes incoming crypto regulatory frameworks in the US. On May 19, the U.S. Senate took a key step toward regulating stablecoins by advancing the GENIUS Act with a bipartisan vote of 66-32 . On the other hand, Republican lawmakers are pushing forward with the ‘ Digital Asset Market Clarity Act of 2025 ,’ backed by bipartisan support. This comprehensive bill is aimed at establishing clear rules for the US crypto market. Tim Draper noted that Web3 apps built on the Bitcoin blockchain is another factor that would drive BTC price up. “Plus banks are adding it to their offerings. Even longtime holdout JPMorgan plans to offer it soon,” he wrote. Businesses Explore Bitcoin, Bringing it to Mainstream Draper stressed that Bitcoin is an “extremely low risk” asset when compared to other cryptoassets and stocks as “people believe in it.” “It’s earning the title of a store of value,” he said, adding that businesses are piling in, exploring the asset in many ways and bringing it mainstream. Per Bitcoin Treasuries , Saylor’s Strategy tops among companies holding BTC, with more than 580,000 BTC, valued at $61 billion. Additionally, “Layer 2 solutions give Bitcoin the flexibility of Ethereum,” said Tim Draper. “The smart money sees what comes next.” The post Billionaire VC Tim Draper Predicts Bitcoin to Reach $250,000 This Year appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-might-go-to-infinite-against-dollar-says-tim-draper/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin News|Bitcoin|Tim Draper",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T05:40:14,"BlackRock Bitcoin ETF: Strategic $69M Shift to Ethereum Sparks Institutional Crypto Debate","BitcoinWorld BlackRock Bitcoin ETF: Strategic $69M Shift to Ethereum Sparks Institutional Crypto Debate In a move that has captured the attention of the cryptocurrency world, investment giant BlackRock, known for its massive spot Bitcoin ETF (IBIT), has reportedly adjusted its digital asset holdings. Recent reports suggest BlackRock made a significant sale of Bitcoin, subsequently using a portion of the capital to acquire Ethereum (ETH). This potential shift in portfolio allocation by a major institutional player like BlackRock warrants a closer look, sparking debate within the Institutional Crypto space. What Does Recent BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Activity Show? According to reports from The Crypto Basic, citing data from Arkham Intelligence, BlackRock recently engaged in notable trading activity. The report indicates a sale amounting to $561 million worth of Bitcoin. While the scale of this reported sale is substantial, the subsequent purchase focused on Ethereum. The same data suggests BlackRock purchased 27,241 ETH through Coinbase. At the time of the reported transaction, this Ethereum acquisition was valued at approximately $69.25 million. Crucially, The Crypto Basic highlighted that this $69.25 million figure reportedly matched the value of the net outflow of Bitcoin from addresses associated with BlackRock’s spot BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , IBIT, over the preceding two days. It’s important to note the distinction between the reported $561 million Bitcoin sale and the $69.25 million ETH purchase value. The report implies the $69.25 million ETH buy coincided with and equaled the value of recent net outflows from IBIT, suggesting a possible reallocation of capital, though not necessarily that the entire $561 million sale directly funded only the reported ETH purchase. Why Would BlackRock Consider Such a BlackRock Ethereum Purchase? The reported acquisition of a significant amount of Ethereum by an entity linked to BlackRock raises questions about the motivations behind such a move. While BlackRock is a major holder of Bitcoin through its highly successful IBIT fund, adding Ethereum to its portfolio, even in a smaller initial amount relative to its BTC holdings, could signal evolving institutional perspectives on digital assets beyond just Bitcoin. Several factors might influence an institutional player’s decision to buy Ethereum: Diversification: While both are cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum serve different primary functions. Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold or a store of value, whereas Ethereum is the backbone of a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi. Adding ETH provides exposure to this different facet of the crypto market. Belief in Ethereum’s Ecosystem: Institutions may see long-term value in the growth and adoption of the Ethereum network and its smart contract capabilities, which power innovative financial and technological applications. Yield Opportunities: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake, institutions can potentially earn yield through staking, a feature not available with Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism. Future Growth Potential: Some analysts believe Ethereum’s utility-driven nature could offer different growth trajectories compared to Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. This move, if part of a broader strategy, could indicate BlackRock exploring ways to offer clients exposure to the wider digital asset landscape, potentially anticipating future demand for diverse crypto products beyond a single asset like Bitcoin. Analyzing Bitcoin vs Ethereum for Institutional Portfolios For large institutions like BlackRock, the decision to allocate capital between Bitcoin vs Ethereum involves weighing different characteristics and risk profiles. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Narrative Store of Value, Digital Gold Programmable Blockchain, Fuel for dApps/DeFi Consensus Mechanism Proof-of-Work (PoW) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Supply Capped (21 million) Issuance reduced significantly post-Merge, deflationary potential under certain conditions Ecosystem Focus on monetary policy, Layer 2 scaling (Lightning) Vast ecosystem of DeFi, NFTs, dApps, Layer 2 scaling solutions (Optimistic/ZK Rollups) Regulatory Clarity (Relative) Generally viewed as a commodity in the US Status debated, some uncertainty remains Potential Yield None inherent (can lend) Staking yield available While Bitcoin offers a clearer, more established narrative as a digital reserve asset, Ethereum presents exposure to the innovation happening in decentralized finance and Web3. An Institutional Crypto strategy might involve holding both to capture different market dynamics. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market Analysis? Any significant move by a player as large as BlackRock is closely watched and analyzed within the Crypto Market Analysis landscape. While the reported ETH purchase value of $69.25 million is modest compared to BlackRock’s multi-billion dollar Bitcoin holdings via IBIT, the symbolic significance is potentially large. Validation for Ethereum: It could be interpreted as another step towards institutional acceptance of Ethereum as a legitimate investment asset, potentially paving the way for future institutional inflows or even an eventual spot Ethereum ETF (though regulatory hurdles remain significant). Shifting Narratives: It might signal a growing institutional interest in the utility aspect of crypto, moving beyond just the store-of-value narrative dominated by Bitcoin. Market Sentiment: Positive sentiment around institutional adoption, especially from a name like BlackRock, can influence broader market perception and potentially attract further investment. However, it’s crucial not to overstate the impact of a single reported transaction. The $69.25 million ETH purchase represents a small fraction of BlackRock’s overall digital asset exposure through IBIT. Market participants should view this data point as one piece of a larger puzzle regarding institutional digital asset strategies. Challenges for BlackRock Ethereum Holdings and Other Institutions Despite the potential upsides, holding Ethereum comes with its own set of challenges for institutions: Regulatory Uncertainty: Unlike Bitcoin, the regulatory status of Ethereum in key jurisdictions like the United States is less clear. There is ongoing debate about whether ETH should be classified as a security or a commodity, which impacts how it can be offered and held by regulated entities. Technical Complexity: Engaging with Ethereum’s ecosystem, including staking for yield, involves technical infrastructure and expertise that differs from simply holding Bitcoin. Market Volatility: While both assets are volatile, ETH’s price can be influenced by factors specific to its ecosystem’s growth and challenges, adding another layer of complexity. These challenges are likely reasons why institutional adoption of Ethereum in regulated products like ETFs has lagged behind Bitcoin. Actionable Insights from the Institutional Crypto Landscape For individual investors watching these institutional moves, the reported BlackRock activity offers a few insights: Pay Attention to Diversification: Institutions often diversify their holdings. Consider how both Bitcoin and Ethereum might fit into your own investment strategy based on your goals and risk tolerance. Stay Informed on Regulation: Regulatory developments, particularly regarding Ethereum, will likely be a major catalyst or impediment for future institutional adoption. Understand the Use Cases: Appreciate the fundamental differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum beyond just price action. Their underlying technologies and ecosystems drive their long-term value propositions. While you shouldn’t blindly follow institutional trades, understanding their strategies can provide valuable context for your own market analysis. Summary: A Glimpse into Evolving Institutional Strategies The report detailing BlackRock’s sale of Bitcoin and subsequent purchase of Ethereum provides a fascinating glimpse into the evolving strategies of major financial institutions in the digital asset space. While the reported ETH purchase amount is relatively small compared to their vast Bitcoin holdings via the BlackRock Bitcoin ETF , IBIT, the move signals potential interest in diversifying into Ethereum. This development is a key data point for anyone conducting Crypto Market Analysis and watching the broader trend of Institutional Crypto adoption. As the digital asset landscape matures, we may see more institutions exploring assets beyond Bitcoin, potentially reshaping the dynamics between Bitcoin vs Ethereum in institutional portfolios and the market at large.

He praised El Salvador’s continued accumulation of Bitcoin, aligning with its earlier government policies and reaffirming its position as a global leader in the crypto space. The most immediate effect is an increased interest in the sovereign accumulation of Bitcoin and its potential effects on economic policy. Bo Hines appreciated the crypto’s transformative role in changing finance, specifically giving a shout-out to El Salvador for leading the change. El Salvador’s transformative role in cryptocurrency occurred in 2021 when President Bukele announced converting Bitcoin into legal currency . This led to a remarkable short-term increase in the digital asset’s price. It also led to current discussions focused on whether state-supported cryptocurrency can succeed. In an X post , Bo Hines mentioned having a great meeting with Bukele. He revealed that they talked about innovations in digital assets and their shared goal of shaping the future of global finance . Bo Hines acknowledged that President Bukele was making significant changes in the beautiful country of El Salvador. Bo Hines also highlighted that the federal government plans to keep all the current Bitcoin and will continuously work to gather more for a strategic reserve. The crypto community seems to have responded cautiously and positively after the meeting with some pundits, calling it a strategic partnership for future policy definition. The crypto world is still waiting for more details of the collaboration. Analysts in the market also noted continued support for sovereign Bitcoin strategies as they anticipate formal commitments toward reserve allocations. Bukele and Bo Hines pledged to make a mark in the finance world with BTC, the clearest sign yet of Bukele’s rapacious drive in El Salvador. According to data from CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin is currently trading at $104,999.59, reflecting a 0.70% decrease in the past 24 hours. Analysts anticipate that the adoption of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve could shape global financial Following analysts from reliable sources, further advocacy of BTC as a strategic reserve could potentially shape global financial and regulatory trends. According to analysts, President Bukele and Bo Hines’ meeting could spur other countries to consider similar policies that may influence technological evolution and market penetration through cryptocurrency solutions. Additionally, it underlines the remarkable power of Bitcoin to drive the future of financials. Just a day earlier, on June 4, Bo Hines welcomed Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), at the White House. They talked about cooperation on Bitcoin and digital assets. Pakistan is planning to build a cryptocurrency reserve. This meeting came on the heels of an announcement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who appointed Bilal Bin Saqib as Special Assistant on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency.

XRP XRP, Solana’s SOL SOL and BNB Chain’s BNB BNB shed 1.5%, while Tron’s TRX TRX was the only major token in the green with a 1.9% bump. “Recent macro and policy conditions have created uncertainty in risk-on assets, which is reflected in the current Bitcoin price,” said Anna Liu, CEO of HashKey Tokenization, said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk. “While we believe there will likely be volatilities in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, we remain positive on BTC as a strategic asset for investors in the longer term,” she added, noting that recent inflows into BTC and ETH ETFs show institutions are still exploring crypto allocations despite short-term headwinds. Market sentiment remains in the greed zone, with the crypto fear and greed index at 62, though it has lost a few points in the last day. Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, said bitcoin’s rebound from near $103,000 on May 31 signals the beginning of a potential upward movement. “Potentially, this momentum could take the market to new highs above $130K,” he said.

2025-06-05T05:00:26,"$63 Billion in Bitcoin Scooped Up by New Whales, Is $135K Still in Play?","Bitcoin is so far facing a notable pullback in price, with its price now down roughly 5.8% from its all-time high recorded last month. At the time of writing, the asset currently trades at $105,062, marking a 1.1% decrease in the past day. Despite the pullback, on-chain data indicates a significant change in market behavior among large investors. A new set of Bitcoin whales—wallets holding 1,000 BTC or more with coins aged less than six months—has been accumulating the asset at an accelerated pace. Related Reading: Bitcoin Derivatives Reset: Neutral Funding And Whale Withdrawals Hint At Bullish Shift Young Whale Holdings Surge as Supply Share Tightens According to a recent analysis published by CryptoQuant contributor “onchained,” this accumulation trend may reflect renewed conviction among high-capital participants preparing for future catalysts. Between March 1 and June 4, 2025, the amount of Bitcoin held by this group of “new whales” more than doubled from approximately 500,000 BTC to over 1.1 million BTC. This represents an increase of around $63 billion in value. During the same period, their share of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply grew from 2.5% to 5.6%, effectively removing an amount equivalent to nearly ten months of Bitcoin mining output from active circulation. Notably, this measure excludes long-dormant wallets, helping isolate recent capital inflows. This trend suggests a combination of long-term positioning and active supply absorption, which historically has preceded significant price volatility. Analysts view the emergence of new whale activity as a signal of shifting market structure, especially when paired with tightening supply conditions. If these entities continue to withdraw BTC from circulation without signs of immediate distribution, it could signal a period of price compression followed by upside volatility. Technical Patterns Suggest Possible Breakout Levels From a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin may be forming a new bullish pattern. According to a recent post by the analyst known as “Titan of Crypto,” the asset has broken out of a right-angled descending broadening wedge, a chart pattern that can imply a trend reversal or continuation depending on confirmation. #Bitcoin to $135,000 in 2025? 📈$BTC has broken out of a right-angled descending broadening wedge.

2025-06-05T04:40:14,"Standard Chartered says corporate demand for Bitcoin is about to make it crash","Corporate wallets are filling up with Bitcoin, and Standard Chartered thinks that could soon blow up in everyone’s face. In a new report released yesterday, the bank said businesses that recently joined the crypto frenzy are loading up at high prices—and if the market takes a hit, they might dump their coins fast. That’s not just bad for them. That’s bad for everyone else holding Bitcoin, too. According to Standard Chartered , the number of companies buying Bitcoin to hold on their balance sheets has doubled in the past two months, pushing total holdings close to 100,000 coins. This increase has helped drive the recent price rally, but analyst Geoff Kendrick, who leads the bank’s digital asset research, said the buying pressure could flip and crush the market if those companies decide to get out. Corporate buyers face risk of becoming forced sellers Geoff said, “Bitcoin treasuries are adding to bitcoin buying pressure for now, but we see a risk that this may reverse over time.” He explained that most companies in the bank’s sample have net asset value multiples above 1, which for now looks fine thanks to regulatory restrictions and slow-moving investment policies. But he warned that if those roadblocks disappear, there’s nothing stopping the same companies from turning into sellers, not buyers. Geoff pointed out that many of these new corporate buyers didn’t get in cheap. Unlike Strategy—previously MicroStrategy—which is known for stacking Bitcoin at lower levels, most of these newer players bought at much higher prices. If the price of Bitcoin drops below $90,000, Geoff said half of them would be underwater. And if the price falls 22% below their average buy-in, they’d likely be forced to sell. He asked the key question: “How much pain can companies withstand before being forced to sell their bitcoin?” Geoff brought up Strategy’s situation in November 2022, during the FTX collapse. At the time, Bitcoin nosedived from $31,000 to $15,500, but Strategy kept holding. He said that might’ve been because their dollar losses weren’t that big, and because back then, US spot Bitcoin ETFs didn’t exist, so Strategy still served a purpose for traditional investors. Now that spot ETFs are on the market, that purpose is gone. Geoff said none of the newer entrants would survive a similar drop. In his words, “We do not think any of the newer entrants to the bitcoin treasury space could continue holding their bitcoin if bitcoin prices were to fall 50% below their average purchase price.” The bank said it’s tracking 61 companies that hold Bitcoin just to keep it—not companies in the industry like miners, crypto exchanges, asset managers, ATM firms, or Tesla. These 61 companies make up a small part of the 110 public companies globally that own Bitcoin, but they matter because they’re outside the crypto space. And together, as of press time, they own 673,897 Bitcoin. That’s about 3.2% of the total 21 million supply.

Ripple Co-founder Could Be Worth $2.7 Trillion, 500K Millionaire Boom Predicted appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently trading at $2.20, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours and about 4% over the past week. But zooming out, the picture looks brighter as it has surged over 300% in the past year. While some experts have made unrealistic predictions of it hitting $1,000, others remain divided on how high XRP can go. According to a viral post doing rounds on X (formerly Twitter), Chris Larsen, the co-founder of Ripple, owns around 2.7 billion XRP. If XRP ever reaches $1000 per coin, his net worth could skyrocket to $2.7 trillion. This would make him the first trillionaire in history, far ahead of Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. But Larsen would not be the only one to be on the XRP rich list . If XRP holders do not sell their coins, it could give birth to new ultra-wealthy individuals. There could be around 300 to 500 new billionaires, 10,000 people with over $100 million, 100,000 with over $10 million, and about 500,000 new millionaires. XRP is never going to $1000 $10 is possible. $100 is unlikely. $1000 will never happen. — Matthew Turner (@MbtHawk) June 5, 2025 What It Would Take for XRP to Rewrite Financial History? However, many claim that this is extremely unlikely in the short term. XRP would need to jump nearly 50,000% to hit $1,000. Some experts like Matthew Brienen and Patrick Bet-David believe it’s possible due to XRP’s role in global payments. However, it is doubtful if it will ever reach that level, even in 25 years. If XRP hit $1,000 with its current supply of about 58.4 billion tokens, its total market value would be around $58.4 trillion. That is way more than the value of gold (about $22.4 trillion), Apple (around $3 trillion), Bitcoin ($1.7 trillion), and the entire crypto market ($2.7 trillion). XRP would be worth more than all of them combined, which shows just how unlikely that price is. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction: Bearish Pattern, Bigger Picture and Key Levels Revealed , XRP Price Prediction (Short-term) XRP is currently trading at $2.20. Most oscillators are neutral, with only momentum suggesting a buy. All short- to medium-term moving averages are signaling sell, except the 200-period EMA . It recently bounced back from a low of $2.07, but it could not rise above the resistance at $2.27. Key support levels to watch are $2.22, $2.07, and lower zones around $1.92, $1.85, and $1.61. Although price faces some downward pressure, the rising trading activity and liquidations in the derivatives market hint at a possible recovery ahead. XRP isn’t hitting $1,000 or even $100 anytime soon. Some say $4 or even $10 might be possible . And $1,000 is just off the table. Also, there is always this question looming- “What if Larsen decides to sell a big chunk?” That could cause the price to drop quickly and create a lot of market chaos. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T04:02:00,"Crypto price prediction: Fartcoin, Livepeer, Grass, Dego Finance","Crypto prices remained in a tight range on Thursday as Bitcoin struggled to move above the key resistance level at $105,000. Most altcoins retreated, with meme coins falling by double digits. This article forecasts some of the most active cryptocurrencies like Fartcoin, Livepeer, Grass, and Dego Finance. Fartcoin price prediction Fartcoin, one of the most popular Solana meme coins, surged by over 400% a few months ago. It moved from a low of $0.2097 to a high of $1.6520 in May. This surge helped to stimulate the recent surge among Solana meme coins. The momentum has faded in the past few days as the Fartcoin price has plunged by over 45% and moved below the psychological point at $1. It has crashed below the 50-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Further, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has continued falling and is nearing the oversold level. Also, the MACD has crossed the zero line and is in a strong downtrend, a sign that it has lost momentum. Worse, Fartcoin price has moved below the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level at $1.0530. Therefore, the path of the least resistance for the coin is bearish, with the next point to watch being the 78.6% retracement point at $0.5970. A move above the resistance level at $1.3545 will invalidate the bullish view. Fartcoin price chart | Source: TradingView Livepeer price analysis Livepeer is a top crypto project in the artificial intelligence and video space. It runs a decentralized platform that enables people to share their bandwidth, which is used for video streamers. The developers also launched Daydream, a generative AI platform that turns live camera input into animated visuals. It is a useful tool used by marketers, creators, and other stakeholders. Livepeer price surged last week, reaching a high of $14.23, the highest point since January 18 of this year. Its highest point was up by 330% from its lowest point this year. LPT price then pulled back to a low of $7.58 as the rally lost momentum. On the positive side, it has moved above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, and has formed a rounded bottom pattern. Livepeer price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, the token will likely have a bullish breakout as bulls target last year’s high of $14.23. If this happens, it will form a double-top pattern, a highly bearish sign that will mark the end of the recent rally. A move above the double-top point will signal more gains.

Grass price has formed a rising broadening wedge pattern, a popular bullish sign in the market. This pattern is also known as a giant megaphone pattern and it often leads to more gains over time. Grass price chart | Source: TradingView Therefore, the Grass crypto price will likely resume the downtrend soon since it remains below the 50-period and 25-period moving average. A drop below the key support at $1.6457 will point to more downside. Dego Finance price forecast The 12-hour chart shows that the DEGO price has plunged this week. It has moved from a high of $2.888 to a low of $1.2430, its lowest point on record. This 50% plunge mirrored the performance of Mantra, a token that plunged by over 90% in 24 hours. The ongoing DEGO price crash happened likely as insiders dumped their tokens after it jumped by over 115% in the past few months. DEGO price has crashed below all moving averages. DEGO price chart | Source: TradingView The most likely scenario is where it continues plunging as investors remain in the sidelines. However, there is a likelihood that it may have a dead cat bounce, where it rebounds and then resumes the downtrend.

2025-06-05T04:00:29,"Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge","Senator Cynthia Lummis, who leads the Senate Subcommittee on Digital Assets, says the US military backs a plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of a major bank, recently called that plan a waste. Lummis pushed back. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Lummis told Bloomberg the military thinks having Bitcoin on hand matters. She said it could be a tool in the economic contest with China. Some see that as a bold step. Others say it’s risky. Military Backs Bitcoin Reserve According to the senator, military leaders say Bitcoin could help in an economic showdown. They see it as a way to hold value if traditional assets get hit by sanctions or big moves from other nations. She spoke about weapons and ammunitions being part of national security, but she added that a Bitcoin reserve is also vital. Some military voices have warned that future conflicts won’t just be fought on battlefields. Money and digital assets could play a key role too. Legislative And Executive Moves Based on reports, Lummis introduced a bill to have the US buy and hold 1 million BTC. That would mirror what countries do with gold. The idea is to pull funds from the Treasury or Federal Reserve rather than use new budget money. It has not moved far in Congress. Still, US President Donald Trump issued an order on March 6, 2025, to set up a Bitcoin reserve plus a digital asset stockpile for other coins. He said the government would use assets seized in civil and criminal actions to start the fund. That means some 200,000 BTC the government already has could be part of it. Lummis Sees Bitcoin Price Rising In The Next Decade Lummis unveiled a proprietary model forecasting a dramatic rise in Bitcoin’s price over the next decade, citing factors such as its fixed supply, growing institutional adoption, and expanding network effects. Analysts caution that such long-term forecasts hinge on unpredictable factors like regulatory shifts, technological breakthroughs, and market sentiment, any of which could derail even the most optimistic projections. She also praised Trump for pushing simple rules for crypto and for using digital coins as part of national strategy. Trump’s family runs a DeFi platform, a stablecoin project, and even some meme coins. Lummis thinks everyone will end up in the crypto economy sooner or later. Related Reading: $500M Bet On Solana: Education Platform Aims To Supercharge Its Treasury Skeptic Voices And Uncertain Path Jamie Dimon disagrees. He calls the Bitcoin reserve a waste of resources. Other experts worry about Bitcoin’s ups and downs. They say a strategic reserve shouldn’t ride on something that can swing 20% in a single day. Some economists at top universities give zero support to borrowing money to build a crypto stash. They argue it doesn’t make sense against the US’s nearly $36 trillion national debt. For now, the bill to buy 1 million BTC sits in committee.

2025-06-05T03:49:15,"Bitcoin’s (BTC) Shrinking Supply Could Set Off the Next Price Surge","As Bitcoin hovers near its May high, new data suggest that there has been a tightening the leading crypto asset’s supply amid surging institutional demand. Sygnum Bank’s June 2025 Monthly Investment Outlook attributes the asset’s positive momentum to its growing appeal as a safe haven and broader institutional adoption, which are now driving a structural reduction in liquid supply. Bitcoin Demand Shocks Over the past 18 months, Bitcoin exchange balances have fallen by one million BTC, which represents a 30% drop, largely due to increased holdings by ETFs and other acquisition vehicles. These instruments are funneling capital from traditional equity and fixed income investors into the crypto space. The decline in exchange balances is viewed as a bullish signal, which points to a shift toward long-term holding behavior. With more institutional products entering the market and some governments considering adding Bitcoin to their reserves, Sygnum stated that it sees potential for demand shocks and upside volatility. These factors, the bank argued, set the stage for a possible continuation of the current bull cycle. As institutional adoption drives Bitcoin’s upward trajectory, developments on the government front suggest an expanding role for the asset at the state and national level. Global Interest in Bitcoin Reserve Adoption Grows Three US states have recently passed bills supporting the inclusion of Bitcoin in government reserves, with New Hampshire becoming the first to sign such a bill into law. Texas is likely to follow, as the state’s governor has publicly backed the initiative. International interest is also growing. Pakistan’s government and the Reform UK party – currently leading in British election polls – have both announced plans to explore central bank Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, policy think tanks in China have floated similar proposals, and unconfirmed reports suggest quiet accumulation may already be underway. While no official Bitcoin purchases have begun under these approved frameworks, analysts at Sygnym suggest that actual acquisitions could become a major price catalyst. The combination of increased demand and the strong signaling effect of state and national entities entering the market may drive broader institutional interest and accelerate Bitcoin’s mainstream adoption.

2025-06-05T03:40:11,"The Future of Non-Custodial Models in a Post-Coinbase World","HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post As the dust settles from the latest wave of phishing attacks, breaches and increasing regulatory pressure, one thing is becoming abundantly clear – the era of centralized custody in crypto is reaching an inflection point. Coinbase may still stand tall as the poster child of exchange-driven adoption, but its growing vulnerabilities expose a systemic flaw. Users are still being asked to trust a third party with their assets, privacy and safety. In a post-Coinbase world, this trust model is no longer sustainable. The next chapter of crypto centers around non-custodial infrastructure – models that return control to the user without sacrificing security, usability or speed. The ‘not your keys, not your coins’ ethos is evolving from a rallying cry into an architectural blueprint for the next generation of crypto platforms. The trust crisis and its ripple effects Recent events, like the estimated $300 million in phishing-related losses on Coinbase as highlighted by investigators like ZachXBT, means centralized platforms are being pushed to serve as banks, tech firms and compliance officers all at once. But in doing so, they inherit the worst vulnerabilities of each model. The trust users place in these intermediaries becomes a single point of failure, exploited not just by hackers but by misaligned incentives and opaque systems. We are now seeing users, especially the next wave of adopters, demanding platforms that work like Coinbase but without the custody. They want seamless on/off ramps, intuitive UI and fast swaps – but without giving up sovereignty over their funds. What a post-Coinbase model looks like Most so-called ‘non-custodial’ platforms still expect users to jump through hoops just to do the basics. Meanwhile, centralized giants like Coinbase built empires by prioritizing ease of use over core crypto principles. That tradeoff is no longer acceptable. The real opportunity now is to build platforms that don’t ask users to choose between control and convenience. Crypto should be as simple as swapping tokens in seconds. No logins, no account creation, no handing over your identity to a black box. Most fiat on-ramps still funnel users through third parties that operate like banks in disguise. The future is wallet-native – not broker-driven. We need KYC (know your customer) and payments infrastructure that supports sovereignty not platforms that treat users like liabilities to be monetized. And let’s kill the fantasy that users are going to ‘bridge’ and ‘wrap’ and ‘unwrap’ every time they move across chains. No one has time for that. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos – they should all work from one interface. No jargon, no jumping through tabs. If your product still requires a tutorial, it’s not ready for mass adoption. Lastly, security can’t mean telling people ‘don’t forget your seed phrase’ and calling it a day. That’s lazy. Non-custodial platforms must bake in real protection – recovery options, phishing defense, smart defaults – without turning every user into their own IT department. We cannot afford to be rebranding the old playbook anymore. The real shift is happening – i n tools that feel as seamless as Coinbase but don’t ask you to hand over your keys, your data or your trust.

2025-06-05T03:00:38,"Bitcoin Pullback or Setup? On-Chain Metrics Hint at What’s Coming Next","Bitcoin is experiencing a short-term price decline. In the past 24 hours, the asset has fallen by approximately 9.3% to a trading value of $105,062. This pullback places Bitcoin roughly 8% below its all-time high recorded last month. The dip comes amid broader market volatility, but on-chain indicators and exchange data suggest deeper structural trends that may influence the next phase of Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Recent market analysis points to renewed accumulation among long-term holders, a spike in exchange withdrawals, and rising spot trading activity on Binance. These developments are being interpreted as signals of underlying strength despite recent price weakness. CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha has provided a detailed breakdown of these emerging patterns, offering a perspective on how long-term dynamics may be shaping Bitcoin’s current market behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3–5 Year Holders Slow Selloff—Waiting for Higher Prices? Binance Trading Volume Rises, Long-Term Holders Accumulate Since early June, Binance has seen its share of Bitcoin spot trading volume increase from 26% to 35%, positioning it more firmly as the dominant platform in the market. This increase in trading activity has occurred as Bitcoin approaches and tests key price levels. According to Taha, this surge may indicate renewed interest from retail and institutional traders alike, particularly as volatility draws more short-term market participants to major exchanges. In addition to exchange volume shifts, on-chain data reveals growing confidence among long-term Bitcoin holders. The Long-Term Holder (LTH) Net Position Realized Cap, a metric that reflects the value of coins held by entities with a holding period of over 155 days, has returned above $20 billion. Historically, this type of accumulation pattern has preceded periods of price expansion, as long-term investors tend to hold through corrections and avoid frequent selling. The rise in LTH realized cap suggests these entities are not exiting positions during this market dip, which may reduce available supply and support future upward movement. Bitcoin Large Exchange Withdrawals Signal Tightening Supply Beyond trading activity and holder behavior, Taha pointed out that another notable trend is emerging on centralized exchanges. Over a two-day period, Kraken and Bitfinex recorded net Bitcoin outflows exceeding 20,000 BTC, among the largest short-term withdrawals in recent months. Such movements are often interpreted as signals of investors shifting assets into self-custody, possibly in anticipation of long-term holding or strategic redeployment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Go ‘Bananas’ If Price Closes Above This Level, Top Analyst Says Combined, the rise in Binance’s market share, increased LTH accumulation, and exchange outflows present a picture of a market undergoing structural positioning rather than widespread exit activity. While the short-term price trend reflects a pullback from recent highs, the simultaneous withdrawal of supply and steady long-term holder confidence could act as foundational elements for potential future growth.
