2025-06-05T17:19:00,"US Seizes 145 Domains and Crypto Linked to BidenCash Dark Web Market","US law enforcement has seized 145 domains and an unspecified quantity of cryptocurrency linked to BidenCash, a notorious dark web marketplace. The site is said to have trafficked in millions of stolen credit cards and personally identifiable information. The operation, which was unveiled on June 5 by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, was carried out in collaboration with the US Secret Service and FBI. Seized domains now divert to law enforcement-controlled servers. BidenCash Enabled Widespread Data Theft Launched in March 2022, BidenCash quickly became a hub for cybercrime activity with over 117,000 users. It facilitated the sale of over 15 million payment card numbers and personally identifiable information that were stolen. As a promotional effort from October 2022 to February 2023, the site gave away 3.3 million stolen card records for free—an aggressive marketing tactic aimed at attracting new customers. Authorities estimate the marketplace generated more than $17 million in illicit revenue. Crypto Assets Also Targeted Along with the domain seizures, US officials obtained court permission to seize cryptocurrency assets linked to the operations of BidenCash. The amount of cryptocurrency seized was not disclosed. The operation was led by the Frankfurt Resident Office of the US Secret Service, its Cyber Investigative Section, and the Albuquerque Field Office of the FBI. Officials stated that the operation is part of a sustained effort to dismantle crypto-enabled criminal networks across the dark web. BidenCash Added to the Growing List of Takedowns The BidenCash shutdown follows Operation RapTor, a massive dark web crackdown in May that brought down various drug trafficking websites. That effort led to 270 arrests in 10 countries and the seizure of around $200 million in assets, much of it in cryptocurrency. Earlier in March, US officials sanctioned Nemesis darknet marketplace operators, another closed-down darknet market. The assets sanctioned were 44 Bitcoin and five Monero addresses that had collectively received over $850,000 between 2022 and 2024. Darknet Market Activity Surging Dark markets generated $1.7 billion in revenue in 2024, a modest year-on-year increase, per TRM Labs’ 2025 Crypto Crime Report. The report notes that Russian-language markets dominate the sector, in great part due to the fact that there is no expectation of Russian law enforcement cracking down on them. The takedown of BidenCash reflects the ongoing challenge for global agencies combating cybercrime and the increasing role of cryptocurrency in illicit online economies.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/us-seizes-145-domains-and-crypto-linked-to-bidencash/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|XMR","Bitcoin|Regulation",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T17:13:35,"Donald Trump’s Truth Social Advances with Bitcoin ETF S-1 Filing","Truth Social, a social media company linked to President Donald Trump, is boldly moving towards crypto investment. The company has filed a critical S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing, announced on June 5, aims to launch a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Truth Social wants to offer investors a new, regulated way to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) through a fund. Truth Social Awaits SEC Approval The filing reveals that Truth Social plans for its Bitcoin ETF to be supported mainly by real Bitcoin. A company named Foris DAX, which acts as the fund’s custodian, will keep these Bitcoins safe. Another company, Yorkville America, is the sponsor responsible for managing the ETF. However, the filing did not provide some key information, such as the ticker symbol, the amount of money that will start the fund, or the price for each share. This SEC filing came after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca submitted a related form called a 19b-4 on June 4. This is essential in getting permission to list and trade the ETF shares on the stock exchange. Now, regulators will review these applications to decide if they will approve the ETF. Truth Social’s Bitcoin ETF Eyes Real BTC Backing Truth Social’s Bitcoin ETF aims to closely follow the price of the flagship crypto. This fund will allow large investors, such as institutions, to invest in Bitcoin in a more traditional and regulated way without buying the digital coin directly. This is similar to other Bitcoin ETFs that hold real Bitcoin, not just futures or contracts. Truth Social hopes this fund will attract investors who want to invest in Bitcoin but prefer the safety and ease of an investment fund product. Truth Social’s ETF To Join A Competitive Market Experts in the finance industry have noticed Truth Social’s move into the Bitcoin ETF space. In a recent post on X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said this filing is unusual because it is linked to a company connected to a U.S. president. This connection gives the ETF a unique profile. However, Balchunas noted that Truth Social’s crypto fund will compete in a market already full of Bitcoin ETFs. Many of these existing ETFs have low fees and attract many investors, making it hard for Truth Social’s ETF to stand out, even with its unique political connection. This ETF filing comes as President Donald Trump’s involvement in cryptocurrency has faced criticism and controversy. This may further add some challenges to this new project.

2025-06-05T17:05:55,"About 31% of Kenyan banks are open to start facilitating crypto deals","Nearly a third of Kenyan banks are set to start facilitating crypto deals. The interest was sparked by the government’s intentions to legalize and regulate crypto amidst increasing illicit activities. The report came out of a survey done by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). According to the survey, commercial and microfinance banks said that the assets could provide potential opportunities in enhancing financial access to the unbanked. “31% of the respondents indicated that they were highly likely to undertake activities in the area of virtual assets,” CBK’s Innovation Survey says. The report also indicated that they were “highly likely” to undertake activities in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as non-fungible tokens(NFTs) and digital tokens. The findings signal a shifting view of banks about virtual assets on the back of increased use across sectors such as finance, entertainment, real estate, and art. This report comes after the US banks consequently dealt with debanking. Also, as reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan will start counting crypto assets in some clients’ net worth calculations, putting Bitcoin and other digital holdings in the same category as stocks, cars, and artwork. Kenyan banks emphasize the need for a regulatory framework According to the United Nations Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the government has seen a lot of potential in the crypto market. There are about four million users of crypto in the country. The report states, “Most financial institutions (35 percent) emphasized the need for regulatory frameworks governing digital innovation. This includes areas such as digital lending, open banking, application programming interfaces standardization, digital identity blockchain, virtual assets including crypto assets, and digital-only banking.” Kenya was put on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list” in 2014 because it didn’t have a clear plan for prosecuting money laundering crimes, among other things. Another problem was that no rules were in place to monitor and control how crypto was used. However, recently, the government moved to regulate the sector through the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2025. This law requires crypto companies that do business in the country to set up local offices and hire directors, but only after getting approval from regulators like the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). Crypto taxes reduced by half In addition, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has also said that it will create a new tax system that includes real-time tracking of crypto transactions. This is so that the government can use the local crypto sector to catch tax cheats and criminals. At the same time, the government has tried to encourage people to use crypto. The National Treasury is cutting the 3% tax on the sale of digital assets that was put in place in 2023 by half, to 1.5%, in the 2025 Finance Bill. However, this was after the Kenyan crypto companies teamed up against what they called the country’s controversial 3% digital asset tax (DAT). 🚨 Crypto Tax Showdown in Kenya 🇰🇪 @PwC has officially joined forces with top Kenyan crypto firms, including Busha, Kotani Pay, Luno & Swypt, to fight the controversial Digital Asset Tax (DAT). 🟠From 3% to 1.5%, but the industry says it's still unfair. 🟠Parliament has… pic.twitter.com/uuH9HSYps4 — TawkCrypto (@Tawkcrypto) June 2, 2025 According to Cabinet Secretary John Mbadi, the levy was lowered to make it the same as the 1.5% turnover tax that businesses with a total turnover of Ksh.1 million to Ksh.25 million a year pay. Meanwhile, the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) took its biggest step yet into the crypto world by teaming up with DeFi Technologies to launch the Kenya Digital Exchange (KDX).

2025-06-05T17:01:07,"JPMorgan to Accept Bitcoin ETF Shares for Loans","JPMorgan Chase, the world's largest bank by assets, is about to make history on Wall Street: in the near future, it will permit clients to utilize units of spot Bitcoin ETFs to start with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral for a loan. It is the first time that a leading U.S. bank is welcoming crypto-native collateral on scale, opening up a new era of institutional acceptance of digital assets. How the Program Works: Risk Model and Collateral The JPMorgan move allows both trading and wealth-management clients to access lines of credit using their holdings of Bitcoin ETFs as collateral, with the ultimate aim of expanding beyond IBIT to other ETFs. The policy will apply globally, to retail and institutional accounts. For the first time in history, the bank will also factor crypto holdings into net worth and liquid asset calculations equating digital assets to stocks, property, and pieces of fine art in qualifying for loans. The risk model is conservative: only regulated, liquid ETFs like BlackRock's IBIT meet the cut. The collateral values will be marked to market on a daily basis, and JPMorgan will require healthy loan-to-value ratios, the same way it does for equities. It de-risks but allows clients to leverage their crypto exposure without having to give up their assets. “JPMorgan will begin accepting shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral for loans... putting them on par with traditional securities like stocks.” — @CoinDesk Why Now? Wall Street, Politics, and the ETF Boom JPMorgan's U-turn comes as investor and political pressure grows. President Trump's administration easing crypto regulation, and spot Bitcoin ETFs managing a record $128 billion in assets, banks can no longer ignore customer demand for exposure to digital. JPMorgan's famously crypto-skeptical CEO Jamie Dimon recently caved: ”I don't think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” Wealth management firms are seeing a wave of clients agreeing to use Bitcoin ETF shares to access liquidity, especially as such ETFs like IBIT have surged 138% since their approval by the SEC in January 2024. Feature JPMorgan Goldman Sachs Collateral Accepted Spot Bitcoin ETF shares (e.g., IBIT) Direct Bitcoin holdings, select crypto assets Loan Clients Trading & wealth management, global Institutional (e.g., Coinbase), high-net-worth Risk Controls Daily mark-to-market, conservative LTV, regulated ETFs only 24-hour risk management, direct crypto custody Crypto Integration Scope Net worth/liquidity calculations include crypto ETF holdings Expanding to tokenized assets and blockchain lendingShareExportRewrite The action also puts JPMorgan squarely in contention with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley repo desks, which have now begun adding crypto ETFs to their own trading and lending businesses. Turbocharging ETF Liquidity Through using ETF shares as collateral, JPMorgan can boost spot Bitcoin ETF liquidity and trading volumes. The analysts feel that this would make ETFs even more attractive to institutions considering the reality that clients would be in a position to use their holdings to finance leverage.”. This action is already challenging the difference between mainstream finance and crypto, as Bitcoin Magazine indicates: ”JPMorgan just made Bitcoin ETF shares mainstream collateral.”. The lines between TradFi and crypto are officially blurred.” The sentiment is echoed by fintech analyst Frank Chaparro, who remarked, “Jamie Dimon: ‘I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.’ JPMorgan: ‘We’ll lend against it.’ Wild times.” For many in the industry, this is a clear signal that Wall Street is not just tolerating crypto — it’s actively integrating it into the core mechanics of global finance. The news has also created a furor of discussion among traders and institutional investors. All of them see JPMorgan's action as an accelerator that will turbocharge ETF liquidity and motivate other big banks to join the bandwagon. With assets under management of Bitcoin ETF increasing, the ability to trade these shares as collateral is going to drive more volume, tighter spreads, and increasing usage of crypto-backed financial products. The bottom line: JPMorgan's use of Bitcoin ETF shares as collateral is a watershed moment for both Wall Street and crypto. By satisfying the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, the bank is improving ETF liquidity while opening the door to wider institutional acceptance of crypto as an acceptable financial tool.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9456/jp-morgan-to-accept-bitcoin-etf-shares-for-loans,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Announcements",cryptocompare

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy’s $45 million presale, BTC Bull’s giveaways, and BDAG’s Buyer Battles make waves in crypto. Table of Contents Buyer battles are minting daily BDAG millionaires Why the Solaxy token presale ends upfront winners Bitcoin milestones are fueling the BTC bull presale Don’t just watch, win with BlockDAG What do Solaxy (SOLX) token buyers and BTC Bull presale participants have in common? They’re not waiting around. Solaxy’s presale is closing in on $45m as it gears up to become Solana’s first Layer-2. BTC Bull is giving out Bitcoin for free to holders as BTC hits new milestones, and it’s already raised over $6.7m. Meanwhile, the real-time action is happening at BlockDAG (BDAG), where one bold move can win someone millions of BDAG in a single day. Buyer Battles are flipping the game, no luck, no referrals, just the biggest purchase of the day takes home what’s left of a 150m BDAG prize pool. And with BDAG still at just $0.0018, this is the lowest price it’ll ever be. It’s arguably one of the best crypto presales to be in right now. With the June 13 GO LIVE event closing in, every day that passes is a chance missed. You might also like: Integrating LI.FI into banking APIs for blockchain-powered transactions Buyer battles are minting daily BDAG millionaires Every day, someone is winning millions of BDAG tokens, just by making the biggest buy. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles reset every 24 hours and set aside 150 million BDAG for one winner. No referrals, no waiting for luck, just the highest single purchase of the day walks away with what’s left of the bonus pool. And with presale activity rising fast, these overnight wins are getting bigger. Don’t watch this opportunity pass by. Make a move while it lasts! The current BDAG price is just $0.0018, the lowest it’ll ever be before listings hit. Over 21.9 billion BDAG have already been sold, with more than $287 million raised. That’s not small interest, it’s heavy buying from people who know what they’re doing. And with the GO LIVE event confirmed for June 13, this window is closing fast. What makes this the best crypto presale right now isn’t just the low price. It’s the mechanics. Tokens can 2x through the Double Up offer, available to buyers who reinvest 50% of their original purchase. And they can stack even more by winning a Buyer Battle. It’s one of the few presales where early action pays in real time, every single day. Whether using the mobile-friendly X1 miner or scaling up to the powerful X100 ASIC, BlockDAG has the hardware and ecosystem to back its momentum. The best crypto presale right now is the one rewarding bold moves before the market even opens. Why the Solaxy token presale ends upfront winners The token is positioning itself as Solana’s first Layer-2, with a dual-chain model that brings in Ethereum’s strengths too. The presale ends June 16, and over $43.4m has already been raised. At the current rate of $0.001744 per token, buyers are stacking in bulk ahead of its planned listings. With staking rewards hitting 94% APY and the first tools like the block explorer already live, the early ecosystem is already taking shape. There’s a clear push behind this project: a total supply of 138 billion tokens, solid tokenomics with 30% for development and 25% for rewards, and a roadmap that includes a DEX and a no-code launchpad. Predictions put the Solaxy token at $0.00879 by the end of 2025, with long-term forecasts crossing $0.05 in a few years. That makes now a strong entry point before the presale closes and price discovery kicks in. Bitcoin milestones are fueling the BTC bull presale The BTC Bull presale is built around a simple idea, reward holders in actual Bitcoin as BTC crosses key price levels. With milestones set at $150k, $200k, and $250k, buyers are positioning early to collect those airdrops. The presale has already raised over $6.7 million, with the current token price sitting at $0.002545. Add a 61% staking APY and regular token burns when BTC hits other benchmarks like $125k and $175k, and there’s plenty of incentive to hold long-term. Running on Ethereum and fully audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, BTC Bull offers simple entry options through ETH, USDT, or card via Best Wallet. The presale runs until June 30, so the window to get in early is still open. Forecasts expect the token to hit $0.0076 by the end of 2025 and $0.0151 by 2026. Don’t just watch, win with BlockDAG Solaxy token buyers are stacking in ahead of the June 16 presale close, with over $43 million already raised and strong forecasts ahead. Meanwhile, the BTC Bull presale is giving out real Bitcoin as rewards, with airdrops and token burns tied to BTC milestones, plus a 61% APY for staking. But while both projects are building momentum, BlockDAG is rewarding action daily. Its Buyer Battles give away up to 150 million BDAG every 24 hours, no luck needed, just the biggest buy wins. At just $0.0018, BDAG is at its lowest entry point, and with GO LIVE reveal on June 13, prices are set to change. Investors who are still watching from the sidelines may be missing what could be the best crypto presale right now. With bold buyers already winning millions daily, this is a shot to multiply holdings before the market even opens. Don’t wait, jump in or miss out.

2025-06-05T16:55:57,"Here Are the Two Most Important Charts in All of Macro, According to Former Goldman Sachs Executive Raoul Pal","Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal is outlining what he says are the two most important charts “in all of macro.” The Real Vision chief executive and co-founder tells his 1.2 million followers on X that aging demographics force governments to borrow more money to support gross domestic product (GDP) growth and pay interest on the debt. Pal’s first chart looks at the US labor force participation rate against the inverted chart for US government debt as a percentage of GDP. Source: Raoul Pal/X His second chart looks at U.S. Federal Reserve net liquidity compared to the normal chart for US government debt as a percentage of GDP. Source: Raoul Pal/X Pal says the charts highlight a serious macroeconomic challenge, and the end result will be currency debasement. “At over 100% of GDP in debt there isn’t enough economic cash flow to fund the debt growth, so it gets ‘printed’ via Fed Net Liquidity and also forced, via regulation, onto the balance sheet of the banks. That debases the currency and lowers the denominator, optically making scarce assets more valuable. Crypto (mainly Bitcoin) is the life raft as it not only offsets the annual 8% debasement but also gains value due to adoption effects.” In the long run, Pal says he believes artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will improve the dilemma and play a key role in mitigating the pressures of aging demographics.

2025-06-05T16:49:37,"Binance Research: RWA Token Market Hits $23B as Private Credit Leads 260% Surge in H1 2025","The tokenized real-world asset (RWA) sector has witnessed huge growth in 2025, according to new findings from Binance Research, authored by Moulik Nagesh, Joshua Wong, Michael JJ, and Asher Lin Jiayong. In just the first half of the year, the RWA market has ballooned from $8.6 billion to over $23 billion—a massive 260% surge. This expansion shows a dramatic shift in how traditional financial assets are being integrated into the blockchain sector. Tokenized Private Credit Takes the Lead Driving this explosive growth is tokenized private credit, which now represents a dominant 58% of the total RWA market . This asset class has outpaced even tokenized U.S. Treasuries, which hold an estimated 34% market share. The appeal of private credit lies in its yield-generating potential and growing demand from DeFi-native and institutional investors seeking alternatives to saturated lending protocols. Time to look at June's market insights! Discover the current market landscape and key insights on: Spot ETF Flows Corporate BTC Treasuries Sector Divergence Tokenized RWAs …and more. Read here https://t.co/XItAOGvn5O — Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) June 5, 2025 According to the report, a standout contributor in this category is Tradable, a protocol built on ZKSync Era that launched in January 2025. Tradable has already tokenized more than US$2 billion in assets, becoming a clear front-runner in the race to bridge TradFi and DeFi. Its meteoric rise reflects both product-market fit and a growing appetite for tokenized debt instruments among investors and protocols. DeFi Integration Shows Maturity A major development in the RWA space is its increasing integration with decentralized finance. The BlackRock BUIDL fund , now the largest tokenized treasury product with $2.9 billion in assets (up from $649 million at the start of the year), recently launched its first direct DeFi integration through Euler Finance. This allows users to lend and borrow directly against tokenized treasury assets, introducing a new era of composability and utility for on-chain financial products. Other players, such as Centrifuge and Securitize, have launched tokenized funds on the Solana blockchain, connecting with DeFi platforms like Kamino Finance. These integrations improve liquidity and accessibility, allowing RWAs to serve as a reliable source of yield and helping DeFi evolve from a self-contained ecosystem into a more robust and externally linked financial system. A Broader Bull Market Boost According to the report, the growth of tokenized RWAs also coincides with a broader bullish trend in crypto markets. In May 2025, the overall crypto market rose by 10.3% despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of US$5.2 billion, the strongest since late 2024, helping Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of around US$112K. This rally was bolstered by stablecoin legislation progress in both the U.S. and Hong Kong, as well as growing corporate treasury adoption. With 116 public companies now holding over 809,000 BTC, and firms starting to cautiously diversify into ETH, SOL, and XRP, the market is showing signs of increasing maturity. While Gaming and Layer 2 sectors lagged, DeFi surged by 19% in May, reflecting a rotation of capital into yield-bearing sectors—like RWAs. According to Binance Research, the fusion of RWAs with DeFi could be a defining narrative of this cycle, offering a scalable and sustainable model for blockchain-based finance.

2025-06-05T16:47:35,"On-Chain Data Signals ‘Buy the Dip’ as Bitcoin Hashrate Hits New Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) is down almost 7% from its all-time high (ATH), and on-chain signals are flashing a buying opportunity. According to Darkfost, a pseudonymous analyst at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, this buy signal is coming from the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons indicator. This metric tracks the Bitcoin hashrate and is used to identify potential entry points during a market correction. Is it Time to Buy the Dip? The Hash Ribbon monitors Bitcoin mining activity and tells when miners are under stress or capitulating by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of the hashrate. Miner capitulation refers to a period when miners shut down their hardware and sell off their coin reserves to remain afloat because BTC has fallen below a certain price. On most occasions, the capitulation coincides with the hashrate recovery. The hashrate metric tells how much computational power is required to solve complex math problems and approve transactions on the Bitcoin network. During this period of recovery, mining becomes more difficult. Market experts say buying BTC during miner capitulation yields significant returns, and the best buy signals are seen during hashrate recoveries. Recently, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been reaching new highs, with the latest being 1.016 billion TH/S. The network’s mining difficulty also surged past 126 trillion during the last adjustment on May 30. “We recently got a new buy signal from the Hash Ribbons indicator. This metric helps us assess the level of stress in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. It’s not a big surprise considering that the hashrate has recently reached new all-time highs,” Darkfost stated. Miners Are Selling Their BTC Furthermore, the CryptoQuant analyst noted that the Hash Ribbon’s flashing a buy signal is a short-term negative. This is because miners selling their BTC to stay operational create long-term profitable opportunities. Darkfost explained that the indicator has always been accurate except once, during the 2021 China mining ban event. Hence, the possibility of the metric being correct this time is high. “Bottom line, this signal is telling you that buying the dip around here is a smart move,” he added. The analysis comes as a solo BTC miner defied hashrate odds and beat mining giants to validate a block on the Bitcoin network, earning a reward worth over $330,000.

2025-06-05T16:39:33,"Shiba Inu price at risk of deeper dive as whales capitulate","Shiba Inu price remained under pressure Thursday as holders continued to capitulate amid the ongoing crypto market downturn. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) dropped to $0.00001275, its lowest level since May 9, and is now down 28% from its May peak. The meme coin has struggled in recent weeks as demand weakened and investors began exiting positions following prolonged underperformance. On-chain data shows that Shiba Inu’s network realized profit/loss (NPL) has remained negative for several months. The NPL metric measures the average profit or loss of all coins that change addresses daily, calculated by the difference between the last move price and the new transaction price. You might also like: Ethereum price forms bullish setups as Wall Street demand gains steam A negative NPL indicates coins are being sold at a loss — a clear sign of bearish sentiment. This decline has coincided with ongoing whale selling . Data reveals that whale holdings have dropped from 748 trillion tokens in January to just over 718 trillion today. Meanwhile, the supply of SHIB on exchanges has been rising steadily, signaling increased selling pressure. Shiba Inu NPL and whale transaction | Source: Santiment Additional data shows Shiba Inu’s spot market volume has also declined. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB recorded just $141.8 million in daily trading volume, significantly lower than other meme coins. Dogecoin registered $764 million, while Pepe topped the list with $1.08 billion. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that SHIB peaked at $0.00001762 on May 11, following a broader crypto market rally. Since then, it has dropped to $0.00001275, breaking below the lower boundary of an ascending broadening wedge pattern. SHIB has also moved below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, reinforcing a bearish bias. The Relative Strength Index remains above the oversold zone, suggesting that further downside is still possible. Given the current setup, capitulation may continue, with sellers likely targeting the next key support level at $0.000010, the lowest point from April 7. A move above the 200-day moving average at $0.00001570 would be required to invalidate the current bearish outlook.

2025-06-05T16:38:31,"Altcoins today: XRP forms a risky pattern, Lagrange gains over 300%","Cryptos displayed mixed performances in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin remained stuck below $105,000 . While Ripple’s XRP threatened a decline to the crucial $2 support barrier, Lagrange (LA) soared over 300% in the past day, propelled by top-tier exchange listings. Let’s explore further details about the duo’s performance over the last 24 hours and what to anticipate in the short term. XRP: $2 in danger as inverted cup and handle emerges Ripple’s native token fails to keep pace as massive token supply meets unclear regulatory developments. XRP trades at $2.18 after surrendering 20% of its value from last month’s peak of $2.658. The alt’s trading volume plunged 15% in the past day, signaling weakness. Moreover, the daily chart reveals a crucial technical pattern. XRP has formed an inverted cup & handle setup on its daily chart. Source – TradingView This is a classic bearish pattern that often heralds sharp price dips. The formation signals dwindling buyer momentum, leaving XRP prone to substantial declines in the coming sessions. Bears will target the vital support at $2, below which the digital asset could witness massive slumps or prolonged consolidations. XRP risks dipping to the multi-month foothold at $1.71, leading to a 22% dip from its current market value. Buyers should hold above $2 to keep the remittance token afloat in the near term. Moreover, bullish developments such as XRP spot ETF approval could mean stable uptrends in the coming months. Polymarket shows a 93% chance of the SEC authorizing XRP exchange-traded funds in 2025, a significant increase from 68% in April. Source – Polymarket Lagrange soars over 300% after tier-1 listings While XRP exhibited bearishness, Lagrange (LA) stole the show with staggering gains in the past day. LA climbed from $0.409 to an intraday high of $1.7803, translating to an over 330% upswing. It hovers at $1.45, with an over 35,900% surge in daily trading volume, signaling colossal trader and investor interest. Chart by CoinMarketCap What drove Lagrange’s latest outperformance? LA’s massive uptrend comes after the project confirmed listing on multiple leading exchanges via its X handle . The altcoin is now available in leading trading platforms, including KuCoin, Gate.io, Coinbase, Bitget, Bybit, and Binance Alpha. These developments saw Lagrange dominate social media chatter, with heightened developer and trader activities propelling LA prices. Lagrange is a crypto ecosystem that prioritizes modular blockchain infrastructure, enabling developers to create secure and scalable decentralized applications (dApps). LA will enjoy increased visibility and liquidity after the latest exchange listings. However, LA will hardly remain elevated after the massive rally. The alt exhibits significant volatility, calling for a cautious approach. Potential profit-taking could send the alt tumbling in the upcoming hours.

2025-06-05T16:37:33,"Bitcoin and altcoins are crashing as investors ‘are locking profits’","Bitcoin and other altcoins continued their downward trend on Thursday as the recent bullish momentum faded. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped briefly below $104,000 as the market capitalization of all coins fell by 1% to $3.27 trillion. Some of the top laggards were altcoins like Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Jupiter ( JUP ), and Ethena ( ENA ). Analysts suggest the ongoing pullback is a typical occurrence during bull markets, as some investors begin locking in profits. In a statement to crypto.news, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said: “After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. This behavior is not unusual in bull cycles, where sharp rallies often lead to a wave of corrections as traders seek to de-risk their portfolios.” Ryan added that the ongoing geopolitical developments like trade tensions from the US had contributed to market uncertainty and triggered a risk-off sentiment. He added that: “While the overall outlook for digital assets remains positive, current price action suggests a cooling period, especially in speculative altcoins that saw outsized gains. Investor sentiment is being recalibrated in response to these developments.” Historically, Bitcoin tends to pull back after reaching a key resistance level, often triggering a broader correction across altcoins. For example, BTC hit a record high of $108,335 in December before retreating to $88,987 in January. It later surged to a new all-time high of $109,300 in the same month. Bitcoin price chart analysis points to an eventual rebound BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally, which could spark a broader altcoin rebound. On the daily chart, BTC is gradually forming a bullish flag pattern — characterized by a steep vertical rally (the flagpole) followed by a downward-sloping consolidation channel (the flag). This setup is typically viewed as a continuation pattern. Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the recent pullback forming the handle section. The cup features a depth of approximately 30%, or 34,000 points. Using standard technical analysis, the target for a cup-and-handle breakout is calculated by adding the cup’s depth to its upper boundary. In this case, adding $38,000 to the top of the pattern yields a projected target of $146,000.

2025-06-05T16:34:03,"Bitcoin price could reach reach $125k in June: Bitfinex","Bitcoin’s short-term price performance will largely be influenced by Friday’s U.S. jobs report and a continued increase in ETF inflows, according to Bitfinex analysts. Bitcoin (BTC) could climb to $125,000 by the end of June if macroeconomic conditions remain favorable, analysts told crypto.news on June 5. The primary catalyst in the near term is Friday’s non-farm payroll report, which is expected to show a slowdown in employment. Current forecasts for new non-farm payrolls range between 125,000 and 130,000 — down from April’s 177,000. Bitfinex analysts believe that a weaker-than-expected print would be bullish for Bitcoin, as it could accelerate the Federal Reserve’s timeline for interest rate cuts, a move generally favorable for risk assets like BTC. “We believe if Bitcoin maintains support above $105,000, it could target the $120,000–$125,000 range in June. This will not be catalysed just from the labour market but it could be a domino in multiple catalysts prompting the Fed to cut rates at a faster than expected pace,” Bitfinex analysts. Still, a stronger-than-expected jobs report could make rate cuts less likely. This would strengthen the dollar, but hurt Bitcoin and other crypto assets. In any case, the effects of the jobs data will trickle down to other Bitcoin price catalysts. This includes ETF inflows, which will be influenced by rate cuts and the strength of the dollar. You might also like: Elon Musk called it an “abomination” — but the Big Beautiful Bill might be crypto’s backdoor stimulus Jobs data remains in focus for Bitcoin’s price Investor sentiment remains divided ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report, given the mixed signals from earlier labor market data. For instance, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed strength, with job openings climbing to 7.39 million, up from 7.2 million in March. On the other hand, ADP private payrolls came in significantly below expectations, posting just 37,000 new jobs versus the anticipated 110,000. The breakdown revealed that small businesses shed 13,000 jobs, and large firms cut 3,000, while midsized companies added 49,000. While the U.S. labor market remains resilient , employers are concerned about the potential negative effects of the U.S. tariffs on its major trading partners.

2025-06-05T16:30:53,"Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142","Solana (SOL) is currently navigating a challenging environment as the broader crypto market experiences a cooldown. After an impressive run earlier this year, momentum has slowed significantly, and SOL is struggling to reclaim the $160 level with conviction. The lack of strong demand has been evident in recent sessions, as buying pressure fades and volume remains low across major altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout Despite this cooling phase, many investors remain optimistic. A growing number of market participants believe Solana could lead the next altseason once conditions stabilize and liquidity returns to the market. Historically, SOL has shown the ability to recover rapidly and outperform in bullish phases, making it one of the top contenders for explosive upside when sentiment shifts. However, in the short term, caution prevails. Top analyst Carl Runefelt has highlighted a key technical development, noting that Solana might be on the verge of breaking a horizontal support zone. This event could trigger further downside in the near term. If this support fails, traders should prepare for increased volatility. Still, the broader consensus remains that SOL’s structural strength and ecosystem development position it well for long-term upside once macro conditions align. Solana Faces Bear Flag Breakdown Risk As Uncertainty Grows Solana has been locked in a tight range just below the $160 mark, struggling to reclaim key levels despite multiple attempts. For several days, momentum has faded, and with global markets under pressure, traders are bracing for increased volatility. The broader crypto market is losing steam as Bitcoin and Ethereum fail to sustain upward moves, which puts added pressure on altcoins like Solana. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, with ongoing tariff disputes and rising bond yields fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. The US bond market, in particular, is flashing signs of stress, adding to the caution in risk-on assets. If these conditions persist, altcoins may face a challenging period as capital retreats to more stable assets like Bitcoin or exits the market altogether. Runefelt recently highlighted a key technical pattern on Solana’s chart—a bear flag forming around horizontal support. According to his analysis, this structure could break down any hour now, which would confirm the bearish setup and potentially send SOL down toward the $142 level. This target aligns with previous support zones and could act as a temporary bottom if the broader market stabilizes. Despite the short-term risks, long-term sentiment around Solana remains cautiously optimistic. The network’s continued development and strong DeFi presence could fuel a recovery once market conditions improve. For now, however, traders are closely watching the $160 resistance and the $150–$152 support area, which could determine the next directional move. A clean break below support would likely trigger a wave of selling, while a reclaim of the $160 level could invalidate the bearish setup and open the door for a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? SOL Tests Key Support As Bearish Momentum Builds Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $152.62 on the 4-hour chart, testing a critical horizontal support zone as bearish momentum continues. The recent price action shows a clear downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows forming since the rejection from the $176–$180 area in late May. All key moving averages—34 EMA, 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA—are positioned above the current price, signaling short-term weakness and a lack of bullish momentum. Volume has picked up slightly as price nears support, suggesting increasing market interest at this level. However, the failure to break above the 34 EMA (currently at $157.70) reinforces the view that sellers are still in control. The flattening 200 SMA at $165.31 and declining 50 SMA around $159.82 indicate that SOL must reclaim the $160–$165 zone to regain strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst If the $150–$152 support range fails to hold, Solana could break down and target the next key support area around $142, in line with the projected move of the bear flag pattern identified by analysts.

2025-06-05T16:27:19,"White House Crypto Chief Bo Hines Met With El Salvador’s Bukele to Discuss Bitcoin","El Salvador and the United States are looking to ramp up their crypto partnership. Bo Hines, the executive director of the White House’s Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday. “The aspiring Bitcoin Superpower came to meet with the OG Bitcoin Country to discuss areas of mutual interest and possible collaboration relating to bitcoin, stablecoins and digital assets,” Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, told CoinDesk. “Over the coming months, I believe we will see some extraordinary things happen for both partners as a result of this meeting,” she added, without elaborating further. Hines is an important player in Washington when it comes to crypto policy, working alongside David Sacks, who chairs the crypto council and took on the role of AI and crypto czar. The two countries have gotten closer since U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Bukele was welcomed by Trump at the White House in April, where they discussed security agreements. El Salvador has agreed to take custody of some of the illegal immigrants deported by the U.S. in the country’s maximum security mega-prison, CECOT, built in 2022 as part of the government’s crackdown on violent gangs. El Salvador’s crypto regulation agency, the National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD), has also already met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the purpose of establishing a cross-border regulatory sandbox. The idea, according to CNAD President Juan Carlos Reyes, is for the U.S. to take advantage of El Salvador’s experience in regulating digital assets to evaluate streamlined regulatory approaches for its own framework.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/05/white-house-crypto-chief-bo-hines-met-with-el-salvadors-bukele-to-discuss-bitcoin,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Policy|El Salvador|Bitcoin|White House|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T16:15:38,"Trump's Truth Social files S-1 for a Bitcoin ETF","Donald Trump’s Truth Social is submitting its S-1 form to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a Bitcoin ETF. This corresponds to the company’s 19b-4 filing. Like the other spot BTC ETFs, the fund is designed to track the price of Bitcoin and offer a simpler way for investors to gain exposure without holding the asset directly. Crypto.com will be the only company that stores, executes, and provides liquidity for the ETF’s Bitcoin. However, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF launch is pending until the Registration Statement goes into effect and a Form 19b-4 filing with the SEC is approved. NYSE Arca will list the Shares when they go public. Trump Media looks to add to current market offerings The NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 form to list and sell shares of this fund and has already started the approval process in earnest. According to the S-1 form , Yorkville America is supporting the fund. However, some important information is missing from the file, like the fund’s ticker, seed capital, or share price. The filing statement for a Bitcoin ETF by Trump Media is a big step for the company to grow beyond its current social media, streaming, and fintech businesses. With this move, DJT can take advantage of the growing interest among institutions in Bitcoin investment vehicles. The business is setting this up as a physically-backed Bitcoin product. The ETF will hold real Bitcoin instead of swaps or futures contracts. This project aligns with the company’s “Bitcoin treasury strategy,” which was partly talked about in forward-looking statements. It suggests that the company is interested in crypto in more ways than just the ETF product. Truth Social Bitcoin ETF survival odds in the competitive market The market’s reception remains uncertain because Trump Media is a relatively new company dealing with well-known financial institutions with deeper experience in ETF management and distribution. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs came out in January 2024, the market has grown to have more than $130 billion in assets. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), which has assets worth nearly $69 billion, is the leader. The company already has a fintech brand called “Truth.Fi” that could be used as a distribution route, but the filing doesn’t say how this new product fits in with what they’re already doing. Analysts believe it could be a new ground for this industry because it involves a company with ties to the US president. But Truth Social is late to the party because it is filing in an area where many ETFs are already very cheap and easy to trade. In addition, this adds to the controversy about Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry. This might make it harder as investors doubt Trump’s crypto companies’ viability after his tenure. However, it is good timing for Trump’s organization. As reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan will start allowing its trading and wealth clients to borrow cash using crypto-related assets as collateral. Also, the bank will start including some clients’ crypto assets in their net worth figures. This means that Bitcoin and other digital assets will be treated the same as stocks, cars, and art. A law called the US Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) makes it easy to pledge stocks in the US. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

More than 4,000 investors participated, the exchange announced, noting it will take into account customer demand when planning the development of the new market. Moscow Exchange releases first Bitcoin futures trading stats The volume of Bitcoin futures traded on Moscow Exchange exceeded 420 million rubles (over $5.3 million) at the end of June 4, the day the new product was offered to investors, a representative of the platform’s operator announced. Nearly 8,600 transactions were carried out and the number of clients involved in the trading reached 4,137, the Russian business daily Kommersant reported, quoting Maria Patrikeeva, managing director of the Moscow Exchange Derivatives Market. The executive emphasized that the leading Russian exchange intends to develop the new segment in accordance with customer requests and elaborated: “90% of the turnover on the futures market comes from qualified investors. Therefore, the launch of futures on shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF investment fund — an instrument available exclusively to this category of investors — was a logical and timely step in the development of our line.” The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) started trading futures contracts for the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) on Wednesday. The value is expressed in U.S. dollars per lot, and settlements are made in Russian rubles. The contracts will expire in September. The trading platform revealed it’s going to launch the product right after the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) said it’s authorizing the offering of crypto derivatives in the country. The regulator did that while warning both financial firms and their clients against direct investments in cryptocurrencies. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, managed by the American investment firm BlackRock, is one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds allowing investors to gain exposure to the price changes of BTC without directly holding the crypto. The fund has $70 billion in assets. Legalization opens crypto derivatives market for Russian investors Following the CBR’s announcement , Russia’s largest credit institution, majority state-owned Sberbank, launched structured bonds tied to the value of Bitcoin, which were also listed on MOEX. Another government-controlled bank, VTB, said it will offer the bonds to its clients. Sergey Selyutin, head of trading operations at the bank’s “VTB My Investments” arm, commented that the trading results from the Moscow Exchange indicate that Russian investors are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios and are ready to work with new assets. Currently, cryptocurrency derivatives are only available to “ highly qualified ” investors as the Bank of Russia favors restricting access to volatile assets and products based on them. The regulator has been a strong opponent to legalizing the free circulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian economy. To be treated as qualified investors, private individuals should prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $633,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (almost $1.27 million), the CBR suggested earlier this year. This week, the monetary authority proposed to raise the limit for non-qualified investors who want to buy digital financial assets (DFAs) from the current 600,000 rubles to 1 million rubles (around $12,500). Under Russian DFA law, the category includes various tokenized assets and rights, other than crypto. The CBR’s regulatory nod sparked a race between financial and banking institutions in Russia to tap into the domestic crypto derivatives market. One of the companies competing for a share, the Russian broker Finam, said it will launch products based on the most popular coins, including BTC and ETH.

2025-06-05T15:59:30,"Can Crypto Investors Handle Extreme Market Volatility? Insights for 2025","For new crypto investors, handling the sometimes stomach-churning volatility common to the crypto market must be incredibly difficult. The market is constructed to take as much money from as many investors as possible, and therefore watching your crypto investment surge to the heavens and then come crashing down in a short period of time has led many to sell and leave. What should these investors bear in mind before investing in crypto? Is this cycle different? One major factor to bear in mind for all new investors to the crypto space is that this cycle may be quite different to those of the past. What generally used to happen is that once Bitcoin had reached its next local top, the money would flow out and into Ethereum and the other big layer 1s. From there, it would enter the mid-caps, and finally flow into the small-caps. If the observant trader/investor made the right moves, getting into the big movers, especially among the small-caps, they were sometimes able to make several multiples of their original outlay. Bitcoin dominance just keeps going up Source: TradingView This time, at least up to now, it has been Bitcoin that has hogged the market focus. Bitcoin Dominance, a chart of Bitcoin measured against the rest of the crypto market, has been climbing in Bitcoin’s favour since September 2022, which is longer than the entire bull market so far. Many new retail investors are here for the big gains However, many investors entering into this bull market cycle are here for the big money. They no doubt heard the stories of past bull markets and are here for that potential 100x. While the 100x gains might still be a possibility, they are likely to be very few and far between now. To be honest, a 2x or 3x gain is a fantastic return for an investor in these times when the best performing money market return of 6% or 7% is the norm. Stomach-churning volatility wrecks minds That said, even to get some kind of return on altcoin positions, investors have to experience sometimes extreme volatility, where their position might be up 50% in the morning, and end the day at -25%, with the next day bringing a huge 80% swing to the upside. The likelihood of an investor rage-quitting exactly at the deepest point of the correction is often quite high. Therefore, having a longer term time horizon may be the way to go. The emotional rollercoaster of the sharp ups and downs, or having to look at your altcoin losing value day after day cannot be healthy for anyone. Buying a position when things look at their worst is generally accepted as the best time to get in, rather than trying to jump onto a speeding rocket only to find that you’ve just bought the top. Of course, your altcoin needs to be fundamentally sound, and it must also be borne in mind that even if you’ve done all the right research, it might just be that the market is not ready for the upside move that could help to buoy your altcoin higher. Take your memecoin gains off the table (if you get them) Finally, if you are in the crypto space for the memecoins, this certainly is where some big money can be made. That said, most will end up losing, simply because they do not know how to play the game correctly. One of the biggest pieces of advice here is to take your initial investment out as soon as you can, then you are playing with the house’s money. Also, take profits regularly. If you have made a 10x, take the money. Yes, it could be that your memecoin might go another 10x, but the chances are that it will plummet and head to zero as soon as the market turns.

2025-06-05T15:57:07,"Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping – Is the Trade War Coming to an End? Here Are the Details of the Call","US President Donald Trump announced that he had a phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping that lasted approximately 1.5 hours. The main agenda item of the meeting was the new trade agreement recently agreed between the two countries. Trump said the meeting had produced positive results for both sides and that complexities, especially on the rare earths issue, had been resolved. Trump said on social media, “I had a very productive phone call with President Xi of China. During this call that lasted about an hour and a half, we discussed some of the sensitive points of the trade agreement we recently agreed on. The meeting was very positive for both countries. There should no longer be any question marks about the complexity of rare earth products.” It was also stated that representatives of the two countries will hold face-to-face meetings at a location to be determined shortly. It was announced that the US side will be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Trump also said that President Xi invited him and his wife Melania Trump to China and that in response to this kind invitation, Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were invited to the U.S. Trump noted that the meeting focused almost entirely on trade issues, and that other geopolitical issues such as Russia-Ukraine or Iran were not brought up. Related News: Fresh Whales Are Very Active in Bitcoin: They Are Accumulating BTC at Record Levels - Here's What It Means The call came just days after Trump accused China of violating the initial trade deal reached in May last week and just a day after a Truth Social post in which he said Xi was “extremely difficult to make deals with.” As a result of negotiations between the parties, it was decided that the US would reduce customs duties on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would reduce duties on US imports from 125% to 10%. Trump, however, expressed disappointment that China had not fully complied with the agreement. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC: “The United States has done its part, but China has been slow to remove the non-tariff barriers that are in the agreement. This is completely unacceptable and must be addressed.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping – Is the Trade War Coming to an End?

2025-06-05T15:54:00,"Introducing The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF","Summary The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF is an actively managed strategy that synthetically provides exposure to bitcoin ETPs, seeking to gain indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin. Every week, BCCC seeks to write call options against a portion of its notional holdings in an effort to harvest option premiums and perform distributions. By writing call options against only a portion of its bitcoin ETP exposure, BCCC maintains the potential ability to benefit from a portion of the gains that may be realized. On June 4 th , 2025, we listed the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF ( BCCC ) on the Cboe BZX Exchange. BCCC is the latest addition to Global X’s covered call and growth ETF suite, and it is designed to offer investors the opportunity to indirectly participate in the price performance of bitcoin ETPs (exchange-traded products), while seeking to harvest option premiums and manage volatility by selling call options on the same underlying security. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) intrigue as an investment opportunity stems from a variety of factors, but whether investors choose to lean into its status as a decentralized currency, or simply view it as a speculative potential growth opportunity, the trajectory it has assumed over the last few years has been difficult to ignore. These days, new innovations in exchanges and products have made investing in bitcoin easier than ever. However, should investors wish to take positions, it’s likely they would still need to deal with the levels of volatility it has historically demonstrated. With wide price swings representing a potential deterrent, gaining indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin ETPs that provide exposure to bitcoin, while employing a call option writing strategy to exchange a portion of upside price appreciation potential for a stream of premiums, may represent an interesting value proposition. BCCC Offers Indirect Exposure to Bitcoin Within the Wrapper of an ETF Investors have sought various means by which to gain exposure to bitcoin over the years. From mining bitcoin itself, to trading it on crypto exchanges and engaging with bitcoin trusts, access has become increasingly seamless and potentially more efficient. Benefits of the progression have included wider accessibility and liquidity. Most recently, the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and ETFs that trade bitcoin futures have ushered in a new means by which to achieve this exposure. The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF seeks to achieve indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin by buying and selling options on bitcoin ETPs. Specifically, it utilizes long call options and short put options to obtain synthetic exposure to the price returns of these products. For illustrative purposes only. Illustration assumes the options positions are made at-the-money and does not include the effect of the premiums paid or received for establishing the option positions. BCCC’s options positions may not always be made at-the-money, which could affect the correlation of the returns. Gaining exposure to bitcoin ETPs in this fashion is potentially less expensive than buying the ETP outright, as options often cost less to purchase than the underlying vehicles they reference. It may also result in fund returns that deviate modestly from that of the underlying ETPs amid a weekly roll period. That said, upon the outcome period’s conclusion, returns are expected to converge to an approximate 1:1 rate. The Fund Seeks to Provide Weekly Distributions, Utilizing a Systematically Active Approach Although the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF is an active investment strategy, a series of functions within the fund are aimed at remaining relatively consistent. For instance, portfolio managers will seek to write weekly call options that are at-the-money or slightly out-of-the-money, from which approximately 75% of the call premiums received are expected to be ultimately distributed to shareholders. Additionally, only a portion of the funds’ notional holdings are expected to be covered, on a roll-to-roll basis, which is designed to allow for upside price appreciation potential to be consistently pursued. One of the important levers that BCCC engages to promote potentially higher premium values is weekly option writing. By writing options week after week, in succession, the fund may be able to generate larger premiums than it would by writing options with longer tenors (time until expiration). Options naturally lose value as they approach their expiration date, and this decay happens more rapidly during the final days before expiration. By repeatedly selling short-term weekly options, rather than longer-term options, the fund can potentially capture this accelerated value decrease more efficiently, allowing it to collect more premiums over time when compared to a strategy using longer-dated options. In conjunction with the writing of weekly options, the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF also aims to provide investors with a stream of weekly distributions. Each week, when call options are written, approximately 75% of the premium that is received from writing the call option is expected to be distributed to shareholders, while the balance of the premium is reinvested back into the fund. A distribution will offer investors the opportunity to pursue reinvestment or utilize the proceeds elsewhere. Meanwhile, any automatically re-invested premiums ought to provide a measure of support to the fund’s net asset value (NAV). BCCC May Be Considered a Hedged Bitcoin Strategy The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF writes call options on bitcoin ETPs that are either at-the-money or slightly out-of-the-money. For the portion of the portfolio on which call options are written, its upside is theoretically capped at the strike level of the written call options. An important consideration, however, is that by leaving a portion of the fund’s notional holdings uncovered, investors may still be able to participate in some of the upside of these bitcoin-tracking products. On the other side of the coin, BCCC will remain fully exposed to the downside price movements of the underlying ETPs. This downside is expected to be partially offset by the premiums that are pursued from writing the options. Operating in this fashion, the fund might make a bitcoin investment more palatable for those that still believe it can produce outsized returns but are apprehensive owing to its historically elevated levels of volatility. Conveniently, the same measure of volatility that might promote disinterest in a bitcoin investment is something that may well allow BCCC to procure better option premiums and provide more generous distributions. Bitcoin has shown the propensity to operate under these wider levels of volatility, as illustrated by the standard deviation of its daily returns over time relative to some major domestic equity indices. Conclusion: BCCC May Strike a Balance Between Growth and Distributions Based on the intermittent periods of remarkable price appreciation that bitcoin has been able to realize over the years, it’s no mystery why it has garnered interest from a broad segment of the investment community. Nonetheless, the peaks and valleys that have been associated with these advances may make an unhedged position in bitcoin feel like a roller coaster ride. By writing call options on a portion of bitcoin holdings, investors have the opportunity to maintain a degree of upside price appreciation potential associated with bitcoin, while managing its volatility through the pursuit of option premiums and distributions. The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF provides that potential exposure and may help accomplish that goal.

At-the-Money: An option contract is deemed at-the-money when the price of the underlying instrument is equal to the strike price of the option. Out-of-the-Money: An option contract is deemed out-of-the-money when the price of the underlying instrument is below that of the strike price of a call option or above that of the strike price of a put option. Time Value: The portion of an option premium that is based upon the amount of time that remains until the option reaches its expiration date. Standard Deviation: Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the variation or dispersion within a set of numbers. In investing it is used to discuss the volatility in returns.

However, the subsequent decline made investors nervous, and an analyst made a prediction of $150,000. Accordingly, Foresight Ventures CEO Alice Li predicted that BTC could reach $150,000. The famous CEO said that increased regulatory clarity in the US could push Bitcoin above $150,000 this market cycle. At this point, the famous CEO said that positive US policy changes, including US President Donald Trump’s executive order approving the Bitcoin reserve and stablecoin developments, will be the main drivers of the rally in the rest of 2025. “The 2025 rally in the cryptocurrency market is mainly driven by the change in US policy. One of the strongest drivers of the rally is certainly policy change, with US President Donald Trump’s reserve approval and stablecoin developments as the main catalysts for Bitcoin. These developments could push Bitcoin above $150,000 in this market cycle.” The famous CEO added that the first interest rate cut of the year by the FED could significantly increase Bitcoin's price momentum. Li stated that the GENIUS law is a good start for stablecoin regulations and that the rest of the world will follow the US. “This law has set a great innovation example for the rest of the world. I believe that all other countries, especially Asian countries, Singapore and Hong Kong, will follow suit in a short time,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T15:50:54,"Strategic Move: Smarter Web Company Expands Corporate Bitcoin Holdings","BitcoinWorld Strategic Move: Smarter Web Company Expands Corporate Bitcoin Holdings In a significant move signaling continued confidence in digital assets, UK-listed firm Smarter Web Company has once again increased its Bitcoin reserves. This latest announcement underscores a broader trend of companies exploring and executing strategies to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their treasury management. Smarter Web Company Bitcoin: Expanding Digital Reserves Smarter Web Company recently took to the social media platform X to announce a notable addition to its balance sheet. The company confirmed the purchase of an additional 39.52 BTC. This acquisition wasn’t a one-off decision but fits within a previously stated long-term vision. With this latest purchase, Smarter Web Company’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached an impressive 122.76 BTC. This accumulation demonstrates a clear commitment to Bitcoin as a component of their corporate assets. For a UK-listed entity, such a public and consistent approach to acquiring Bitcoin is noteworthy and provides a real-world example of evolving corporate finance strategies. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Smarter Web Company is not operating in a vacuum. Over the past few years, there has been an observable increase in the number of companies, both public and private, adding Bitcoin to their treasury. This trend, often referred to as adopting Corporate Bitcoin Holdings, is driven by various factors. Many companies see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in a macroeconomic environment characterized by quantitative easing and rising debt levels. Others view it as a store of value akin to digital gold. Furthermore, some corporations believe in the long-term appreciation potential of Bitcoin as the digital asset class matures and gains wider adoption globally. Examples of companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin include: MicroStrategy: A pioneer in the corporate Bitcoin treasury space, holding the largest amount. Tesla: Added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, though its holdings have fluctuated. Block (formerly Square): Another tech company that has allocated capital to Bitcoin. While Smarter Web Company’s holdings are smaller compared to these giants, their systematic approach highlights that this isn’t just a strategy for large tech firms but is being considered and implemented by companies across different sectors and sizes. What Drives Smarter Web Company’s Bitcoin Investment Plan? The recent purchase aligns perfectly with Smarter Web Company’s publicly stated Bitcoin Investment Plan. The company had previously revealed an ambitious long-term strategy to acquire Bitcoin over a 10-year period. This isn’t about timing the market but rather a systematic accumulation approach. A 10-year acquisition plan suggests a strategy similar to Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This approach can help mitigate the risk associated with price volatility, as purchases are made at various price points over time. For a volatile asset like Bitcoin, a long-term DCA strategy can smooth out the average purchase price and potentially yield favorable results over an extended horizon. This long-term view indicates that Smarter Web Company sees Bitcoin not as a short-term speculative play, but as a strategic asset intended to provide value over a decade or more. This commitment over such a long timeframe is a strong signal about their belief in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role within their financial framework. UK Company Bitcoin Strategy: A Look at Adoption Smarter Web Company’s actions provide insight into the evolving UK Company Bitcoin Strategy. While not as widespread as in some other regions, there is growing interest among UK businesses in understanding and potentially adopting digital assets. Factors influencing a UK company’s decision to hold Bitcoin include: Macroeconomic Climate: Concerns about inflation and the stability of traditional fiat currencies. Diversification: Seeking alternative assets uncorrelated or less correlated with traditional markets. Innovation & Future Readiness: Positioning the company at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. Shareholder Value: The potential for asset appreciation to benefit shareholders in the long run. However, UK companies also face unique considerations, including navigating the specific regulatory landscape within the UK, accounting standards for digital assets, and potential public perception. Smarter Web Company’s willingness to publicly pursue a Bitcoin strategy could serve as a case study for other UK firms contemplating similar moves. Their experience navigating the operational and financial aspects of holding Bitcoin will be valuable for the broader market. Benefits and Considerations of Strategic BTC Acquisition Engaging in a Strategic BTC Acquisition, as Smarter Web Company is doing, comes with potential benefits but also important considerations: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often cited as a protection against currency debasement. Store of Value: Its characteristics make it a candidate for preserving wealth over time. Potential for Appreciation: As adoption grows and network effects strengthen, the price could increase significantly. Diversification: Adds an asset class that may behave differently from traditional stocks and bonds. Transparency: Holdings on the blockchain are verifiable. Key Considerations & Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and substantial swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and within the UK. Security Risks: Requires robust security measures to protect private keys and prevent theft. Accounting Treatment: How to classify and account for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current standards. Public & Investor Perception: Some stakeholders may be skeptical or unfamiliar with crypto assets. Companies must carefully weigh these factors, conduct thorough due diligence, and establish clear policies and security protocols before undertaking a strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan. In conclusion, Smarter Web Company’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin, culminating in 122.76 BTC holdings, is a tangible example of a UK-listed company executing a long-term Bitcoin Investment Plan. Their Strategic BTC Acquisition highlights the growing trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings and provides a relevant case study for understanding the motivations, strategies, and considerations involved in adopting digital assets within a corporate treasury framework. As the digital asset space continues to mature, observing the progress and outcomes of companies like Smarter Web Company will offer valuable insights into the future intersection of corporate finance and cryptocurrency.

2025-06-05T15:20:54,"Visa Stablecoin Cards: Revolutionizing Payments Across Asia-Pacific","BitcoinWorld Visa Stablecoin Cards: Revolutionizing Payments Across Asia-Pacific Big news is hitting the wires for anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance and the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies! Visa, a global leader in digital payments, is making a significant move in Asia-Pacific with the introduction of Visa stablecoin cards . This development signals a growing acceptance and integration of digital currencies into everyday transactions, promising exciting possibilities for users and businesses across the region. What Are Visa Stablecoin Cards? At its core, this initiative involves creating payment cards that are directly linked to stablecoin balances. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or sometimes to commodities or other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes them far more practical for everyday transactions and payments. The new Visa stablecoin cards, launched through collaborations with key partners, allow users to convert their fiat currency into supported stablecoins and then use those stablecoins to make purchases anywhere Visa is accepted worldwide. The conversion from stablecoin back to fiat happens seamlessly at the point of sale, meaning the merchant receives traditional currency, while the user spends their digital assets. Exploring the Visa Partnership in Asia Visa isn’t doing this alone. This strategic push into stablecoin payments in Asia-Pacific is a result of a Visa partnership Asia with three notable entities: DCS Singapore, DTC Pay, and StraitsX. Each partner brings a unique strength to the table: DCS Singapore: Likely involved in the card issuance and processing infrastructure. DTC Pay: A payment provider specializing in digital assets, helping to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional payment rails. StraitsX: A prominent stablecoin issuer in Southeast Asia, known for its Singapore Dollar-pegged stablecoin, XSGD, and potentially others. Their role is crucial in providing the stable digital asset layer for these cards. This collaborative approach leverages the expertise of digital asset specialists alongside Visa’s vast global payment network, aiming to create a robust and user-friendly system for stablecoin payments Asia . Driving Stablecoin Payments in Asia-Pacific Why is Visa focusing on stablecoin payments in Asia-Pacific? The region is a hotbed for innovation and has shown significant interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Many countries in Asia-Pacific have rapidly growing digital economies and populations increasingly comfortable with digital finance. The partnership aims to tap into this market by offering a practical use case for stablecoins. By enabling users to spend stablecoins easily at millions of locations, Visa and its partners are providing a tangible benefit that could accelerate the adoption of digital currencies for commerce. This move could significantly boost stablecoin payments Asia -wide, making digital assets more than just speculative investments. Bridging Crypto and Fiat: A New Crypto Payment Solution One of the biggest hurdles for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption has been the difficulty in using digital assets for everyday purchases. You often have to convert crypto back to fiat through an exchange, which can be slow and involve fees, before you can spend it. These new cards act as a crucial bridge. They represent a significant step forward as a crypto payment solution that simplifies the process dramatically. Users can hold stablecoins and spend them directly, with the complexity of conversion handled in the background by the payment processor. This creates a smoother experience akin to using a traditional debit or credit card, but powered by digital assets. Benefits of this approach include: Global Acceptance: Spend stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted. Speed: Transactions can potentially be faster than traditional methods in some cases, depending on the underlying stablecoin network and processing. Reduced Costs: Depending on the card provider and stablecoin network, transaction fees might be lower compared to traditional international transfers or card fees. Ease of Use: Converts a digital asset into a universally accepted payment method. This makes it easier for individuals and potentially businesses to utilize stablecoins for various transactions, from buying groceries to paying for online services. Implications for Digital Currency Adoption Visa’s involvement is a powerful endorsement for the use of stablecoins in commerce. As a globally recognized brand, their participation lends credibility and visibility to digital asset payments. This partnership is likely to have significant implications for overall digital currency adoption , not just in Asia-Pacific but potentially as a model for other regions. Here’s how this could impact the landscape: Increased User Confidence: Seeing a trusted network like Visa facilitate stablecoin transactions can make potential users feel more secure and willing to experiment with digital assets. Broader Merchant Acceptance: While the conversion happens instantly for the merchant, Visa’s integration makes it easier for businesses to effectively ‘accept’ stablecoins without changing their existing payment systems. Regulatory Push: As major players like Visa enter the space, it often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines, which can further legitimize and facilitate digital currency adoption. Innovation Catalyst: This move could inspire other payment networks and financial institutions to explore similar integrations, accelerating the development of crypto payment solutions. While challenges remain, including navigating diverse regulatory environments across Asia-Pacific and ensuring user education, this partnership represents a tangible step towards a future where digital currencies play a more integrated role in the global economy. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite the exciting potential, launching stablecoin-backed cards isn’t without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity surrounding stablecoins varies significantly from country to country in Asia-Pacific. Partners must navigate different legal frameworks regarding digital assets, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Furthermore, ensuring seamless technical integration across different platforms and providing adequate customer support for users who might be new to digital assets are crucial for widespread success. The user experience needs to be as smooth and reliable as using a traditional Visa card. However, the collaboration between a global payment giant and innovative fintech and stablecoin companies suggests a commitment to overcoming these challenges and building a robust infrastructure for the future of payments. Conclusion The launch of Visa stablecoin cards in Asia-Pacific, facilitated by partnerships with DCS Singapore, DTC Pay, and StraitsX, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital payments. By creating a simple and globally accepted way to spend stablecoins, Visa is helping to bridge the gap between the traditional financial system and the digital asset economy. This initiative has the potential to significantly boost stablecoin payments Asia-wide, serving as a powerful new crypto payment solution and accelerating overall digital currency adoption. It’s a clear signal that stablecoins are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative assets, but as viable tools for everyday commerce.

2025-06-05T15:16:08,"Crypto Self Custody Is the Future, and People Say Best Wallet Leads the Way","What does crypto want to be when it grows up? Centralized exchanges like Coinbase have long marketed themselves as crypto’s answer to convenience. User-friendly, regulated, and custodial. Just give them the keys and let them drive. They’ll handle all the boring details – like on/off ramps, UI, integrated swapping, and little things like taking control of your crypto. And in return, all you need to do is trust. But increasingly, that deal sounds like a bad one. The trade-off between trust and control is no longer worth it. Trust Coinbase and other custodial platforms too much, and what do you get? Hacks and data breaches , among other things. There’s a better path forward – and more and more crypto users are looking for it. A Better Custody Deal So, what should the future of crypto be? Crypto should still be easy. It should still be intuitive. But it should also be private, safe, secure, and truly self-custodial. After all, the old adage of ‘not your keys, not your crypto’ shouldn’t just be a slogan – it is, and should be, the foundation of decentralized finance. That’s where wallets like Best Wallet come in. Unlike centralized platforms, self-custody crypto wallets like Best Wallet don’t hold your private keys. You have complete control of your assets at all times. There are no middlemen, no single points of failure, and no need to put your trust in third parties. But what about the convenience of swapping crypto, sending crypto, and exploring new crypto opportunities all from one app? Bridging the Gap: Self-Custody Meets Convenience The future of crypto points to tools that combine the convenience of centralized exchanges like Coinbase, including KYC and AML requirements, with the security of self-custody, without sacrificing usability. We’ve already seen this with tools like Railgun , which complies with KYC while enabling private transactions on DeFi platforms, and which Vitalik Buterin just used to transfer $2.6M in crypto. While transactions of that size may well be just another day in the office for the Ethereum founder, it demonstrates how increasingly important privacy, control, and functionality are in the developing crypto economy. This is nothing new; it’s often the people most deeply involved in tech who understand just how important it is to control your own data (and your own crypto). Remember Zuckerberg’s camera? That was the time he was promoting Meta, and everyone realized he’d taped across his laptop’s microphone and camera. Was that paranoia or an understanding of just how vulnerable our data is? That’s the balance that Best Wallet wants to deliver, beating MetaMask at its own game and dominating the Web3 self-custody wallet market. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Self-Custody Crypto Wallet Presale Token Crypto wallets aren’t just handy places to stash some spare Bitcoin, at least not anymore. The best crypto wallets – like Best Wallet – serve as all-in-one control hubs for crypto investors, whether you’re operating multiple wallets, swapping tokens, ot investing in crypto presales. And that’s not all. The Best Wallet ecosystem is supercharged by its own token, $BEST . Best Wallet Token holders get: Lower transaction fees Higher staking rewards Earlier presale access Eligibility for bonus crypto airdrops (such as BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrop) Best Wallet and the $BEST token are building the crypto future that Buterin and others are looking for: interconnected, seamless, and self-custodial. It’s everything you could want or ever need from a crypto wallet. You can manage your portfolio, browse upcoming token launches (including the best new meme coins ), and spend your crypto in real life with the upcoming Best Card. Buying, selling, and swapping are as easy as tapping a few buttons. And all this is secured with multi-party computation (MPC) and biometric authentication to keep your crypto safe without sacrificing ease of use. The Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $13.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.025135. That could rise to $0.035215 by the end of the year, according to our $BEST price prediction , delivering gains of 40% to current presale investors. Learn more about how to buy Best Wallet Token with our guide. Best Wallet: Building the Self-Custodial Future of Crypto No longer does crypto have to choose between usability and control. Tools like Best Wallet are showing that self-custody platforms can match – or even beat – the convenience that centralized exchanges offer while staying true to the core values of crypto. As more self-custodial models appear in a post-Coinbase world, Best Wallet wants to lead the charge and dominate this $11B sector. If it succeeds, it will be by delivering a product that is convenient and completely crypto-native. Always do your own research before investing in crypto; this isn’t financial advice. Crypto self-custody is the future. Best Wallet is helping to build that future.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-self-custody-is-the-future-best-wallet-leads-the-way/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T15:07:03,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Hovers Around $105,000 As Indecisiveness Persists","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade around $105,000 as selling pressure and buyer exhaustion weigh on the price. The flagship’s cryptocurrency’s price action indicates indecision after its sharp retracement from its all-time high of $111,970. Momentum stalled after BTC reached this level as investors locked in their profits, leading to a decline that gradually transitioned into a sideways consolidation phase. BTC had dipped to a low of $103,734 at the beginning of the week before recovering and moving to current levels. The price is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,825. New Whales Scoop Up Billions in Bitcoin Bitcoin is facing a significant pullback in recent sessions, with its price trading below key levels after surging to a new all-time high. Despite the decline, on-chain data has revealed a startling discovery. A new set of Bitcoin whales, wallets with 1000 Bitcoin aged less than six months, have been accumulating the asset at a frenetic pace. According to CryptoQuant analysts, this accumulation could indicate renewed conviction among participants for future catalysts and price jumps. The amount held by the new Bitcoin whales doubled from 500,000 BTC to over 1.1 million BTC between March 1 and June 4, representing an increase of over $63 billion in value. The share of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply grew from 2.5% to 5.6%, removing an amount equivalent to ten months of Bitcoin mining output from active circulation. Analysts believe new whale activity indicates a shift in the market. If these whales continue to remove BTC from circulation, it could herald a period of price compression followed by upside volatility. Vitalik Buterin Concedes Bitcoin Dominance in Some Areas Of Crypto Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has conceded that Bitcoin is ahead of Ethereum in some aspects of the crypto space. Buterin made the comments in response to users who were debating about the protocol’s strengths and what it must improve upon. Some users believe Ethereum is leading the industry in terms of censorship resistance but not transactions per second. Buterin confirmed this but stated that there are some aspects of the crypto space dominated by Bitcoin . “I believe Ethereum is leading in terms of CR and security. There are some aspects of this where Bitcoin is ahead (eg. less code complexity, lower rate of protocol change, higher full node count, less dependence on RPCs).” He stated that Bitcoin was superior to Ethereum in terms of coding simplicity, fewer protocol changes, node count, and lesser dependency on services like Infura, Alchemy, or Ankr. Buterin believes Ethereum is more advanced in censorship resistance and security thanks to its flexible and evolving protocol. JPMorgan To Accept Bitcoin ETFs As Collateral JPMorgan is expanding its financing options to include spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing its customers to use their crypto ETFs as collateral when applying for a loan. According to sources, the new offering will apply to the banking giant’s wealthy clients. Recently, the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, announced it will allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. Dimon, a crypto skeptic, had stated that he would defend the people’s right to buy Bitcoin. The new service will begin with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $40 billion in cumulative inflows and over $70 billion in net assets. The bank could expand its offering to include other Bitcoin ETFs. Reports have also claimed that JPMorgan plans to add crypto holdings to the list of assets considered when financial managers assess a client’s net worth. The bank will also include crypto in the assessment of liquid assets, treating it like real estate, stocks, and motor vehicles. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action remained subdued as it struggled to build momentum and cross the 20-day SMA. The price briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session but crashed back below it, moving to its current level of $104,770. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced significant selling pressure after reaching its all-time high as investors locked in their profits and buyer exhaustion set in. Data shows that long liquidations are stabilizing after hitting a peak of $206 million. The past 24 hours saw $200 million worth of long positions flushed as markets opened facing strong selling pressure. Market sentiment has also waned, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index. The index peaked at 76 in May but has fallen to 57, indicating the prevalence of a neutral attitude among investors. Investors may be adopting a wait-and-watch approach, thanks to renewed trade tensions between the US and China. According to some analysts, BTC could slip below $100,000 if the current downtrend continues, falling as low as $92,000. However, others have stated that while BTC’s pullback is concerning, investors are still optimistic about a recovery. Crypto market sentiment remains strong. Some analysts believe BTC could surge to a new all-time high above $115,000 next month if institutional interest continues and US job data is weaker than expected. “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July.” The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report on June 6. Job data is a crucial indicator for Bitcoin as it impacts the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, which in turn, influences sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. “A stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin.” On the other hand, a softer-than-expected report could encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates sooner. BTC traded in positive territory last weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. The price continued to push higher on Monday, rising to $109,453, but lost momentum on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $109,000 and settle at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell over 1% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 2.01%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as the price fell 1.61%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Source: TradingView BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and 0.95% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. The price plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 as the week started on a bearish note. However, the price recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. BTC was back in the red on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. BTC continued to decline on Wednesday, falling 0.65% to slip below $105,000 and settle at $104,755.
