2025-06-05T08:50:33,"BitMine Unveils $18M Public Offering for Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition","BitcoinWorld BitMine Unveils $18M Public Offering for Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Big news is hitting the wires for those tracking the intersection of corporate finance and the digital asset space. A prominent crypto company , BitMine, has just made a significant announcement that could reshape its balance sheet and investment strategy. The Las Vegas-based firm, deeply involved in the Bitcoin (BTC) network, is tapping into the public markets to fuel its growth and increase its exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. What Exactly is This BitMine Public Offering? According to a recent GlobeNewswire press release, BitMine is undertaking a public offering . This isn’t just a standard fundraising round; it’s specifically aimed at strengthening the company’s position in the digital asset market. Here are the key details: Offering Size: The offering involves 2.25 million shares of BitMine’s stock. Expected Proceeds: The company anticipates raising approximately $18 million in gross proceeds from this offering. Primary Use of Funds: The stated intention is clear – the net proceeds from this offering will be used primarily to purchase Bitcoin . A public offering is a way for a company to sell shares of its stock to the general public. This allows them to raise a substantial amount of capital relatively quickly. For a company like BitMine , which operates within the dynamic crypto landscape, accessing capital through traditional financial mechanisms like a public offering provides a structured way to fund strategic initiatives, in this case, a direct investment in Bitcoin . Why Would a Crypto Company Buy Bitcoin? It might seem counterintuitive at first glance – a company involved in the Bitcoin network raising money just to buy more Bitcoin. However, for many firms operating in this sector, holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet is a core part of their strategy. It aligns their corporate value with the performance of the asset they are fundamentally tied to. Think of it as a tech company holding stock in other promising tech companies, but in the digital asset realm. Several factors could drive BitMine’s decision for this significant BTC investment : Bullish Outlook: The company likely has a strong conviction in the future price appreciation of Bitcoin . By holding BTC directly, they position themselves to benefit from potential market rallies. Treasury Management: Some companies view Bitcoin as a potential store of value, similar to gold or other hard assets. Adding it to their treasury can be seen as a hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. Industry Alignment: As a company operating within the Bitcoin ecosystem, increasing their direct holdings reinforces their commitment and belief in the network’s long-term viability and success. Investor Appeal: For investors interested in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through a publicly traded entity, a company with significant BTC holdings can be an attractive option. This move might appeal to a broader range of investors beyond those comfortable holding BTC directly. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for BitMine? Embarking on a significant public offering to fund a BTC investment strategy comes with both potential upsides and inherent risks. Understanding these can provide a clearer picture of BitMine’s strategic play. Potential Benefits: Enhanced Balance Sheet: A large holding of Bitcoin can significantly increase the value of the company’s assets if the price of BTC rises. Increased Investor Interest: The focus on direct Bitcoin acquisition might attract investors specifically looking for crypto exposure via public markets. Operational Synergy: As a Bitcoin network company, holding BTC aligns with their core business and could potentially be used for various operational purposes in the future (though the press release specifies purchase). Potential Challenges: Bitcoin Price Volatility: The most significant risk is the inherent volatility of Bitcoin’s price. A downturn could negatively impact BitMine’s balance sheet and stock price. Execution Risk: There’s always a risk that the public offering might not be fully subscribed or might face delays, impacting their ability to raise the full $18 million. Market Perception: While some investors favor this strategy, others might view it as risky or speculative, potentially affecting the company’s valuation. This move places BitMine in a category of companies that have publicly adopted Bitcoin as a treasury asset, though the scale and specific use of funds from this offering highlight a direct strategy focused on increasing their BTC holdings. How Does This Compare to Other Companies Holding Bitcoin? BitMine isn’t the first publicly traded company to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet, but the specific strategy of using a public offering explicitly to fund Bitcoin purchases is noteworthy. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously accumulated large amounts of Bitcoin, often using convertible notes or other debt financing methods. Tesla also added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, though they later sold a significant portion. BitMine’s approach, raising equity capital specifically for this purpose, signals a potentially strong commitment to making Bitcoin a central part of their asset base, funded directly by shareholders’ investments in this offering. This differentiates their method from companies using corporate profits or debt to acquire BTC. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? While an $18 million purchase isn’t massive in the context of Bitcoin’s multi-trillion dollar market cap, it represents continued institutional and corporate interest. Each announcement like this contributes to the narrative of increasing adoption and validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class for corporate treasuries and investment strategies. It adds to the overall demand side for Bitcoin . Furthermore, it highlights how companies within the crypto sector are leveraging traditional financial tools, like a public offering , to strengthen their position within the digital asset world. This convergence of traditional finance and crypto is a trend worth watching. Key Takeaways for Investors and Observers For anyone following the crypto space or considering an investment in BitMine , this announcement is significant. It signals a clear strategic direction for the company, tying its future performance even more closely to that of Bitcoin . Investors should consider: BitMine’s increased exposure to BTC price volatility. The potential upside if Bitcoin performs well. The successful execution of the public offering itself. How this strategy aligns with their own investment goals regarding crypto exposure. This move by BitMine underscores the evolving nature of corporate finance in the digital age, where even companies deeply embedded in the crypto world utilize traditional mechanisms like a public offering to enhance their strategic assets, in this case, a significant BTC investment . In Conclusion: A Bold Move for BitMine’s BTC Future BitMine’s announcement of an $18 million public offering with the explicit goal of purchasing Bitcoin is a bold strategic maneuver. It reflects a strong belief in the future of BTC and a commitment to making it a central component of the company’s balance sheet. While this strategy comes with the inherent risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility, it also positions BitMine to potentially benefit significantly from future price appreciation. This development is a compelling example of how crypto companies are navigating the financial landscape and leveraging traditional tools to solidify their presence in the digital asset market.

2025-06-05T08:48:23,"Top Three Reasons Why Major XRP Price Rally is Possible in June 2025","Over the past eleven years, the month of June has historically been unfavorable for XRP, with average returns showing a decline of 8.49%. This pattern has often discouraged investors and reinforced bearishness around the asset during early summer. However, crypto market sentiment for June 2025 appears to be shifting, as analysts identify three major developments that could reverse the historical trend and potentially trigger a significant rally in XRP’s price. Potential Approval of Franklin Templeton’s Spot XRP ETF A key catalyst for XRP in June is the anticipated ruling by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Franklin Templeton’s proposed Spot XRP ETF. The decision is expected by June 17. If approved, the ETF would enable institutional and retail investors to gain direct exposure to XRP via traditional financial platforms, bypassing the need for cryptocurrency wallets. Prominent crypto analyst Cekky Crypto argues that this event could mirror the impact of Bitcoin’s ETF approval in early 2024. According to him, if approved, institutional investors and retail traders would be able to buy real XRP through traditional brokerage apps — no crypto wallet needed. He draws parallels to the momentum Bitcoin experienced, noting that its ETF debut aided it to break past the $100,000 level. Cekky sees a similar trajectory potentially forming for XRP. FOMC Rate Decision and Liquidity Inflows Another significant event occurring mid-June is the U.S. Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, scheduled for June 17–18. Expectations are growing that the Fed may implement a modest rate cut, possibly around 25 basis points. Such a move would mark the first dovish policy shift in months and could spark renewed investor interest in risk-oriented markets, including altcoins. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historically, rate cuts have bolstered capital inflows into both technology stocks and cryptocurrencies. Cekky believes XRP could benefit from this environment, emphasizing that broad-based rallies in digital assets often follow easier monetary conditions. Whale Activity Suggests Strategic Accumulation A third bullish indicator is the recent pattern of accumulation observed at the $1.90 range. On-chain metrics suggest that large XRP holders—commonly referred to as “whales”—have been quietly increasing their positions, likely in anticipation of upcoming market catalysts. Cekky highlights this as a noteworthy signal, stating that while there are still risks such as a potential delay in ETF approval or a hawkish Fed decision, “the risk-reward is heavily skewed in favor of bulls.” He adds that this may be “the last calm before the XRP storm,” signaling confidence in the possibility of a major price breakout. Is June the Turning Point for XRP? While June has traditionally delivered poor returns for XRP holders, the alignment of these three developments could mark a turning point. The outcome of the ETF decision, the Federal Reserve’s monetary stance, and increasing whale activity all present strong arguments for a potential rally. Cekky’s strategy involves accumulating between $1.90 and $2.10, leaving room for volatility, and preparing for what he believes could be a 5x surge if favorable conditions align. If market momentum builds around these anticipated events, June 2025 may be remembered not for its past weakness but as the month XRP reversed the trend and moved decisively higher.

2025-06-05T08:34:05,"James Wynn Faces $1M Unrealized Loss Despite Holding $80M in BTC","The post James Wynn Faces $1M Unrealized Loss Despite Holding $80M in BTC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News High-stakes crypto trader James Wynn is once again in the spotlight after losing $25 million on a massive Bitcoin bet. Wynn, known for swinging enormous trades on the Hyperliquid platform, was liquidated for 240 BTC despite trying to manually adjust his position to avoid it. Still holding 770 BTC, worth over $80 million, he now faces nearly $1 million in unrealized losses on his latest 40x long trade as per Hypurrscan data . He went viral after turning $0 into $87 million in just 70 days through his bold and risky trades. He made millions betting on meme coins like PEPE and TRUMP, and even had a massive $1.14 billion long position on Bitcoin that showed $39 million in profits. From Billion-Dollar Bets to Blame This loss follows a wild trading streak where Wynn had earlier placed a $1.25 billion leveraged bet on Bitcoin after a $29 million loss, only to flip positions with a $110 million short the very next day. By May 29, reports from Lookonchain and Arkham Intelligence revealed Wynn had hemorrhaged $100 million in a single week. His most recent $100M long position also failed, further intensifying the drama. Now, Wynn alleges the market is being manipulated against him and has even called for donations to help fund his mission to expose this “rigged” system.

I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations. Even with a CEX… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 1, 2025 In the wake of Wynn’s massive liquidation, Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao chimed in, proposing a dark pool DEX to address transparency issues in perpetual trading. According to CZ, the real-time visibility of orders on DEXs enables front-running and slippage, worsening liquidations like Wynn’s. He believes dark pools, long used in traditional finance, could offer privacy and fairness to large traders. This million-dollar wipeout is a stark lesson for all crypto users to invest their funds with proper research and not to follow the trading strategies of influencers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T08:31:18,"Fear, Greed, and Liquidations: Market at Crossroads Between Bitcoin and Altcoins?","The post Fear, Greed, and Liquidations: Market at Crossroads Between Bitcoin and Altcoins? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It’s no wonder that investors and traders in the crypto market remain puzzled, as sentiments in the business continue to swing rapidly. The swift moments in the Fear & Greed Index’s metrics are catalyzed heavily by liquidation. As of today, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands at 55, signaling a neutral sentiment in the market. This marks a retreat from last week’s “Greed” level of 65, and slightly above last month’s neutral reading of 49. At the same time, the Bitcoin ETF approval has fundamentally changed the landscape of liquidation behavior across the market. While Bitcoin rallied, triggering a $190 million short liquidation wave, altcoins faced the brunt, with over $1 billion in long positions liquidated. This imbalance unveils two drastically different trader expectations — and outcomes — across the crypto spectrum. Liquidation Map and Sentiment Trends Bitcoin’s steady rise, shown in the chart, has been marked by spikes in short liquidations. This classic short squeeze phenomenon reflects high-leverage traders betting against BTC’s rally, only to be liquidated as BTC crossed $100k+, driven by institutional momentum from the ETF narrative. BTC Liquidations – Source On the contrary, altcoins showed the opposite pattern. Leverage-fueled long positions were consistently wiped out, hinting at aggressive bets on an “altseason” that never came. Since December 2024, this asymmetry has only widened, reflecting intensifying risk aversion towards altcoins. Overlaying this with the Fear & Greed Index, we observe a clear correlation: when the index was in Extreme Greed (90–100) territory in early 2025, traders overexposed to altcoins suffered the most. As sentiment cooled to neutral, BTC stabilized, while altcoins continued to experience high leverage flush-outs. Read our Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030 , to know where the largest altcoin is heading! FAQs What does a Fear & Greed Index of 55 indicate? It reflects neutral sentiment, meaning the market is currently balanced between caution and optimism. Why are altcoins seeing more long liquidations than BTC?

2025-06-05T08:30:54,"SEC wins $1.1 million judgment against Keith Crews for defrauding investors","A federal judge in Georgia entered a $1.1 million default judgment in favor of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after Keith Crews, a resident of Kennesaw, failed to respond to civil fraud charges tied to a crypto offering allegedly based on non-existent stem cell technology. The SEC filed its lawsuit against Crews in August 2023, accusing the 69-year-old man of conducting an affinity fraud scheme through two companies under his control, Stem Biotech LLC and Four (4) Square Biz LLC. June 3 Court order in the SEC vs Keith Crews case. Source: Pacermonitor On June 3, 2025, Judge Tiffany Johnson of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia issued a default ruling after Crews made no effort to answer the charges or defend himself in court. Court orders over $1.1 Million in penalties According to court documents , Judge Johnson ordered Crews to pay more than $1.1 million in total financial penalties. This includes the disgorgement of over $530,000 in illicit profits, nearly $51,000 in prejudgment interest, and an additional $530,000 as a civil penalty. The ruling also includes a permanent injunction barring Crews from violating securities laws in the future. The SEC’s August 2023 complaint mentioned the defendant used a pattern of deceptive practices between October 2019 and May 2021. Crews is alleged to have raised at least $800,000 from approximately 200 investors through the promotion and sale of a digital token known as “Stemy Coin.” These sales were conducted primarily via email, phone solicitations, websites for both of his companies, and a network of self-described “ambassadors” who distributed promotional materials Crews personally approved. “ Crews used his connections in the African-American community to solicit investors, many of whom were non-accredited, and also recruited investors through relationships at church and a Bible study, ” the SEC wrote. Misrepresentations tied to stem cell claims and church affiliations The SEC propounded that Crews exploited investors who were not accredited and lacked financial safeguards. They were told that advanced stem cell treatments and tangible assets such as gold-backed Stemy Coin. Crews insisted that Stem Biotech had operational laboratories, real medical products, and ongoing partnerships with healthcare professionals and biotech firms. In reality, the SEC says none of these representations were true. “ Crews and his entities had no existing stem cell technology, products, or operations ,” the complaint stated. “ There was no partnership with the claimed entities .” False affiliations and misleading promotional material Crews reportedly used the names of professionals and companies without consent to improve the credibility of his operations. For instance, the complaint cites his unauthorized use of the name of Dr. Shah and the company Alexandros, falsely presenting them as affiliated with Stem Biotech. In May 2020, Dr. Shah formally requested that Crews cease using his and Alexandros’ names in any business promotion. Similar uncertified uses were documented involving BHI, another company whose branding and intellectual property were allegedly used to promote Stemy Coin. In January 2021, BHI issued a cease and desist letter to Crews demanding that he stop using its name, logo, and product references in solicitations.

2025-06-05T08:30:08,"Dogecoin Price Crash Below $0.2: 4H Order Block Shows Exactly What’s Happening","Following the Bitcoin price sweep down below the $104,000 level over the weekend, the Dogecoin price was pushed back down below $0.2 once again. This move understandably shocked the community as the $0.2 has held for a long time. However, using the 4-hour order block (OB), a crypto analyst has explained what is going on with the Dogecoin price, why the decline happened, and where it could be headed next. Dogecoin Price Experienced A Liquidity Sweep Crypto analyst Smart Flows, on the TradingView website, pointed out an interesting development on the Dogecoin price chart. This showed a clear delineation for why the meme coin’s price dropped below the $0.2 psychological support level, and it came down to something as clean as a liquidity sweep. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Headed For Crash To $2,000 With Current Price Action The crypto analyst uses the 4-Hour order block on the Dogecoin price chart to explain this, starting just above the $0.22 price level. This saw a liquidity sweep through the Fair Value Gap (FVG) at the 0.5 Fibonacci level, breaking through the $0.2 support. This move, Smart Flows explains, was in no way emotional and was more of a ‘mechanical’ move, suggesting it was engineered to happen. The outcome of this liquidity sweep is that there has now been a reset of sentiment surrounding the Dogecoin price, setting the stage for a potential reversal. If this is the case, then Dogecoin may be sitting on the cusp of what could be the next major rally above $0.2. What To Expect Next From Here According to the crypto analyst, Dogecoin is now sitting in a 4-Hour demand order block zone that is in confluence with the Fair Value Gap (FVG) above $0.2. This makes the $0.20928 level the first “key reaction point,” and the analyst points out two possibilities for the meme coin here: either the price continues to stall or consolidation begins at this level. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Community Should Pay Attention To June 4-6, Here’s Why Basically, the Dogecoin price has to be able to beat the first major test at $0.209 before moving higher from here. This means it must complete a clean clearance of the FVG to grab liquidity above. After this, the real test begins at $0.22094, where the next major 4-Hour order block sits. The analyst explains that being able to clear the FVG will mean a continuation model is in play. However, there is still the possibility that the Dogecoin price is rejected before it is able to clear the FVG above $0.2. In this case, it could signal a further downtrend for the altcoin. “If we reject early — that tells me distribution is starting, and I’ll prep for a secondary sweep below 0.18 to retest the deeper 4H OB near 0.16387,” the analyst concluded.

And Shared All the Price Levels They Expect From Now On!","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a correction to the level of $ 103,000 after the new record of $ 111,000 in the past weeks. Despite this correction, bullish expectations continue, with Bitfinex analysts predicting that Bitcoin could rise to $115,000 if the upcoming US employment report disappoints. Bitfinex analysts noted that the main points of the bullish scenario are increasing institutional demand and flows into spot ETFs. At this point, analysts predicted that Bitcoin could climb to $115,000 or higher by early July. Analysts added that the recent pullback in Bitcoin has caused some concerns in the market, but investors still remain bullish. “In a bullish scenario driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could reach $115,000 or higher by early July.” Analysts lastly stated that the US Employment report, which will be announced on June 6, is very important for Bitcoin, and said that a weaker than expected employment report would be good for BTC. Analysts stated that lower-than-expected employment data could strengthen the case for reducing inflation, and argued that it could prompt the FED to consider lowering interest rates earlier, which would likely support BTC's upward momentum. Conversely, stronger employment data could negatively impact the Fed's interest rate decision and delay rate cuts. This could also support the US Dollar and suppress the price of Bitcoin, pushing it below the $102,000 support or even the $100,000 level and leading to a possible accumulation in the $95,000-$97,000 range, analysts say. “US employment data is a key indicator for Bitcoin. A weak employment data could support Bitcoin's upward momentum. But a stronger-than-expected report could strengthen the dollar and possibly put downward pressure on Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T08:10:09,"Bitcoin Network Activity Surges: What it Means for Price Consolidation","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Network Activity Surges: What it Means for Price Consolidation The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing, but sometimes, quiet periods in price action mask significant underlying movements. This appears to be the case with Bitcoin recently, as fascinating data from crypto analytics firm Santiment highlights a notable spike in activity on the network, even as the BTC price consolidation phase continues. Decoding the Spike in Bitcoin Network Activity According to Santiment’s observations shared on X (formerly Twitter), the Bitcoin network witnessed a dramatic increase in two key metrics: New Wallet Creation: On May 29, a staggering 556,830 new Bitcoin wallets were created. Santiment noted this was the highest daily figure recorded since December 2, 2023. This metric often serves as a pulse check on potential new entrants or increased interest in the asset. On-Chain Volume: Just a few days later, on June 2, the network saw 241,360 BTC transferred on-chain. This figure marked the largest single-day transfer volume since December 8, 2023 (assuming the year was 2023 based on typical data patterns). High on-chain volume indicates significant value moving across the network, which can be driven by various factors including large institutional transfers, exchange activity, or whale movements. While conventional wisdom suggests that increased network activity is a bullish signal, pointing towards growing adoption and usage, Santiment added a crucial caveat. They highlighted that this surge is occurring during a period where Bitcoin’s price has been largely consolidating, trading within a relatively tight range rather than establishing a clear upward or downward trend. This specific context makes the activity particularly noteworthy and warrants closer examination. Why the Surge in New Bitcoin Wallets Matters During Consolidation The creation of hundreds of thousands of new Bitcoin wallets in a single day is a significant event. But what does it truly signify, especially when the price isn’t making big moves? Here are a few potential interpretations: Potential for New Adoption: It could indicate a fresh wave of individuals or entities setting up wallets, possibly preparing to enter the market or already accumulating Bitcoin quietly during the consolidation phase. Increased Distribution/Accumulation Tactics: Existing holders, particularly large ones (whales), might be distributing their holdings across multiple wallets or consolidating smaller amounts into new addresses. This is a common tactic for privacy or strategic positioning. Exchange Activity: Exchanges often create new wallets for various purposes, including managing user deposits and withdrawals or internal shuffling of funds. A spike could relate to increased user onboarding or operational changes at major platforms. Speculative Interest: Sometimes, new wallets are created in anticipation of specific events, such as potential airdrops (though less common for native BTC) or forks, although this is a less likely primary driver for such a massive single-day spike. During consolidation, a jump in new wallets could suggest that ‘smart money’ or early participants are positioning themselves before a potential price breakout. Alternatively, it could simply be noise from automated processes or short-term speculative interest that doesn’t translate into sustained buying pressure. Understanding High On-Chain Volume in a Sideways Market Just like new wallets, high on-chain volume can be interpreted in multiple ways. When 241,360 BTC (worth billions of dollars at current prices) move in a single day, it demands attention. Here’s what it might imply during a phase of BTC price consolidation : Large Investor Movements: Significant volume often points to large players moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. This could be institutions rebalancing portfolios, over-the-counter (OTC) deals taking place off public exchanges, or whales shifting assets. Exchange Inflows/Outflows: A large portion of on-chain volume relates to funds moving to or from exchanges. High inflows could suggest intent to sell or trade, while high outflows might signal accumulation and a move towards cold storage. Monitoring exchange net flows alongside total volume provides better context. Internal Transfers: Sometimes, large entities (like custodians or exchanges) perform internal transfers between their own wallets, which adds to the on-chain volume without necessarily indicating market intent. Preparation for Volatility: Increased volume during consolidation can be seen as participants getting ready for a potential price swing. They might be moving funds to exchanges to trade the expected volatility or moving funds off exchanges for long-term holding. When volume spikes during consolidation, it often suggests that a significant move might be brewing. The challenge is determining the direction. Is it large players accumulating supply from impatient sellers, or is it distribution from those looking to exit before a potential downturn? This is where looking at the destination of the transfers becomes critical – are coins moving onto exchanges (potentially bearish) or off exchanges (potentially bullish)? Why Santiment Says This Trend is Worth Watching The key takeaway from the Santiment analysis is not just that activity is high, but that its timing alongside BTC price consolidation is particularly interesting. Santiment’s expertise lies in providing behavioral and on-chain data insights, and their caution suggests that while the numbers look positive on the surface, the context requires deeper analysis. During periods of strong price trends, high activity typically confirms the trend’s strength. However, during consolidation, high activity can be ambiguous. It could be: Under-the-Radar Accumulation: Large players might be quietly buying up supply within the tight price range, absorbing selling pressure without causing a significant price increase yet. This would be bullish long-term. Stealth Distribution: Conversely, large players might be selling into any demand that arises within the range, offloading their holdings without triggering a major price drop immediately. This would be bearish long-term. Increased Speculative Fidgeting: Traders might be moving funds more frequently between wallets and exchanges in anticipation of volatility, leading to higher volume without a clear directional bias yet. Santiment’s alert serves as a reminder that raw data points, while valuable, need interpretation within the broader market structure. The increased activity suggests that beneath the calm surface of price consolidation, significant movements of Bitcoin are occurring, which could prefigure the next major price move. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? So, what should investors and traders take away from this report on Bitcoin network activity ? Context is King: Understand that high activity during consolidation is different from high activity during a trend. It’s a signal of potential change, not necessarily confirmation of a current direction. Look Deeper: Don’t stop at the headline numbers. If possible, use on-chain analysis tools (like those offered by Santiment or others) to investigate where the activity is happening. Are funds flowing into or out of exchanges? Are large dormant wallets becoming active? Combine Metrics: On-chain data is powerful but best used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as technical analysis (chart patterns during consolidation), market sentiment, and macroeconomic factors. Prepare for Volatility: Increased activity during consolidation often precedes a breakout. While the direction isn’t guaranteed, being aware that a significant move could be coming allows you to prepare your strategy. Stay Informed: Continue to follow reports from reputable analytics firms like Santiment for ongoing insights into network behavior. The surge in new Bitcoin wallets and on-chain volume reported by Santiment is a compelling development. It indicates that even during a period of BTC price consolidation , the underlying network is highly active. This hidden activity could be the precursor to the market’s next major move, highlighting the importance of monitoring on-chain metrics alongside price charts. Conclusion: The Calm Before the Storm? The recent data from Santiment paints a picture of a Bitcoin network bustling with activity, even as the price takes a breather. The significant increase in new wallets and on-chain transfer volume suggests that participants are actively engaging with the network. While the direction isn’t yet clear from this data alone, the heightened activity during BTC price consolidation strongly implies that forces are positioning themselves. Whether this portends an imminent bullish breakout fueled by accumulation or a bearish downturn driven by distribution remains to be seen. However, the message is clear: beneath the surface stability, the Bitcoin market is dynamic, and watching these on-chain signals closely is crucial for understanding what might come next.

2025-06-05T08:09:12,"Best Crypto to Buy Now – New Entries Perfect for Buying the Dip This Month","The cryptocurrency market continues to show sharp movements as Bitcoin and Ethereum experience fresh price dips. After a volatile start to the year, recent corrections have opened discussions among investors about potential repositioning. Many are watching how these fluctuations could shape opportunities for the next bull run. Analysts observing current trends believe market dips are not unusual during broader consolidation phases. Rather than signaling weakness, they often allow for strategic positioning focused on long-term gains. By studying how previous cycles recovered, investors can understand that moments like this can offer better entry points when evaluating innovation-driven cryptocurrencies. This article highlights three tokens that reflect the growing market. Among them is Dawgz AI , an emerging project that blends blockchain technology with AI, alongside two established names that have maintained a consistent market presence. Each token offers different characteristics for those considering their options carefully in the current environment. Why Buying the Dip Appeals to Investors Historical market data shows that buying the dip has often been a profitable strategy for those who stay focused on long-term growth. After Bitcoin’s decline in 2018, the token recovered steadily, reaching new highs by 2021. According to CoinMarketCap , Bitcoin’s price rose from under $4,000 in early 2019 to nearly $69,000 two years later. Similar patterns can be observed with Ethereum, which has navigated multiple market cycles and continues to drive a significant portion of the decentralized finance sector. Crypto enthusiasts believe that market dips provide investors with better entry points to acquire assets. Rather than chasing momentum during market peaks, accumulating during price corrections helps improve cost efficiency. Reports from Nasdaq suggest that disciplined accumulation during bear phases often positions portfolios for more substantial gains during the next upswing. Buying during corrections is not about timing the exact bottom. It focuses on maintaining a long-term perspective where price fluctuations become part of a broader strategy. While the market remains volatile, history indicates that tokens with solid fundamentals and real use cases often recover as conditions improve. This approach favors patience and research over speculation. Key Factors to Analyze Before Buying Cryptocurrencies Technology remains a core factor when researching new cryptocurrencies. Investors often focus on blockchain scalability, transaction speeds, and integration with other technologies, such as artificial intelligence. According to CoinDesk , projects that improve network efficiency and security tend to gain stronger adoption. Blockchain solutions that address fundamental limitations attract not only retail investors but also developers building decentralized applications. Community strength is another critical indicator of a project’s long-term potential. A transparent and engaged community often reflects the credibility of a cryptocurrency. Forbes Digital Assets reports that decentralized projects with active governance models usually build stronger trust. These communities drive development and ensure that decisions align with broader user interests rather than being controlled by a small group. Tokenomics plays a key role in sustaining growth. Investors examine supply caps, inflation rates, and staking incentives before deciding where to allocate their funds. A healthy model supports stability and rewards long-term participation. These fundamentals are crucial when determining which projects align with a strategy centered on the best crypto to buy now . Highlighting strong use cases, community trust, and sustainable tokenomics helps filter projects worth deeper research in a volatile market. 3 Cryptocurrencies Investors Are Monitoring Now Dawgz AI (DAWGZ) As blockchain technology moves closer to real-world applications, one segment drawing new interest is the combination of artificial intelligence and decentralized systems. Among the projects gaining attention is Dawgz AI, a token that focuses on building an efficient AI-powered ecosystem within the Ethereum network. Instead of stretching into NFTs or unrelated areas, Dawgz AI maintains a clear direction by prioritizing token utility and community growth. Dawgz AI has raised over $3.7 million. It is now priced at $0.00438. These figures reflect growing trust from early supporters who see potential in its focused strategy. According to the audit by SolidProof , Dawgz AI has completed key verification steps, improving transparency for future holders. This audit adds another layer of confidence for those assessing new opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. By targeting two of the strongest areas in technology — artificial intelligence and blockchain — Dawgz AI aligns itself with larger trends without overcomplicating its mission. Its emphasis on simplicity, combined with an active community, makes it a project that many are starting to take notice of. For investors researching innovation-focused tokens, Dawgz AI represents an accessible entry point tied to fundamental digital transformation themes. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and continues to set the standard for decentralized finance. It was the first project to introduce a peer-to-peer payment system without intermediaries. CoinMarketCap indicates that as of June 4, 2025, Bitcoin maintains a market capitalization of approximately $2.09 trillion, and as of today, the price is trading at around $105,435.22. Institutional adoption keeps Bitcoin relevant. Large financial organizations have increasingly explored Bitcoin as a store of value. Nasdaq highlights that many funds now hold Bitcoin alongside traditional assets, further validating its place in modern portfolios. As the market matures, Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty has become more prominent. Bitcoin’s ability to recover from previous market corrections gives it a reputation for resilience. CoinMarketCap provides historical data showing how Bitcoin rebounded after major drawdowns. This track record supports the view among crypto enthusiasts that Bitcoin remains an essential asset to watch during both volatile and stable periods. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum holds a strong position in blockchain technology by offering more than just transactions. It provides the infrastructure for smart contracts, decentralized finance applications, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). As of June 4, 2025, Binance reports that Ethereum has a current price of about $2,540.86 and a market cap of nearly $306.74 billion. It puts it second only to Bitcoin in overall market valuation. One key factor behind Ethereum’s growth is the adoption of its innovative contract capabilities. Developers favor Ethereum for building decentralized applications because of its flexibility and reliability. The network’s shift to Proof-of-Stake has reduced its energy consumption, a change that aligns with current environmental expectations. The Guardian notes that this move helps strengthen Ethereum’s reputation as a future-ready blockchain platform. Ethereum also benefits from strong developer activity and community support. CoinMarketCap data highlights its consistent market share in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These strengths give Ethereum a durable position in the cryptocurrency sector, making it a frequent choice for investors aiming to balance innovation with stability. Why Dawgz AI Aligns with Emerging Trends Artificial intelligence and blockchain are two areas that continue to gain attention for their practical uses in digital infrastructure. Investors are starting to look beyond price speculation and focus more on how these technologies solve real problems.

Tokens that combine real technological frameworks with active community involvement are often seen as more sustainable. Dawgz AI’s audit by SolidProof, along with its early fundraising success, supports its standing as a serious project among AI-based cryptocurrencies. Investor interest is shifting toward projects that demonstrate both innovation and a commitment to practical applications. Dawgz AI effectively addresses both areas without overextending into multiple sectors. By staying focused on its core mission, it appeals to those seeking digital assets that offer both accessibility and a clear growth strategy. This focus helps align it with broader market shifts where utility and simplicity are driving new investment decisions.

2025-06-05T08:02:52,"Ripple Price News: Analyst Who Called XRP’s $3.36 Top Expects $2 Retest, Then Breakout","The post Ripple Price News: Analyst Who Called XRP’s $3.36 Top Expects $2 Retest, Then Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Popular crypto market analyst Francis Hunt, better known as “The Market Sniper,” recently shared his latest views on XRP’s price movements — and while the token has been stuck in a range for some time, Hunt says a big breakout is still on the cards. A Perfect Call at $3.36 and What Followed Hunt recalled that his team had accurately called XRP’s previous high at $3.36, a price they predicted would act as a temporary top. Since hitting that level, XRP has fallen into what he describes as a falling wedge pattern — a technical setup where the price steadily moves lower within a narrowing range. Typically, falling wedges tend to break upwards, and Hunt expects XRP to follow this pattern eventually. The Importance of the $2 Support Zone According to Hunt, the $2 mark has become one of the most crucial support levels for XRP. Even though the token dipped below it a few times, each drop was quickly bought up, showing there are big buyers in that area. He believes this is a good sign for long-term bulls, as it means strong hands are defending the price around $2. While the current market isn’t showing much strength — especially with Bitcoin taking a hit recently — XRP still hasn’t broken down decisively. Hunt points out that while he exited some of his positions at the $3.36 high, he’s watching for a chance to jump back in if XRP drops slightly below $2 for brief periods, as it could offer “one or two lucky fills.” Why the Falling Wedge Matters The falling wedge pattern XRP is stuck in has lasted longer than expected, but according to Hunt, the longer this kind of setup holds, the stronger the eventual breakout tends to be.

2025-06-05T08:00:46,"Ripple CTO: I Invented XRP While Trying to Design a Better Vending Machine","Ripple CTO David Schwartz shared a lighthearted yet insightful post on X, offering a rare glimpse into his extensive experience in cryptography and blockchain. Responding to a question from OldmanJonesy about what his personal highlight reel would look like, Schwartz offered a satirical yet subtly profound glimpse into the evolution of his career. Among the most eye-catching of his remarks was the claim: “invented XRP while trying to design a better vending machine,” and in the process, “accidentally solved payments instead of snacks.” Though offered in jest, this comment captures the serendipitous brilliance that has long defined Schwartz’s trajectory. With a background in cryptography and a deep fascination for distributed systems, Schwartz co-created the XRP Ledger (XRPL) in 2012 alongside Arthur Britto and Jed McCaleb. Their original intention was to build a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin, which at the time was grappling with high transaction costs and scalability issues. Schwartz’s latest playful anecdote aligns well with his history of transforming abstract technical ideas into tangible breakthroughs, turning a “vending machine problem” into a global payments infrastructure. Invented XRP while trying to design a better vending machine.Accidentally solved payments instead of snacks. Once debugged an XRPL consensus edge case using only telepathy and Diet Coke. Known as ""JoelKatz"" because ""Satoshi Nakamoto"" was already taken. Rumored to be the only… — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 5, 2025 From Cryptographic Curiosity to Ledger Mastery David Schwartz has never been the typical technologist. His Twitter post adds color to this, stating that he once “debugged an XRPL consensus edge case using only telepathy and Diet Coke.” While clearly satirical, the comment nods to his deep involvement in fine-tuning XRPL’s consensus algorithm, which uses a unique Federated Byzantine Agreement to achieve fast, secure transactions without the energy demands of proof-of-work systems. This consensus model remains one of the XRP Ledger’s most distinguishing features and is at the heart of its institutional appeal. The CTO also jokingly claimed he “successfully explained XRPL’s consensus mechanism to one of his dogs,” who then went on to “lead a DAO.” Behind the humor lies a very real truth: Schwartz is widely respected for his ability to demystify complex blockchain concepts. His technical blogs, whitepapers, and public talks have educated thousands and helped shape industry conversations around scalability, interoperability, and decentralization. A Mythical Technologist with a Cryptic Past Schwartz’s self-effacing wit continued throughout his post, with claims like being “known as JoelKatz because Satoshi Nakamoto was already taken,” and “rumored to be the only person who understands both how the XRP Ledger works and Ripple’s org chart.” These tongue-in-cheek remarks not only reflect the cult-like mystique that surrounds blockchain pioneers but also hint at his dual role as both a deep technologist and a leader within Ripple’s complex organizational structure. Before his work in blockchain, Schwartz held various engineering roles, including working on encrypted cloud storage and secure messaging systems. He also once filed patents related to distributed computer networks, a precursor to his later work on decentralized ledgers. While his post claims he “architected NuDB in his head during a five-hour investor meeting while pretending to be asleep,” it’s true that Schwartz is the creator of NuDB, a key-value database engine optimized for high-throughput applications like XRP’s ledger. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Satirical Brilliance, Serious Legacy Perhaps the most hilarious of his recent statements is the quip that he “publicly declared the blockchain trilemma ‘a fun puzzle,’ then solved it on a napkin during a lunch break. The napkin became the design for Solana.” Of course, there’s no evidence that Schwartz contributed to Solana’s design, but the joke serves as a nod to his towering reputation in crypto circles. Similarly, his claim of having “developed a zero-knowledge proof that he was not responsible for the ledger loss incident but never told anyone” pokes fun at the opaque nature of some blockchain narratives. He rounded off his mythical self-portrait by alluding to an early, fictional stint “lumberjacking in the Sahara Forest,” and being “often mistaken for a time traveler due to an unfortunate mix of never being completely sure what year it is, prophetic tweets, and extremely old shoes.” Though hyperbolic, these comments highlight Schwartz’s status as not only a respected technologist but also an influential figure in crypto culture. The Genius Behind the Humor Despite the humorous tone, David Schwartz’s post underscores a legacy that is anything but trivial. As Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, he remains instrumental in the ongoing development of cross-border payment solutions, decentralized finance protocols, and enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure. Under his technical guidance, Ripple has broadened its impact beyond XRP, driving fintech innovation through initiatives like the RLUSD stablecoin and XRPL EVM sidechain support . David Schwartz’s genius lies not just in the technologies he builds, but in the way he communicates them—with humor, clarity, and the kind of eccentric charisma that turns code into culture.

2025-06-05T08:00:38,"JPMorgan to Offer Loans Backed by Bitcoin ETFs as Wall Street Warms to Crypto","JPMorgan Chase — the largest bank in the United States by assets — is preparing to allow trading and wealth management clients to use crypto-related assets, including Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as collateral for loans. According to a June 4 report by Bloomberg, the offering is expected to roll out in the coming weeks, starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF with over $70.1 billion in assets under management. The move signals growing institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and digital assets, particularly following the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year. JPMorgan’s program will let clients pledge crypto-linked ETFs to access liquidity and factor digital asset holdings into net worth calculations. JPMorgan CEO Stays Skeptical but Expands Bitcoin Access Despite JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s long-standing criticism of cryptocurrencies, the bank’s crypto footprint continues to grow. In May, Dimon acknowledged the growing client demand and said that JPMorgan would soon allow clients to purchase Bitcoin. Still, he reiterated his personal reservations about crypto, likening its use to smoking: “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” JPMorgan has been gradually building its crypto infrastructure since launching its dollar-pegged stablecoin, JPM Coin, in 2020. More recently, the bank disclosed that it holds shares in several spot Bitcoin ETFs, further indicating its expanding interest in digital asset markets. The decision to offer crypto-collateralized loans places JPMorgan among a small but growing group of U.S. financial institutions exploring the integration of blockchain-based assets into traditional financial services. Trump Administration Eases Crypto Rules for Banks JPMorgan’s latest initiative also comes as U.S. regulatory attitudes toward crypto shift under the Trump administration. In April 2025, the Federal Reserve rescinded guidance that discouraged banks from engaging in crypto-related activities , including stablecoin services. A month later, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency affirmed that banks could legally custody digital assets for their customers. With regulatory barriers easing and institutional products maturing, the line between traditional finance and digital assets continues to blur.

2025-06-05T08:00:04,"Altcoin Season Warning: Index Plunges to 23, Signaling Critical Bitcoin Season","BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Warning: Index Plunges to 23, Signaling Critical Bitcoin Season Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ever wonder if it’s the right time to focus on Bitcoin or explore the vast world of altcoins? The crypto market is constantly shifting, and understanding these cycles is key. A popular metric, the Altcoin Season Index, is currently giving us a strong signal: we are firmly in Bitcoin Season. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index, tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap, is designed to give investors a snapshot of market sentiment and performance relative to Bitcoin. It measures how many of the top 100 altcoins (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The index score ranges from 1 to 100. Here’s a simple breakdown: Altcoin Season: This occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have performed better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score would typically be high, often above 75. Bitcoin Season: This is the opposite. It happens when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. The index score would be low, typically 25 or below. Neither: If the performance is somewhere in between (25% to 75% outperform Bitcoin), the market isn’t clearly in either season. Bitcoin Season is Here: The Index at 23 As of June 5, the Altcoin Season Index registered 23. This figure is down slightly from the previous day, reinforcing the current trend. A score of 23 falls squarely into the definition of Bitcoin Season. This means that over the last three months, a significant majority of the largest altcoins have struggled to keep pace with Bitcoin’s performance. During Bitcoin Season, capital tends to flow primarily into Bitcoin. This could be due to various factors such as Bitcoin acting as a safe haven during uncertainty, increased institutional interest focused on BTC, or simply market dominance cycles where Bitcoin leads rallies or shows relative strength during downturns. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Cycle Understanding whether we are in Altcoin Season or Bitcoin Season is crucial for developing an effective Crypto Investing Strategy. When the index signals Bitcoin Season, it suggests that focusing solely on a broad basket of altcoins might not yield the best short-term results compared to holding or focusing on Bitcoin. Key Considerations During Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin’s market dominance (its market cap relative to the total crypto market cap) often increases during Bitcoin Season. Altcoin Performance: Many altcoins may underperform Bitcoin, and some may even see significant price drops while Bitcoin holds relatively steady or increases. Risk Assessment: Altcoins are generally considered higher risk than Bitcoin. During periods of market uncertainty or consolidation led by BTC, this higher risk can become more apparent. Your Crypto Investing Strategy in a Bitcoin-Dominant Market So, with the Altcoin Index pointing to Bitcoin Season, what’s your move? This isn’t financial advice, but understanding the current climate can help inform your decisions: Potential Strategies: Focus on Bitcoin: Some investors may choose to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to Bitcoin, anticipating it will continue to be the stronger performer. Selective Altcoin Exposure: Instead of a broad altcoin approach, focus on specific altcoins with strong fundamentals, upcoming catalysts, or unique use cases that might still perform well even in a Bitcoin-led market. Thorough research is essential here. Increase Stablecoin Holdings: For risk-averse investors, increasing stablecoin holdings can be a way to preserve capital during volatile periods or await clearer market signals. Rebalancing: Use this period to rebalance your portfolio according to your long-term strategy and risk tolerance. Challenges: Predicting the Shift: Knowing exactly when Bitcoin Season will end and Altcoin Season will begin is impossible. The index is a lagging indicator, reflecting the past 90 days. Market Volatility: Even during Bitcoin Season, the entire crypto market remains highly volatile. False Signals: The index is just one tool. Other factors like macroeconomics, regulatory news, and specific project developments also heavily influence prices. Understanding the Cycle is Power The Altcoin Season Index at 23 serves as a clear indicator of the current market phase – Bitcoin Season. While this doesn’t mean altcoins won’t see any gains, it suggests that Bitcoin is currently the dominant force and has been outperforming the majority of the top altcoins over the past three months. For investors, recognizing this phase is crucial for refining their Crypto Investing Strategy, managing risk, and potentially identifying where value is currently congregating within the crypto market. Remember, market cycles are dynamic. Bitcoin Season won’t last forever, and eventually, conditions will likely become favorable for altcoins again. Staying informed, conducting your own research, and having a well-defined strategy tailored to different market conditions are your best tools for navigating the exciting, albeit sometimes challenging, world of cryptocurrency.

The company’s stock will list on NYSE American under the ticker BMNR. BitMine is expanding both its BTC holdings and advisory services. BitMine Immersion Technologies is raising $18 million through a public stock offering as it looks to expand its Bitcoin holdings and deepen its treasury strategy. In a June 4 announcement , BitMine detailed plans to offer 2.25 million shares priced at $8.00 each. Underwriters also have a 45-day option to purchase an additional 337,500 shares. The offering is expected to close on June 6, subject to standard conditions. BitMine to Deploy Entire $18M Raise Toward Building BTC Reserves The company said it intends to deploy all proceeds from the raise to purchase Bitcoin, supporting its long-term approach of building BTC reserves through mining and direct acquisition. BitMine operates in both Trinidad and Texas and is positioning itself as a Bitcoin treasury-focused public company. Alongside the offering, BitMine confirmed that its stock has been approved for listing on the NYSE American under the ticker BMNR, with trading beginning June 5. The stock will no longer trade on the OTCQX Best Market. ThinkEquity is managing the offering. The capital raise comes as interest in Bitcoin mining and BTC treasury strategies continues to grow. According to JPMorgan, the combined market cap of 13 publicly traded Bitcoin miners rose 20% in May, signaling improving mining profitability. BitMine has also expanded into advisory services. In May, it launched a Bitcoin Treasury Advisory Practice to help other public firms develop BTC-based strategies, covering areas such as accounting and risk management. The company also secured a $4 million leasing agreement involving 3,000 ASIC miners. With this $18 million raise and NYSE uplisting, BitMine is doubling down on its identity as a Bitcoin-first public company — raising the question of whether its latest BTC accumulation will have an impact on Bitcoin price dynamics. BTC Tests $104K Zone as Bulls Struggle to Regain Momentum Bitcoin is currently trading near $104,550 after facing resistance around the $105,200–$105,300 range. The 2-hour chart shows BTC in a consolidation phase following its recent high above $106,000. Bollinger Bands are tightening, indicating a potential breakout setup. On the 30-minute chart, BTC has been gradually sliding from last week’s highs near $112,000, with lower highs forming a descending structure. Current support is seen around $104,300–$104,500, which has held over the past 24 hours. RSI on both the 2-hour and 30-minute charts is hovering in the neutral zone (39–42), suggesting no clear bullish or bearish momentum yet. MACD on the 30-minute is slightly negative, hinting at weak bearish pressure. The 1-minute chart shows a minor recovery from the early morning low of $104,433, with RSI bouncing to 53 and MACD flipping positive — a short-term bullish signal. For now, BTC must reclaim $105,300 to shift sentiment toward bullish continuation. Failure to hold above $104,300 could open the door for a retest of the $103,500 level.

2025-06-05T07:50:00,"Bitcoin Price Plunge Alarms Retail Investors: Volume Shrinks","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge Alarms Retail Investors: Volume Shrinks The cryptocurrency market is always a dynamic space, reacting swiftly to price movements. Recently, as the Bitcoin price has retreated from its impressive all-time high, we’re seeing shifts in how different market participants are behaving. One notable change is the apparent cooling off of activity among retail investors . Has the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop Shaken Retail Confidence? Bitcoin (BTC), the bellwether of the crypto market , recently touched an all-time high of $111,000 on May 22nd. However, like any volatile asset, it experienced a pullback, dropping roughly 7% to trade near $104,000. While this might seem like a standard market correction, an analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci suggests it had a noticeable impact on smaller players. According to Kesmeci’s findings, the volume of transactions typically associated with retail activity – specifically transfers valued between $0 and $10,000 – saw a decline. This ‘retail transaction volume’ dropped from $423 million to $408 million following the BTC price dip. Furthermore, a look at the 30-day change in retail demand reinforces this trend. This metric, which had shown a healthy 5-point increase, shifted dramatically to a slight decline of 0.11 points. This pivot indicates a change in momentum, suggesting that the bullish enthusiasm from retail seems to be taking a pause. Understanding the Decline in Retail Transaction Volume What does a drop in transaction volume for small transfers tell us? It primarily indicates that individuals making smaller trades or transfers are becoming less active. There are several potential reasons for this: Fear and Uncertainty: Price drops can trigger fear (FUD) among less experienced investors, leading them to pause buying or even sell to cut potential losses. Profit Taking: Some retail investors might have taken profits after the rally towards the all-time high, and the subsequent dip reinforced their decision to stay on the sidelines temporarily. Waiting for a Lower Entry: Others might be waiting for a deeper correction before buying back in, reducing current transaction volume. Reduced Hype: A slight dip can sometimes cool the broader market excitement that often fuels retail participation. This specific ‘retail transaction volume’ metric, focusing on the $0-$10,000 range, is a useful proxy for gauging the activity level of individual, non-professional investors who are less likely to be moving large sums for institutional purposes. Why Do Retail Investors React Differently Than Institutions? The analysis highlighted that while retail activity waned, institutional interest appeared to remain steady. This is a crucial distinction in the crypto market : Investment Horizon: Institutions often have a much longer investment horizon than retail investors. Short-term price fluctuations are less likely to deter them from their long-term strategies. Risk Management: Institutional investors typically employ sophisticated risk management strategies and capital allocation models that account for volatility. Retail investors might be more emotionally driven. Access to Capital and Information: Institutions have deeper pockets and often access to proprietary research and trading desks, allowing them to act differently during market shifts. Strategic Goals: Institutional involvement is often part of broader portfolio diversification or specific strategic plays, not just speculative trading based on daily price swings. This divergence in behavior between retail and institutional players during a Bitcoin price pullback is a common theme in volatile markets. It underscores the different motivations and capabilities of these two distinct investor groups. Implications of Shifting Bitcoin Volume Dynamics A decline in Bitcoin volume among retail investors doesn’t necessarily signal the end of a bull run, but it does indicate a potential shift in market dynamics. If retail momentum slows, sustained price increases might rely more heavily on institutional accumulation or significant positive news events. Conversely, a period of lower retail volume during a pullback could be seen by some as a healthy consolidation phase, potentially setting the stage for the next move up once confidence returns or institutional buying pressure increases. It highlights the current sentiment among smaller players, which is a key component of the overall market structure. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Investors For those participating in the crypto market , understanding these shifts in Bitcoin volume and retail behavior is key. Here are a few insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of on-chain data and analyses like those from CryptoQuant to understand underlying market flows. Define Your Strategy: Whether you’re a long-term holder or a short-term trader, have a clear plan that isn’t solely dictated by daily price swings. Manage Risk: Only invest what you can afford to lose, and consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to smooth out volatility. Observe Institutional Activity: While harder to track directly, signs of continued institutional interest (like ETF flows or corporate adoption news) can be a positive signal. The current environment serves as a reminder that market corrections are normal and can reveal underlying shifts in participation. While the dip in BTC price has caused some retail investors to pull back, the broader picture involves multiple types of market participants with varying strategies. Summary: Retail Takes a Breather as Bitcoin Pulls Back In conclusion, Bitcoin’s recent retreat from its all-time high has indeed coincided with a noticeable decrease in activity among retail investors, as evidenced by declining small-value transaction volume and a negative shift in the 30-day retail demand metric. This suggests that many smaller players are reacting to short-term price movements, perhaps taking profits or waiting for clearer market direction. This contrasts with the reported steady interest from institutional players, highlighting the different approaches taken by various market segments. While the dip in Bitcoin volume from retail might cool short-term momentum, it’s a typical reaction during pullbacks and provides valuable insight into current market sentiment.

2025-06-05T07:48:14,"Expert Explains Why Ripple Escrow Could Aid XRP Price Rally","The escrow system used by Ripple has long been a source of controversy within and outside the XRP community. Critics, including Bitcoin advocates and some XRP holders, often claim that the monthly release of XRP from escrow creates downward pressure on the asset’s price. However, a well-known analyst within the XRP community has provided a contrasting perspective, asserting that the escrow does not harm the price. He claims it restricts market supply and could contribute to a future price surge. A Misunderstood Mechanism The analyst, who operates the “All Things XRP” account, argues that many people misinterpret the nature and impact of Ripple’s escrow system. According to the pseudonymous analyst, “It’s starving the market,” not flooding it. He explains that while XRP has a total fixed supply of 100 billion tokens, over 56 billion have already entered circulation. The remaining tokens are being gradually released from escrow, a system Ripple implemented in 2017 to address trust and transparency concerns. At the time, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow and set up a schedule to release 1 billion tokens per month. While this schedule might seem like a steady injection of new supply, the analyst clarified that Ripple does not typically use the full monthly allocation. In most months, a large portion of the released XRP is returned to escrow, effectively deferring its entry into the market. He stated that Ripple typically uses between 200 and 300 million XRP monthly for purposes such as market making, running its payment infrastructure, and supporting ecosystem initiatives. THINK XRP’S ESCROW IS BAD FOR PRICE? You’ve been misled. It’s not dumping XRP… It’s starving the market. And the moment it ends could be explosive. pic.twitter.com/L0ZXVxiqnI — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) May 17, 2025 Supply Control, Not Dumping This approach, the analyst argues, demonstrates supply control rather than market manipulation. He emphasized that Ripple’s behavior has been consistent and disciplined, with unused tokens routinely locked back into escrow. This process, he said, should not be equated with token dumping, which implies reckless or excessive release of assets into the market. Currently, Ripple holds approximately 36.5 billion XRP in escrow, down from the initial 55 billion, reflecting how the system has gradually reduced over time. The analyst believes this declining escrow balance, combined with increasing demand, particularly from On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) services and the potential for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), could lead to a scenario where demand surpasses available supply. In his view, this “starving” effect could ultimately fuel a significant price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Centralization Concerns and Transparency The analyst also responded to concerns about centralization, a point frequently raised by Bitcoin maximalists and skeptics of Ripple’s influence over XRP. While Ripple still owns a significant portion of the total supply, estimated at around 46%, he contends that the escrow system introduces accountability. Because every token release is publicly recorded on-chain, the process remains transparent and traceable. This structure, he argues, limits Ripple’s ability to manipulate the market and reinforces long-term trust in the system. Suggestions from the Community Some members of the XRP community have proposed alternative ways of handling the escrowed tokens. Ideas have included unlocking additional tokens to support ecosystem initiatives or even burning the remaining supply entirely to create artificial scarcity. However, Ripple Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has dismissed such proposals. He referenced the 2019 decision by the Stellar Development Foundation to burn 55 billion XLM tokens. “Stellar burned half their supply and there wasn’t so much as a blip on their price chart,” he said, suggesting a similar strategy for XRP would not yield the desired effect and would instead squander valuable assets. The analyst behind “All Things XRP” argues that Ripple’s escrow structure acts as a supply management tool, not a price suppressor. He believes that as long as Ripple maintains its current release practices and market demand continues to grow, the conditions for a substantial price movement will only strengthen as the remaining escrow balance declines.

2025-06-05T07:40:56,"Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Market Sentiment Remains Greed","BitcoinWorld Decoding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: Market Sentiment Remains Greed The world of cryptocurrency is a dynamic landscape, heavily influenced by the collective mood of investors and traders. Understanding this underlying emotional state – whether people are feeling fearful and hesitant or greedy and eager – is crucial for navigating the market. A widely used tool for gauging this is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index . Recently, this popular indicator, provided by software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 57 as of June 5. This figure marks a five-point decrease from the previous day’s reading. While this drop indicates a slight cooling of market enthusiasm, the index firmly places the current crypto market sentiment within the ‘Greed’ territory. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index : More Than Just a Number The index operates on a simple yet insightful principle: extreme fear can be a sign that investors are overly worried, potentially presenting a buying opportunity, while extreme greed suggests the market might be due for a correction as investors become complacent or overly speculative. The index scale ranges from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are very worried. Could signal a potential bottom. 25-49: Fear – Market is nervous. Caution is prevalent. 50-74: Greed – Market is optimistic. Prices are rising, attracting more buyers. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Market is overheated. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) is high. Could signal a potential top. The index doesn’t rely on just one data point. Instead, it aggregates data from several key sources, each weighted differently, to provide a comprehensive snapshot of market psychology. What Drives Crypto Market Sentiment ? The Index Factors Explained The calculation of the index is based on six distinct factors, though one is currently paused. Each factor offers a unique perspective on the market’s mood: Volatility (25%): This measures the current volatility and maximum drawdown of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High crypto volatility , especially sharp downward moves, often signals fear in the market. Conversely, stable or upward-trending prices with lower volatility can contribute to a sense of greed or confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component compares the current market volume and momentum (strength of price movements) with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume on upward trends indicates strong Market momentum driven by investor interest and often signals greed. Low volume or high selling volume on downward trends suggests fear or lack of conviction. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes posts on various social media platforms, focusing on specific hashtags related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It counts the speed and frequency of posts and assesses the sentiment (positive or negative) of these interactions. High levels of positive discussion and engagement can boost the greed score. Surveys (15%): (Currently Paused) While not active at the moment, this factor historically involved weekly polls where users were asked about their perception of the market. This provided a direct measure of investor sentiment, bypassing market data analysis. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increase in Bitcoin dominance often suggests that investors are moving funds out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, which is typically seen as a safer haven in crypto. This can indicate fear. Conversely, decreasing dominance often means money is flowing into altcoins, a sign of higher risk appetite and potentially greed. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search query data related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google Trends, the index can gauge public interest and sentiment. For example, a sudden surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “buy crypto” might indicate growing public greed, while searches for “Bitcoin scam” or “crypto crash” could signal fear. By combining these factors, the index provides a nuanced perspective that goes beyond simple price movements. Current State: Why 57 Still Signals Greed A reading of 57, while lower than the previous day, still falls comfortably within the ‘Greed’ zone (50-74). This suggests that despite some recent price fluctuations or potentially cautious news, the prevailing mood among crypto investors remains optimistic. The slight drop might reflect short-term price dips, minor negative news cycles, or profit-taking, but it hasn’t been significant enough to push the overall sentiment back into ‘Fear’. Being in the ‘Greed’ phase means that investors are generally confident, willing to buy, and perhaps chasing upward price trends. This positive sentiment can create a self-reinforcing cycle, pushing prices higher as more people jump in. Navigating a ‘Greed’ Market: Opportunities and Risks When the Crypto Fear and Greed Index is in the ‘Greed’ zone, several market dynamics are typically at play: Opportunities: Continued upward price action is possible as positive sentiment fuels buying. Altcoins may perform well as risk appetite increases (reflected in potentially decreasing Bitcoin dominance ). Traders might find opportunities in riding upward trends, leveraging the positive Market momentum . Risks: The primary risk in a ‘Greed’ market is overheating. Prices can become overextended, driven more by emotion and FOMO than fundamentals. This increases the potential for sharp corrections. High Crypto volatility can work both ways, leading to rapid losses if sentiment suddenly shifts. It’s crucial to avoid getting swept up in the hype and making impulsive decisions based solely on positive sentiment. Limitations of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index : It’s Not a Crystal Ball While a valuable tool for understanding current crypto market sentiment , the index has limitations: Lagging Indicator: The index reflects the *current* sentiment based on recent data. It doesn’t predict future price movements with certainty. Correlation vs. Causation: While high greed often correlates with market tops and high fear with market bottoms, the index doesn’t *cause* these events. It reflects the collective behavior that drives them. Simplified View: Market dynamics are complex. The index provides a useful summary but doesn’t capture all nuances, such as specific sector performance or regulatory news impacts. Using the Index: Actionable Insights for Your Strategy How can you use the Crypto Fear and Greed Index effectively? As a Contrarian Signal: Some experienced traders use the index contrarianly – considering buying when the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (when others are panicking) and considering selling or taking profits when it’s in ‘Extreme Greed’ (when others are overly confident). As a Confirmation Tool: Use the index to confirm signals from your other analysis methods (technical, fundamental). If your analysis suggests a potential uptrend and the index is in ‘Greed’, it might reinforce the positive outlook driven by Market momentum . If your analysis suggests caution and the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it adds weight to the potential for a pullback. Understand the Context: Always look at *why* the index is at a certain level. Are all factors pointing in the same direction, or is one factor like high Crypto volatility pulling it down while others remain positive? Consider the role of Bitcoin dominance in the overall picture. Manage Risk: Regardless of the index level, always employ sound risk management practices. Don’t invest more than you can afford to lose, and consider setting stop-loss orders. Conclusion The Crypto Fear and Greed Index, currently sitting at 57 and indicating ‘Greed’, remains a valuable barometer for understanding the prevailing mood in the cryptocurrency market. While it has dipped slightly, the sentiment is still largely optimistic, driven by factors like market momentum, social media trends, and potentially Bitcoin dominance dynamics. By understanding how this index works and its components, and by using it in conjunction with other analytical tools, investors can gain better insights into the emotional forces shaping the market, helping them make more informed decisions rather than being solely guided by fear or greed themselves.

2025-06-05T07:38:23,"Altcoins Retrace Again as Bitcoin (BTC) Price Loses $105K Level (Market Watch)","Bitcoin’s underwhelming price actions continued in the past 24 hours as the asset has lost some ground compared to yesterday and sits below $105,000. The altcoins have posted even bigger losses, especially AVAX, UNI, HYPE, XMR, ENA, and a few others. BTC Falls Beneath $105K It was just two weeks ago, on Bitcoin Pizza Day, when the primary cryptocurrency skyrocketed to a fresh all-time high of almost $112,000. However, it failed to maintain its run and started to retrace almost immediately. At first, it remained around $110,000 but was stopped and driven south last week. The most violent rejection arrived at the end of the business week when the bears pushed bitcoin down by several grand. The culmination took place on Saturday when BTC slumped to a 12-day low of $103,100. The cs-are-overheating-while-bitcoin-remains-bullish-cryptoquant/finally stepped up at this point and didn’t allow a potential breakdown toward five-digit territory. Bitcoin started to recover and aimed at $106,000 on a few occasions since then. However, each attempt was stopped in its tracks, and BTC now sits below $105,000 after the more recent rejection. Its market capitalization has dropped to $2.080 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has recovered to 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Back in Red Most altcoins have charted even bigger losses than BTC in the past day, evident from their reduced market share. Avalanche is among the poorest performers, having lost over 5% of value and sitting just inches above $20. UNI has dropped by a similar percentage, while XMR has plunged by over 8%. HYPE, DOGE, and LINK are also well in the red, while ADA, SUI, and XRP have lost up to 2%. The cumulative market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has dropped by more than $30 billion since yesterday and is below $3.410 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-06-05T07:30:51,"Bitcoin Buy Signal: Crucial Hash Ribbons Indicator Emerges Amid Miner Stress","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Buy Signal: Crucial Hash Ribbons Indicator Emerges Amid Miner Stress Hey crypto enthusiasts! Are you keeping an eye on Bitcoin? A fascinating signal has just emerged from the depths of the network, one that historically points towards opportune moments for accumulation. We’re talking about a potential Bitcoin buy signal flagged by a powerful on-chain tool known as the Hash Ribbons indicator. This isn’t just market noise; it’s a signal rooted in the very economics of Bitcoin mining, suggesting a period of stress among those who secure the network. Understanding the Hash Ribbons: What Are These Crypto Indicators Telling Us? The Hash Ribbons are essentially a set of two simple moving averages applied to Bitcoin’s hash rate – the computational power dedicated to mining and processing transactions. Think of the hash rate as a direct measure of the health and activity of the mining network. When the hash rate is high and growing, it suggests miners are profitable and expanding operations. But what happens when conditions get tough? This is where the Hash Ribbons become particularly insightful. They are designed to identify periods of Bitcoin miner capitulation . This happens when the price of Bitcoin drops, or energy costs rise, making mining unprofitable for less efficient miners. These miners are forced to shut down their machines, leading to a decline or stagnation in the network’s hash rate. The Hash Ribbons signal this stress through specific crossovers of the moving averages. Bitcoin Miner Capitulation: Why Stress Can Lead to Opportunity The term Bitcoin miner capitulation might sound dramatic, and in a way, it is. It signifies a phase where miners, who are essentially the backbone of the network, are under significant financial pressure. To cover their operational costs (electricity, hardware, etc.) and potentially avoid bankruptcy, these struggling miners often have to sell their mined Bitcoin. This forced selling adds supply to the market, contributing to downward price pressure or preventing a price recovery. Here’s the critical insight: While miner selling creates short-term headwinds, the capitulation phase eventually washes out the less efficient participants. Once the selling pressure from these specific miners subsides, and the hash rate begins to recover (signaling that more efficient miners are still operating or new ones are coming online), it has historically marked a strong bottom for Bitcoin’s price. The Hash Ribbons indicator aims to pinpoint this transition – the moment the ‘worst is over’ for miners and the network starts to heal. The Current Signal: What the Hash Ribbons Are Showing Now for BTC Price Analysis Recent analysis, like the one shared by Darkfost on CryptoQuant, highlights that the Hash Ribbons indicator is currently flashing a signal consistent with past periods of miner stress and potential capitulation. This comes after a phase where Bitcoin’s hash rate surged to new record highs. While a high hash rate generally indicates a robust network, if the price doesn’t keep pace or energy costs become prohibitive, it can squeeze profit margins for miners, particularly the less sophisticated ones. The indicator suggests that the market may be experiencing the effects of this miner stress. Miners offloading BTC to stay afloat can create temporary selling pressure. However, according to the historical performance of this indicator, this very stress phase often precedes a significant price recovery. It’s a counter-intuitive idea: pain in the mining sector can signal potential gain for investors looking at the BTC price analysis . Looking Back: How Have the Hash Ribbons Performed Historically? Let’s peek into the past to see why the Hash Ribbons are considered among the more reliable Crypto indicators for identifying potential cycle lows. Historically, every major Bitcoin bottom has been accompanied by a Hash Ribbons buy signal. Here are a few notable instances: December 2018: Following the peak of the 2017 bull run, Bitcoin entered a deep bear market. The Hash Ribbons signaled miner capitulation near the $3,200 bottom, which marked the end of that bear cycle. March 2020 (COVID Crash): During the sudden global market panic, Bitcoin’s price plummeted. The Hash Ribbons quickly printed a buy signal shortly after the bottom around $3,800, preceding a significant rally. July 2021: After the May 2021 peak and subsequent correction, the Hash Ribbons signaled miner stress and recovery, coinciding with the low around $29,000 before the push to new all-time highs later that year. January 2023: Following the 2022 bear market, the Hash Ribbons signaled accumulation early in the year, preceding Bitcoin’s rally from the $16,000-$17,000 range. These historical examples illustrate the indicator’s potential to highlight periods where the selling pressure from distressed miners is likely peaking, setting the stage for a recovery. This track record is why the current Bitcoin buy signal from the Hash Ribbons is attracting attention from analysts focused on BTC price analysis . Is This Bitcoin Buy Signal Foolproof? A Word of Caution While the Hash Ribbons indicator has a compelling history, it’s crucial to remember that no single indicator is a crystal ball. The crypto market is influenced by a vast array of factors beyond just miner behavior. Macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, institutional investor sentiment, and global events all play significant roles in BTC price analysis . Relying solely on the Hash Ribbons without considering the broader market context would be naive. This signal should be viewed as one powerful piece of the puzzle, suggesting that the fundamental supply side from miners is likely entering a less pressured phase. It’s a strong indication from the network’s core, but it doesn’t negate the impact of external market forces. Actionable Insights: What to Do With This Information So, you’ve seen the Hash Ribbons signal, understood Bitcoin miner capitulation , and reviewed the historical context. What does this mean for you as an investor or trader? See it as a Potential Accumulation Zone: Historically, periods flagged by the Hash Ribbons buy signal have offered attractive entry points for long-term holders. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This signal is a prompt for further investigation. Look at other Crypto indicators , analyze market sentiment, and consider your own investment strategy and risk tolerance. Long-Term Perspective: The Hash Ribbons signal is typically relevant for identifying macro bottoms or significant accumulation periods, not short-term trading fluctuations. Diversification: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket based on a single indicator. The emergence of this Bitcoin buy signal based on the Hash Ribbons suggests that the market might be in a phase that has historically rewarded patient investors. The underlying stress in the mining industry, while challenging for miners, often cleanses the system and paves the way for future growth. In Conclusion: The Hash Ribbons Signal and the Road Ahead for Bitcoin The Hash Ribbons indicator’s latest reading, pointing to ongoing or concluding Bitcoin miner capitulation , presents a compelling case for a potential Bitcoin buy signal . This on-chain metric, rooted in the economic realities of mining, has a proven track record of coinciding with significant price bottoms in the past. While miner stress can create temporary selling pressure, the indicator suggests that this phase might be setting the stage for a more favorable environment for price appreciation, according to historical BTC price analysis . As with all Crypto indicators , it’s a tool to inform your decisions, not make them for you. However, the signal from the Hash Ribbons is a powerful reminder that opportunities can arise from periods of stress within the network’s fundamental layers. Keep this signal on your radar as you navigate the fascinating world of Bitcoin.

The Honourable Singapore High Court issued an order declining to approve our proposed restructuring plan.

Our primary… pic.twitter.com/jrXFFwnMBA — WazirX: India Ka Bitcoin Exchange (@WazirXIndia) June 4, 2025 WazirX Repayment Hopes Dashed The plan, which aimed to begin creditor payouts by April 2025, had previously received initial court approval in January following a devastating $230 million hack linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. WazirX had proposed a path to recovery that included launching a decentralized exchange (DEX), issuing recovery tokens, and buying back tokens to support liquidity. However, with the court’s recent decision, the repayment timeline has collapsed, leaving creditors in limbo. WazirX Shifts Base to Panama Following the Singapore court’s rejection of its restructuring plan, WazirX is now relocating operations to Panama and rebranding under a new entity. Recently, the exchange shared redacted legal documents with users via email, revealing that its parent company, Zettai, is setting up a subsidiary called Zensui Corporation in Panama. The move signals a strategic shift as WazirX attempts to reset its crypto services under a new jurisdiction, possibly to regain operational flexibility and distance itself from ongoing legal and financial challenges. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : WazirX Rebrands as Zensui After Moving from Singapore to Panama , Legal Limbo and Risk of Liquidation The Singapore court’s refusal now threatens to push WazirX into liquidation under Section 301 of the Companies Act.

Despite the setback, WazirX said in a note to creditors that it remains committed to legal compliance and hopes to begin distributions “as soon as possible.” From Market Leader to Crisis Mode Once a dominant force in India’s crypto trading scene, WazirX’s credibility is in question due to poor communication, limited asset recovery, and an almost complete shutdown of user interaction on social media platforms. Moreover, this latest court ruling casts serious doubt over the platform’s future and signals deeper challenges for its path to redemption. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T07:10:38,"California’s Crucial AB1052 Bill Protects Unclaimed Crypto Assets","BitcoinWorld California’s Crucial AB1052 Bill Protects Unclaimed Crypto Assets Big news for crypto holders in the Golden State! The California State Assembly has taken a significant step forward in recognizing and protecting digital assets by unanimously passing a new bill. This legislation, known as AB1052 bill , brings cryptocurrency under the umbrella of the state’s existing Unclaimed Property Law. If you hold crypto on an exchange or platform, this is a development you’ll want to understand. What Does California’s New Crypto Law Change? Before this bill, the standard procedure for unclaimed property held by businesses in California involved eventually converting those assets into cash. This applied to various types of property, from dormant bank accounts to forgotten stock dividends. Under the previous interpretation, unclaimed cryptocurrency could potentially be subject to the same fate – converted into fiat currency by the state after a set period. The core change introduced by the AB1052 bill is specifically targeted at digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. Here’s the key difference: Old Approach: Unclaimed assets, including potentially crypto, would eventually be converted into cash after a dormancy period (typically three years for most property types). New Approach (under AB1052): Unclaimed cryptocurrency must be held by the state in its native cryptocurrency form . It cannot be converted into cash upon being reported as unclaimed. This is a crucial distinction for several reasons, which we’ll explore next. It acknowledges the unique nature of digital assets and their potential for value fluctuation independent of fiat currencies. Protecting Your Digital Assets: Why Unclaimed Property Crypto Stays Crypto The decision to require the state to hold unclaimed cryptocurrency in its original form is a major win for potential owners. Here’s why this new aspect of the California crypto law is beneficial: Preserving Potential Value: Cryptocurrency markets are known for volatility. Converting unclaimed crypto to cash at a specific point in time could lock in a loss if the market value later increased significantly. By keeping the assets as crypto, the state preserves the potential for future appreciation for the rightful owner. Owner’s Choice: When an owner eventually comes forward to claim their property, they will receive the original cryptocurrency assets, not just the cash equivalent from a past conversion date. This gives the owner control over when and if they choose to convert their digital assets. Alignment with Asset Nature: The bill recognizes that cryptocurrency is a distinct asset class, different from traditional financial instruments. Treating it as such under the Unclaimed Property Law is a step towards regulatory maturity in the digital asset space. This provision directly addresses a potential unfairness where an owner could lose out on significant gains simply because their assets were deemed unclaimed and converted during a market dip. Navigating Crypto Regulations California: What Happens When Assets Are Unclaimed? So, how does crypto actually become ‘unclaimed’ under this law? The process is generally initiated by the holder of the asset – in the case of cryptocurrency, this is typically a centralized exchange or a similar platform that custody assets on behalf of users. The law specifies a dormancy period. If the exchange or platform loses contact with the owner of the crypto assets for a continuous period, usually three years, those assets are then considered ‘unclaimed’. The exchange is required to attempt to contact the owner diligently during this period. If contact cannot be re-established, the assets must be reported and eventually escheated (turned over) to the State of California’s Unclaimed Property Division. Under the new AB1052 bill , when these crypto assets are escheated, they must be transferred to the state in their cryptocurrency form. The state will then be responsible for securely storing these diverse digital assets until the rightful owner comes forward to claim them. Reclaiming Your Assets: The Process for Owners The good news for owners whose crypto might end up in the state’s custody is that the process for reclaiming it is designed to be straightforward and fee-free. If you believe the state might be holding your unclaimed property, including cryptocurrency, you can search the state’s unclaimed property database. Once you locate your property, you can initiate a claim. The California State Assembly ‘s approval of this bill ensures that when you successfully claim your digital assets, you will receive the specific cryptocurrencies that were escheated, not a cash equivalent from years prior. This maintains the integrity of your original holdings. While the process of searching and claiming is generally free, owners will need to provide proof of identity and ownership to successfully retrieve their assets. The state will need to develop secure and efficient systems for managing and returning a potentially wide variety of cryptocurrencies. Comparing California’s Approach to Unclaimed Property Crypto California is often at the forefront of regulatory developments in the U.S., and this bill regarding unclaimed property crypto is another example. While other states have unclaimed property laws, explicitly including cryptocurrency and mandating it be held in its native form is a relatively new and progressive approach. Many existing state laws were written long before digital assets existed. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, states are grappling with how to apply existing regulations or create new ones. California’s decision sets a precedent for how states can handle unclaimed digital assets in a way that respects their nature and protects the potential value for owners. This move by the California State Assembly could influence how other states address similar issues in the future, potentially leading to more standardized and crypto-friendly unclaimed property regulations nationwide. Actionable Insights for California Crypto Users What does this bill mean for you right now if you hold crypto and live in California? Keep Contact Information Updated: The primary reason assets become unclaimed is the holder losing contact with the owner. Ensure your email, phone number, and physical address are current with any exchange or platform where you hold crypto. Be Aware of Dormancy Periods: Understand the typical three-year dormancy period after which assets might be considered unclaimed if contact is lost. Know Your Holdings: Keep track of where you hold your cryptocurrency. This makes it easier to check the state’s unclaimed property database if necessary in the future. Understand Your Rights: Be aware that under the new California crypto law , if your crypto is escheated, you have the right to claim the original cryptocurrency assets back from the state. This bill doesn’t change how you hold or trade crypto day-to-day, but it provides an important safety net for dormant or forgotten assets, ensuring they aren’t simply converted to cash and potentially losing significant value over time. Summary: A Win for California Crypto Holders The unanimous passage of the AB1052 bill by the California State Assembly marks a significant and positive step for cryptocurrency regulation in the state. By explicitly including crypto within the Unclaimed Property Law and, more importantly, requiring that unclaimed digital assets be held in their original cryptocurrency form rather than being converted to cash, California is setting a forward-thinking precedent. This legislation protects the potential future value of unclaimed crypto for its rightful owners and acknowledges the unique characteristics of digital assets. It ensures that if circumstances lead to your crypto being deemed unclaimed, you will have the opportunity to reclaim the actual assets from the state, fee-free, preserving your exposure to the crypto market.

2025-06-05T07:09:52,"Why Crypto Market down Today? Whale Sell-Offs Trigger Panic","The post Why Crypto Market down Today? Whale Sell-Offs Trigger Panic appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, the crypto world is mostly in the red. Meanwhile, the total crypto market fell by 1% to $3.29 trillion. Bitcoin, the biggest crypto by market cap, dropped by 0.7% to $104,618.95 and its market value now stands at $2.08 trillion. Even though the crypto fear index is steady at 55 , it shows a neutral mood. So, what’s causing the downturn in the market? Whale Activity Raises Concerns One key reason is that the whales have started selling. These giant investors, who hold more than 10,000 BTC each, have been in profit-taking mode. According to expert Willy Woo, some of these whales bought their Bitcoin as early as 2017, at dirt-cheap prices of $0 to $700. Now, with Bitcoin hitting long-term highs, they’re cashing in. ""Who are the idiots who are selling when institutions and sovereigns are racing to buy billions in BTC?"" This chart sheds light. The big whales >10k BTC have been selling since 2017. ""They're stupid!"" Most of those coins were bought between $0-$700 and held 8-16 years. pic.twitter.com/pv1elMx9N1 — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 3, 2025 Joao Wedson from Alphractal also shared that whales are selling off between $105,000 and $100,000 levels. His charts show selling pressure building up, with the buy/sell ratio turning negative. This means more people are selling than buying, which adds extra weight to the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: Top 4 Catalysts That Could Send BTC Price to $300K , Bitcoin ETF Inflows Slow Down Another reason why the market is down is the slowdown in Bitcoin ETF inflows. Recently, these ETFs had outflows of about $1 billion , and this week alone, around $267 million has flowed out. While there was a smaller inflow of $87 million yesterday, mostly driven by BlackRock’s $284 million buy-in, it wasn’t enough to offset the losses. Historically, when ETF inflows slow down, Bitcoin’s price tends to feel the pressure. Just a few weeks ago, daily inflows of $1.5 billion were common, but now that’s not the case. Altcoins Feeling the Heat Too It’s not just Bitcoin that’s feeling the heat. Ethereum is mostly flat at $2,612, while Solana dropped 2.6% to $152.5. Other popular altcoins like XRP, Dogecoin, and Cardano have also taken a hit, each losing 3% to 5% in the past 24 hours. All in all, the crypto market is in a cautious phase as whales take profits and ETF inflows slow down. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The analyst also shares a weekly chart showing Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator is flashing bullish for BTC. The MACD is a technical indicator that tracks the convergence and divergence of moving averages to gauge an asset’s momentum and trend direction while pinpointing potential reversal areas. “A similar BTC move up, even from a 38% real consolidation of the recent move, would see that Fib extension target hit.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Lastly, the analyst shares a daily Bitcoin chart suggesting BTC is repeating a similar 2024 pattern of consolidating within a range before breaking out to new all-time highs. “BTC shaping up nicely.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Bitcoin is trading for $104,755 at time of writing, down 1.1% in the last 24 hours.

While daily trading volume has shrunken down by 3.55% to $101.76 billion. The Fear & Greed Index sits at a neutral 55, reflecting indecision among traders. In a strategic move, JP Morgan has adopted crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. Amidst all the compounding moves, investors and traders need a clear, data-driven strategy to navigate uncertainty and seize potential opportunities. And this analysis underlines what you could do to make the most of this time. Strategic Framework: You Need to Consider The primary goal in the current trend is the preservation of capital with selective accumulation. Here’s how smart investors can build a strategy during this phase: 1. Follow BTC First – Dominance is Leadership: With Bitcoin dominance around multi-year peaks, it’s important to treat BTC as the benchmark. An analyst strategy highlights the use of 2 moving averages, the 20-week SMA ( for value buy zone) and the 50-week SMA ( for bull market support). As long as BTC holds above $82.6K, the uptrend is intact. A dip to $93K–$95K should be treated as a high-probability buy zone, not a panic moment. A core BTC position is critical for long-term positioning. 2. Altcoins: Consolidation = Opportunity: Altcoins have spent over 1300 days consolidating below their all-time highs. However, dominance trends suggest they’re not ready to lead. The altseason signal is weak, and ETH’s brief surge hasn’t translated into broader movement. Focus should remain on high-conviction sector leaders like $ETH, $SOL, $TAO, and $PEPE, all of which have defined buy zones. Avoiding low caps and meme coins unless paired with solid momentum would be crucial.

No, it is advisable not to, as the market is still BTC-dominant, and the Altseason Index is low (22/100). What is the best buy zone for Bitcoin right now? Watch for a dip into the $93K–$95K zone, near the 20-week SMA.

2025-06-05T07:00:10,"Bitcoin’s Key Investors Double Down, Buy Another 79,000 BTC","On-chain data shows the large Bitcoin investors have added to their holdings in the past week, a sign that could be bullish for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Investors With 10 To 10,000 BTC Have Added To Their Holdings In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 BTC investors. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total number of tokens that a particular wallet group is carrying right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin ATH Fails To Hype Retail—Demand Is Actually Down Addresses or investors are placed into these cohorts based on the size of their balance. For example, the 1 to 10 coins group includes all holders owning between 1 and 10 tokens of the cryptocurrency. In the context of the current discussion, the groups lying inside the 10 to 10,000 BTC range are of interest. This wide range includes some of the key holders of the sector like the sharks and whales. These investors own significant holdings, so their behavior can often be worth keeping an eye on. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Supply Distribution of the 10 to 10,000 BTC holders over the last few months: As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin supply held by the 10 to 10,000 BTC investors has registered a significant jump over the past week, implying this group has purchased a net number of coins. More specifically, the members of the cohort have collectively added 79,244 BTC to their wallets in this period. At the current exchange rate, this amount converts to a whopping $8.3 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin 3–5 Year Holders Slow Selloff—Waiting for Higher Prices? From the chart, it’s visible that this accumulation from the key investors has arrived while BTC has been going down after forming a new all-time high (ATH). This could be a potential indication that these holders still believe in the rally and see this drawdown as just a dip opportunity. That said, the 10 to 10,000 range is a bit wide, so while it does include the big-money investors, it also mixes up their behavior with some of the less-significant hands. Fortunately for Bitcoin, it would appear that the whales (1,000 to 10,000 BTC) agree with this trend of buying, as the chart shared by analyst Ali Martinez implies. As displayed in the graph, the whales of the cryptocurrency have added around 30,000 tokens to their holdings during the past few days, meaning that it’s not just the mid-sized hands buying this dip. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $105,200, down over 2% in the last seven days.

2025-06-05T06:55:06,"What to Expect in Bitcoin Price in the Next Three Months, What to Watch Out For?","QCP, one of the leading analysis companies in cryptocurrency markets, has published its market report today. While unexpectedly strong employment data increased risk appetite, eyes turned to the critical non-farm employment data to be released on Friday. While the upward movement in the US stock markets is drawing attention, the S&P 500 index is gradually advancing towards 6,000 points, a psychologically important level. According to the analyst firm, stable nonfarm payrolls data will strengthen the Fed's rhetoric about the resilience of the labor market and increase expectations that interest rates will remain steady. According to QCP’s analysis, on the trade front, markets are focused on the upcoming talks between the US and China. This cautious wait is also reflected in the crypto market. While Bitcoin’s short-term volatility has declined, spot prices are trading sideways in the $105,000 band. One-month implied volatility has fallen below 40%. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Adds a Surprise Altcoin to its Listing Roadmap Bitcoin continues to trade in a narrow price range, while the low open interest and the normalization of the skew indicate that the market is indecisive about the direction. Since May, the volatility curve has flattened, especially in the medium and long term. This situation parallels the decline in the VIX index and causes some investors to take long volatility positions. In particular, the purchase of the September term $130,000 call option with 47 percent volatility reveals a partial increase expectation for the third quarter. According to QCP, the third quarter could be more challenging. While the effects of customs duties are expected to be reflected in macroeconomic data, uncertainties about the fiscal package called the “Big Beautiful Bill (BBB)” and the debt ceiling could cause volatility. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T06:51:32,"Bitcoin Sees Surge in Profit-Taking and Whale Accumulation Amid ETF Outflows","The recent all-time high Bitcoin achieved in its market has sent ripples of fresh activity across the crypto scene. Those who thought the wave of profit-taking seen in September and October was the peak of that wave were mistaken. Bitcoin ETF inflows had finally returned after long being absent, and now that trend is in reverse with leading ETFs experiencing outflows. With prices moving to unprecedented heights, the typical Bitcoin investor is watching their stake ascend into profitable territory—with coins now locked in at an average profit of 16%. Historically, the average trading day has offered fewer than 8% of trading days that have been more profitable for investors. That signals a shift. Not all market participants are piling in, but the ones who are seem to be taking advantage of the price movement and securing profitable exits. Profit-Taking Begins as Market Reaches Overbought Levels The recent surge in Bitcoin’s value has prompted an increased amount of profit-taking among investors. According to blockchain data, the average Bitcoin that changed hands carried a gain of 16% as of last week. That means a lot of people who have held onto their coins are finally cashing in after many months of accumulation. And this profit-taking, by our estimate, puts today’s trading environment among the top 8% of all days in Bitcoin’s history in terms of investor gains. The recent #Bitcoin ATH breakout has led to a notable uptick in profits locked in, with the average coin capturing a +16% profit. Fewer than 8% of trading days have been more profitable for investors, suggesting a meaningful transition into profit-taking activity is underway. pic.twitter.com/3Fz1A6Ccis — glassnode (@glassnode) June 3, 2025 Profits taken at such high realized levels tend to put downward pressure on prices, so it’s no surprise to see local price corrections occurring after such a big move. Our earlier work has shown that when overheated markets experience this kind of profit-taking activity, they typically cool off for a bit before they’re potentially able to make new highs. Even so, the overall mood is still quite positive. The long-term case for investing in Bitcoin continues to pull in backing from both institutions and individuals, even as those who trade in it for short-term gains have just spent a few days adjusting their positions. Whales and Mid-Sized Holders Step Up Accumulation Even with the recent profit-taking surge, crucial Bitcoin investors are sticking around. Indeed, wallets that hold between 10 and 10,000 BTC have seen substantial inflows in the past week. They now total 151,820 on the Bitcoin network, and these accreting wallets have collectively added around 79,244 BTC over just the last seven days, which breaks down to an average of over 11,321 coins per day. There are now 151,820 wallets holding between 10 to 10,000 Bitcoin. These key stakeholders have aggressively been accumulating over the past week, collectively adding 79,244 $BTC (11,321 coins accumulated per day). pic.twitter.com/jWUtqOFaPO — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 3, 2025 This assertive accumulation highlights that strategic investors are still confident in the market and are positioning themselves ahead of potential future market changes. These wallets—often seen as sorts of ecosystem stakeholders—act as early indicators of investor bullishness. Significantly, certain of the biggest whales in the network have seized this moment to load up on Bitcoin. Just in the last 96 hours alone, these high-net-worth entities have bought more than 30,000 BTC. They seem to be on a buying spree, perhaps indicating that they view the recent all-time high (ATH) as a market high not. Rather, it looks like they see the recent price action as a further step toward price discovery. Whale accumulation at this scale has historically been a powerful signal of long-term market strength, often occurring just before or during major upward movements. Their continued accumulation, even as ETFs show signs of weakening demand, hints at a possible divergence between retail or institutional ETF flows and direct, on-chain holdings. Some of the biggest whales on the network have bought over 30,000 #Bitcoin $BTC in the last 96 hours! pic.twitter.com/Z0Ujszhdnc — Ali (@ali_charts) June 3, 2025 ETF Outflows Hit $1.21 Billion Amid Uncertainty Unlike on-chain Bitcoin accumulation, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are experiencing the opposite trajectory. Over the last three days of trading, the U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs have seen an unprecedented $1.21 billion in net outflows. That’s the largest volume of capital that has exited the Bitcoin ETF market since mid-March. The current outflows could be a combination of profit-taking by investors, general economic uncertainty, or perhaps a shift back to direct Bitcoin holdings and other crypto assets. Bitcoin's ETF's have seen significant money outflowing for three straight days now. There has been a total of $1.21B in net outflows, marking the first time we've seen $1B or more moving out of ETF's since the 2nd week of March. pic.twitter.com/Gz4cj60Dh1 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) June 4, 2025 Before this year, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs had been tepid. But ETF providers had driven significant recent inflows into Bitcoin itself, bringing the price up toward recent highs. When those inflows began to reverse in late August and early September, it marked the first time in a while that institutional repositioning. Either way, this is a reported example of Bitcoin ETFs reversing recent inflows and going into outflows. Yet, some analysts say that the ETF outflows might be temporary and are linked to bigger financial market adjustments and not necessarily to any dwindling confidence in Bitcoin. They point to the fact that some major holders have been buying up Bitcoin aggressively just lately (and that on-chain fundamentals are still looking pretty strong) as evidence that the current development is a healthy, rebalancing state of affairs and not the opening act of some larger downturn. Conclusion Bitcoin has recently hit a new all-time high, and this has set the stage for something potentially major in the market. Traders have taken this opportunity to book some profits. But what has been far more interesting is the behavior of long-term holders and larger investors, who seem to be the very same individuals that have largely been absent from this market since its last high in late 2021. Long-term investors and notable “whales” in this space have been steadily buying, which signals that these entities might have a fortified belief in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Blending caution with conviction, the current landscape has Bitcoin on the verge of a new chapter. Three forces shape this next sequence for Bitcoin. First is reduced supply on exchanges—an unfriendly development for sellers. Second is expanding institutional adoption, with big players like Blackrock banging down the door to get in on the action. Third is growing global awareness, with everything from Google searches to nationwide protests in your face inducing even more people to notice Bitcoin.

The drop comes as concerns over U.S. trade tariffs and a weaker economy weigh on investor confidence. After reaching record highs in late May, Bitcoin has struggled to move higher. Recent profit-taking has also added pressure, leading to questions about whether the bull run is slowing down or just taking a break. In a recent interview, crypto expert and “Wolf of All Streets” host Scott Melker confirmed that Bitcoin is still in a bull market, fueled by unprecedented institutional interest. Melker emphasized that even amid global volatility and rising bond yields, Bitcoin’s strength signals a major shift in how investors view the asset. Top 4 Catalysts Fueling Bitcoin’s 2025 Rally When asked about the most impactful developments driving Bitcoin’s adoption and price surge in 2025, Melker ranked the following: Bitcoin Spot ETF Approvals – The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s pro-Bitcoin stance marked a pivotal moment. Melker called Fink’s public support a “turning point,” highlighting how major institutions now view Bitcoin as a credible and strategic asset. Donald Trump’s Pro-Crypto Pivot – The U.S. president’s public embrace of crypto and NFTs gave the space significant political backing. His influence, Melker said, created a “massive catalyst” for mainstream attention and regulatory momentum. Sovereign Wealth Fund Inflows – Investments from the Middle East and other regions are just beginning, with Melker predicting that a 1% allocation from global sovereign funds could trigger a massive surge due to Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Corporate Treasury Adoption – While not new, companies following MicroStrategy’s lead in holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets continue to validate Bitcoin’s utility as a hedge and long-term asset. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025: $150K to $300K? Looking ahead, Melker predicts Bitcoin could climb conservatively to $130K–$150K , with a more optimistic ceiling of $230K to $300K this cycle. While cautious due to prior overestimations, he noted that Bitcoin is already trading above $100K, making further gains feasible. “To go to $150K is a rounding error from here,” said Melker, pointing out that current ETF flows and institutional accumulation are likely to continue. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Chamath Palihapitiya Predicts Ripple, Coinbase, and Stripe Will Fight for USDC Dominance , Melker also questioned the sustainability of the traditional four-year crypto cycle, suggesting that drawdowns may now be smaller , with Bitcoin becoming a more stable and institutionalized asset. Rather than sharp 80% crashes followed by massive rallies, he sees the market evolving into a “grind up and dip” cycle—gradually increasing over time with less extreme volatility. Time To Buy Bitcoin? While acknowledging the “sell in May and go away” mantra from traditional markets, Melker advised long-term investors to keep buying: “Buy in May, buy in June, buy in July,” he said. “Use the dips to dollar-cost average—this is a long game.”Despite the seasonal lull, Melker believes Bitcoin’s downside is increasingly limited , especially compared to stocks, and ETF investors are more likely to hold than trade on daily price movements. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T06:38:25,"XRP Primed To Move Higher As Chinese Company Plans $300 Million XRP Treasury Plan","China-based Webus International (WETO) submitted a Form 6-K with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, setting the stage for a potential corporate treasury based on the Ripple-linked XRP token. Foreign private issuers with securities traded on US exchanges use Form 6-K to disclose material updates to U.S. investors. According to the filing, the Nasdaq-listed automotive and hospitality company is exploring a financing strategy of up to $300 million to build an XRP reserve to support international payment solutions. Specifically, Webus plans to incorporate Ripple’s blockchain-based payment network into its business to streamline cross-border transactions and bolster transparency across its travel and hospitality booking services. The firm teamed up with investment advisor Samara Alpha Management to facilitate the creation of its XRP treasury, as per the filing. XRP is changing hands at $2.21 as of press time, down roughly 1.6% over the past 24 hours but up 320.5% over the past year, CoinMarketCap data shows. The Ripple-affiliated coin rocketed after President Donald Trump’s election victory, almost reaching its all-time high price milestone from January 2017 in the process. The filing comes as a growing number of public companies have also begun stacking cryptocurrencies in their treasuries, emulating Michael Saylor-led software firm Strategy’s push to amass over $60 billion in Bitcoin over the past few years. Like Webus, several companies are also increasingly imitating Strategy’s playbook and adapting it for Ripple’s XRP, indicating increasing interest from corporations in the industry’s fourth-largest token by market capitalization. Earlier in May, Florida-based healthcare logistics company Wellgistics announced that it would add millions of dollars worth of XRP to its balance sheet and adopt it for payments infrastructure. And last week, Nasdaq-listed energy firm VivoPower International disclosed plans to create a $121 million XRP treasury.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-to-move-higher-as-chinese-company-plans-300-million-xrp-treasury-plan/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP","Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T06:30:30,"Trump Family To ‘Legally Challenge’ Magic Eden’s ‘Official’ Crypto Wallet – Report","Amid the controversial announcement of an “official” TRUMP crypto wallet, the Trump family is allegedly considering taking legal action against the project for using the likeness of the US President. Trump Family Denies Crypto Wallet Involvement On Tuesday, the crypto community was taken by storm after the announcement of an upcoming “official” Trump crypto wallet by non-fungible Token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden in partnership with the team behind the president’s official memecoin , TRUMP. According to the official website, the wallet will be “the first and only crypto wallet for true Trump fans,” supporting the trade of the TRUMP token and other digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC). Users who join the wallet’s waitlist will reportedly have an opportunity to share $1 million worth of the memecoin’s rewards. Magic Eden’s CEO, Jack Lu, confirmed the news, affirming that with the project, “DeFi can finally support seamless UX and regulatory clarity is finally allowing crypto to thrive in the US. The time to take big bets & onboard mainstream is now.” Nonetheless, the Trump family distanced itself from the wallet, with the President’s sons taking to social media to clarify the family’s involvement. Eric Trump said in a post that he knows “nothing about this project,” despite running The Trump Organization. He affirmed that the Magic Eden crypto wallet “is not authorized” by the Trump Family, warning their team to be “extremely careful” using the Trump name in an unauthorized project that is unknown to their organization. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr also denied any involvement with the wallet and announced that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is working on launching an official wallet soon. The New York Times reported that Eric Trump “escalated the dispute,” affirming that the Trump family would “legally challenge the creation” of the unofficial wallet in a series of texts to the news media outlet. “There is no deal for this product,” he stated, reaffirming that “There is no agreement for this product. It has not been approved.” Since then, the “TrumpWalletApp” X account has been suspended, despite reportedly having a Magic Eden verification badge. A ‘Bizarre’ Miscommunication? Journalist and podcast host Eleanor Terret shared a response from Magic Eden’s team regarding the claims of being the “official” wallet. In the Tuesday statement , the NFT marketplace affirmed that “It is the official $TRUMP Wallet carrying the official Trump branding and IP. Magic Eden has historically worked with the $TRUMP project to support their prior NFT launches and are excited that we’re working on a much larger project now with $TRUMP Wallet.” Molly White, who first reported the story, called the announcement an “absolute chaos,” noting that “Trump memecoin team is Fight Fight Fight LLC (Bill Zanker), though the Trump Organization-affiliated CIC Digital also holds a substantial quantity of tokens.” To White, “It seems like the breakdown is between the Zanker team and the Trump sons, but pretty incredible they claim never to have even heard of it.” Similarly, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, called the incident “a very bizarre situation,” suggesting that the most likely explanation is a miscommunication or misunderstanding. He theorized that the TRUMP token team possibly didn’t need approval from or to inform CIC Digital or The Trump organization to launch the project, which could explain the Trump family’s remarks about the wallet: Depending on the deal The Trump Organization negotiated here, Fight Fight Fight LLC might be trying to use its connection to $TRUMP (which it seems to have bought for 80% of the supply) to connect Trump to other projects (like this wallet) which only benefit Trump through possible appreciation of $TRUMP. Fight Fight Fight LLC is heavily incentivized to monetize these products other ways since Trump owns 80% of $TRUMP. Schwartz concluded that, “If this is correct, The Trump Organization may be very unhappy with this announcement — especially if they planned to launch their own wallet.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-family-to-legally-challenge-magic-edens-official-crypto-wallet-report/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Crypto News|Crypto wallet|Eric Trump|Magic Eden|Ripple CTO|The Trump Organization|Trump|TRUMP crypto wallet|Trump memecoin|TRUMP token|TRUMP Wallet|TRUMPUSDT|US President Donald Trump|WLFI",cryptocompare
