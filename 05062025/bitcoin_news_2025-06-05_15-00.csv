2025-06-05T12:50:52,"Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Bluebird Mining Makes Bold Shift Using Gold Revenue","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: Bluebird Mining Makes Bold Shift Using Gold Revenue In a move that bridges the gap between traditional industry and the digital asset world, Bluebird Mining Ventures, a publicly listed UK mining company, recently announced a significant shift in its financial approach. The company, known for its gold mining projects, is set to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy , leveraging revenue generated from its gold operations to acquire and hold Bitcoin (BTC) on its balance sheet. This announcement, made via the company’s official X account, signals a growing trend of companies exploring digital assets as a component of their corporate finance and investment strategies. For a gold mining company to pivot towards Bitcoin in this manner is particularly noteworthy, given gold’s historical status as a premier store of value. What is Bluebird Mining’s Bold Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Bluebird Mining Ventures operates primarily in the gold sector. Their core business involves extracting gold, a tangible asset valued globally for centuries. The traditional path for a mining company’s revenue is reinvestment in operations, debt reduction, dividends, or holding fiat currency reserves. However, Bluebird is charting a different course. Their new Bitcoin treasury strategy involves allocating a portion of the income derived from their gold sales towards purchasing Bitcoin. This means that as they mine and sell gold, instead of keeping all the proceeds in traditional cash or short-term investments, they will be converting some of that value into the leading cryptocurrency. This approach is a form of corporate treasury management that seeks to diversify asset holdings beyond traditional fiat and potentially hedge against inflation or currency devaluation. It’s a strategic decision that reflects a belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and growth asset. How Gold Mining Revenue Fuels Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The connection between gold mining revenue and institutional Bitcoin adoption is fascinating. Gold has long been considered a safe-haven asset and a hedge against economic uncertainty. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by many as ‘digital gold’ – a scarce, decentralized asset with similar properties, but with the advantages of digital transferability and a verifiable, fixed supply cap (21 million coins). For a company whose business is centered around extracting one store of value (gold) to invest in another (Bitcoin) using the revenue from the first, it creates a unique synergy. It suggests that even players deeply entrenched in traditional safe assets see value and potential in the emerging digital asset class. This move by Bluebird Mining could serve as a case study for other traditional commodity-based companies considering similar strategies. It demonstrates a potential pathway for businesses with significant physical asset revenue streams to gain exposure to digital assets, contributing to the broader trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption . The Mechanics: How Does a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Work? Implementing a corporate Bitcoin strategy involves more than just buying BTC. Companies need to consider several operational and financial aspects: Custody: How will the Bitcoin be securely stored? This requires robust security protocols, potentially using multi-signature wallets or engaging with institutional-grade custodians. Accounting: How will Bitcoin holdings be accounted for on the balance sheet? Current accounting standards often treat Bitcoin as an intangible asset, which can lead to volatility in reported earnings due to impairment rules if the price drops below the purchase cost. Purchasing: How will large amounts of Bitcoin be acquired? This might involve over-the-counter (OTC) desks or executing trades on regulated exchanges to minimize market impact. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets in their operating jurisdictions. Risk Management: Developing strategies to manage price volatility risk, security risks, and potential regulatory changes. For Bluebird Mining, integrating these considerations into their existing financial and operational framework, which is built around physical asset management and sales (gold), will be key to the success of their corporate Bitcoin strategy . Benefits and Challenges of Holding Bitcoin in Treasury Adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy comes with potential upsides and significant risks. Companies weigh these carefully: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Like gold, Bitcoin is seen by many as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its fixed supply. Store of Value: Its scarcity and global accessibility make it an attractive potential long-term store of value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a traditional treasury portfolio can offer diversification benefits, as its price movements may not be perfectly correlated with traditional assets. Potential Appreciation: If Bitcoin’s value continues to grow, the company’s treasury holdings could increase significantly. Attracting Investors: A forward-thinking approach to treasury management, particularly involving digital assets, might appeal to a new class of investors interested in both traditional sectors and cryptocurrency. Key Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its significant price swings, which can impact the reported value of treasury holdings and create financial uncertainty. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still developing globally, which could introduce unforeseen challenges. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of digital assets requires extremely robust cybersecurity measures to prevent theft or loss. Accounting Treatment: Current accounting rules can make holding Bitcoin challenging for public companies, potentially leading to non-cash impairment charges that affect earnings reports. Public Perception: While increasingly accepted, Bitcoin still carries some stigma or misunderstanding for traditional investors. Bluebird Mining’s decision indicates they believe the potential benefits outweigh these challenges, or that they have developed strategies to mitigate the risks effectively. Examples: Who Else is Adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? Bluebird Mining is not the first company to implement a corporate Bitcoin strategy , but they are a notable addition, particularly from the traditional mining sector. The trend was significantly popularized by companies like: MicroStrategy: Led by Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has been a pioneer and arguably the most aggressive corporate adopter, holding billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Tesla: Elon Musk’s company famously purchased a significant amount of Bitcoin, though they have also sold some holdings since. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company has also invested in Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury. These examples highlight that companies across various sectors – from software (MicroStrategy) and automotive/tech (Tesla) to financial services (Block) – are exploring or have adopted a Bitcoin treasury strategy . Bluebird Mining’s entry adds the traditional resource sector to this growing list, further demonstrating the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Actionable Insights: What This Means for Investors? Bluebird Mining’s adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy provides several insights for investors: Cross-Industry Adoption is Growing: This move reinforces the idea that Bitcoin’s appeal is broadening beyond the tech and finance sectors, penetrating traditional industries like gold mining . Potential for Other Miners: If successful, this strategy could inspire other mining or commodity companies to consider similar approaches, potentially increasing corporate demand for Bitcoin. Understanding Company Strategy: Investors in Bluebird Mining now need to understand not just the dynamics of gold markets but also the implications of holding a volatile digital asset like Bitcoin. The company’s performance will be influenced by both gold prices and BTC prices. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: This case further validates the narrative of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset for corporations, alongside cash, bonds, and other traditional holdings. For those interested in the intersection of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies, Bluebird Mining’s strategy offers a compelling case study to watch. Conclusion: A Golden Bridge to Digital Assets Bluebird Mining Ventures’ decision to use gold mining revenue for a Bitcoin treasury strategy is a landmark development. It signifies a forward-thinking approach that leverages the value generated from a traditional, tangible asset (gold) to invest in a modern, digital asset (Bitcoin). This move contributes significantly to the narrative of institutional Bitcoin adoption and highlights the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate component of corporate finance. While challenges remain, Bluebird’s bold step could pave the way for other companies in traditional sectors to explore the potential benefits of holding digital assets. It’s a fascinating evolution in corporate treasury management, demonstrating how even industries built on centuries-old foundations are beginning to embrace the future of finance.

2025-06-05T12:49:38,"Top 3 Altcoins Whales Are Buying Right Now","The post Top 3 Altcoins Whales Are Buying Right Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto field is poised for a potential rebound, major altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) are becoming choice’s of major crypto whales. The smart money’s move for these assets, is fiercely hinting that a market resurgence in June, seems more likely then ever. Similarly, the top crypto BTC also showered optimism, as its spot ETFs faced three consecutive days of outflows, and data from Santiment shows that whales have a worth of over $8.3 billion, just last week. Meanwhile, its strong correlation with the Global M2 money supply has increased experts’ conviction for its price to hit $150,000. These growing bullish factors suggests that the next crypto sector’s brewing alt season could be even more parabolic than previous cycles. As, BTC aside, Whales are stacking altcoins in anticipation of a rally. In late May, the sector saw a slowdown, but this dip has not deterred major investors, who are seizing the opportunity to accumulate promising altcoins. Keep reading as crypto whales are setting the stage for a significant shift as we have moved already into June. Ethereum (ETH) According to data from Lookonchain , a crypto whale utilized Galaxy Digital’s OTC wallet to obtain 108,278 ETH, amounting to $283 million. Before several hours of this move, this whale had already withdrawn 89,000 ETH, amounting to $233 million. Now, all combined 139,476 ETH amounting to $365 Million in total sits in a wallet address “0x0b26”. This move is not any reckless move, the way address moved his assets clearly showed a well-devised accumulation strategy that has been made for future increase in Ethereum’s price . Additionally, on the daily chart, the ETH price is above major EMAs and seems the Fibonacci 50% zone is set to break in June for the Fibonacci 78.6% and 100% targets (Q4 2024’s High). Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) Apart from the second most dominant crypto, which has attracted significant attention from Crypto whales, is Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). According to data from Lookonchain , three whales purchased 9.2 million FARTCOIN, amounting to $9.5 million, showing a highly optimistic vision for FARTCOIN’s growth potential. At the time of writing, FARTCOIN is trading at $0.8910, down 5.7% over the past 24 hours. However, some traders remain quite optimistic after knowing the whale’s activity, the long-term price of this meme could go to the Fibonacci 100% level around ATH $2.7321, but a crash would lead to its lowest demand zone. Hyperliquid (HYPE) The recent surge in HYPE is due to the hype around a trader named James Wynn on Hyperliquid and the BINANCE listing announcement. Amid this optimism, data from OnchainLens highlights that one crypto whale spent an amount worth $6 million over a consistent three days to buy over 170,000 HYPE. Taking into account all bullish factors of recent times, the participation of large investors has increased, which indicates strong confidence in the HYPE price’s long-term potential. Per the Fibonacci, if ATH is broken, then $58 is likely next. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Bitcoin’s price reacted immediately with a surge of $1,000, taking it from $104,500 to $105,500. The European Central Bank cut rates and further widened a gap with the Federal Reserve that has fueled President Trump’s calls for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to follow suit https://t.co/Lq7suXwqxJ — The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) June 5, 2025 The current interest rates in the Eurozone have dropped to 2%, the lowest level since early 2023. This comes amid a slowing of inflation in the region and despite the threat of tariffs by US President Donald Trump. This is the eighth rate cut from the ECB, which is a stark contrast to what the US Federal Reserve is doing. Recall that the US central bank lowered the rates twice in late 2024, but has maintained them unchanged ever since. This has prompted US President Donald Trump to urge Fed Chair Powell to start cutting the rates, otherwise the risk of a macro crisis grows. Just minutes after the ECB news went live today, BTC reacted with an immediate uptick that drove it higher by a grand as the chart below demonstrates. BTCUSD.

Here Are the Details","According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine, UK publicly traded gold mining company Bluebird Mining Ventures is taking a significant step into the digital asset space by announcing plans to adopt the Bitcoin treasury strategy. UK-Based Bluebird Mining Ventures Decides to Adopt Bitcoin Treasury Strategy The company said it will begin converting future revenues from its gold mining projects into Bitcoin, signaling a strategic transformation to align with the growing trend of businesses using BTC as a long-term store of value. Bluebird Mining Ventures owns three major gold mining projects — two in South Korea and one in the Philippines — with a combined gold resource of about 1.8 million ounces. The company’s decision reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and global economic uncertainty. By integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury, Bluebird joins a growing list of companies seeking to diversify their balance sheets with tangible assets that provide portability, transparency, and resistance to monetary depreciation. The move is particularly notable given Bluebird’s roots in the traditional commodities sector, and signals that there could be greater convergence between traditional natural resource companies and digital financial infrastructure. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T12:40:52,"Japan Blockchain Investment: SMBC Nikko Backs Hashed Ventures Fund in Pivotal Institutional Move","BitcoinWorld Japan Blockchain Investment: SMBC Nikko Backs Hashed Ventures Fund in Pivotal Institutional Move Hey crypto enthusiasts and finance watchers! Get ready for some significant news straight out of Japan. We’ve just seen a major move that signals how traditional finance giants are increasingly looking towards the future of digital assets and blockchain technology. This isn’t just any news; it’s about a heavyweight player making a strategic bet in the evolving world of crypto venture capital. Let’s dive into what this Japan blockchain investment means. A Major Japanese Financial Group Makes a Pivotal Move So, what exactly happened? SMBC Nikko Securities, which is a key subsidiary of the massive Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG), one of Japan’s largest financial conglomerates, has officially invested in a prominent blockchain venture capital firm. This isn’t a small, experimental fund; they’ve backed Hashed Ventures’ Hashed Venture Fund III. Think of SMFG as a pillar of the Japanese financial system, managing vast amounts of capital and involved in banking, securities, leasing, and more. For a group of this stature to put capital into a dedicated blockchain fund is a powerful statement. While the specific amount of the SMBC Nikko investment hasn’t been publicly disclosed, the fact that it happened at all is the headline here. It shows a tangible commitment to exploring and potentially capitalizing on the growth within the blockchain ecosystem, moving beyond just observing from the sidelines. Understanding the Hashed Ventures Fund Now, who is Hashed Ventures, and what makes their fund attractive to a traditional financial giant like SMBC Nikko? Hashed is a well-regarded venture capital firm with a strong focus on the blockchain and Web3 space. They’ve been active players, identifying and supporting startups building the next generation of decentralized applications, infrastructure, and protocols. The Hashed Ventures fund , specifically Fund III in this case, is designed to deploy capital into promising projects within this rapidly expanding sector. Their expertise lies in navigating the complexities of the crypto market, understanding emerging trends like DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), gaming, and underlying blockchain infrastructure. For SMBC Nikko, investing in a specialized fund like Hashed Venture Fund III offers a way to gain exposure to this high-growth, albeit volatile, market segment without having to build the internal expertise from scratch. It’s a common strategy for traditional institutions looking to dip their toes into new asset classes: partner with or invest in those already deeply embedded in the space. The Growing Wave of Institutional Crypto Adoption This development isn’t happening in a vacuum. It’s part of a broader, accelerating trend: institutional crypto adoption . We’ve seen banks, asset managers, corporations, and even governments around the world start to engage with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in various ways. This ranges from offering crypto-related services to clients, investing directly in digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, building blockchain infrastructure, or, as in this case, investing in venture funds focused on the space. Why the sudden interest? Institutions are recognizing the potential of blockchain to revolutionize finance, improve efficiency, and create new investment opportunities. They also face pressure from clients and competitors who are already moving into the space. While retail interest often drives headlines, institutional capital brings significant resources, legitimacy, and long-term potential to the market. The SMBC Nikko investment is a clear indicator that this trend is not slowing down and is reaching into major economies like Japan. What This Japan Blockchain Investment Signifies Let’s unpack the significance of this particular Japan blockchain investment . Firstly, it’s a strong vote of confidence from a major traditional financial player in the future of blockchain technology and the crypto ecosystem. SMBC Nikko isn’t just exploring; they are putting capital at risk through a dedicated fund investment. Secondly, it highlights the increasing convergence between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) or Web3. These worlds, once seen as entirely separate, are finding points of connection and collaboration. Thirdly, it positions Japan, which has sometimes been seen as cautious in the crypto space despite being an early adopter, as a market where major financial institutions are actively participating in the ecosystem’s growth. This could potentially pave the way for more investments and collaborations between traditional Japanese firms and crypto-native companies. Potential Benefits and Implications: Increased Legitimacy: An investment from a firm like SMBC Nikko lends credibility to the blockchain space and Hashed Ventures specifically. Capital Inflow: More institutional capital means more resources available for promising blockchain startups to build and innovate. Network Effects: Hashed Ventures gains access to the vast network and expertise of SMBC Nikko and SMFG, potentially opening doors for portfolio companies. Future Collaboration Potential: This could be a precursor to deeper partnerships or SMBC Nikko exploring direct blockchain applications within their own business. Boost for the Japanese Ecosystem: Encourages other Japanese firms to consider similar moves, fostering growth within the local blockchain scene. Challenges and Considerations for a Japanese Financial Group Crypto Move While the investment is positive news, it’s important to consider the potential challenges and nuances involved when a large Japanese financial group crypto investment occurs. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain is still evolving globally, and particularly in Japan, which has a relatively clear but strict framework. Future regulatory changes could impact the performance of the fund or the operations of the portfolio companies. The crypto market itself is known for its volatility, which can pose risks to investment returns. Furthermore, integrating the culture and operational models of traditional finance with the fast-paced, often less formal world of crypto startups can present challenges. However, by investing through a specialized VC fund like Hashed, SMBC Nikko is mitigating some of these direct operational risks while still gaining exposure. Key Considerations: Regulatory Environment: Staying ahead of potential shifts in Japanese and global crypto regulations. Market Volatility: Managing the inherent risks associated with investments in a volatile asset class. Due Diligence: The importance of rigorous evaluation of blockchain projects by the fund managers. Long-Term Vision: This is likely a long-term play, and returns may take time to materialize. Actionable Insights for Readers What can you take away from this development? If you’re interested in the intersection of traditional finance and crypto, keep a close eye on major financial institutions like SMBC Nikko and SMFG. Their strategic moves provide valuable insights into how the mainstream financial world views and is approaching the blockchain space. Monitor the types of projects that Hashed Ventures Fund III invests in, as this can indicate areas of anticipated growth within the ecosystem. This Japan blockchain investment is a signal that despite market fluctuations, the underlying technology and its potential continue to attract serious capital from powerful traditional players. It reinforces the narrative that blockchain and crypto are becoming increasingly integrated into the global financial landscape. Conclusion: A Significant Step Forward The investment by SMBC Nikko Securities, a subsidiary of the influential SMFG, into Hashed Venture Fund III is a significant milestone. It underscores the growing confidence among major traditional financial institutions in the potential of blockchain technology and the digital asset ecosystem. This strategic move by a prominent Japanese financial group crypto investment vehicle not only provides valuable capital to the space but also adds a layer of legitimacy that can encourage further institutional participation. As the lines between traditional finance and decentralized technology continue to blur, investments like the SMBC Nikko investment in the Hashed Ventures fund highlight the irreversible trend of institutional crypto adoption . This Japan blockchain investment is a clear signal that the future of finance will undoubtedly involve the innovations being built in the blockchain world.

2025-06-05T12:24:43,"The $10 Investment That Could Make You Rich: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Changes Everything","The post The $10 Investment That Could Make You Rich: Bitcoin Solaris Mobile Mining Changes Everything appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the crypto world, fortunes are made by those who recognize innovation before the crowd. Bitcoin was once a curiosity, selling for under a dollar. Today, it’s a cornerstone of wealth. But as its accessibility fades with its rising price, a new opportunity has arrived—Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S)—and it’s changing the game by allowing everyday users to mine directly from their phones. A single $10 move into this ecosystem today could echo the wealth-building effects of Bitcoin’s early days. Why Bitcoin Solaris Is Turning Heads Bitcoin Solaris isn’t chasing trends—it’s building a new infrastructure for financial independence. At its core is a hybrid blockchain design that merges the tried-and-true security of Proof-of-Work with the blazing scalability of Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This unique two-layer system ensures both decentralization and high-speed performance, processing up to 100,000 TPS with 2-second finality. The key innovation, however, is its focus on accessible mining. No warehouses, no expensive GPUs—just your phone. With the upcoming Solaris Nova App, anyone can start mining BTC-S with a tap. Headline Features Powering the Revolution 1. The Solaris Nova App (Upcoming) This isn’t just another mobile wallet. It’s a full mining suite, accessible from mobile, desktop, or browser. It features: One-click mining with adaptive power use Built-in secure wallet Biometric login and remote wipe Real-time analytics and performance reports Customizable settings to fine-tune user control 2. Mining Power Marketplace This upcoming marketplace enables users to rent or sell computational power with the help of smart contracts, performance-based rewards, and real-time task distribution. It opens passive income streams even for those who don’t mine directly. 3. Universal Device Compatibility From high-end GPUs and ASICs to standard laptops and Android/iOS smartphones, Bitcoin Solaris optimizes mining performance based on your device’s specs. 4. Community-Centric Gamification Mining is no longer a solo grind. Earn achievements, climb leaderboards, and participate in community forums—all built directly into the app to encourage growth, education, and consistent engagement. The Future of Decentralization Is Already Mining—Start with BTC-S A Mobile Mining Engine That Scales Behind the scenes, BTC-S is powered by a meticulously engineered dual-consensus architecture: Base Layer: SHA-256 PoW mechanism, 5-minute blocks, built for energy-efficient security. Solaris Layer: High-speed DPoS layer with 21 validators, dynamic block sizes, and 15-second blocks. Validator rotation and state anchoring between layers ensure robust synchronization and security while maintaining low fees and high throughput. The Referral Program That Rewards Everyone Bitcoin Solaris has introduced a double-sided referral system where both the referrer and the referred receive 5% bonuses in BTC-S during the presale. It’s a smart, community-driven mechanism that fuels both growth and participation—fitting perfectly with the project’s inclusive vision. Audited, Transparent, and Ready for Growth Security and transparency are non-negotiable in today’s market. That’s why Bitcoin Solaris has undergone audits by both Cyberscope and FreshCoins, with KYC verification completed through FreshCoins as well. These steps ensure the code is clean, the project is trustworthy, and your investment is protected. Plus, with an active and growing community, users can stay up to date by joining the Telegram group or following their X account . The Presale That’s Blowing Up We’re currently in Phase 6 of the BTC-S presale, with the price at just $6—and climbing to $7 next. The final launch price? $20. That’s a potential 1,900% return, not counting the daily mining income. With over 3 million dollars raised and more than 11,000 users already on board, this is shaping up to be one of the shortest and most explosive presales in recent memory. And with only around 8 weeks left, timing is critical. Bitcoin Solaris Is the New Blueprint Crypto has always promised decentralization and equal opportunity, but Bitcoin Solaris is delivering it. You don’t need to be an early miner with thousands in hardware. You just need a phone, internet, and the will to participate. The upcoming Solaris Nova App isn’t just about mining—it’s about rethinking how wealth is distributed in Web3. When you combine scalable infrastructure, mobile-first mining, community features, gamification, and audited transparency—you don’t just have a project. You have a movement. And sometimes, it only takes $10 to be on the right side of history.

2025-06-05T12:19:03,"Bitcoin Ban in Europe? EDPB Guidelines Could Outlaw BTC Over GDPR Conflict","The post Bitcoin Ban in Europe? EDPB Guidelines Could Outlaw BTC Over GDPR Conflict appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A major regulatory storm is brewing in Europe, and it could put Bitcoin users in legal jeopardy. A recent consultation by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) could potentially ban Bitcoin across Europe , according to Alexandre Statchtchenko, co-founder of French crypto exchange Paymium. Why Is the EDPB Targeting Bitcoin? The EDPB’s draft guidelines argue that Bitcoin public keys qualify as personal data , making every BTC transaction subject to GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) . Because a public key can indirectly identify a person, it triggers compliance obligations, including the right to data deletion —something fundamentally incompatible with blockchain’s immutability. This clash between Bitcoin’s unalterable ledger and European privacy laws could make the cryptocurrency illegal to use or operate within EU nations. Alerte réglementaire — Bitcoin risque l’illégalité de fait en Europe Si les Guidelines du Comité Européen de la Protection des Données (EDPB en anglais) sont confirmées dans leur version finale, il n’existera plus aucun usage de Bitcoin 100 % conforme au droit européen. … pic.twitter.com/0N5qrW4kVg — Alexandre 'unhosted' Stachtchenko (@StachAlex) May 5, 2025 Critics Slam the Ban Proposal The guidelines have sparked immediate backlash. Critics argue the EDPB is demanding a “radical solution” without offering a feasible technical pathway for data deletion on blockchain . The committee even admitted that deletion requires an “ad-hoc engineered architecture,” a solution that doesn’t currently exist for Bitcoin. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Donald Trump Accused of Crypto Corruption as CLARITY Act Debate Heats Up , AML vs. Anonymity: A Legal Paradox Statchtchenko highlights the absurdity of the situation, where regulatory demands conflict with each other. The GDPR requires anonymization and deletion of data, but Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) laws prohibit anonymity in financial transactions. In France and other EU countries, anonymous crypto transactions are presumed to be money laundering , placing Bitcoin in a regulatory deadlock. Who’s Involved and What’s Next? The EDPB’s public consultation is open until June 9, 2025 , and it’s attracting attention from across the crypto and Web3 ecosystem. Major industry players and legal experts are expected to voice concerns before the final decision.If the current draft guidelines are adopted without change, Bitcoin could be effectively banned in Europe , leaving millions of users trapped in legal uncertainty. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Usually, mining is done by huge companies with super-powerful computers, so this small miner’s success is a rare and exciting moment that shows anyone can still play a part in the Bitcoin world. But how did this happen? And how often does a solo miner get so lucky? Solo Bitcoin Miner Wins $325,000 On June 4, 2025, a lone Bitcoin miner managed to solve block number 899,826 all by themselves. This lucky miner processed 3,680 transactions and received the full block reward of 3.125 BTC, which is worth around $325,000, plus an extra 0.026 BTC in transaction fees. Usually, it’s very hard for solo miners to win because huge mining farms and pools have so much computer power. These giant mining operations have massive resources, making it tough for someone working alone to compete against the 600+ EH/s network hashrate. Many in the mining space see this as a small win for decentralization, though large pools still dominate. Bitcoin Mining Is Getting Tough for Small Miners Mining Bitcoin isn’t as easy as it used to be. The process has gotten much harder because the network’s difficulty level is now at a record 126.98 trillion . This makes it tough for smaller miners to keep up, especially when big mining companies have more powerful machines. At the same time, Bitcoin’s hashrate, which shows how much computing power is being used, is at its highest level of 842.92 exahashes per second. That’s 40% more than it was just a year ago. This shows how crowded and competitive the Bitcoin mining space has become.

2025-06-05T12:12:43,"Solana Top Meme Coins Ready to Blow: Are Solaxy and Snorter Among Them?","Bluntz, a crypto trader with 319K followers on X, is extremely bullish on SPX6900 (SPX), one of Solana’s top meme coins. The trader has cited the Elliott Wave Theory and expects $SPX to climb up to $2.20, which will double its current price of $1.10 . Keep reading to find out more about his predictions, and why the best meme coins on Solana could be your path to crypto millionaire status. Expert Trader Bullish on Solana Meme Coins $SPX & $WIF According to the the Elliott Wave Theory, the price of an asset moves in identifiable wave patterns in the direction of the overall trend. So, if the overall trend is bullish, which is the case in $SPX, the price will move up in five waves, with the second and fourth waves being small dips for consolidations. Bluntz believes that $SPX has currently only served up the first two waves, with a trending third wave, which usually sees the highest increase in prices, waiting to happen. Interestingly, Bluntz has picked another Solana meme coin, dogwifhat (WIF) , to print its third wave of the Elliot theory and climb up to $1.25 by the end of the fifth wave. $WIF is currently trading around $0.87. After a sluggish Q1, Bluntz says that the ‘real’ altcoin season hasn’t arrived yet, and when it does, it will be meme coins (like $SPX and $WIF) that will lead the momentum. When the real altcoin bid returns, memes are always the strongest. – Bluntz It’s hardly surprising that Bluntz picked two Solana meme coins to lead the next rally. After all, some of the best altcoins to buy are usually Solana-based thanks to the network’s blazing speeds and low fees. Also, just take a look at the top trending cryptos over the last month. Tokens like Kekius Maximus and KoKoK The Roach , which saw triple-digit gains, are all new meme coins on the Solana blockchain. With that in mind, we’ve handpicked three Solana meme coins with the potential to 10x (even 1,000x) your investment in the upcoming altcoin season. 1. SPX6900 ($SPX) – Best Solana Meme Coin on Presale, Building First-Ever Solana L2 SPX6900 blends humor and finance like very few meme coins can. As the name suggests, $SPX is a meme coin twist on the legendary S&P 500 stock market index. The token’s virality stems from its ‘amusing’ goal of taking on the S&P 500. Thanks to incredible backing from meme coin degens, $SPX has turned out to be significantly more profitable than its traditional counterpart. It’s up 135% over the past 30 days and currently boasts a massive market capitalization of around $1.08B. Even though $SPX is currently heading into a major resistance zone, its current momentum could help it break through relatively easily. After this, we can see the token climb up to its all-time high of $1.80. $SPX is currently trading at $1.18. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Best Solana Meme Coin on Presale, Building First-Ever Solana L2 Solaxy ($SOLX) is unlike other Solana meme coins in that it won’t just leech off of the blockchain’s low-cost and high-speed infrastructure. It will, in fact, MSGA, i.e., Make Solana Great Again. Solana has been struggling with frequent transaction delays (even complete failures) thanks to network congestion and scalability issues that crept up after the launch of $TRUMP early this year. An unprecedented increase in investors overloaded the network, but Solaxy will fix these issues by building the first-ever Solana Layer 2. This L2 will offload transactions from Solana’s mainnet onto a sidechain, thereby reducing the burden on it. Additionally, $SOLX will also improve Solana’s affordability by processing transactions in batches rather than individually. With over $44.3M in early investor funding, Solaxy’s brain-melting presale performance is proof that Solana enthusiasts can’t wait to see their beloved blockchain get better than ever. If the momentum holds after listing, which it should, we can see $SOLX burst 11,400% and reach $0.2 by 2026 . You can buy Solaxy now for just $0.001746. 3. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Telegram-Based Trading Bot Simplifying Meme Coin Trading on Solana Snorter Token ($SNORT) is a new crypto and the native token behind the Snorter Bot, a Telegram-based meme coin trading tool offering low costs, lightning-fast executions, and state-of-the-art security. In addition to charging you just 0.85% trading fees (other bots charge a minimum of 1%), Snorter also comes with several unique features, such as copy trading, meme coin sniping, stop-loss automation, and live portfolio tracking. Combined with real-time honeypot and rug pull detection, as well as MEV protection, you can use Snorter Bot to elevate your meme coin trading game without compromising security. You can also engage in cross-chain meme coin trading and asset management thanks to Snorter Token’s Portal Bridge. It’s a handy tool that allows you to transfer Solana-based tokens to Ethereum and vice versa. It’s worth noting that $SNORT is one of the newest crypto presales around, but despite that, it has already raised over $420K. Each token is currently available for only $0.0943. Here’s how to buy it . DYOR Before Buying Solana Meme Coins The market is showing us strong potential growth from Solana and $SOL-based tokens like Snorter Token or Solaxy . The extent of growth remains to be seen. But investing early in presales tends to offer higher profits at the end of the day. Still, remember that investing in crypto is a risky endavor. Market conditions can change and fluctiation can ruin your plans.

2025-06-05T12:02:22,"Top Reasons Why Ethereum Price Rally is on the Cards","The post Top Reasons Why Ethereum Price Rally is on the Cards appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is back at capturing the market attention with its price trend, onchain dynamics, and fundamental strength. With Bitcoin trading sideways after its all-time highs, Ethereum could be poised for a potential breakout. In this write-up, we talk about the top reasons why the Ethereum price rally is on the cards. Top Reasons Why Ethereum Price is Going to Rally! Crypto analyst Lark Davis , in his recent post, cites that ETH is back in business, and the data proves it. Since the 8th of May, ETH’s trading volume has shown a sustained uptrend, indicating a rise in both buying and selling activity. Unlike previous phases of stagnation, traders are back and active. Additionally, whale accumulation is building a solid floor. While unconfirmed directly, on-chain signals and large wallet behaviors suggest heavy ETH buying, possibly in anticipation of future price rallies or institutional inflows. Importantly, the post also highlights that Ethereum’s comparative strength against Bitcoin is a standout. Even as BTC traced back from its all-time highs, ETH has held firm, signaling resilience. This independent performance is often a bullish signal, suggesting ETH may lead the next market leg higher. Furthermore, Ethereum’s 76% dominance in the tokenized asset space, boosted by stablecoin growth and active wallets, underpins its leadership role in the broader crypto ecosystem. This network strength continues to attract capital and developer attention. ETH Price Analysis Despite a minor 1.29% dip in the last 24 hours, ETH at press time trades at $2,608.70, still up over 45% in the past month. Its 24-hour trading volume has surged 9.14% to $17.75 billion, while its market cap stands at $314.79 billion. The chart shows ETH forming a higher low structure and holding support above key EMA20 at $2,522 and EMA50 at $2,320. Price action remains within a horizontal channel, with a clear resistance around $2,787. Should ETH break above the $2,787 resistance with volume, the next leg could target $3,000 and beyond. Given its strong fundamentals and technical setup, ETH offers an asymmetric long opportunity, especially if Bitcoin remains neutral or bullish.

2025-06-05T12:00:55,"Dogecoin Needs $0.40 Breakout To Salvage Bull Case, Says Analyst","Dogecoin’s six-month slide may be about to reach its moment of truth, according to independent market commentator VisionPulsed, who told followers on June 4 that the memecoin must vault the long-standing ceiling at roughly $0.40 “either this week or next” if the broader bullish structure is to survive the summer. In a video analysis, the analyst pointed to a second consecutive “blue bar” flashing on Ethereum’s momentum oscillator, a signal he treats as a reliable harbinger of imminent, high-magnitude moves across the digital-asset complex. “The last time we had two blue bars on Ethereum was way back when we were still young and optimistic,” he said, invoking memories of August 2023. “We printed five that time and the market moved sixteen percent. We’re at two now; by Sunday we’ll probably have four, which tells me the move should come next week.” Dogecoin Needs June Rally To Avert Summer Slump Although the blue-bar framework is native to Ethereum, VisionPulsed argued that its read-through for Bitcoin and, by correlation, Dogecoin is more important than ever. He noted that Bitcoin’s own hash-ribbon metric—formed when the network’s 30-day and 60-day hash-rate moving averages compress—has followed a strictly “sell for two weeks, then rally” pattern through the current cycle. “We’ve already been selling off for two weeks,” he said. “Historically in this bull market, that’s when Bitcoin resets and moves higher. If that plays out again, Dogecoin should finally get the lift it’s been denied since February.” Related Reading: June Or Doom: Dogecoin Faces 6 Red Months If It Fails To Surge, Predicts Analyst The crux of his thesis sits on a 70-day timing model derived from Dogecoin’s prior impulse lows. Measuring from the most recent trough, the 70-day mark falls on 14 June. “Every major upswing in Dogecoin during this cycle has come 60 to 80 days after a bottom,” he explained, scrolling through historical candles on screen. “We’re right on that window—if we’re going to break higher, it almost has to be now.” VisionPulsed acknowledged his own track record of slipping deadlines—“one for five hundred,” he joked—but insisted the structure remains statistically sound. “If we don’t rally next week, I’m never putting dates on anything again,” he told viewers, before adding a caveat that has become the headline takeaway. “Dogecoin has to clear $0.40. If we can’t do that, the bear case strengthens dramatically: June down, July probably down, September seasonally weak, and suddenly you’re talking eight red months out of nine.” Pressed by commenters about the depth of a potential downside scenario, the analyst pointed to Ethereum for context. A bullish resolution, he said, could lift ETH to roughly $3,200 before a summer consolidation and possibly $4,200 by early autumn, a path that in his view would drag Dogecoin well north of the $0.40 trigger. Failure, however, “sets up a very large move down, maybe sub-$2,000 on ETH,” a slide that would likely leave Dogecoin retesting multi-month lows. “Whichever way we go,” he concluded, “is going to determine the rest of the summer.” Related Reading: Dogecoin’s Fate Hinges On This Price Level, Analysts Agree The urgency is aggravated by Dogecoin’s mounting sequence of monthly losses: five red candles since January, with only a brief reprieve in April. “Six red months out of seven is staring us in the face,” VisionPulsed said. “June doesn’t have to be a vertical move, but it does have to be green—or at least show a decisive breakout—because otherwise, where is the bull run?” Market structure rather than sentiment, he stressed, underpins the call. Bitcoin already sits near cycle highs while Dogecoin still trades markedly below its own year-to-date peak, a divergence he interprets as latent leverage. “If Bitcoin punches through its local top, it typically drags Doge,” he said, referencing earlier intervals in 2024 when BTC strength eventually translated into delayed but exaggerated moves in the memecoin. Whether that historical choreography can repeat depends, in his framework, on the next few daily closes. “We’re definitely getting more energy built up,” he said, pointing to narrowing Bollinger Bands and declining on-chain activity. “I don’t think the large move is here yet, but by late this week—or early next week at the latest—you should get your answer.” For traders who still believe the four-year cycle remains intact, the analyst’s $0.40 line in the sand arrives almost exactly one calendar year before the next projected Bitcoin top in October 2026. “If Doge can’t start moving now, the entire timing model gets pushed off course,” he warned. “I genuinely think June is a make-or-break month.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.189.

2025-06-05T11:58:08,"How Bitcoin (BTC) Price Signals For The Continuation Of June: Bullish Or Bearish?","While tariff tensions and developments between the US – China and other countries negatively affected Bitcoin, BTC fell to $74,000 levels in April. Afterwards, BTC started to recover with the moderate steps taken by US President Donald Trump and broke a new record by rising above $111,000 in the last days of May. While tariff tensions have had a significant impact on Bitcoin, Swyftx Chief Analyst Pav Hundal identified Trump’s ongoing tariff uncertainty as a significant threat to Bitcoin. At this point, Pav Hundal said that Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in June if trade tensions in the US ease. “The biggest threat to bulls right now is that nothing changes for the next two months and we get stuck in this endless cycle of tariff uncertainty. If the tariff tensions are resolved, Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in June. However, if the bears say 'I told you so', we could see Bitcoin fall below $100,000.” FED Expects Tariff Uncertainty to Be Resolved for Interest Rate Cuts! Hundal said that tariff uncertainty also delayed the FED's interest rate cut decision, adding that there was a risk that the FED would delay monetary expansion until it obtained concrete data on the impact of Trump's tariffs, which would pose a risk of slowing growth. “Trump-induced tariff uncertainty has jeopardized the achievement of the 2% inflation target this year. Six months ago, a 2% inflation target seemed possible; today, it is under long-term threat from tariffs. The US is at a macro turning point and the Fed is walking a fine line right now.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T11:50:09,"Ethereum (ETH) Explosive Surge Signals Promising Altseason Potential","BitcoinWorld Ethereum (ETH) Explosive Surge Signals Promising Altseason Potential The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, presenting unique dynamics for investors and enthusiasts alike. While Bitcoin (BTC) often dominates headlines, recent data suggests a significant shift is occurring, with Ethereum (ETH) taking the lead in terms of short-term performance. This divergence is sparking conversations across the industry about the potential for a broader rally among altcoins – commonly known as an altseason. Understanding the current landscape requires a close look at the key metrics driving this narrative. What Does Ethereum (ETH)’s Outperformance Mean? Recent analysis from crypto data analytics firm Swissblock, shared on X, highlights a compelling trend: Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated remarkable strength over the past month. Specifically, ETH has surged by an impressive 46% over the last 30 days. This performance substantially outpaces Bitcoin (BTC)’s gains during the same period. This kind of relative strength from the second-largest cryptocurrency is often seen as a significant indicator within the market. The disparity in performance between the two crypto giants is a crucial piece of the puzzle when conducting Crypto Market Analysis. Bitcoin’s movements typically set the tone for the overall market, but when Ethereum begins to show independent strength and outperform BTC, it suggests capital might be rotating down the market cap ladder. Why is the ETH/BTC Ratio So Important? The relationship between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) is often tracked using the ETH/BTC ratio. This ratio measures the price of one ETH in terms of Bitcoin. A rising ETH/BTC ratio means Ethereum is gaining value relative to Bitcoin, while a falling ratio indicates the opposite. According to Swissblock’s report, the ETH/BTC ratio has increased by 30% over the past 30 days. This substantial jump is a direct consequence of ETH’s superior performance during this period. The ETH/BTC ratio is a critical barometer for market sentiment regarding altcoins. When this ratio trends upward, it often signals increasing confidence and interest in Ethereum and, by extension, the broader altcoin market. Traders and analysts closely watch this ratio for clues about potential market rotations and the likelihood of an Altseason. Is a Breakout Approaching for the ETH/BTC Pair? The growing momentum reflected in the rising ETH/BTC ratio is pushing the pair towards a significant technical level. According to Swissblock, the pair is approaching the upper boundary of its weekly trading range. Technical analysts pay close attention to trading ranges and their boundaries. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Resistance Level: The upper boundary of a trading range typically acts as a resistance level, where selling pressure has historically emerged. Breakout Potential: A successful breakout above this level, especially with strong volume and conviction, is often interpreted as a bullish signal. Trend Confirmation: Clearing this resistance could confirm the strengthening trend of ETH relative to BTC and potentially pave the way for further gains. A breakout from this key technical level for the ETH/BTC pair is considered a potential trigger for a significant shift in market dynamics. Could This Signal the Beginning of an Altseason? The term Altseason refers to a period where altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) experience significant price increases, often outperforming Bitcoin by a large margin. These periods are characterized by capital flowing from Bitcoin into various altcoins as investors seek higher returns and explore emerging technologies or trends. While there’s no single definitive trigger for an altseason, several factors often precede or accompany one: Bitcoin Stability or Sideways Movement: Bitcoin consolidating after a large rally allows capital to look elsewhere. ETH Leading the Charge: As the largest altcoin by market cap and a major ecosystem driver, Ethereum’s strong performance relative to Bitcoin is often a precursor. Increasing Risk Appetite: Market sentiment becomes more bullish, and investors are willing to take on more risk by investing in smaller, more volatile altcoins. Specific Altcoin Narratives: Hype around particular sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI, etc.) can fuel rallies in related altcoins. The current scenario, with Ethereum (ETH) showing such strong relative strength and the ETH/BTC ratio challenging a key resistance, aligns with historical patterns that have preceded altseasons. A successful breakout could indeed act as the catalyst that broadens the rally beyond just ETH. What Factors Are Driving Demand for Ethereum? Beyond simple speculation, several fundamental factors could be contributing to the rising demand for Ethereum (ETH): 1. Staking Yield: The transition to Proof-of-Stake allows ETH holders to earn yield by staking their tokens, making it an attractive asset for passive income. 2. Ecosystem Activity: Ethereum remains the dominant platform for decentralized applications (DApps), including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 scaling solutions. Increased activity in these areas drives demand for ETH as the network’s native currency for gas fees and participation. 3. Potential ETF Developments: While Bitcoin ETFs have launched, speculation continues regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions, which could open the door to significant institutional investment. 4. Network Upgrades: Ongoing developments and planned upgrades to the Ethereum network aim to improve scalability, security, and sustainability, enhancing its long-term value proposition. These underlying drivers provide a fundamental basis for ETH’s value, complementing the technical and market-driven factors contributing to its recent outperformance in the Crypto Market Analysis. Challenges and Considerations While the signals are promising, it’s important to consider potential challenges and risks: Bitcoin Volatility: A sudden significant downturn in Bitcoin’s price could negatively impact the entire market, including Ethereum and other altcoins, potentially halting or reversing an altseason. Regulatory Headwinds: Uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in major markets can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and dampen investor enthusiasm. Technical Failure to Break Out: The ETH/BTC pair could fail to break above the weekly range resistance, leading to a retracement and delaying any potential altseason. Market Saturation: While some altcoins may rally, not all will participate equally, and many carry high risks. Navigating the market requires careful consideration of both the bullish signals and the potential pitfalls. Actionable Insights for Readers Given the current market dynamics, what should interested individuals consider? Monitor the ETH/BTC Ratio: Keep a close eye on the ETH/BTC chart, specifically the weekly range upper boundary mentioned by Swissblock. A convincing break and hold above this level would be a strong bullish signal. Research Altcoins: If an altseason materializes, not all altcoins will perform equally. Research projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Manage Risk: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Employ proper risk management strategies, such as diversification and setting stop-losses. Stay Informed: Follow market analysis, news, and on-chain data to stay ahead of potential shifts. Concluding Thoughts: Is Altseason Imminent? The data from Swissblock painting a clear picture: Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing significant strength relative to Bitcoin (BTC), marked by a substantial 30-day gain and a rising ETH/BTC ratio challenging key resistance. This technical setup, combined with underlying fundamental drivers for Ethereum, presents a compelling case for the potential start of a new Altseason. While a breakout from the ETH/BTC weekly range boundary is seen as a potential trigger, the market remains subject to broader macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin’s price action. Investors should view these signals as indicators, not guarantees. The potential is certainly building, but careful observation, research, and risk management remain paramount in navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of cryptocurrency markets.

The program, known as Stabilize Families, is backed by the nonprofit RISE Together Innovation Institute and the Community Shelter Board in Franklin County, Ohio, reports The Columbus Dispatch. The Community Shelter Board will give 80 families a one-off cash handout of $1,500, while RISE Together Innovation Institute will offer monthly payments of $500 to 20 families for 11 months. Data collected by the Community Shelter Board reportedly shows homelessness in Franklin County in 2024 went up six times faster than the population growth. As of January 23rd, according to the report, there were 2,556 homeless people in the Ohio county, up by 7.4% from 2024. Community Shelter Board’s president and CEO Shannon Isom says the guaranteed income pilot program is “about dignity” and will give the beneficiaries “breathing room to stabilize, plan, and dream again.” The report cites RISE Together Innovation Institute’s CEO Danielle Sydnor saying, “Guaranteed income is a viable strategy to promote economic stability and well-being for residents in Franklin County.” According to the report, Ohio State University will be involved in the guaranteed income pilot program and will conduct research on the project’s impact on beneficiaries and the community.

2025-06-05T11:45:01,"Binance maintains 59% dominance of CEX stablecoin reserves: Data","Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, controls 59% of all stablecoin reserves across centralized exchanges, according to on-chain data. This accounts for $31.45 billion in USDT and USDC alone. It is more than three times the next closest competitor, OKX, which holds $8.2 billion (15.39%). The stablecoin market cap is on a surge as its capitalization breached the $254 billion mark. Tether’s USDT remains the largest stablecoin with a market cap of more than $153 billion, while USDC remains at the second spot with over $61 billion cap. Hype for stablecoins is such that even Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial launched its dollar-pegged USD1 recently. Binance tops Bitcoin inflows According to the data, Binance dominates in its central role in crypto liquidity, while Coinbase leads in total reserves with $129 billion. Binance stands in the second spot in all reserves, holding $110 billion. Combined, Coinbase and Binance hold 60% of the total reserves held across the top 20 crypto exchanges. As of May, Binance received $31 billion in USDT/USDC deposits. It stood just ahead of Coinbase’s $30 billion. A report mentioned that the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows. Meanwhile, Coinbase does not provide a public Proof-of-Reserves (PoR), but Binance offers transparent PoR reports, and this includes wallet addresses. It added that Coinbase and Binance bagged the largest cumulative inflows in USD terms in 2025. These figures turn out to be $344 and $335 billion, respectively. However, Binance showed the highest average Bitcoin inflow . On May 22, as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of over $111,900, the exchange saw an average BTC deposit size of 7 BTC, the biggest among major exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant On the other side, major exchanges’ average deposits were lower. Bitfinex accounted for 5, OKX for 1.23, and it was less than 1 BTC for Kraken and Coinbase. Stablecoin boom and politics collide This surge comes as the US Senate is heading into the final stretch of debate on the GENIUS Act . The stablecoin bill could become the first major crypto legislation to pass the chamber as it seeks to regulate the issuers of dollar-pegged tokens like USDT and USDC. However, it has already cleared the Banking Committee and passed an early floor test with bipartisan support. Some Democrats have begun linking the bill to Donald Trump’s personal crypto ventures. This includes one of the projects closely tied to the president, USD1 . Backed by World Liberty Financial, USD1 has exploded in usage. In just 10 days after its Binance listing, the stablecoin recorded over $10.7 billion in transfer volume. Data shows that from May 22 to June 1, trading volumes surged past all prior records. The week of May 19 alone saw a 1,300% jump in transfer activity. It soared from $307M to $4.3 billion, and by June 1, USD1 had already logged another $6.8 billion, setting a new weekly high. That surge follows a rapid rise in market cap as USD1 broke into the top six stablecoins in May, surpassing $2 billion. For lawmakers, this growth complicates the GENIUS Act’s final steps, as some argue the legislation could benefit Trump-linked ventures.

A longtime Bitcoin supporter, Lummis is working with Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) to fold in parts of her bipartisan crypto regulation bill , co-authored with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Her proposals aim to close tax loopholes and support the crypto industry – though not everyone is on the same page. Crypto Wash-Sale Rule Could Raise Billions One of Lummis’s main proposals is to apply the wash-sale rule to crypto. This would stop investors from selling their digital assets at a loss and quickly buying them back to reduce their tax bills – a common tactic that isn’t currently restricted for crypto. Lummis told Semafor, “This bill is the right place to fix crypto taxation,” but skeptics, including Gillibrand, call it “premature,” citing risks of rushed policy. Bitcoin Miners May Catch a Break Another part of Lummis’s plan would exempt Bitcoin miners from reporting capital gains and losses. This would ease the reporting burden on miners, who often face confusing tax requirements despite playing a major role in the crypto ecosystem. This proposal reflects Lummis’s ongoing support for the industry, but it’s expected to face resistance in a divided Senate. Trump Weighs In on GOP Tax Bill On Wednesday, members of the Senate Finance Committee, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), met with President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss the bill. According to Cassidy, Trump is focused on including “working account benefits,” adding more complexity to ongoing negotiations. A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto Policy With the 2025 tax cuts set to expire soon, Lummis’s proposals could help set the direction for how digital assets are taxed and regulated going forward. If adopted, they could provide clarity to the crypto market while also boosting federal revenue.

It surprised the market by pricing its IPO at $31 per share, well above the expected $27 to $28 range. The company and existing shareholders sold about 34 million shares, raising approximately $1.1 billion. This pricing values Circle at around $6.9 billion, according to Bloomberg . Second Big Crypto Listing Goes Live The stablecoin issuer was set to go live today on the NYSE under the ticker “CRCL.” Circle has also given its underwriters a 30-day option to buy an extra 5.1 million shares. BlackRock plans to buy 10% of Circle’s IPO shares, while ARK Invest plans to invest up to $150 million. This IPO is the second big crypto listing under the Trump administration, after eToro’s debut last month. This move gives Circle more access to funding and stronger regulatory oversight that will help improve investor confidence amidst recent volatility in crypto markets. Ripple Denies Circle Acquisition Rumors This comes shortly after the rumors of a potential acquisition by Ripple were put to rest. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared during a Las Vegas Bitcoin conference that Ripple had never pursued an acquisition of Circle, while some reports had suggested that Circle had denied a $5 billion offer from Ripple. Coinbase was also on the list to acquire Circle. Nevertheless, Circle’s IPO shows rising institutional interest in stablecoins and the broader crypto market. U.S. lawmakers are also pushing for clearer rules for stablecoins, which marks a major shift in how these digital assets will be viewed in the country. Lately, Wall Street giants have also shown interest in exploring their own stablecoin plans. Why Institutions Could Choose Circle- Circle is one of the first big crypto companies. The USDC, issued by Circle, is the second most popular stablecoin, holding 27% of the market, while Tether’s USDT leads at 67%. Circle’s IPO is also one of the biggest since Coinbase’s 2021 Debut. This is a big step for crypto moving into traditional finance. More crypto firms are eyeing the public market. Kraken is reportedly planning an IPO this year, while BitGo launched a global trading desk in February ahead of its listing plans. Circle’s USDC coin is likely to be favored by institutions due to the company’s strict regulatory focus. It was the first to get a New York State BitLicense in 2015, which gives it an advantage as banks and fintech firms look to enter the stablecoin space.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/circles-1-1b-ipo-shines-as-ripple-ceo-dismisses-acquisition-claims/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|USDC","News|Crypto news|Stablecoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T11:38:52,"Leverage Reconfigures in Q1: DeFi Recovers, CeFi Quietly Expands, Treasury Debt Mounts","Leverage across the crypto economy is evolving, not evaporating. Total crypto-collateralized lending fell 4.9% quarter-over-quarter to $39.07 billion, the first decline since late 2023, Galaxy Research’s Q1 2025 report shows. But while the headline figure contracted, underlying dynamics suggest leverage is shifting form, not fading. Lending in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending took a hit early in the quarter, sliding as much as 21%, before rebounding sharply in April and May. The turnaround was driven largely by Aave’s integration of Pendle tokens, whose yield-bearing structure and high loan-to-value ratios (up to 90%) sparked a wave of fresh borrowing. By late May, DeFi borrowing had surged more than 30% off the lows, with Ethereum leading the recovery. Centralized finance (CeFi) lending climbed 9.24% to $13.51 billion, led by Tether, Ledn, and Two Prime. Still, Galaxy notes that a narrow set of public disclosures limits visibility into the true scope of centralized lending. Private desks, OTC platforms, and offshore credit providers likely push the actual total far higher. perhaps by 50% or more. Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC treasury companies are quietly becoming a new systemic leverage node. Firms like Strategy (MSTR) have issued billions in convertible debt to fund BTC purchases. As of May, total outstanding debt across treasury firms stood at $12.7 billion, much of it set to mature between 2027 and 2028. In derivatives, CME’s rising open interest especially in ether ETH futures signals accelerating institutional participation. At the same time, upstart exchange Hyperliquid has carved out a growing share of the perpetual futures market, underscoring the continued strength of retail-driven leverage. The report points to an increasingly interconnected market structure, one where stress in a single venue or instrument could reverberate quickly across the ecosystem.

2025-06-05T11:32:31,"Pundit Says the Real XRP FOMO Will Start At This Price","In a market often driven by speculation, sentiment, and surprise surges, XRP has long stood as a polarizing asset, either heralded as the future of institutional finance or dismissed as a relic of regulatory entanglement. But according to influential crypto commentator BarriC, the real moment of mass hysteria, true Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), won’t arrive until XRP crosses the astonishing $1,000 mark. BarriC’s Bold Price Forecast Taking to X, BarriC made a compelling case that while XRP has seen its fair share of market cycles, the public has yet to experience what he calls “massive FOMO.” In his words, “When $XRP hits $1,000 , that’s when we see massive FOMO from the masses, desperate to own 1 XRP.” The post, which quickly gained traction, taps into a growing narrative that XRP’s long-term value lies not just in its utility or legal clarity but in its scarcity and psychological appeal. While $1,000 may sound like a fantastical number to many retail investors accustomed to XRP’s historically modest price range, BarriC’s perspective is rooted in a broader understanding of how retail behavior tends to trail institutional adoption. His comment suggests that the bulk of the public has yet to grasp XRP’s full potential and that true market frenzy will only ignite once the price reaches levels most now consider unthinkable. When $XRP hits $1,000 That’s when we see massive FOMO from the masses, desperate to own 1 x #XRP — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 4, 2025 Institutional Momentum and Utility-Driven Value BarriC’s projection comes amid a wave of growing institutional attention on Ripple, the company closely associated with XRP. Ripple’s cross-border payments network, which continues to expand globally, leverages XRP for on-demand liquidity, a model that has begun to appeal to central banks and large-scale financial institutions looking to modernize outdated payment rails. Ripple has also taken firm steps toward integrating its ecosystem into broader financial frameworks. The launch of RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, is aimed at enhancing XRP Ledger (XRPL) liquidity and promoting enterprise-grade tokenization, setting the stage for further adoption. These developments add a layer of long-term utility to XRP, strengthening the argument for a significantly higher valuation. Moreover, the advent of tokenized assets and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) places XRP at the center of conversations about the future of finance. With its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, XRP is uniquely positioned to serve as the bridge asset in a rapidly evolving global financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Psychological Threshold: The Power of Round Numbers BarriC’s $1,000 target also reflects an important psychological principle in financial markets: the power of round numbers. In the same way, Bitcoin’s rise above $10,000 and $50,000 triggered new waves of interest; XRP crossing a milestone like $1,000 could dramatically shift public perception. Scarcity-driven narratives, especially the idea that owning just one XRP becomes a big deal, have historically sparked major retail interest in other assets. The comparison is not without precedent. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum also went through extended periods of underestimation before the masses caught on. By the time BTC crossed $20,000 in late 2020, most of the institutional accumulation had already occurred. Retail investors, driven by headlines and viral posts, often buy the top of the wave. BarriC believes XRP could follow a similar trajectory, with the masses only scrambling to accumulate when supply dries up and price enters four-digit territory. The FOMO Threshold: Speculation or Strategic Forecast? BarriC’s forecast, while bold, aligns with a growing belief that a massive price appreciation for XRP could be triggered not by speculation alone but by fundamentals converging with market psychology. Utility, legal clarity, and scarcity narratives could become catalysts, and in a space as sentiment-driven as crypto, such a tipping point could result in a self-fulfilling surge. As history has shown with other digital assets, today’s improbable can become tomorrow’s inevitable. And if BarriC is right, the XRP FOMO that many expected years ago has yet to begin, it’s merely waiting for the right number to be printed on the charts.

Predictions suggest BTC could reach $175K in 2025. Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, rising institutional interest, and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $$104,232.70 and $105,579.56 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin witnessed an unstoppable and steady ascent. This recovery was fueled by easing tensions from the trade tariff war, pushing BTC to a new all-time high of $112K. Now, in the early days of June, Bitcoin is attempting to hold this support level after pulling back from its all-time high. Yet, it continues to face resistance from the 20-day EMA band. If bearish pressure increases again, this support zone becomes crucial. A breakdown below it could lead to a further decline toward the $100K to $95K range in the short term. Additionally, market sentiment has shifted to neutral over the past 24 hours. As the price consolidates in June, the BTC long/short ratio is also hovering near 1.0, signaling a weak directional bias in the short term. However, if sentiment improves, Bitcoin would need to break past its newly formed all-time high to resume upward momentum. If this happens, BTC will enter price discovery mode, targeting a near-term level of $120,000, with the potential for even higher gains in the months ahead. On the contrary, on-chain data suggests caution in the short term, as the 30-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) has fallen from a high of “+10.22%” to the current “-0.507%”. This move below the zero line indicates that, on average, recent BTC holders are now at a loss. Additionally, the Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) metric saw a large spike on Tuesday, indicating that holders are closing their positions and increasing selling pressure. Similarly, a spike in the Age Consumed index also reveals bearish signals, urging caution in the short term. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC. Source: CryptoQuant Talking about Bitcoin Price Prediction, if things turn bullish, BTC is expected to create a high of $175K. If things go south, we can expect a low of $70K.

2025-06-05T11:23:45,"Solo Miner Defies Odds After Mining Bitcoin Block Earning Over $330K","A solo Bitcoin miner has successfully validated a block on the Bitcoin network, earning a reward worth over $330,000. Identified as Solo CK, the individual mined Bitcoin block #899826 on June 5 at 04:48:18 UTC. $330K Mining Reward On-chain data from mempool shows that the reward included the standard block subsidy and 0.026 BTC in transaction fees. This brought the miner’s total earnings to approximately $330,386 based on current market prices. The block itself measured 1.66 megabytes in size and weighed 3.99 megawatt units (MWU). The hash for the successfully mined block was “000000…d1f8bb3,” with the transaction fees alone being worth around $2,761. Independent Bitcoin mining success remains extremely rare due to the high computational power needed to validate a block. Most of such activities today are done by large-scale operations using warehouses filled with specialized mining equipment. Many of these operations are run by companies publicly listed on U.S. stock exchanges like Bit Digital, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital. As of June 5, data from YCharts reveals that the Bitcoin Network Hash Rate stands at 795.35M. This figure is down from 908.97M yesterday and up by over 40% one year ago. A higher hashrate means increased competition, greater energy demands, and longer verification and transaction times. These conditions make it more difficult for individual miners to succeed without pooled resources. Additionally, Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly hard and energy-intensive over time, requiring greater resources to remain effective. 1 in 1.6 Million Odds Experts estimate the odds of an independent miner successfully validating a block using their own hardware to be roughly 1 in 1.6 million. Statistically, this means a single individual would expect to solve one block every 31 years. Despite the long odds, solo participants occasionally achieve success, as seen in the recent case of Solo CK. Several other individuals have also managed to mine a Bitcoin block on their own. In February 2025, one such user mined Block 883,181, earning 3.158 BTC worth $310,000 at the time. On April 29, 2024, another solo operator validated Block 841,286 and received the full 3.125 BTC reward worth approximately $200,000. In July of the same year, a BitAXE device with a hashrate of just 500 gigahashes per second (Gh/s) successfully mined Block 853,742, securing a Bitcoin reward of $206,000.

2025-06-05T11:20:18,"Astonishing Bitcoin Price Prediction: Could BTC Hit $120K Amid US Trade Tensions?","BitcoinWorld Astonishing Bitcoin Price Prediction: Could BTC Hit $120K Amid US Trade Tensions? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with potential. A bold Bitcoin price prediction has emerged, suggesting the leading digital asset could soar to $120,000 as early as June. But there’s a significant condition attached: an easing of US trade tensions . This forecast comes from a reputable source, highlighting the intricate link between global macroeconomic factors and the volatile crypto market. What’s Behind This Ambitious Bitcoin Price Prediction ? The forecast originates from Pav Hundal, the lead analyst at Swyftx, a prominent Australian crypto exchange. Speaking recently, Hundal pointed to external economic pressures as key determinants for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. While internal market dynamics, adoption rates, and technological developments always play a role, macro events, particularly those emanating from major global economies like the United States, can exert significant influence. The $120,000 target for June is ambitious, representing a substantial rally from current levels. Achieving this would likely require a confluence of positive factors, with the easing of trade friction being identified as a primary catalyst by the Swyftx analyst . Decoding US Trade Tensions and Their Impact Ongoing uncertainty surrounding tariffs, particularly those linked to potential policies under figures like former President Donald Trump, presents a notable short-term risk for investors in assets like Bitcoin. Here’s why trade tensions matter for the crypto market outlook : Economic Uncertainty: Trade disputes create instability. Businesses face unpredictable costs and market access issues, potentially slowing down investment and economic growth. Investor Sentiment: Heightened tensions often lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment in traditional markets. Investors may retreat from volatile assets, including cryptocurrencies, in favor of perceived safe havens. Currency Fluctuations: Trade policies can impact currency values. While Bitcoin is often seen as an alternative to fiat, significant shifts in major currencies like the USD due to trade wars can indirectly affect crypto trading dynamics and global liquidity. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, leading to inflation in certain sectors and potentially impacting overall economic stability, which in turn affects investor confidence across all asset classes. According to the Swyftx analyst , if these trade-related uncertainties were to diminish, it could signal a more stable economic environment, encouraging investors to re-engage with risk assets like Bitcoin. How Macroeconomic Factors Shape the Bitcoin Outlook Beyond trade, the broader economic landscape, particularly monetary policy set by institutions like the Federal Reserve, is crucial for the Bitcoin outlook . The Fed’s decision on May 7 to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% was a key event. However, the analyst notes that rising tariff concerns are now casting doubt on the central bank’s long-term goals, specifically its 2% inflation target. Six months ago, achieving this inflation target seemed more probable. Now, the combination of potential tariff impacts (which can be inflationary) and the Fed’s delicate balancing act leaves the U.S. economy, and by extension, global markets, at a critical juncture. The Fed’s stance on interest rates and its success (or lack thereof) in managing inflation directly influence the liquidity available in the market and the attractiveness of yield-bearing traditional investments versus non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Outlook The current crypto market outlook is complex, influenced by a mix of positive fundamental developments (like increased institutional adoption and technological upgrades) and challenging macroeconomic headwinds (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical risks, and yes, trade tensions). The Swyftx analyst’s view underscores that while the potential for significant upside exists, it is heavily conditional on external factors improving. Here are some key aspects influencing the market: Potential Upside Catalysts: Easing trade tensions, successful inflation control allowing for future rate cuts, increased institutional inflows, positive regulatory clarity. Potential Downside Risks: Escalation of trade disputes, persistent inflation leading to higher-for-longer interest rates, unfavorable regulatory actions, broader economic recession fears. Investors are currently weighing these factors, leading to periods of volatility. The path to $120,000 is not guaranteed and depends heavily on how these macroeconomic puzzles are solved. Expert Insights: What the Swyftx Analyst Highlights Pav Hundal’s specific emphasis on trade tensions as a major short-term risk provides a focused insight. While many analysts discuss interest rates and inflation, highlighting tariffs points to a potentially underestimated factor. His perspective suggests that a resolution or significant de-escalation on the trade front could unlock significant positive sentiment and capital flows that are currently held back by uncertainty. This specific angle differentiates the Swyftx analyst’s commentary and offers a unique lens through which to view the current market dynamics and the potential for a rapid price appreciation in June. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Outlook ? Based on this analysis, the Bitcoin outlook for the coming months appears highly sensitive to policy decisions in Washington, both regarding trade and monetary policy. For investors, this means keeping a close eye not just on crypto charts, but also on global economic indicators and political developments. Actionable Insight: Diversification remains key. Understanding the potential impact of macro events allows investors to better manage risk and position themselves according to their own risk tolerance and market expectations. While a $120,000 Bitcoin in June is a thrilling prospect, it’s crucial to recognize the conditions required for such a move. Conclusion The bold Bitcoin price prediction of $120,000 by June, as put forth by the Swyftx analyst , serves as a powerful reminder of how interconnected the crypto market is with the broader global economy. The path to this significant milestone appears contingent on the easing of US trade tensions , a factor identified as a critical short-term risk. Alongside the ongoing influence of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy on the crypto market outlook , these macroeconomic forces are shaping the current Bitcoin outlook .

2025-06-05T11:17:49,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The XRP Price LIVE: $ 2.21991935 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.21991935 -0.94% Market cap $ 130,441,848,159.17 Circulating Supply 58,759,724,027.00 Trading Volume $ 1,981,512,914.3529 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP is currently in a pullback phase after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May. Following this, the price slipped below a key high-volume profile level throughout the remainder of the month. In early June, XRP is attempting to hold above the previous swing low of $2.10. However, it’s facing resistance due to a short-term bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. If selling pressure continues and XRP breaks below the crucial $2.10 support—closely aligned with the dynamic 200-day EMA—further downside could follow, potentially pushing the price toward $1.88 and even $1.63. However, if XRP manages to rebound and break above the key resistance at $2.40—along with overcoming the recent bearish EMA crossover—it could open the door for a rally toward $2.80, with the potential to retest its all-time high of $3.40 later in June. That said, the current decline in both volume and volatility points to a lackluster, consolidative phase, which poses a challenge for XRP’s price action. Since strong momentum relies on rising volume and heightened volatility, their absence could prolong the downtrend. Conversely, if both metrics begin to rise alongside renewed buying interest, XRP could experience a sharp price surge this month. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T11:17:04,"XRP Proponent: Owning Just 10,000 XRP Will be Impossible for 99.999%","Edoardo Farina, a prominent voice in the XRP community and founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has voiced concern that accumulating 10,000 XRP may soon be a goal few investors can realistically achieve. Farina has consistently advocated for accumulating and holding XRP, suggesting it could be pivotal for long-term financial security. Farina believes that the digital asset is significantly undervalued and could soon rise substantially. At today’s price of $2.2, obtaining 10,000 XRP would cost around $22,000. While that sum already places it outside the budget of some retail participants, Farina’s statement suggests that more investors will be priced out as the token enters a stronger bullish phase. Owning just 10,000 $XRP will be impossible for 99.999% — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 3, 2025 Long-Term Targets and Financial Implications Farina has openly discussed his investment plans, revealing that he intends to begin taking little profits once XRP hits $10, but that he expects to hold the majority of his holdings until it reaches $100 . Under such a scenario, 10,000 XRP would be valued at $1 million. Such a rise would significantly impact accessibility. For example, an individual earning the median U.S. salary of $65,000 annually would find it nearly impossible to purchase 10,000 XRP at $100, unless they saved for more than a decade without spending any of their income. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This is a likely outcome if investors wait too long to enter the market, and one of the primary reasons Farina has consistently warned everyone to buy and hold XRP . In October 2024, Farina advocated buying 10,000 XRP at $0.52, totaling $5,200. Since then, XRP’s price has quadrupled, proving his stance. He still believes the real breakout lies ahead, recently suggesting that if Bitcoin hits $500,000, XRP could surge to $100 . Historical Parallels Highlight the Warning To support his view, we can consider early Bitcoin investment opportunities. In 2013, Bitcoin traded around $110. Back then, early adopters like Davinci Jeremie encouraged investors to acquire even modest amounts. At that price, 10 BTC would have required about $1,000. Today, those same 10 BTC are worth more than $1 million, as Bitcoin is trading at around $104,000. Many experts believe XRP is now at a comparable stage in its market development. Just as most people today would find it impossible to buy 10 BTC, the same may soon be true for XRP if current price forecasts materialize. Farina has previously predicted that 95% of people will miss out on XRP . For those waiting for more confirmation before investing, the opportunity may have passed by the time they act.

2025-06-05T11:15:09,"Russia's central bank proposes strict oversight on crypto trading transfers","The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has called on credit institutions to strengthen control over transactions linked to crypto trading platforms, which it lists among “shadow businesses.” The push comes after the enforcement of a law empowering banks to impose a monthly limit on transfers made by persons suspected of fraudulent activities. It allows them to block card accounts and online banking services. Russian banks told to monitor crypto-related transactions Russia’s monetary authority has instructed commercial banks in the country to catch money transfers between payment cards of private individuals and the corporate cards of ghost firms that show little or no signs of real business activity. Such entities are often used by “shadow businesses,” the regulator said in a circular , listing among these cryptocurrency exchangers, online casinos, financial pyramids, and drug dealers. Russian banks have been asked to swiftly identify these types of transactions, using online monitoring tools “in close to real time mode,” and conduct a thorough analysis of the respective client’s transaction profile, RBC Crypto and Bits.media reported. Banking institutions may restrict transactions of a customer who has been interacting with “counterparties that previously transferred money to droppers” or companies with fictitious activity, the CBR noted. The measures include limiting bank wires and prohibiting cash deposits. “Droppers” is a colloquial Russian term that refers to people lending their bank accounts, cards and wallets to fraudsters who use them to launder criminal proceeds. The central bank has been trying to deal with the phenomenon known as money muling in the West. As part of these efforts, Moscow adopted new legislation, which went into force in mid-May. The law allows authorities to cap the monthly bank transfers of individuals at 100,000 rubles ($1,300) if their bank details have been added to the CBR’s database of suspicious transactions. When the limit is reached, online access to a blacklisted account may be blocked. The account holder is then required to contact the bank and present their passport and payment card before they can use the account again. Dropper law hits peer-to-peer crypto traders in Russia In the notice, the Bank of Russia remarked that its latest recommendations are voluntary for banks, but at the same time, the financial authority emphasized that they can help improve their anti-money laundering procedures. Meanwhile, concerns have been growing that the new regulations targeting droppers are actually hitting crypto traders who have few options to buy and sell digital coins in Russia, where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are yet to be properly regulated. The central bank’s dropper database is affecting crypto trading in general as it often includes not only the bank details of criminals and their accomplices but also of legitimate participants in peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchange, legal analysts told RBC. The business news outlet noted that P2P has remained the only way to buy and sell cryptocurrency for users with a domestically issued card. And while the new limits will certainly make it harder for fraudsters to launder illicit funds, they will also restrict law-abiding participants in the market. In May, the CBR revealed that crypto asset flows linked to Russian residents have spiked by over 51% during the last quarter of 2024 and the first three months of 2025, compared to the previous two quarters. The total reached 7.3 trillion rubles, or $91 billion at the time the bank published its latest financial stability review. This month, the bank proposed to increase the maximum amount that ordinary Russians can invest in digital financial assets, such as tokenized securities, to 1 million rubles (over $12,600) from the current 600,000 rubles. However, the regulator continues to insist on limiting access to decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to only “ highly qualified ” investors.

2025-06-05T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Faces Bearish June Seasonality as ETF Flows Slow","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies continue to offer little directional clarity to traders, with inflows into spot ETFs slowing during the seasonally bearish period. According to 10x Research , June tends to be a mixed-to-negative month for the largest tokens. Bitcoin has averaged a 1.9% return in June over the past 10 years, evenly split between five positive and five negative occurrences. Ethereum's ether (ETH) averaged an 11.7% decline, with only two out of the last seven Junes in the green. XRP has fared even worse, though SOL has been stronger. The apathy is reflected in the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, which recorded net inflows in only two of the past five trading days. Inflows on Wednesday were just $87 million, a sharp decline from Tuesday's $387 million, SoSoValue data show. Ether ETFs recorded a net inflow of $57 million, the least since May 21. ""The weakening pace of institutional flows confirms a loss of momentum — and makes us more cautious on the short-term outlook,"" Valentin Fournier, lead research analyst at BRN, said in an email. Other analysts, however, remain optimistic, citing the rapid pace of institutional adoption. ""Despite the seasonal summer lull, the structural backdrop remains intact,"" QCP Capital said. ""With both BTC and ETH emission rates now trailing global money supply growth, a long-term positive price drift appears increasingly probable. Fresh treasury buyers are absorbing supply."" The firm also noted the relative strength in ether as the ETH-BTC ratio trades close to the recent range highs. The crypto news flow over the past 24 hours has been positive. Circle, the issuer of the regulated USDC stablecoin, priced its initial public offering at $31 per share, above the expected range of $24 to $26. The company sold around 34 million shares in the offering for a valuation of $1.1 billion. The California Assembly approved the AB-1052 bill, classifying long-inactive crypto assets as “unclaimed property” and allowing the state to hold them in custody. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham said that a whale address supposedly linked to Consensys purchased $320 million in ETH from Galaxy Digital and transferred it to a new address. Economic developments, however, have been dismal. Three soft U.S. economic reports, including the Fed's Beige book, sent the Treasury yields tumbling, reviving hopes for the Fed rate cut. Stay alert!

Chain sleuths found 93% of USD1’s circulating supply parked in just three wallets. Traders are concerned the pair’s depth, and therefore DEGO’s new price floor, could be yanked at any moment, sparking “exit-liquidity” accusations. Dego Finance said in a Thursday tweet that “fundamentals, tokenomics, long-term vision"" were unchanged and pinned the price collapse on “short-term market psychology."" The team claimed it is auditing on-chain flows and liaising with exchanges/market makers to dampen volatility. Skeptics warned of “ghost liquidity” and urge the team to court more reputable stablecoins such as USDT, FDUSD and USDC before deploying treasury funds. Dego will publish a post-mortem and treasury-transparency dashboard “within days,” host an AMA with core devs, and outline additional safeguards (e.g., time-locked treasury moves, multi-sig sign-offs) to rebuild confidence. Derivatives Positioning Growth in CME-listed BTC and ETH futures open interest has stagnated this month, leaving the annualized one-month basis between 5% and 10%. The figures show that institutions have scaled back demand. Binance's 1000SHIB perpetual futures and BCH perpetual futures show negative funding rates in a sign of bearish bias. Other major tokens, including BTC and ETH, continue to trade with mildly bullish or positive funding rates. On Deribit, the BTC call bias has weakened across multiple time frames. Still, higher strike BTC calls continue to dominate the 24-hour volume rankings.

2025-06-05T11:14:07,"Legendary Analyst John Bollinger Issues Critical Warning for Bitcoin (BTC)","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) made a name for itself with its new record of $111,000 just a few weeks ago, but then experienced a decline. The fact that this decline has come very close to the critical level of $100,000 has increased concerns that the correction could deepen even further. At this point, John Bollinger, a well-known analyst and inventor of Bollinger Bands, warned that the bullish momentum in Bitcoin was weakening and further pullbacks could occur. John Bollinger stated in his post from his X account that a “Three Peaks Push” pattern has formed on the Bitcoin chart. A picture perfect 'Three Pushes to a High' Bollinger Band Pattern marked the end of this rally phase for $BTCUSD . https://t.co/KZ3GWr7a2o — John Bollinger (@bbands) June 4, 2025 This pattern occurs when the Bitcoin price reaches the top of the Bollinger Band three times in a row but fails to move higher. Noting that this pattern has occurred, the analyst said that the pattern means that Bitcoin could experience further declines and the bullish momentum could reverse before experiencing a strong rise again. Looking at the chart shared by Bollinger, the price of Bitcoin reached levels close to $ 108,000 and tested the upper band three times. However, after these tests, the candles became smaller and the BTC price followed an uptrend instead of making a direct upward movement. This is usually interpreted as a sign that buyers have lost their strength and momentum and that the price needs to cool down a bit to start rising again. *This is not investment advice.
