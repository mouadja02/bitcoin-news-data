2025-06-05T20:40:12,"Market Strategist Explains Why Holding 5,589 XRP Is Important","A respected voice within the XRP community, known as J4b1, has advised investors to consider holding exactly 5,589 XRP tokens in preparation for what he believes may be a significant market development. He identified May 19 as a possible inflection point for the asset’s trajectory, suggesting that changes in XRP’s institutional accessibility could signal a broader shift in momentum. On May 19, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) officially introduced XRP futures, expanding the asset’s reach into the institutional investment space. While platforms such as Bitnomial and Coinbase had previously listed XRP derivatives, CME’s participation lends added credibility due to its established role in global finance. The futures launch is seen as a step toward mainstream financial integration and may serve as a foundation for further regulatory progress. #XRP is about to enter one of the most important moments in its history. Imagine holding 5589 XRP before the market explodes. Let me explain in this why May 19 could change everything pic.twitter.com/fS4GaWXENC — J4b1 (@XRPJ4b1) April 27, 2025 ETF Approval Could Follow Futures Milestone J4b1 emphasized that the introduction of XRP futures could lead to the eventual approval of spot-based XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), referencing a similar timeline followed by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. These assets saw ETF approval only after their futures markets became active and widely used. XRP appears to be progressing along a comparable path. Currently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing an XRP ETF proposal submitted by asset manager WisdomTree . Although the agency has postponed its decision, XRP advocates argue that such delays are common in ETF review processes and do not necessarily signal rejection. Many believe approval is likely in the long term. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Value of Holding 5,589 XRP Tokens J4b1’s specific recommendation to hold 5,589 XRP is based on potential future valuations. At the current price of approximately $2.20, such a position would require an investment of around $12,295. However, if XRP experiences substantial appreciation following ETF approval and broader adoption, the return on this investment could be significant. Analysts Offer Bullish Long-Term Projections Several market analysts have issued optimistic forecasts. Crypto analyst Cryptominder predicts that XRP could climb to $50, raising the value of 5,589 tokens to $279,450. Another analyst, BarriC, has projected a potential price of $100, which would increase the investment’s value to over $558,000. With XRP futures now trading on the CME and ETF applications under regulatory review, many in the crypto community view this moment as pivotal. J4b1’s call to accumulate 5,589 XRP reflects growing sentiment that the asset may soon enter a new phase of institutional adoption and price growth.

Webus International wants to set aside $300 million in XRP. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge VivoPower plans to use roughly $121 million. Wellgistics Health has earmarked $50 million. This marks a shift in how some firms think about keeping reserves, and it could change how they handle payments down the road. Webus International Plans Huge Reserve According to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Webus International aims to raise $300 million through non-equity funding. The company will tap its existing cash, credit lines backed by institutions, and support from shareholders. Companies are exploring the XRP treasury strategy: – Webus International: $300M – VivoPower: $121M – Wellgistics: $50M pic.twitter.com/C9rldXDdDG — Messari (@MessariCrypto) June 4, 2025 Once the money is in hand, Webus intends to buy XRP and hold it as part of its treasury. The plan comes with a partner: Samara Alpha Management. Webus says the altcoin will help the firm with global payment services. They think it can move value quickly across borders, and this treasury could back that. VivoPower’s XRP Ambition Based on reports, VivoPower is setting aside about $121 million to build its own XRP stash. The public announcement highlights a recent private placement led by Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud of Saudi Arabia. Most of the $121 million raised will go straight into the coin. VivoPower even wants to rebrand itself as the world’s first company focused on XRP. That’s a bold goal for a firm listed on Nasdaq. If everything goes to plan, XRP would play a big role in how VivoPower manages money and transactions. Wellgistics Health Joins Trend Wellgistics Health, a healthcare company you might not expect to dive into cryptocurrency, has its own $50 million set aside for XRP. The cash came in last month and is meant for PX (purchase and hold XRP) and to use XRP for real-time payments. Wellgistics says it wants to cut out delays and fees that come with old‐school payment methods. By sending and receiving XRP, the company believes it can move money faster when it pays vendors or gets paid by customers. It’s a sign that even outside tech or finance, firms see value in holding crypto.

It will cross the $10 mark in 2027 and the $20 mark in 2029. TON (The Open Network) is a decentralized protocol designed by Telegram and created by the community. The protocol is designed as a distributed supercomputer, or “super server,” that consists of TON Blockchain , TON DNS, TON Storage, and TON Sites. The native token for the network is called Toncoin. “Will TON ever go up? Can TON reach the $10 mark? Where will TON be in five years?” These are the questions traders and investors ask. Let’s answer them and more in our Toncoin price prediction.

Recent news Telegram’s deal with xAI, which would see Elon Musk’s AI company integrate into Telegram is a work in progress despite an announcement from Pavel Durov. While Durov confirmed that the deal is yet to be signed, the Telegram founder said there is an “agreement in principle,” which might be why TON still has significant support at the $3.0. Is TON a good buy? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, TON will trade higher in the years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Why is TON up? The rise in TON value could be attributed to the recovery in the crypto market, which saw Bitcoin rise above $100,000. Will TON reach $10? Yes, TON should rise above $10 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will TON reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, TON is unlikely to reach $100 before 2031. Will TON reach $1,000?

2025-06-05T20:24:54,"RichMiner green mining beats Musk’s carbon standards with potential 1.61% daily income","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto mining now consumes more energy than the Philippines, but RichMiner’s AI + green power model promises to deliver 1.61% daily returns. Table of Contents Three technical pillars for soaring returns Investor strategy with a daily return of 1.61% Future layout: DePIN+AI reconstructs energy network Conclusion The global energy consumption of crypto mining has exceeded the national electricity consumption of the Philippines, and 60% of the income of traditional mines is swallowed up by energy costs. When Musk suspended Bitcoin payments due to “carbon emissions” and the EU’s Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA) imposed a 30% carbon tax on non-green electricity mining, a cloud mining platform called RichMiner, relying on its “AI + green electricity” dual engines, set an industry record of 1.61% daily returns, opening up a new blue ocean of passive income for investors. Three technical pillars for soaring returns RichMiner’s core competitiveness stems from its hard-core architecture that deeply integrates AI algorithms, renewable energy and compliant financial frameworks: AI intelligent mining engine – the center for maximizing returns. Zero threshold dynamic switching: The platform’ AI analyzes the prices and computing power requirements of currencies such as BTC, ETH, and DOGE in real time, and automatically switches the user’s computing power to the currency with the highest return, with more than a thousand optimizations per day. Fully automated operation and maintenance: 24/7 monitoring of mining machine status, with a self-repair rate of 95%, ensuring continuous and uninterrupted operation of equipment. Anti-volatility strategy: When the halving of Bitcoin causes computing power fluctuations, the system automatically transfers 30% of computing power to emerging high-yield currencies (such as Dogecoin) to buffer the decline in revenue. Green power network – the cornerstone of low-cost mining: RichMiner deploys mining farms in renewable energy-rich areas such as plateaus and global deserts. Direct connection to power plants reduces costs by 40%: By building solar farms and wind farms, the electricity cost is only 60% of that of traditional mines. Zero-carbon certificate traceability: Every kilowatt-hour of electricity is matched with an international renewable energy certificate (REC), and carbon emissions are more than 75% lower than coal-fired power plants. Avoid electricity price fluctuations: Users do not need to bear the risk of fossil energy price increases (such as a 200% surge in electricity prices during the European gas crisis in 2024), and the stability of income is increased by 50%. Green data center diagram: RichMiner’s distributed green mines use solar and wind energy to directly supply electricity, reducing energy costs by 40%. Investor strategy with a daily return of 1.61% In 2025, RichMiner launched the “Short-term High Turnover Contract Matrix” to break through the traditional mining payback period limit with scientific calculations: Key strategies for explosive returns: Compound interest reinvestment: Daily returns (such as $8,800 contracts earning $141.68 per day) can be invested in higher-level contracts to increase returns; Newcomer benefits: Register and receive a $15 reward, with daily returns of $0.6. Hedge arbitrage: When the price of Bitcoin fluctuates by more than 15%, AI automatically starts option hedging, successfully avoiding three black swan crashes in Q4 2024. RichMiner promises a net profit of $3,825 for a $8,800 contract in 27 days, a product of algorithm optimization and green electricity cost advantages. Dual moats of compliance and security Against the backdrop of frequent industry chaos (e.g., the vacancy rate of China’s intelligent computing center exceeds 80%), RichMiner has built an institutional-level risk control system: Asset cold storage: 95% of user assets are stored in offline multi-signature wallets, with zero security incidents for three consecutive years from 2023 to 2025; Dual-track compliance: Comply with international anti-money laundering regulations and US SEC carbon disclosure requirements at the same time, and audit reports are made public quarterly; Green electricity financialization: Tokenize carbon emission reductions into RWA assets (e.g., 1 GREEN Token is generated for every MWh of electricity generated), which can be traded twice on the DeFi platform. Future layout: DePIN+AI reconstructs energy network RichMiner is evolving from a mining service provider to a green energy infrastructure operator: Photovoltaic storage and charging smart nodes: deploy physical nodes that integrate photovoltaic panels, energy storage batteries and charging piles. Users who invest $300K in nodes can obtain triple benefits of green electricity sales + mining + grid subsidies; EnergyGPT is online: AI models predict peak and valley electricity prices (such as the Texas power grid error rate Strategic cooperation with Bit Xiaolu: access to Norwegian hydropower and Bhutan wind power networks, with the goal of achieving 100% renewable energy coverage in 2025. Conclusion When traditional miners lose 30% of their profits due to carbon tax, RichMiner has opened up a channel for investors to achieve both profit and environmental protection with the triple barriers of AI dynamic optimization + green power cost reduction + compliance framework. With the full implementation of the EU MICA regulations (2025), non-green power mines will be eliminated faster, and those who plan ahead have taken the lead. Green computing power is the future asset; every low-carbon token is rewriting the valuation logic of the crypto world.

2025-06-05T20:11:38,"XRP Proponent Connects the Dots Between Ripple and BlackRock, Sets Timeline for $25 – $75 Price","A prominent XRP advocate, known as The Real Remi Relief on X, has stirred significant attention in the digital asset community with a bold post connecting influential names and institutions in a narrative that could have monumental implications for XRP’s valuation. The post outlines key relationships and recent developments involving Ripple, BlackRock, and former U.S. President Donald Trump, hinting at the possibility of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and projecting a dramatic price surge between $25.00 and $75.00 by June or July 2025. The Ripple-BlackRock Connection: Robert Mitchnick’s Role At the heart of Remi Relief’s post is Robert Mitchnick, a former Ripple employee who now serves as the head of digital assets at BlackRock. Mitchnick’s position at the world’s largest asset manager is not new, but his Ripple ties have gained renewed scrutiny amid growing speculation that BlackRock could soon enter the XRP ETF space . Ripple “ex”-employee is the head of digital assets at BlackRock Ladies and Gentlemen Do NOT forget: 1) Ripple “ex”-employee Robert Mitchnick is the head of digital assets at BlackRock 2) Larry Fink (BlackRock), Trump and Ripple were all in the Middle East together… pic.twitter.com/SFjK4Hzv8g — The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 5, 2025 Mitchnick, whose career includes a brief but strategic stint at Ripple, has led BlackRock’s digital asset initiatives since 2020. While BlackRock has been cautious in its crypto engagement, it made headlines in 2023 by securing SEC approval for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). The firm has since expanded into Ethereum, fueling market speculation that XRP could be next. The XRP community sees Mitchnick’s past association with Ripple as a potential strategic bridge, especially given Ripple’s efforts to establish XRP as a key liquidity solution for institutional finance. The possibility that BlackRock might harness XRP in future offerings, whether through ETFs, tokenized finance, or cross-border settlement, has ignited discussions across the digital asset space. BlackRock, Ripple, and Trump in the Middle East Another intriguing point raised by Remi Relief is the reported convergence of Larry Fink (CEO of BlackRock), Ripple representatives, and former President Donald Trump in the Middle East last month. While exact details of this gathering remain speculative and largely unreported by mainstream media, several crypto commentators have noted overlapping international appearances during the period, especially surrounding events in Abu Dhabi and Riyadh that focused on digital asset innovation and tokenized finance. Ripple has made no secret of its ambitions in the Middle East, where it has deepened ties with central banks and financial institutions. The region is also a growing focus for BlackRock, particularly in light of the Gulf states’ vision to diversify away from oil dependence and embrace fintech innovation. Trump’s presence, possibly tied to private investment discussions or speaking engagements, adds another layer of intrigue, though no direct link to XRP has been confirmed. While it is difficult to verify the specifics of the meeting alluded to in Remi Relief’s post, the overlapping presence of these powerful entities in the same geopolitical space at a time of accelerating crypto institutionalization cannot be easily dismissed. The BlackRock XRP ETF Rumor and Its Lingering Shadow Adding fuel to the fire is the memory of the so-called “false” XRP ETF filing that surfaced in 2023 . The application, which was publicly visible on the Delaware Department of State’s website, listed BlackRock as the issuer of an XRP Trust. BlackRock swiftly denied involvement and claimed no knowledge of the filing, prompting headlines and regulatory scrutiny. Despite the denial, the document was never officially removed. The filing remains publicly accessible, leading many in the XRP community to speculate that it may have been a strategic trial balloon or an internal filing prematurely leaked. Remi Relief references this episode as a potential breadcrumb pointing to future action. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The persistence of the XRP Trust filing, combined with BlackRock’s ongoing crypto exploration, continues to raise eyebrows. Institutional ETF filings often move behind closed doors until strategic moments of announcement. Some analysts believe BlackRock may be quietly gauging regulatory sentiment toward XRP, especially given Ripple’s partial legal victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2023. Institutional Floodgate Theory and the Hurricane Metaphor Perhaps the most striking part of Remi Relief’s post is the metaphor of ETFs arriving like a “hurricane… wiping everything off the exchanges.” This imagery captures a widely held belief in the XRP community: that institutional approval and capital influx will rapidly drain liquidity from retail exchanges and reallocate it into custodial ETF products. Remi Relief suggests that once BlackRock officially files for an XRP ETF, a domino effect will ensue, prompting other asset managers to follow suit. This is a scenario similar to what unfolded in the Bitcoin ETF space, where BlackRock’s entry was followed by a wave of applications and approvals from Fidelity, VanEck, and others. In the case of XRP, such a cascade would not only validate the asset’s regulatory standing but could also fuel a parabolic price move, especially if supply constraints, such as Ripple’s large escrow holdings and delisting on major U.S. exchanges, intersect with sudden institutional demand. The $25.00 – $75.00 Price Projection: Hope or Hype? The most headline-grabbing aspect of Remi Relief’s post is his projection that XRP could reach between $25.00 and $75.00 within the June–July 2025 window. For context, XRP is currently trading at approximately $2.15, making this forecast extremely ambitious. However, skeptics argue that such a price would require trillions in new capital and significant real-world utility adoption. While the $75.00 mark may seem extreme, many in the XRP community believe that a multi-dollar price is inevitable, especially if XRP becomes a foundational asset in global finance.

The company is working with an advisor to gauge buyer interest, the report said. CoinFlip could seek at least $1 billion in a deal, though the valuation is far from guaranteed. Discussions are still in early stages and may not result in a transaction. CoinFlip’s move follows a wave of high-profile crypto acquisitions in 2025, driven by a rally in bitcoin’s BTC price. Players like Kraken, Ripple and Coinbase have inked deals worth over billions of dollars this year, with others eyeing acquisitions to bolster their balance sheets or prepare for public listings. Founded in 2015, CoinFlip has expanded its footprint beyond the U.S. to markets like Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. It allows users to buy and sell crypto at physical terminals, catering to customers who prefer in-person transactions or lack access to digital platforms. The firm raised seed funding in 2018 from investors including Shoreline Venture Management and JetBlue’s VC arm.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/05/bitcoin-atm-operator-coinflip-explores-potential-1b-sale-bloomberg,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Markets|CoinFlip|M&A|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T20:03:51,"Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million, Calls it the Only “True Hard Money”","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) will soar to $1 million per coin, cementing its position as “the only true hard money.” Speaking on the sidelines of the Bitcoin 2025 Conference, Austin, Texas, last week, Hoskinson outlined a bold new vision for Bitcoin’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), highlighting a future in which BTC not only serves as a store of value but also powers a vast, scalable financial ecosystem. “In the next few years, Bitcoin could grow to $500,000 or even a million per coin,” Hoskinson said. “ We’re talking about a $10 trillion ecosystem, comparable to gold. But unlike gold, Bitcoin can move, earn yield, and power new systems. That’s the difference.” Notbaly, the session brought together key teams from Input Output, Lace, Fairgate, Babylon, and others, who showcased pioneering cross-chain integrations. The centerpiece was a live demonstration of a seamless on-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano within the Lace wallet, a technical milestone that enables Bitcoin to interact with DeFi protocols without centralized intermediaries. Hoskinson emphasized that the infrastructure being built is designed not only for Bitcoin, but also for its forks like Litecoin and Dogecoin. Central to this innovation is BitVMX, a groundbreaking virtual machine developed on the open-source RISC-V instruction set. BitVMX allows smart contracts, traditionally limited to networks like Ethereum and Cardano, to run on Bitcoin’s base layer using zero-knowledge proofs and off-chain computation. “This isn’t about replacing Bitcoin,” he noted. “ It’s about expanding what Bitcoin can do while preserving its core values, decentralization, immutability, and user sovereignty.” In a follow-up interview published Wednesday, Hoskinson likened the user experience of Bitcoin DeFi to a toggle in a wallet. “You turn DeFi mode on, and suddenly you can lend, borrow, swap-all while paying fees in Bitcoin and maintaining custody. When you’re done, turn it off. Your BTC goes back where it came from.” He further stressed that the underlying technology may be complex, but the user experience is designed to be intuitive and straightforward. Trustless bridges, smart contracts on Cardano, and BitVMX ’s taproot-based execution model all work under the hood to ensure security and transparency. Hoskinson concluded by reaffirming his long-standing belief in Bitcoin’s foundational role in crypto. “There is only one god in this space, and it’s Bitcoin. What we’re doing now is giving it the ecosystem it deserves.” He added. BTC traded at $101,966 at press time, reflecting a 2.92% drop in the past 24 hours.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-predicts-bitcoin-will-hit-1-million-calls-it-the-only-true-hard-money/,"ADA|BTC|DOGE|ETH|FIAT","Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson",cryptocompare

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could replace gold as “hard money” and could consequently go up 188x in two decades. “My long-term target for BTC price is not dollars as that continues to be debased. My target is World GDP/21 million. Give or take +/- 50%. It will take the good part of two decades to get there… …If it takes 20 years to get to equilibrium and the US dollar is still a leading currency, then $20 million per coin +/- 50%.” In 20 years, the analyst says the global nominal GDP could nearly quadruple from the current level. “Real GDP growth is 2%, while debasement is 5%. So if we inflate GDP at 7% per year for 20 years measured in debasing US dollar, that would be $425 trillion or $20 million per coin give or take 50%.” Over the shorter term, the analyst says Bitcoin is finding it “hard to move up” as there’s a high level of speculative activity in the market. “NOW is a BAD TIME to take paper bets on BTC. It’s open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting. BTC is waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time highs.” Bitcoin is trading at $105,074 at time of writing.

While Uber is not currently planning to add digital assets such as Bitcoin to its corporate balance sheet, Khosrowshahi confirmed Bitcoin’s status as a “proven store of value.” BREAKING: $176 BILLION UBER CEO TELLS BLOOMBERG #BITCOIN IS A ""PROVEN"" STORE OF VALUE AND THAT IT'S EXPLORING ACCEPTING CRYPTO PAYMENTS BTC IS GOING MAINSTREAM.

That’s good for business, that’s good for our riders and our eaters,” he explained in earlier interviews. Stablecoins are gaining traction as a tool for cross-border payments due to their ability to provide faster, lower-cost transfers compared to conventional banking systems. For global companies like Uber, the adoption of stablecoins could greatly improve international fund management. Uber stock was also up by 1.11% at the time of writing, according to Google Finance. Stablecoin Regulation Bill Faces Key Decisions Meanwhile, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins ( GENIUS ) Act is scheduled for Senate debate and could pass as early as this week, with strong bipartisan support expected to move it to the House.

His statement comes in the wake of Musk’s increasingly sharp critiques of U.S. fiscal policy and ballooning national debt. Notably, on June 4, in a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Musk slammed the recently proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a $5 trillion legislative package that extends tax cuts while raising the debt ceiling. The Tesla Billionaire warned that America is spiraling toward a future where interest payments alone could consume nearly all government revenue. “We pay over $100 billion per month in interest on the national debt ,” Musk posted. “At this rate, there will be no money left for Social Security, healthcare, or defense .” The post drew attention from key figures in the crypto space. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong suggested that if the U.S. fails to rein in deficit spending, Bitcoin could emerge as a reserve currency alternative. Musk responded with a solitary American flag emoji, a cryptic but potent gesture many in the Bitcoin community interpreted as a signal of agreement. Max Keiser quickly capitalized on the moment. “ Elon & Brian are about to shift from Bitcoin agnostics to FULL BITCOIN MAXIMALIST mode. ” Keiser posted , later doubling down in a follow-up prediction that Bitcoin could surge to $2.2 million in the near future. According to Keiser, Musk’s frustration with fiat-driven debt dynamics reflects a growing realization that Bitcoin is the only exit strategy. “Everything goes to zero against Bitcoin,” Keiser added in a separate tweet . “ Everything, and I mean everything , is either relatively or absolutely a Ponzi scheme when compared to BTC.” Tesla, which still holds over 9,700 BTC, has not added to its Bitcoin position since late 2024. However, many now speculate that a more aggressive accumulation strategy may be imminent, similar to MicroStrategy’s. Unchained Capital’s Joe Burnett even suggested Musk might soon adopt a Bitcoin-centric treasury model across his companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X. Elsewhere, analyst Will Clemente and entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano echoed that sentiment. “The ultimate rebellion against reckless government spending would be Musk doubling down on Bitcoin,” Pompliano wrote. That said, while Musk hasn’t officially confirmed any major moves, his recent rhetoric is starting to align closely with core Bitcoin maximalist ideology, especially the belief that only a fixed-supply, decentralized currency can protect wealth from inflation and government mismanagement.

Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price attempted to hold above $2.3 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. However, buyers’ failure triggered a bearish rally toward $2.1. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment?

As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.8 and a maximum of $3.4, with an average of $2.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction June 2025 $1.8 $2.5 $3.4 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $2.3, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Some of these investors might be waiting for the price surge triggered by the Bitcoin Halving to maximize their profits. Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA as it reaches its peak moment.

2025-06-05T19:22:33,"Ethereum ETF Holdings Spike as BlackRock Snaps Up $560 Million in ETH","Ethereum (ETH) trades within a narrow range, with major institutional investors increasing their exposure. According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, BlackRock has accumulated over 214,000 ETH over the week—worth approximately $560 million. The move coincides with a period of price consolidation for ETH, which has hovered between $2,500 and $2,700 over the last several weeks. Despite low price volatility, ETF inflows have steadily risen, pointing to growing institutional confidence. BlackRock leads ETH inflows amid subdued price action BlackRock’s activity suggests a deliberate accumulation strategy. By building positions during a period of market calm, the firm appears to be positioning itself ahead of potential macro or regulatory shifts. Data confirms the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has attracted sustained inflows since U.S. regulators approved Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year. According to data from SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs posted $109.43 million in net daily inflows, of which BlackRock alone accounted for $77.06 million. This marked the 12th consecutive day of positive inflows into ETH-based funds. By contrast, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded significant outflows on May 30 and June 2—totaling $561 million. While inflows briefly returned to the firm’s Bitcoin product with $58 million on Tuesday, the figure was still dwarfed by Ethereum’s ETF momentum. TheBlock’s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator shows Ethereum’s next major resistance zone between $2,726 and $2,856. Roughly 4.13 million ETH—held by 2.7 million addresses—were acquired within this band. Meanwhile, over 12 million ETH sit in the out-of-the-money zone at an average cost basis of $2,613. ETH source: LookonChain This imbalance suggests that many investors are still in accumulation mode. The at-the-money zone remains larger than immediate resistance, indicating that ETH may be under less near-term sell pressure. Joao Wedson, CEO of analytics firm Alphractal, said in a tweet that significant market-maker activity at lower levels could signal a breakout is forming. He identified a short-term target of $2,830 following a break above $2,660. Wedson also highlighted $2,556 as a key stop-loss threshold based on aggregated liquidation data. Ethereum Technical setup supports recovery, but ETH remains range-bound Ethereum’s daily chart shows modest strength. A bullish crossover between the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages recently formed, supporting the short-term outlook. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates renewed buyer interest.

2025-06-05T19:21:19,"Bitcoin (BTC) Sees Highest Wallet Growth and Circulation Spikes of 2025","Bitcoin climbed to a fresh peak in May, but upward momentum slowed as long-term holders began locking in profits. Its price has remained relatively stable this week, fluctuating within a narrow range of $103,000 to $106,000. At the time of writing, the crypto asset trades below $105,000, which represents a minor decline over the past day. Despite the subdued price action, Bitcoin is seeing an increased user participation. Strong BTC Network Growth Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has spiked sharply this week, according to the latest analysis from Santiment. On May 29, the network registered 556,830 newly created wallets – the highest daily total since December 2, 2023, representing a significant surge in user growth. Just days later, on June 2, Bitcoin saw its most active circulation day since December 8, 2024, with 241,360 BTC moved. These activity spikes coincide with Bitcoin’s price trading just below $105,000. Santiment noted that rising network growth and token circulation are typically bullish indicators, pointing to a renewed interest and broader utility at a time when the crypto market continues to consolidate. The latest activity comes as Bitcoin sees renewed bullish accumulation, with new whales, wallets holding 1,000+ BTC with coins aged under six months, doubling their holdings to 1.1 million BTC since March. This 600K BTC surge, which is around $63 billion, now represents 5.6% of the total supply, indicating intensified fresh capital inflows. Unlike long-held coins, these recent buys suggest increased investor conviction. Combined with a 30% drop in exchange balances and increasing institutional adoption, market experts view this behavior as a setup for a supply squeeze. While increased network activity and accumulation trends paint a strong demand-side picture, miner-focused metrics are now offering additional insights into the current market setup. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Rare Buy Signal Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbons indicator has issued a new buy signal, highlighting stress within the mining sector. The tool monitors the 30-day and 60-day hashrate moving averages to detect periods when mining becomes less profitable. Such stress often forces miners to sell their BTC, adding short-term selling pressure. However, this has historically reflected attractive buying opportunities for long-term investors. Given Bitcoin’s hash rate has recently hit all-time highs, the emergence of this signal suggests the current market dip may be worth buying. It’s important to note that, aside from 2021’s mining ban in China, this indicator has proven consistently reliable in identifying solid entry points.

2025-06-05T19:17:28,"JPMorgan Plunges Deeper Into Crypto By Letting Clients Use Bitcoin ETFs As Loan Collateral","JPMorgan, America’s biggest bank by total assets, is set to let its trading and wealth-management clients use certain crypto-linked assets, including spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as loan collateral in the coming weeks, as the United States regulatory environment warms to digital assets. According to a June 4 report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the banking giant will start by allowing financing backed by shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, currently the largest US spot Bitcoin ETF with over $70 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan will reportedly consider clients’ crypto holdings when assessing their total net worth and liquidity, treating cryptocurrencies like real estate and vehicles when determining a client’s ability to repay a loan. JPMorgan’s Love-Hate Relationship With Bitcoin Despite the expanded offerings for trading and wealth-management clients, Dimon has long been a Bitcoin skeptic. The billionaire banker has previously called Bitcoin a “pet rock” and asserted that crypto’s “true use case” was for sex traffickers and money launderers. While he recently confirmed that the bank he heads would soon start to allow customers to buy Bitcoin, the famously crypto-skeptical banker hasn’t changed his tune. Nevertheless, the bank’s latest pivot underscores the increasing institutional pressure to accommodate crypto as the asset class’s footprint in traditional finance deepens. This comes as US President Donald Trump has been easing restrictions on banks and crypto-centric businesses. In April 2025, the Federal Reserve rescinded guidance that served to deter banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities. The US Office of the Comptroller said in May that banks could now buy and sell crypto they hold in custody at customers’ direction. Later the same month, the Wall Street Journal reported that several US banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup, were holding early talks to issue a joint crypto stablecoin. That said, Dimon’s JPMorgan could dive deeper into crypto with more offerings amid the changing regulatory winds.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-plunges-deeper-into-crypto-by-letting-clients-use-bitcoin-etfs-as-loan-collateral/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|JPMorgan",cryptocompare

The company submitted a Form S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF on June 5. The proposed fund would hold spot Bitcoin and list on NYSE Arca, exposing investors to the apex cryptocurrency via shares on the stock exchange. “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to generally reflect the performance of the price of Bitcoin,” the filing reads. The new fund entails exclusivity clauses. According to the S-1, Crypto.com will offer certain services exclusively to the trust behind the product. Neither the ticker symbol for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF nor the sponsor fee has been disclosed in the initial Form S-1. The S-1 comes two days after NYSE Arca filed a Form 19b-4 seeking exchange approval to list and trade shares of the ETF. Both filings are standard dual applications required before an ETF can go live in the US. The S-1 includes detailed information about the fund’s structure, strategy, and risk disclosures. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the risk section highlights potential implications of President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto push and regulatory changes. The filing notes the establishment of an SEC crypto-task force in January and Trump’s March executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, adding that “it is not possible to fully predict the potential impacts on the Sponsor, the Trust, TMTG, Crypto.com, their affiliates or third-party service providers.” “Pretty sure it’s the first time ever the advisor is in the risk section,” Balchunas posted on X. If approved and listed, the ETF will see crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, which is listed as sponsor, act in the role an advisor would play for an ETF filed under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940. Approval for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would deepen President Trump’s ties with the crypto market. Trump Media and Technology Group recently announced a $2.3 billion offering to create a corporate Bitcoin treasury. In addition, the proposed fund would join a bevy of 11 U.S. spot BTC ETFs approved by the SEC for trading on Wall Street last year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the most successful ETF launches in the history of U.S. ETFs, with roughly $70 billion in assets since its debut.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trumps-truth-social-takes-next-step-toward-launching-bitcoin-etf-with-s-1-filing/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T19:07:07,"Major Confirmation from Deutsche Bank for XRP and Crypto Prices","A recent statement from Deutsche Bank has brought renewed optimism to the cryptocurrency sector, particularly for XRP. Highlighted in a detailed research report, Deutsche Bank confirmed what many in the space have long believed: clearer regulatory frameworks like MiCA will push up cryptocurrency prices. This validation comes at a critical moment, as the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) now moves from policy to full enforcement in 2025. Deutsche Bank: Regulation Will Drive Prices Higher In the research note authored by Marion Laboure, Ph.D., and Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace, Deutsche Bank made it clear that institutional adoption is set to accelerate thanks to improved regulatory clarity. The bank pointed to the EU’s MiCA framework as a transformative force, stating: “A clearer regulatory framework should drive corporate adoption, pushing up prices.” This sentiment was echoed by SMQKE, who spotlighted the research with the caption: “Major Confirmation from Deutsche Bank.” Major Confirmation from Deutsche Bank. “Clearer regulatory frameworks like MICA WILL PUSH UP CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES.” Documented. https://t.co/UJzZdZhXKx pic.twitter.com/i3DFLulVxt — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 The Deutsche Bank report was released after the U.S. SEC approved multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that already boosted market sentiment. But it’s MiCA, the EU’s legal framework for crypto-assets, that Deutsche Bank sees as the longer-term catalyst for sustained institutional inflows and price appreciation. MiCA: Now Fully Enforceable Across the EU MiCA entered into force in June 2023, with its rules on stablecoins becoming applicable by June 2024, and its broader rules for crypto-asset issuers and service providers taking effect in December 2024. As of now, MiCA is fully operational across the European Economic Area. MiCA introduces legal definitions and licensing requirements for Utility Tokens, Stablecoins (ARTs and EMTs), and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). Crucially, MiCA excludes DeFi, NFTs, and crypto conglomerates, focusing its scope on centralized actors and custodial services. XRP Recognized as a Utility Token Under MiCA One of MiCA’s most important clarifications is its classification of XRP as a utility token . This designation affirms that XRP is not a security, aligning with Ripple’s long-standing legal position and clearing a regulatory pathway for XRP’s use across Europe. As a utility token, XRP falls squarely within MiCA’s oversight, which means issuers and service providers working with XRP now benefit from full legal certainty when operating in the EU. This gives XRP a strategic compliance advantage over many other digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the contrary, Bitcoin and Ethereum have been excluded from MiCA’s jurisdiction. The reason? Both lack a specific issuer, a core requirement for inclusion under the MiCA framework. As such, the EU will regulate BTC and ETH under other legacy financial laws or future regulatory efforts. This exclusion puts XRP in a favorable position from a legal and compliance standpoint. As firms seek regulatory certainty, XRP offers a clearer path than Bitcoin or Ethereum in the European Union. A Bullish Outlook for 2025 and Beyond With MiCA fully active and Deutsche Bank’s endorsement now public, the message is unmistakable: clear regulation is good for crypto. XRP’s alignment with MiCA provides it with a robust foundation for adoption, particularly among European institutions looking for compliant blockchain solutions. As Deutsche Bank concluded, the stage is now set for corporate integration, institutional participation, and ultimately, price growth driven by fundamentals, not speculation. SMQKE’s statement captures it best: “Documented.” The groundwork has been laid, and the confirmation is now in black and white. 2025 may be the year regulatory clarity becomes crypto’s greatest asset.

2025-06-05T19:00:37,"Beijing Fast-Tracks 24-Hour Seized Crypto Liquidation via Hong Kong Exchanges","Key Takeaways: Beijing’s police authority has introduced a formal process for liquidating seized digital assets through Hong Kong exchanges. The system was developed with the Beijing Equity Exchange and involves third-party custody and compliant offshore liquidation. The first test case was completed in Shunyi District, with funds transferred to the national treasury within 24 hours. Mainland companies, such as JD.com, are increasingly using Hong Kong’s regulatory structure to conduct blockchain-related pilots. Beijing’s municipal police authority has formalized a new mechanism for disposing of virtual assets seized in criminal cases, according to an announcement published by the Legal Affairs Division of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) on June 5. Since the trading of cryptocurrencies is prohibited in mainland China , the process would involve liquidation through Hong Kong exchanges under a framework co-developed with the Beijing Equity Exchange (BEE). China imposes Fresh Ban on Holding Crypto Including Bitcoin The Chinese government has announced a sweeping new ban that prohibits not just trading or mining of cryptocurrencies, but now extends to individual ownership of digital assets like Bitcoin, according to a report… pic.twitter.com/QO5RqqpnEC — CrowdFundJunction (Crypto VC) (@cfjcrypto) May 30, 2025 Beijing Police Formalize Digital Asset Disposal Framework Under the system, the PSB entrusts confiscated digital assets to BEE, which selects third-party providers to conduct technical inspection, custody, and liquidation. Digital assets are then sold via a compliant exchange in Hong Kong. The proceeds, after currency conversion and regulatory review, are transferred to the PSB and eventually routed to China’s national treasury. The new process addresses the regulatory block that currently prevents the direct liquidation of cryptocurrencies within mainland China. It also builds on Beijing’s existing “green channel” for handling physically seized assets, which was established in 2017. Authorities said the method was tested in a recent case handled by police in the city’s Shunyi District. The process, from asset custody to final remittance, was completed within 24 hours. A reserve pricing system based on market consultation is used to mitigate volatility risks, and service providers must post a 110% performance bond. The entire workflow is subject to real-time oversight and digital recording. Hong Kong as Regulatory Bridge for Mainland Crypto Operations Legal training has also been expanded to include digital asset topics. Recent sessions have featured cold wallet protocols and blockchain tracing, with guest lecturers from academic institutions and technical agencies. Mainland-based firms have increasingly turned to Hong Kong to manage regulatory constraints around digital assets. JD.com launched a stablecoin payment pilot using Hong Kong’s licensed infrastructure, part of a broader pattern of companies using the city’s clearer crypto rules to experiment with blockchain-based services. The use of Hong Kong exchanges to liquidate seized crypto further demonstrates how mainland authorities are treating the city’s legal structure as an operational extension for handling digital assets. While this doesn’t indicate regulatory convergence, it reinforces Hong Kong’s role as a buffer zone where mainland entities can access functions that remain restricted at home. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could this model eventually be applied to civil or bankruptcy-related crypto disputes in China? While this mechanism was designed for criminal asset seizures, this structure might serve as a template for handling digital assets in broader legal contexts if the regulatory stance evolves. What might other jurisdictions learn from Beijing’s outsourced disposal model? For countries that ban domestic crypto trading but encounter digital assets in enforcement cases, the use of proximate, regulated offshore centers like Hong Kong could offer a legal workaround without revising core policy positions. Who selects the compliant exchanges used in Hong Kong? The Beijing Equity Exchange appoints third-party service providers, who are responsible for custody and liquidation via licensed Hong Kong exchanges.

With $20.8 million raised and all 15 presale stages sold out, the project has entered its final Bonus Round—offering LCAI tokens at a fixed price of $0.007. As it approaches a July mainnet launch, Lightchain AI is rolling out AI-native infrastructure, developer tools, and smart utility frameworks designed for intelligent decentralized applications. While Bitcoin holds the legacy, Lightchain AI is building the future—where data, logic, and blockchain power combine to deliver real-world, AI-driven solutions. Bitcoin Holds Strong as Market’s Premier Store of Value Bitcoin (BTC) – the world’s number one cryptocurrency – is still finding more and more solid ground as the go-to digital store of value, not least because of strong institutional support and positive legislative news. As of May 25, 2025, BTC has a price of around $108,137 with a market cap that is over $2.1 trillion. A large part of Bitcoin’s dominance has been from institutional adoption. Nowadays, public companies own about 15% of the total Bitcoin supply, valued at around $349 billion. Institutional investors may control 20% of BTC supply by 2026, analysts tell Bloomberg Such a seizure of BTC supply from investors makes BTC increasingly scarce for investment and supporting its price point. Investor sentiment has also gotten a boost from regulatory clarity. While it is appreciated that Bitcoin could be used as a hedge against economic uncertainty, the willingness of the U.S. government, among other things, to establish a federal Bitcoin reserve has increased the attractiveness of Bitcoin. Furthermore, large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, has started to offer Bitcoin investments to clients, which suggests an increasing acceptance of digital currency in traditional finance. All these have contributed to strengthen Bitcoin’s position in the market due to institutional adoption and a favorable regulatory environment. Lightchain AI Introduces Advanced Utility for a Smarter Blockchain Era Lightchain AI is introducing a smarter blockchain era by embedding advanced utility features that go far beyond basic infrastructure. At the core is the Transparent AI Framework, which ensures that all AI computations are auditable, accountable, and traceable on-chain—solving trust issues in AI deployment. Governance Integration further empowers the community by enabling token holders to vote on upgrades, proposals, and AI model decisions, reinforcing decentralized control. In a unique move, Lightchain AI also includes a Memecoin Launchpad, offering creators a secure, AI-enhanced platform to launch meme tokens with built-in transparency and automation. These features together form a dynamic environment where users, developers, and communities can build, govern, and innovate in sync—positioning Lightchain AI as a pioneer in intelligent decentralized ecosystems.

2025-06-05T18:46:37,"California Crypto Bill Rockets Forward, Promising New Protections for Dormant Assets","California is moving to reshape how unclaimed digital assets are handled after the State Assembly unanimously approved Assembly Bill 1052 (AB 1052) on June 3. The bill, which passed 78–0, would update the state’s unclaimed property laws to prevent dormant cryptocurrencies from being automatically liquidated. Instead, assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum would be held in their native form by a licensed custodian designated by the state. The bill now heads to the California Senate for further consideration. New California Bill Protects Dormant Crypto Wallets JUST IN : California Assembly passes bill to regulate Digital Assets under 'Unclaimed Property' law. The bill now moves to the Senate. Law explained: Assets left on an exchange for 3 years will transferred to the state, and can then be claimed by the owner. pic.twitter.com/u9XftO0XRy — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 4, 2025 The bill only affects digital assets held by third-party custodians such as centralized exchanges or banks. Anyone using self-hosted wallets or holding their private keys directly is entirely excluded from the bill’s reach. Even for custodial accounts, the law applies only after three full years of complete inactivity. That inactivity must meet two strict conditions: the custodian must be unable to establish contact, and the account must show no signs of ownership. Additionally, the clock resets with virtually any user activity. If the account holder logs in, makes a transaction, responds to an email, clicks a verification link, or even contacts the platform about another account, the three-year countdown restarts. These safeguards ensure that genuinely active or intermittently used accounts cannot be deemed abandoned. Once that full period passes with no contact or activity, custodians are required to notify the state and report the asset. However, unlike older forfeiture laws, this legislation mandates that the cryptocurrency be transferred in its native form into the care of a licensed state-appointed custodian. The bill’s provisions also place responsibility on licensed custodians to safeguard these assets, raising new compliance challenges. Questions around key storage, asset verification, and technical protocols are likely to become focal points in Senate deliberations. ‘Not Your Keys’ Gets a Legal Boost The bill also clarifies how digital assets like Bitcoin should be handled when left unclaimed, potentially strengthening the principle of “not your keys, not your coins” by requiring clearer custodial accountability. The legislation arrives as other states also move to define crypto ownership and unclaimed property rights, but with different strategies. Arizona recently enacted House Bill 2749 on May 7, creating a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund. Under the law, digital assets can be held in their native form if unclaimed for three years. Arizona Governor Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law, which allows the state to establish a reserve fund to hold unclaimed crypto, airdrops. #Arizona #CryptoBill #UnclaimedCrypto https://t.co/Hhu4wJa2Tm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Qualified custodians are authorized to stake or receive rewards on those assets, with earnings deposited into the new state fund. The bipartisan bill, championed by House Commerce Committee Chair Rep. Jeff Weninger, marks one of the first formal crypto reserve initiatives at the state level. Florida has become the latest US state to abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dealing another setback. #Bitcoin #Reserve https://t.co/kRZo2V0BzE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 6, 2025 Meanwhile, Florida has taken a different path. On May 3, it withdrew two key bills, House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 , intended to establish a Bitcoin reserve. The Florida Senate confirmed both proposals were removed from consideration just one day after the legislative session ended, indicating a pause in the state’s crypto ambitions. Texas is exploring its own frameworks, and Wyoming continues to lead with digital asset-friendly laws . However, the lack of federal clarity still leaves the U.S. with a patchwork of crypto rules.

2025-06-05T18:45:00,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.60 Market cap $179.91M 24-hour trading volume $46.8M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $8.98 24-hour low $8.50 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 12.60% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $18.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI moves into consolidation On the day of writing (May 6), ORDI’s price dropped by 3.59% in 24 hours and rose 19.67% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume dropped by 5.87% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $105,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 49.94. It is oversold when it drops below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart. Image source: TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI has reversed from last month’s high at $13.61 and is at $8.90, losing over 20% of its value. Its volatility is dropping on the 4-hour timeframe. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.13 BUY SMA 5 8.59 BUY SMA 10 9.52 SELL SMA 21 9.97 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.27 SELL SMA 200 18.20 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 9.38 SELL EMA 5 8.97 SELL EMA 10 8.40 BUY EMA 21 8.39 BUY EMA 50 9.99 SELL EMA 100 14.31 SELL EMA 200 21.18 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is consolidating after correcting from the month’s high. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come. Ordinals price prediction June 2025 The Ordinals forecast for June is a maximum price of $9.01 and a minimum price of $6.25. The average trading price will be $7.02.

Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T18:41:31,"Former DOGE Head Elon Musk Tells Lawmakers To Kill Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful’ Bill","After stepping down from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk is publicly attacking the President’s “big, beautiful” bill. In a post on the social media platform X, the platform which he owns, Musk urges Americans to contact their representatives to prevent Trump’s plan from “bankrupting America.” “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” According to Musk , Trump’s highly self-touted economic plan is a “disgusting abomination.” “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” Furthermore, Musk says the shortcomings of Trump’s bill are significant enough to require the entire document to be redrafted. “A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn’t massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 TRILLION DOLLARS.” Musk’s opposition to a budget plan that increases the debt ceiling should come as little surprise. The former DOGE head has long publicly stated that America’s growing debt will ultimately lead to financial ruin. “DOGE has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.” According to a NBC News report, during a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump had the following to say about his former ally : “I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot… Elon’s upset because we took the EV (electric vehicle) mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles and they’re having a hard time with electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning.” However, according to Musk, Trump wouldn’t even be president without him. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-05T18:39:13,"XRP holds key support: is a new bullish trend forming?","XRP is currently holding firm at a critical technical zone, defying broader market weakness. With volume poised to return and support levels stacking up, could this mark the beginning of a bullish continuation? Despite market-wide consolidation and uncertainty, XRP ( XRP ) has maintained its footing at a crucial support level. A combination of high-timeframe support, trend line confluence, and the 200-day moving average is creating a foundation for a potential bullish structure. All eyes are now on volume, the missing ingredient that could fuel XRP’s next move. Key technical points Support Confluence: XRP is holding at the intersection of a key trend line, high-timeframe support, and the 200 moving average – a rare triple-layered support structure. Volume Profile Decline: A noticeable volume drop suggests accumulation; a volume influx is likely and may lead to a sharp breakout. I mpulsive Breakout Candle: The recent trend line break was backed by an impulsive candle, establishing a local high and validating early bullish acceptance. XRPUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP’s current consolidation at support is more than just a pause, it’s a potential base. Price is respecting a long-term trend line that intersects perfectly with high-timeframe horizontal support and the 200-day moving average, forming a strong technical confluence. This level has consistently held across multiple timeframes, and recent price behavior confirms that bulls are actively defending the zone. Adding to the case for bullish continuation, the volume profile shows a significant decline during this retest. This low-volume environment is often indicative of accumulation, a phase that typically precedes expansion, especially when paired with structural strength. Once volume returns, price often moves decisively in the direction of the dominant trend, in this case, upward. You might also like: Buyers are winning big in BlockDAG while Solaxy hits $43M and BTC bull raises $6.7M The recent breakout above the trend line was confirmed by an impulsive candle that printed a new local high. Price is now undergoing a bullish retest of that breakout zone. If this retest holds and forms a higher low, it will solidify a new bullish market structure and open the door to a move toward the swing high and potentially beyond. What to expect in the coming price action If XRP maintains support and volume re-enters the market, expect a continuation toward recent highs. A confirmed higher low in the current retest zone will signal a structural shift and the potential start of a new rally. Until volume returns, however, the risk of continued sideways price action remains.
