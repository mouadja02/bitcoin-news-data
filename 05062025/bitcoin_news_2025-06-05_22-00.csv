In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Altcoin Sherpa tells his 247,600 followers on the social media platform X that the top crypto asset by market cap has seen “cancerous” price action during the last few days. “Cancerous price action for BTC the last few days, better to stay away from the market if in active trades (impossible).” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X According to Sherpa, the flagship digital asset could dip down to the low $104,000 range if it loses its current support level. “Still choppy, no real momentum in either direction right now. Still long but pretty small size (still have spot). Wouldn’t be surprised to see the low $104,000 at this point if current level doesn’t hold for BTC.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X BTC is trading for $104,549 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day. Moving on to the S&P 500-based parody memecoin SPX6900 ( SPX ), the analyst says that its chart appears healthy and that the asset should continue its upward ascent as long as BTC remains stable. “I don’t care what you people say, that chart is pretty damn incredible given the conditions. This one goes higher in the mid-term as long as BTC is stable, in my opinion.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X SPX is trading for $1.18 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

In this transaction, which reached a total notional value of $ 1.19 billion, a position of 11,350 BTC was opened and only $ 7.5 million was paid as a premium. The block transaction consists of two parts: First, with a bullish spread of 3,800 for September maturity, investors are expecting an increase in both price and volatility in the long term. Secondly, the sale of June maturity at-the-money (ATM) call options was carried out. This sale, together with the September purchases, creates calendar spreads and shows that the short-term (for June) bullish expectations are limited. Related News: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping - Is the Trade War Coming to an End?

2025-06-05T19:30:53,"Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Reaches New Record But SHIB Whales Are Exiting – What’s Happening?","Shiba Inu is facing a crossroads with two interesting metrics from within its ecosystem. On one side, its layer-2 blockchain Shibarium has just crossed an impressive transactional milestone that points to long-term growth. But on the other side, recent on-chain data suggests that large holders, which are often seen as the backbone of market confidence, are making outflows from their exchanges in what appears to be the biggest whale outflows since March. Shibarium Reaches New Transaction Record, Whales Exiting Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 network, has now reached a milestone of 1.2 billion transactions. This interesting milestone is relayed through data from the Shibarium explorer website, which shows that the layer-2 network is currently just over the 1.2 billion transaction threshold, with 1,200,301,394 transactions involving 263.3 million addresses. This transaction count figure signals steady onboarding and sustained blockchain activity since the platform’s launch 19 months ago. The activity is quite notable, especially considering it comes barely five weeks after Shibarium reached the 1 billion transaction mark on April 1. The total block count has also risen beyond 11.3 million, just two months after it first registered 10 million blocks. However, despite these long-term indicators of network growth, daily usage on Shibarium is slipping . The number of daily transactions dropped below the million mark on May 22, when it logged 1.51 million, and has continued to decline ever since. At the time of writing, the total number of transactions recorded on Shibarium in the past 24 hours was 63,780. This extends its run of lower than 100,000 daily transactions since May 27. At the same time Shibarium is reaching new milestones, large SHIB holders have started pulling billions of tokens out of their wallets. According to data from IntoTheBlock , whale outflows have risen by an astonishing 992% in just a few days, from 105.39 billion SHIB on June 1 to 2.94 trillion SHIB in the past 24 hours. Interestingly, the 2.94 trillion SHIB outflow from whale addresses in the past 24 hours is the largest outflow count since March 20. These outflows represent SHIB tokens leaving the addresses of major holders, and can be interpreted as a signal that they are selling or preparing to exit their positions. Where Does Shiba Inu Go From Here? Shibarium’s long-term growth shows that Shiba Inu’s ecosystem continues to expand and develop, which is a factor that could be considered bullish for the Shiba Inu price. Yet, the simultaneous withdrawal of nearly 3 trillion SHIB from whale addresses introduces the kind of selling pressure that can erase weeks of progress in a matter of hours. Unsurprisingly, this outflow from whale addresses has been reflected in the recent price of Shiba Inu. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001284, down by 2.3% in the past 24 hours and 11.12% in the past seven days. Continued outflow from whale addresses could increase the selling pressure on Shiba Inu in the coming days.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-high/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Shiba Inu|IntoTheBlock|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium network|Shibarium news|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT",cryptocompare

Image source: TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, the TIA price may drop below the immediate support line at $2.054, resulting in a correction to $1.886. Is TIA a good investment? Celestia and modular rollups enhance Ethereum ‘s performance and expansion, impacting the competition among L1 public chains. Public chains like BNB Chain and Celo opt to integrate with Ethereum as L2 Rollups due to liquidity and cost advantages. Celestia’s scalability and user-friendly design make it an appealing choice for developers, offering additional scalability to the blockchain ecosystem. Why is the TIA price down today? TIA’s price attempted to hold above $2.3 as the overall market sentiment turned bullish. However, buyers’ failure triggered a bearish rally toward $2.1. Will the TIA price reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment and buying demand, we might see TIA’s price touching the $100 milestone in the coming years. According to our prediction, the TIA price might hit the $100 mark in 2030. Will the TIA price reach $1,000? If the altcoin market remains robust in the coming years and Celestia develops more user-friendly utilities, its price might surpass $1K. Is TIA a good long-term investment? Yes, TIA is a good long-term investment option. As buyers’ interest grows and the network expands, we might see profitable returns. Recent news/opinions on TIA Noble has introduced AppLayer, a new platform designed to help developers create financial tools and apps with fast, reliable stablecoin infrastructure on the Celestia network. Celestia price prediction June 2025 Celestia’s price is recovering its momentum as Bitcoin aims for a surge above the $110K mark. As a result, we expect the TIA price to record a minimum of $1.8 and a maximum of $3.4, with an average of $2.5. Celestia Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Celestia Price Prediction June 2025 $1.8 $2.5 $3.4 Celestia price prediction 2025 Historically, the full impact of a Bitcoin Halving isn’t felt until about a year to a year and a half afterward. This suggests that new all-time highs for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might occur around 2025. Considering this, along with the ongoing development of the Celestia network and the growing adoption of modular blockchain technology, the outlook appears positive for the year ahead. Based on a deep technical analysis of past TIA price data, the price of Celestia is predicted to reach a minimum level of $2.3, a potential maximum of $21.22, and an average trading price of $18.47 in 2025.

Consequently, there could be significant downward pressure on the price of TIA as it reaches its peak moment.

2025-06-05T19:22:33,"Ethereum ETF Holdings Spike as BlackRock Snaps Up $560 Million in ETH","Ethereum (ETH) trades within a narrow range, with major institutional investors increasing their exposure. According to on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, BlackRock has accumulated over 214,000 ETH over the week—worth approximately $560 million. The move coincides with a period of price consolidation for ETH, which has hovered between $2,500 and $2,700 over the last several weeks. Despite low price volatility, ETF inflows have steadily risen, pointing to growing institutional confidence. BlackRock leads ETH inflows amid subdued price action BlackRock’s activity suggests a deliberate accumulation strategy. By building positions during a period of market calm, the firm appears to be positioning itself ahead of potential macro or regulatory shifts. Data confirms the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has attracted sustained inflows since U.S. regulators approved Ethereum spot ETFs earlier this year. According to data from SoSoValue, Ethereum ETFs posted $109.43 million in net daily inflows, of which BlackRock alone accounted for $77.06 million. This marked the 12th consecutive day of positive inflows into ETH-based funds. By contrast, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recorded significant outflows on May 30 and June 2—totaling $561 million. While inflows briefly returned to the firm’s Bitcoin product with $58 million on Tuesday, the figure was still dwarfed by Ethereum’s ETF momentum. TheBlock’s Global In/Out of the Money (GIOM) indicator shows Ethereum’s next major resistance zone between $2,726 and $2,856. Roughly 4.13 million ETH—held by 2.7 million addresses—were acquired within this band. Meanwhile, over 12 million ETH sit in the out-of-the-money zone at an average cost basis of $2,613. ETH source: LookonChain This imbalance suggests that many investors are still in accumulation mode. The at-the-money zone remains larger than immediate resistance, indicating that ETH may be under less near-term sell pressure. Joao Wedson, CEO of analytics firm Alphractal, said in a tweet that significant market-maker activity at lower levels could signal a breakout is forming. He identified a short-term target of $2,830 following a break above $2,660. Wedson also highlighted $2,556 as a key stop-loss threshold based on aggregated liquidation data. Ethereum Technical setup supports recovery, but ETH remains range-bound Ethereum’s daily chart shows modest strength. A bullish crossover between the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages recently formed, supporting the short-term outlook. The daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicates renewed buyer interest.

2025-06-05T19:21:19,"Bitcoin (BTC) Sees Highest Wallet Growth and Circulation Spikes of 2025","Bitcoin climbed to a fresh peak in May, but upward momentum slowed as long-term holders began locking in profits. Its price has remained relatively stable this week, fluctuating within a narrow range of $103,000 to $106,000. At the time of writing, the crypto asset trades below $105,000, which represents a minor decline over the past day. Despite the subdued price action, Bitcoin is seeing an increased user participation. Strong BTC Network Growth Bitcoin’s on-chain activity has spiked sharply this week, according to the latest analysis from Santiment. On May 29, the network registered 556,830 newly created wallets – the highest daily total since December 2, 2023, representing a significant surge in user growth. Just days later, on June 2, Bitcoin saw its most active circulation day since December 8, 2024, with 241,360 BTC moved. These activity spikes coincide with Bitcoin’s price trading just below $105,000. Santiment noted that rising network growth and token circulation are typically bullish indicators, pointing to a renewed interest and broader utility at a time when the crypto market continues to consolidate. The latest activity comes as Bitcoin sees renewed bullish accumulation, with new whales, wallets holding 1,000+ BTC with coins aged under six months, doubling their holdings to 1.1 million BTC since March. This 600K BTC surge, which is around $63 billion, now represents 5.6% of the total supply, indicating intensified fresh capital inflows. Unlike long-held coins, these recent buys suggest increased investor conviction. Combined with a 30% drop in exchange balances and increasing institutional adoption, market experts view this behavior as a setup for a supply squeeze. While increased network activity and accumulation trends paint a strong demand-side picture, miner-focused metrics are now offering additional insights into the current market setup. Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Flash Rare Buy Signal Bitcoin’s Hash Ribbons indicator has issued a new buy signal, highlighting stress within the mining sector. The tool monitors the 30-day and 60-day hashrate moving averages to detect periods when mining becomes less profitable. Such stress often forces miners to sell their BTC, adding short-term selling pressure. However, this has historically reflected attractive buying opportunities for long-term investors. Given Bitcoin’s hash rate has recently hit all-time highs, the emergence of this signal suggests the current market dip may be worth buying. It’s important to note that, aside from 2021’s mining ban in China, this indicator has proven consistently reliable in identifying solid entry points.

According to a June 4 report from Bloomberg citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, the banking giant will start by allowing financing backed by shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, currently the largest US spot Bitcoin ETF with over $70 billion in assets under management. JPMorgan will reportedly consider clients’ crypto holdings when assessing their total net worth and liquidity, treating cryptocurrencies like real estate and vehicles when determining a client’s ability to repay a loan. JPMorgan’s Love-Hate Relationship With Bitcoin Despite the expanded offerings for trading and wealth-management clients, Dimon has long been a Bitcoin skeptic. The billionaire banker has previously called Bitcoin a “pet rock” and asserted that crypto’s “true use case” was for sex traffickers and money launderers. While he recently confirmed that the bank he heads would soon start to allow customers to buy Bitcoin, the famously crypto-skeptical banker hasn’t changed his tune. Nevertheless, the bank’s latest pivot underscores the increasing institutional pressure to accommodate crypto as the asset class’s footprint in traditional finance deepens. This comes as US President Donald Trump has been easing restrictions on banks and crypto-centric businesses. In April 2025, the Federal Reserve rescinded guidance that served to deter banks from engaging in crypto and stablecoin activities. The US Office of the Comptroller said in May that banks could now buy and sell crypto they hold in custody at customers’ direction. Later the same month, the Wall Street Journal reported that several US banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Citigroup, were holding early talks to issue a joint crypto stablecoin. That said, Dimon’s JPMorgan could dive deeper into crypto with more offerings amid the changing regulatory winds.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/jpmorgan-plunges-deeper-into-crypto-by-letting-clients-use-bitcoin-etfs-as-loan-collateral/,"BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|JPMorgan",cryptocompare

The company submitted a Form S-1 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its Truth Social Bitcoin ETF on June 5. The proposed fund would hold spot Bitcoin and list on NYSE Arca, exposing investors to the apex cryptocurrency via shares on the stock exchange. “The assets of the Trust consist primarily of bitcoin held by a custodian on behalf of the Trust. The Trust seeks to generally reflect the performance of the price of Bitcoin,” the filing reads. The new fund entails exclusivity clauses. According to the S-1, Crypto.com will offer certain services exclusively to the trust behind the product. Neither the ticker symbol for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF nor the sponsor fee has been disclosed in the initial Form S-1. The S-1 comes two days after NYSE Arca filed a Form 19b-4 seeking exchange approval to list and trade shares of the ETF. Both filings are standard dual applications required before an ETF can go live in the US. The S-1 includes detailed information about the fund’s structure, strategy, and risk disclosures. According to Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the risk section highlights potential implications of President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto push and regulatory changes. The filing notes the establishment of an SEC crypto-task force in January and Trump’s March executive order creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, adding that “it is not possible to fully predict the potential impacts on the Sponsor, the Trust, TMTG, Crypto.com, their affiliates or third-party service providers.” “Pretty sure it’s the first time ever the advisor is in the risk section,” Balchunas posted on X. If approved and listed, the ETF will see crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, which is listed as sponsor, act in the role an advisor would play for an ETF filed under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940. Approval for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would deepen President Trump’s ties with the crypto market. Trump Media and Technology Group recently announced a $2.3 billion offering to create a corporate Bitcoin treasury. In addition, the proposed fund would join a bevy of 11 U.S. spot BTC ETFs approved by the SEC for trading on Wall Street last year. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the most successful ETF launches in the history of U.S. ETFs, with roughly $70 billion in assets since its debut.",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/trumps-truth-social-takes-next-step-toward-launching-bitcoin-etf-with-s-1-filing/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Donald Trump",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T19:07:07,"Major Confirmation from Deutsche Bank for XRP and Crypto Prices","A recent statement from Deutsche Bank has brought renewed optimism to the cryptocurrency sector, particularly for XRP. Highlighted in a detailed research report, Deutsche Bank confirmed what many in the space have long believed: clearer regulatory frameworks like MiCA will push up cryptocurrency prices. This validation comes at a critical moment, as the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) now moves from policy to full enforcement in 2025. Deutsche Bank: Regulation Will Drive Prices Higher In the research note authored by Marion Laboure, Ph.D., and Cassidy Ainsworth-Grace, Deutsche Bank made it clear that institutional adoption is set to accelerate thanks to improved regulatory clarity. The bank pointed to the EU’s MiCA framework as a transformative force, stating: “A clearer regulatory framework should drive corporate adoption, pushing up prices.” This sentiment was echoed by SMQKE, who spotlighted the research with the caption: “Major Confirmation from Deutsche Bank.” Major Confirmation from Deutsche Bank. “Clearer regulatory frameworks like MICA WILL PUSH UP CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICES.” Documented. https://t.co/UJzZdZhXKx pic.twitter.com/i3DFLulVxt — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 The Deutsche Bank report was released after the U.S. SEC approved multiple Spot Bitcoin ETFs, a move that already boosted market sentiment. But it’s MiCA, the EU’s legal framework for crypto-assets, that Deutsche Bank sees as the longer-term catalyst for sustained institutional inflows and price appreciation. MiCA: Now Fully Enforceable Across the EU MiCA entered into force in June 2023, with its rules on stablecoins becoming applicable by June 2024, and its broader rules for crypto-asset issuers and service providers taking effect in December 2024. As of now, MiCA is fully operational across the European Economic Area. MiCA introduces legal definitions and licensing requirements for Utility Tokens, Stablecoins (ARTs and EMTs), and Crypto-Asset Service Providers (CASPs). Crucially, MiCA excludes DeFi, NFTs, and crypto conglomerates, focusing its scope on centralized actors and custodial services. XRP Recognized as a Utility Token Under MiCA One of MiCA’s most important clarifications is its classification of XRP as a utility token . This designation affirms that XRP is not a security, aligning with Ripple’s long-standing legal position and clearing a regulatory pathway for XRP’s use across Europe. As a utility token, XRP falls squarely within MiCA’s oversight, which means issuers and service providers working with XRP now benefit from full legal certainty when operating in the EU. This gives XRP a strategic compliance advantage over many other digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 On the contrary, Bitcoin and Ethereum have been excluded from MiCA’s jurisdiction. The reason? Both lack a specific issuer, a core requirement for inclusion under the MiCA framework. As such, the EU will regulate BTC and ETH under other legacy financial laws or future regulatory efforts. This exclusion puts XRP in a favorable position from a legal and compliance standpoint. As firms seek regulatory certainty, XRP offers a clearer path than Bitcoin or Ethereum in the European Union. A Bullish Outlook for 2025 and Beyond With MiCA fully active and Deutsche Bank’s endorsement now public, the message is unmistakable: clear regulation is good for crypto. XRP’s alignment with MiCA provides it with a robust foundation for adoption, particularly among European institutions looking for compliant blockchain solutions. As Deutsche Bank concluded, the stage is now set for corporate integration, institutional participation, and ultimately, price growth driven by fundamentals, not speculation. SMQKE’s statement captures it best: “Documented.” The groundwork has been laid, and the confirmation is now in black and white. 2025 may be the year regulatory clarity becomes crypto’s greatest asset.

2025-06-05T19:00:37,"Beijing Fast-Tracks 24-Hour Seized Crypto Liquidation via Hong Kong Exchanges","Key Takeaways: Beijing’s police authority has introduced a formal process for liquidating seized digital assets through Hong Kong exchanges. The system was developed with the Beijing Equity Exchange and involves third-party custody and compliant offshore liquidation. The first test case was completed in Shunyi District, with funds transferred to the national treasury within 24 hours. Mainland companies, such as JD.com, are increasingly using Hong Kong’s regulatory structure to conduct blockchain-related pilots. Beijing’s municipal police authority has formalized a new mechanism for disposing of virtual assets seized in criminal cases, according to an announcement published by the Legal Affairs Division of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau (PSB) on June 5. Since the trading of cryptocurrencies is prohibited in mainland China , the process would involve liquidation through Hong Kong exchanges under a framework co-developed with the Beijing Equity Exchange (BEE). China imposes Fresh Ban on Holding Crypto Including Bitcoin The Chinese government has announced a sweeping new ban that prohibits not just trading or mining of cryptocurrencies, but now extends to individual ownership of digital assets like Bitcoin, according to a report… pic.twitter.com/QO5RqqpnEC — CrowdFundJunction (Crypto VC) (@cfjcrypto) May 30, 2025 Beijing Police Formalize Digital Asset Disposal Framework Under the system, the PSB entrusts confiscated digital assets to BEE, which selects third-party providers to conduct technical inspection, custody, and liquidation. Digital assets are then sold via a compliant exchange in Hong Kong. The proceeds, after currency conversion and regulatory review, are transferred to the PSB and eventually routed to China’s national treasury. The new process addresses the regulatory block that currently prevents the direct liquidation of cryptocurrencies within mainland China. It also builds on Beijing’s existing “green channel” for handling physically seized assets, which was established in 2017. Authorities said the method was tested in a recent case handled by police in the city’s Shunyi District. The process, from asset custody to final remittance, was completed within 24 hours. A reserve pricing system based on market consultation is used to mitigate volatility risks, and service providers must post a 110% performance bond. The entire workflow is subject to real-time oversight and digital recording. Hong Kong as Regulatory Bridge for Mainland Crypto Operations Legal training has also been expanded to include digital asset topics. Recent sessions have featured cold wallet protocols and blockchain tracing, with guest lecturers from academic institutions and technical agencies. Mainland-based firms have increasingly turned to Hong Kong to manage regulatory constraints around digital assets. JD.com launched a stablecoin payment pilot using Hong Kong’s licensed infrastructure, part of a broader pattern of companies using the city’s clearer crypto rules to experiment with blockchain-based services. The use of Hong Kong exchanges to liquidate seized crypto further demonstrates how mainland authorities are treating the city’s legal structure as an operational extension for handling digital assets. While this doesn’t indicate regulatory convergence, it reinforces Hong Kong’s role as a buffer zone where mainland entities can access functions that remain restricted at home. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could this model eventually be applied to civil or bankruptcy-related crypto disputes in China? While this mechanism was designed for criminal asset seizures, this structure might serve as a template for handling digital assets in broader legal contexts if the regulatory stance evolves. What might other jurisdictions learn from Beijing’s outsourced disposal model? For countries that ban domestic crypto trading but encounter digital assets in enforcement cases, the use of proximate, regulated offshore centers like Hong Kong could offer a legal workaround without revising core policy positions. Who selects the compliant exchanges used in Hong Kong? The Beijing Equity Exchange appoints third-party service providers, who are responsible for custody and liquidation via licensed Hong Kong exchanges.

With $20.8 million raised and all 15 presale stages sold out, the project has entered its final Bonus Round—offering LCAI tokens at a fixed price of $0.007. As it approaches a July mainnet launch, Lightchain AI is rolling out AI-native infrastructure, developer tools, and smart utility frameworks designed for intelligent decentralized applications. While Bitcoin holds the legacy, Lightchain AI is building the future—where data, logic, and blockchain power combine to deliver real-world, AI-driven solutions. Bitcoin Holds Strong as Market’s Premier Store of Value Bitcoin (BTC) – the world’s number one cryptocurrency – is still finding more and more solid ground as the go-to digital store of value, not least because of strong institutional support and positive legislative news. As of May 25, 2025, BTC has a price of around $108,137 with a market cap that is over $2.1 trillion. A large part of Bitcoin’s dominance has been from institutional adoption. Nowadays, public companies own about 15% of the total Bitcoin supply, valued at around $349 billion. Institutional investors may control 20% of BTC supply by 2026, analysts tell Bloomberg Such a seizure of BTC supply from investors makes BTC increasingly scarce for investment and supporting its price point. Investor sentiment has also gotten a boost from regulatory clarity. While it is appreciated that Bitcoin could be used as a hedge against economic uncertainty, the willingness of the U.S. government, among other things, to establish a federal Bitcoin reserve has increased the attractiveness of Bitcoin. Furthermore, large banks, such as JPMorgan Chase, has started to offer Bitcoin investments to clients, which suggests an increasing acceptance of digital currency in traditional finance. All these have contributed to strengthen Bitcoin’s position in the market due to institutional adoption and a favorable regulatory environment. Lightchain AI Introduces Advanced Utility for a Smarter Blockchain Era Lightchain AI is introducing a smarter blockchain era by embedding advanced utility features that go far beyond basic infrastructure. At the core is the Transparent AI Framework, which ensures that all AI computations are auditable, accountable, and traceable on-chain—solving trust issues in AI deployment. Governance Integration further empowers the community by enabling token holders to vote on upgrades, proposals, and AI model decisions, reinforcing decentralized control. In a unique move, Lightchain AI also includes a Memecoin Launchpad, offering creators a secure, AI-enhanced platform to launch meme tokens with built-in transparency and automation. These features together form a dynamic environment where users, developers, and communities can build, govern, and innovate in sync—positioning Lightchain AI as a pioneer in intelligent decentralized ecosystems. Lightchain AI- Where Security Meets Intelligence The future is here—and it’s smarter, faster, and more secure, thanks to Lightchain AI . With cutting-edge AI-powered execution, zero-knowledge privacy, and builder-first tools already in action, Lightchain AI is redefining what blockchain can do.

2025-06-05T18:46:37,"California Crypto Bill Rockets Forward, Promising New Protections for Dormant Assets","California is moving to reshape how unclaimed digital assets are handled after the State Assembly unanimously approved Assembly Bill 1052 (AB 1052) on June 3. The bill, which passed 78–0, would update the state’s unclaimed property laws to prevent dormant cryptocurrencies from being automatically liquidated. Instead, assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum would be held in their native form by a licensed custodian designated by the state. The bill now heads to the California Senate for further consideration. New California Bill Protects Dormant Crypto Wallets JUST IN : California Assembly passes bill to regulate Digital Assets under 'Unclaimed Property' law. The bill now moves to the Senate. Law explained: Assets left on an exchange for 3 years will transferred to the state, and can then be claimed by the owner. pic.twitter.com/u9XftO0XRy — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 4, 2025 The bill only affects digital assets held by third-party custodians such as centralized exchanges or banks. Anyone using self-hosted wallets or holding their private keys directly is entirely excluded from the bill’s reach. Even for custodial accounts, the law applies only after three full years of complete inactivity. That inactivity must meet two strict conditions: the custodian must be unable to establish contact, and the account must show no signs of ownership. Additionally, the clock resets with virtually any user activity. If the account holder logs in, makes a transaction, responds to an email, clicks a verification link, or even contacts the platform about another account, the three-year countdown restarts. These safeguards ensure that genuinely active or intermittently used accounts cannot be deemed abandoned. Once that full period passes with no contact or activity, custodians are required to notify the state and report the asset. However, unlike older forfeiture laws, this legislation mandates that the cryptocurrency be transferred in its native form into the care of a licensed state-appointed custodian. The bill’s provisions also place responsibility on licensed custodians to safeguard these assets, raising new compliance challenges. Questions around key storage, asset verification, and technical protocols are likely to become focal points in Senate deliberations. ‘Not Your Keys’ Gets a Legal Boost The bill also clarifies how digital assets like Bitcoin should be handled when left unclaimed, potentially strengthening the principle of “not your keys, not your coins” by requiring clearer custodial accountability. The legislation arrives as other states also move to define crypto ownership and unclaimed property rights, but with different strategies. Arizona recently enacted House Bill 2749 on May 7, creating a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund. Under the law, digital assets can be held in their native form if unclaimed for three years. Arizona Governor Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law, which allows the state to establish a reserve fund to hold unclaimed crypto, airdrops. #Arizona #CryptoBill #UnclaimedCrypto https://t.co/Hhu4wJa2Tm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Qualified custodians are authorized to stake or receive rewards on those assets, with earnings deposited into the new state fund. The bipartisan bill, championed by House Commerce Committee Chair Rep. Jeff Weninger, marks one of the first formal crypto reserve initiatives at the state level. Florida has become the latest US state to abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dealing another setback. #Bitcoin #Reserve https://t.co/kRZo2V0BzE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 6, 2025 Meanwhile, Florida has taken a different path. On May 3, it withdrew two key bills, House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 , intended to establish a Bitcoin reserve.

2025-06-05T18:45:00,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.60 Market cap $179.91M 24-hour trading volume $46.8M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $8.98 24-hour low $8.50 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 12.60% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $18.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI moves into consolidation On the day of writing (May 6), ORDI’s price dropped by 3.59% in 24 hours and rose 19.67% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume dropped by 5.87% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $105,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 49.94. It is oversold when it drops below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart. Image source: TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI has reversed from last month’s high at $13.61 and is at $8.90, losing over 20% of its value. Its volatility is dropping on the 4-hour timeframe.

ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is consolidating after correcting from the month’s high. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come.

Note that the predictions are not investment advice. Seek independent consultation or do your research. ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history. Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T18:41:31,"Former DOGE Head Elon Musk Tells Lawmakers To Kill Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful’ Bill","After stepping down from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk is publicly attacking the President’s “big, beautiful” bill. In a post on the social media platform X, the platform which he owns, Musk urges Americans to contact their representatives to prevent Trump’s plan from “bankrupting America.” “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” According to Musk , Trump’s highly self-touted economic plan is a “disgusting abomination.” “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” Furthermore, Musk says the shortcomings of Trump’s bill are significant enough to require the entire document to be redrafted. “A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn’t massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 TRILLION DOLLARS.” Musk’s opposition to a budget plan that increases the debt ceiling should come as little surprise. The former DOGE head has long publicly stated that America’s growing debt will ultimately lead to financial ruin. “DOGE has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.” According to a NBC News report, during a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump had the following to say about his former ally : “I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot… Elon’s upset because we took the EV (electric vehicle) mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles and they’re having a hard time with electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning.” However, according to Musk, Trump wouldn’t even be president without him. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-05T18:39:13,"XRP holds key support: is a new bullish trend forming?","XRP is currently holding firm at a critical technical zone, defying broader market weakness. With volume poised to return and support levels stacking up, could this mark the beginning of a bullish continuation? Despite market-wide consolidation and uncertainty, XRP ( XRP ) has maintained its footing at a crucial support level. A combination of high-timeframe support, trend line confluence, and the 200-day moving average is creating a foundation for a potential bullish structure. All eyes are now on volume, the missing ingredient that could fuel XRP’s next move. Key technical points Support Confluence: XRP is holding at the intersection of a key trend line, high-timeframe support, and the 200 moving average – a rare triple-layered support structure. Volume Profile Decline: A noticeable volume drop suggests accumulation; a volume influx is likely and may lead to a sharp breakout. I mpulsive Breakout Candle: The recent trend line break was backed by an impulsive candle, establishing a local high and validating early bullish acceptance. XRPUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP’s current consolidation at support is more than just a pause, it’s a potential base. Price is respecting a long-term trend line that intersects perfectly with high-timeframe horizontal support and the 200-day moving average, forming a strong technical confluence. This level has consistently held across multiple timeframes, and recent price behavior confirms that bulls are actively defending the zone. Adding to the case for bullish continuation, the volume profile shows a significant decline during this retest. This low-volume environment is often indicative of accumulation, a phase that typically precedes expansion, especially when paired with structural strength. Once volume returns, price often moves decisively in the direction of the dominant trend, in this case, upward. You might also like: Buyers are winning big in BlockDAG while Solaxy hits $43M and BTC bull raises $6.7M The recent breakout above the trend line was confirmed by an impulsive candle that printed a new local high. Price is now undergoing a bullish retest of that breakout zone. If this retest holds and forms a higher low, it will solidify a new bullish market structure and open the door to a move toward the swing high and potentially beyond. What to expect in the coming price action If XRP maintains support and volume re-enters the market, expect a continuation toward recent highs. A confirmed higher low in the current retest zone will signal a structural shift and the potential start of a new rally. Until volume returns, however, the risk of continued sideways price action remains.

This breakdown threatens to drag the entire Solana memecoin sector into freefall. Just two weeks ago, DogWifHat ($WIF) soared above $1.30, fueling hopes of a $2 rally. Now, with Solana weakening and 166,000 wallets losing their capital, traders face a brutal choice. Will WIF crater to $0.50 or defy gravity with a sharp rebound? Source: CoinMarketCap $WIF’s Rapid Drop Sparks Trader Anxiety The mood around $WIF is split. Some see a further collapse below $0.50, while others bet on a full recovery to double its current price. Recent trends lean bearish, with short sellers gaining momentum. On June 4, experienced crypto trader Bob Paulus shared a pessimistic outlook on WIF, pointing to a clear downtrend in its daily market structure. Traders who acted on his short position have seen gains of up to 140%. The broader memecoin slump has also played a role in WIF’s decline. $WIF – Approaching a good short opportunity!

Major memecoins, such as $DOGE, $PEPE, and $SHIB, have each lost at least 10% in the last week, reflecting fading momentum. The market’s current trajectory suggests caution as traders weigh further downside risks against potential rebounds. Memecoins crashes more than 10% on the week/ Source: CoinMarketCap Solana Slips Toward $150—What That Means for $WIF and Other Memecoins Solana’s struggles often dictate the fate of its memecoins, and right now, the signs are worrying. With SOL down more than 12% in the past week and hovering near $150, concerns are growing. A similar drop below $140 in February led to heavy losses across Solana memecoins, and history may be repeating itself. Pumpfun is brutal 217K+ wallets traded this month.

Data from Dune Analytics shows that while over 217,000 wallets traded Solana memecoins this month, only five made profits above $50,000. On the other hand, roughly 166,000 wallets were completely wiped out, including one high-profile trader who lost over $1 million. These trends suggest deepening pessimism in the memecoin market. As Solana struggles, the tokens built on it face mounting pressure, leaving traders to question whether the downturn will continue or if a reversal is imminent. “Summer Price Action Is Trash”: Top Binance Trader Goes All-In on Shorts Matter Trades, currently ranked #2 on Binance’s perpetuals leaderboard, isn’t betting on a turnaround. He’s been building short positions since Bitcoin reached $111,000 , citing his belief that summer market conditions are historically poor. “Summer price action is trash—always has been, always will be,” he said. “Everyone keeps saying this time is different, but it never is.” Been building short positions since $111k BTC.

He also expressed skepticism about the recent altcoin hype , warning that macroeconomic factors could worsen market conditions further. “The U.S. housing market is flashing red flags, reminding me of 2008,” he added. “Bitcoin is a risk asset, and when fear strikes, risk assets are the first to go.” Bearish Market Structure Indicates Another Leg Down for WIF From a technical standpoint, the $WIF/$USDT daily chart reflects a bearish structure with more room to fall. After rallying to nearly $1.50 in May, the price has since retraced to around $0.86. $WIF price prediction/ Source: TradingView The correction appears to be unfolding in a classic A-B-C pattern, with the price now heading from point (B) toward a potential low at point (C). Support between $0.65 and $0.70, shown by previous breakout levels, could provide a temporary floor. Unless $WIF sees a strong reversal with rising volume and reclaims the $1.00 mark, the outlook remains bearish. Should the wave structure play out, $WIF could revisit the $0.60–$0.65 range in the near term.

Circle (CRCL) debuted to wild upside action on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, its shares more than tripling from the IPO price of $31. The event was the culmination of a long journey for the USDC stablecoin issuer, which had been pursuing an IPO for several years. For the crypto industry, it’s certainly a win — a sign of strong traditional investor demand and that under the Trump administration, crypto native firms really do have a path to going public. But cryptocurrencies themselves weren’t enthused. Bitcoin BTC slid more than 2% to $102,800, its weakest level in about a month, while the CoinDesk 20 (an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins) fell over 3%. Leading the selloff are tokens such as SOL, AVAX and AAVE, all lower by roughly 6%. It’s too early to tell whether the downtrend will persist in the short, medium or long term, but for industry veterans, it’s hard not to see shades of another crypto IPO — that of Coinbase (COIN), which took place on April 14, 2021 and marked a then-epic top of $65,000 for bitcoin. Roughly two months following the COIN debut, bitcoin had plunged nearly 60% to about the $28,000 level. A sharp autumn bounce in prices did have bitcoin again re-claiming that $65,000 level, but the selling quickly took hold once again. A brutal bear market ensued through late 2021 and throughout 2022, with bitcoin ultimately bottoming at around $15,000. Bitcoin wouldn't reclaim a fresh record price until March 2024, nearly three years after the Coinbase IPO.

Zeberg tells his 182,800 followers on the social media platform X that the altseason, when altcoins outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ), is just getting started, and massive alt breakouts are likely to occur in the coming days. He says the Ethereum ( ETH /BTC) ratio is flashing bullish for altcoins, after increasing since tapping a local low in late April. Analysts often use the ETH/BTC ratio as an indicator of potential altcoin seasons. “Altseason has already started. First slowly, later in a more explosive manner. I think we are max three to eight days away from the beginning of that explosive phase. ETH/BTC ratio tells us why… It is close to setting off in the explosive phase!” ETH/BTC is trading for 0.02478 BTC ($2,595) at time of writing. Zeberg suggests that certain altcoins will start breaking out at different times. “In the altseason it will be about identifying the next altcoin which is about to skyrocket. And then have an idea of how far it may run.” Among the alts the economist believes will soon print new all-time highs is Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin dogwifhat ( WIF ). “I maintain my extreme Bullish perspective on WIF.” In January, he suggested WIF could eventually hit $19. WIF is trading for $0.86 at time of writing, down 9.9% in the last 24 hours. Zeberg is also bullish on the Internet of Things (IoT) project Jasmy ( JASMY ). The analyst uses the Elliott Wave theory to forecast a massive run for altcoins. The theory states that an asset tends to witness a five-wave rally with wave three being the longest and the strongest move up. “Ready for Jasmy’s takeoff? We seem to be getting closer to the wave two bottom, little lower. Wave three should take Jasmy much much higher.” Jasmy is trading for $0.01413 at time of writing, down 4.8% on the day.

2025-06-05T18:01:23,"Keeta teams up with SOLO to launch a blockchain-native credit bureau","Real-world tokenization project Keeta plans to offer digital asset holders access to credit services, including mortgages and small business loans, through a new platform built for blockchain-native financial identity. With crypto and blockchain adoption on the rise, Keeta Network ( KTA ) has announced the upcoming launch of PASS, a verified financial identity platform. The initiative is a collaboration between Keeta and SOLO, a credit data infrastructure provider, according to a press release published on June 5. According to the Keeta team, the PASS platform is designed as a bank-grade, blockchain-native credit bureau with features including Know Your Customer, Know Your Business, and verifiable credentials for income and crypto asset holdings. These tools are intended to allow banks and lenders to extend services to crypto-native users by leveraging PASS’s on-chain visibility to underwrite credit. “As digital asset adoption accelerates, Keeta’s blockchain is the first to tackle the scale and regulatory overhead for an on-chain credit bureau, opening the door for lending, borrowing, mortgages, stablecoin payments, and more,” Ty Schenk, chief executive officer and founder of Keeta, said in a statement. Schenk emphasized that PASS is built to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. Read more: JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for loans “This is the first time that a blockchain network has made real-world financial credentials, like income, assets, and identity, verifiable, tokenized, and trusted for lending,” Georgina Merhom, founder of SOLO, noted. Keeta, backed by former Google chief executive & chairman, Eric Schmidt, is a blockchain network with built-in compliance framework. The project is eyeing traction in the real-world asset tokenization industry currently on fire across the globe. Global businesses and institutions can now tokenize any assets to tap into blockchain’s massive potential, with the sector growing rapidly in 2024 to currently sit at over $23 billion . The rollout of Keeta’s on-chain credit system in partnership with SOLO will occur in phases. Verified financial profiles are expected to go live in the summer of 2025, with additional features, including a lending marketplace, stablecoin-based loan origination, and bank integrations, planned for subsequent release.

2025-06-05T17:58:50,"Stablecoins Spark AI-Agent Payment Boom, $140B Windfall in Sight","The stablecoin market is currently valued at over $140 billion, but could see substantial growth as new use cases emerge. When combined with artificial intelligence (AI)—another billion-dollar market—stablecoins could quickly rise in demand. This will likely be the case, as a recent trend the Web3 sector is witnessing is the combination of stablecoins and AI-agents. Rebecca Liao, CEO of Layer-1 network Saga, told Cryptonews that autonomous payments and transactions are perhaps the most direct and widespread use case. “AI agents are being designed to make payments, settle transactions, and manage funds on behalf of users or even autonomously,” Liao said. “A recent example of this is Mastercard’s Agent Pay and Visa’s Intelligent Commerce platform, allowing verified AI-agents to make tokenized payments.” #Stablecoins , meet 150M+ checkout counters. Enterprises and #fintechs can now offer Mastercard-branded cards linked to consumers’ stablecoin balances — unlocking new ways to pay and be paid. In partnership with @moonpay , we’re combining our trusted global #payments network with… pic.twitter.com/WMX6sqclze — Mastercard News (@MastercardNews) May 15, 2025 Stablecoins: The Missing Link For AI-Agents Given the increasing use of stablecoins by AI-agents , it’s important to understand why these tokens matter. Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, believes that stablecoins are a missing link for AI-agents. He noted that stablecoins are capable of addressing several issues that AI-agents may face when performing financial transactions without human support. “Stablecoins typically operate in networks that don’t rely on user expectations or behavior to confirm transactions,” Otychenko said. “Furthermore, bots already play a key role in this space. In 2024, bots accounted for 70% of all stablecoin transfer volume, and this trend has continued into 2025. These networks and infrastructures are already designed with machines in mind.” Otychenko explained that traditional payment rails are human-centric, where a human user exists at one or both ends of a transaction. However, he pointed out that AI-driven transactions don’t resemble this process. Echoing this, Jesse Shrader—co-founder of Bitcoin payment platform Amboss—told Cryptonews that AI agents require a digital form of value to transact, and traditional payment systems simply don’t work in these instances. “Traditional payments like wires, ACH, and card payments don’t scale for micropayments and take too long to settle. Stablecoin payments are better positioned to have rapid settlement, which work within the timeframes of AI queries,” Shrader said. Otychenko added that the combination of stablecoins and AI-agents has the most potential for use cases like micropayments, subscriptions, and investment activities such as arbitrage, liquidity provision, or portfolio rebalancing. “These transactions are fee and value sensitive, making predictability paramount,” he said. “Moreover, using altcoins instead of stablecoins would require hedging against price volatility, introducing an inefficient and unnecessary layer.” How Stablecoins Allow AI-Agents To Transact Although this is still an emerging concept, a few use cases are being applied today. Erik Reppel, head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), told Cryptonews that stablecoins allow AI-agents the ability to transact instantly, globally, and autonomously—without human intervention. For example, Reppel explained that CDP recently introduced “x402.” This is an open standard that leverages the original HTTP “402 Payment Required” status code . The x402 standard from CDP embeds stablecoin payments directly into web integrations. “Tools like x402 enable agents to pay for data, APIs, and services,” Reppel said. “And because stablecoins are programmable, they come with powerful built-in security primitives—like signed intents and scoped approvals – that will be critical as agents scale their autonomy and capabilities.” While x402 only recently went live, Reppel explained that the standard is already being leveraged. For instance, he shared that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is exploring how x402 could be used for paid compute. This could be a game changer, as statistics show the global Cloud Computing Market is expected to reach $1902.66 billion by 2030. This growth is being driven by the increasing adoption of advanced technologies like AI and machine learning (ML). Reppel added that the decentralized compute and AI-as-a-Service platform Heurist is using x402 to pay for deep research. Web3 file storage platform Pinata is also using x402 to pay per file stored . 1/ Ever wondered why every internet service needs API keys and subscriptions? Why users can't just… pay for things? We launched Heurist Deep Research using @coinbase 's groundbreaking x402 protocol. Here's how we built it pic.twitter.com/mCGstwkbKQ — Heurist (@heurist_ai) June 2, 2025 “We’ve seen solo developers build everything from monetized music playlists to research bots that pay per article. It’s still early, but the momentum is real—x402 is unlocking a whole new class of apps and agents that can pay as they go,” Reppel said. AI-Agents Integrate Stablecoins With The Lightning Network Shrader pointed out that the next wave of AI-agents may also see an integration with stablecoins on the Bitcoin Lightning Network . “Tether’s recent announcement of issuing USDT on the Lightning Network signals a shift away from crypto’s everything-on-the-blockchain mindset to unbounded scalability through Lightning’s off-chain scaling,” he stated. Shrader added that the Lightning Network already maintains the “ L402 protocol ,” which provides a universal HTTP-based payment flow. According to the L402 protocol document, this combines the strengths of Macaroons for better authentication with the strengths of the Lightning Network for better payments. Macaroons are described as “bearer authentication tokens.” Shrader shared that Amboss, along with a handful of other companies, are already combining the Lightning Network and AI in anticipation of stablecoin issuance on the Lightning Network. A Financial Institution Powered Entirely By AI In addition to HTTP payment flows, Circle co-founder and Catena Labs CEO Sean Neville recently launched a project that seeks to create a financial institution powered entirely by AI. Neville said in a news release that AI agents will soon conduct most economic transactions. Catena Labs will therefore use its recent $18 million led by a16z crypto to develop the “first fully regulated AI-native financial institution (FI). ” Catena Labs further remarked that while AI-agents can use traditional systems and financial rails, stablecoins should be viewed as “AI-native money.” The company mentioned that regulated stablecoins like USDC allow near-instant, low-cost, global transactions, which are essential for agents. Challenges To Consider While there is huge potential behind stablecoins and AI-agents, a number of challenges remain. Reppel believes that the biggest challenge with agentic payments is making sure agents act accordingly. He thinks that stablecoins can help ensure this. “Stablecoins are natively programmable, which makes it easy to add guardrails like spend limits or keeping a human in the loop,” he said. Yet Reppel commented that the tradeoff for this type of programmability is that it introduces a wallet, which can be tricky to implement or secure properly. Liao further told Cryptonews that fragmentation, regulatory uncertainty, and on-and-off ramp limitations are problematic. Liao explained that Saga is addressing these challenges in different ways. For example, she elaborated that Saga has a “chainlet infrastructure” tool that provides infinite horizontal scalability and dedicated blockspace for applications. “This is crucial for AI agents, as it means they won’t be bogged down by network congestion or unpredictable gas fees, allowing them to execute high-frequency transactions with stablecoins reliably,” she said. Additionally, Saga has built a “Liquidity Integration Layer” designed to create a unified liquidity environment across different blockchain ecosystems. This is meant to facilitate seamless and automated asset movement. “For AI agents, this means they can more easily access and utilize stablecoins from various sources and move them where needed without complex bridging,” Liao said. Challenges aside, stablecoin and AI-agent use cases are expected to thrive. Reppel commented that on-chain tools that handle key management can make it easier for developers to build safe and reliable agentic systems. “In short, these challenges are being solved with tools that bridge AI and Web3, making them more accessible, intuitive, and developer-friendly,” Reppel said.
