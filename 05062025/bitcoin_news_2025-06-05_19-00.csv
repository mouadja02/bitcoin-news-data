2025-06-05T16:55:57,"Here Are the Two Most Important Charts in All of Macro, According to Former Goldman Sachs Executive Raoul Pal","Former Goldman Sachs executive Raoul Pal is outlining what he says are the two most important charts “in all of macro.” The Real Vision chief executive and co-founder tells his 1.2 million followers on X that aging demographics force governments to borrow more money to support gross domestic product (GDP) growth and pay interest on the debt. Pal’s first chart looks at the US labor force participation rate against the inverted chart for US government debt as a percentage of GDP. Source: Raoul Pal/X His second chart looks at U.S. Federal Reserve net liquidity compared to the normal chart for US government debt as a percentage of GDP. Source: Raoul Pal/X Pal says the charts highlight a serious macroeconomic challenge, and the end result will be currency debasement. “At over 100% of GDP in debt there isn’t enough economic cash flow to fund the debt growth, so it gets ‘printed’ via Fed Net Liquidity and also forced, via regulation, onto the balance sheet of the banks. That debases the currency and lowers the denominator, optically making scarce assets more valuable. Crypto (mainly Bitcoin) is the life raft as it not only offsets the annual 8% debasement but also gains value due to adoption effects.” In the long run, Pal says he believes artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will improve the dilemma and play a key role in mitigating the pressures of aging demographics.

2025-06-05T16:49:37,"Binance Research: RWA Token Market Hits $23B as Private Credit Leads 260% Surge in H1 2025","The tokenized real-world asset (RWA) sector has witnessed huge growth in 2025, according to new findings from Binance Research, authored by Moulik Nagesh, Joshua Wong, Michael JJ, and Asher Lin Jiayong. In just the first half of the year, the RWA market has ballooned from $8.6 billion to over $23 billion—a massive 260% surge. This expansion shows a dramatic shift in how traditional financial assets are being integrated into the blockchain sector. Tokenized Private Credit Takes the Lead Driving this explosive growth is tokenized private credit, which now represents a dominant 58% of the total RWA market . This asset class has outpaced even tokenized U.S. Treasuries, which hold an estimated 34% market share. The appeal of private credit lies in its yield-generating potential and growing demand from DeFi-native and institutional investors seeking alternatives to saturated lending protocols. Time to look at June's market insights! Discover the current market landscape and key insights on: Spot ETF Flows Corporate BTC Treasuries Sector Divergence Tokenized RWAs …and more. Read here https://t.co/XItAOGvn5O — Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) June 5, 2025 According to the report, a standout contributor in this category is Tradable, a protocol built on ZKSync Era that launched in January 2025. Tradable has already tokenized more than US$2 billion in assets, becoming a clear front-runner in the race to bridge TradFi and DeFi. Its meteoric rise reflects both product-market fit and a growing appetite for tokenized debt instruments among investors and protocols. DeFi Integration Shows Maturity A major development in the RWA space is its increasing integration with decentralized finance. The BlackRock BUIDL fund , now the largest tokenized treasury product with $2.9 billion in assets (up from $649 million at the start of the year), recently launched its first direct DeFi integration through Euler Finance. This allows users to lend and borrow directly against tokenized treasury assets, introducing a new era of composability and utility for on-chain financial products. Other players, such as Centrifuge and Securitize, have launched tokenized funds on the Solana blockchain, connecting with DeFi platforms like Kamino Finance. These integrations improve liquidity and accessibility, allowing RWAs to serve as a reliable source of yield and helping DeFi evolve from a self-contained ecosystem into a more robust and externally linked financial system. A Broader Bull Market Boost According to the report, the growth of tokenized RWAs also coincides with a broader bullish trend in crypto markets. In May 2025, the overall crypto market rose by 10.3% despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of US$5.2 billion, the strongest since late 2024, helping Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of around US$112K. This rally was bolstered by stablecoin legislation progress in both the U.S. and Hong Kong, as well as growing corporate treasury adoption. With 116 public companies now holding over 809,000 BTC, and firms starting to cautiously diversify into ETH, SOL, and XRP, the market is showing signs of increasing maturity. While Gaming and Layer 2 sectors lagged, DeFi surged by 19% in May, reflecting a rotation of capital into yield-bearing sectors—like RWAs. According to Binance Research, the fusion of RWAs with DeFi could be a defining narrative of this cycle, offering a scalable and sustainable model for blockchain-based finance.

2025-06-05T16:47:35,"On-Chain Data Signals ‘Buy the Dip’ as Bitcoin Hashrate Hits New Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) is down almost 7% from its all-time high (ATH), and on-chain signals are flashing a buying opportunity. According to Darkfost, a pseudonymous analyst at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, this buy signal is coming from the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons indicator. This metric tracks the Bitcoin hashrate and is used to identify potential entry points during a market correction. Is it Time to Buy the Dip? The Hash Ribbon monitors Bitcoin mining activity and tells when miners are under stress or capitulating by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of the hashrate. Miner capitulation refers to a period when miners shut down their hardware and sell off their coin reserves to remain afloat because BTC has fallen below a certain price. On most occasions, the capitulation coincides with the hashrate recovery. The hashrate metric tells how much computational power is required to solve complex math problems and approve transactions on the Bitcoin network. During this period of recovery, mining becomes more difficult. Market experts say buying BTC during miner capitulation yields significant returns, and the best buy signals are seen during hashrate recoveries. Recently, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been reaching new highs, with the latest being 1.016 billion TH/S. The network’s mining difficulty also surged past 126 trillion during the last adjustment on May 30. “We recently got a new buy signal from the Hash Ribbons indicator. This metric helps us assess the level of stress in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. It’s not a big surprise considering that the hashrate has recently reached new all-time highs,” Darkfost stated. Miners Are Selling Their BTC Furthermore, the CryptoQuant analyst noted that the Hash Ribbon’s flashing a buy signal is a short-term negative. This is because miners selling their BTC to stay operational create long-term profitable opportunities. Darkfost explained that the indicator has always been accurate except once, during the 2021 China mining ban event. Hence, the possibility of the metric being correct this time is high. “Bottom line, this signal is telling you that buying the dip around here is a smart move,” he added. The analysis comes as a solo BTC miner defied hashrate odds and beat mining giants to validate a block on the Bitcoin network, earning a reward worth over $330,000. Mining successes like this are extremely rare due to the high computational power required to approve transactions.

2025-06-05T16:39:33,"Shiba Inu price at risk of deeper dive as whales capitulate","Shiba Inu price remained under pressure Thursday as holders continued to capitulate amid the ongoing crypto market downturn. Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) dropped to $0.00001275, its lowest level since May 9, and is now down 28% from its May peak. The meme coin has struggled in recent weeks as demand weakened and investors began exiting positions following prolonged underperformance. On-chain data shows that Shiba Inu’s network realized profit/loss (NPL) has remained negative for several months. The NPL metric measures the average profit or loss of all coins that change addresses daily, calculated by the difference between the last move price and the new transaction price. You might also like: Ethereum price forms bullish setups as Wall Street demand gains steam A negative NPL indicates coins are being sold at a loss — a clear sign of bearish sentiment. This decline has coincided with ongoing whale selling . Data reveals that whale holdings have dropped from 748 trillion tokens in January to just over 718 trillion today. Meanwhile, the supply of SHIB on exchanges has been rising steadily, signaling increased selling pressure. Shiba Inu NPL and whale transaction | Source: Santiment Additional data shows Shiba Inu’s spot market volume has also declined. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB recorded just $141.8 million in daily trading volume, significantly lower than other meme coins. Dogecoin registered $764 million, while Pepe topped the list with $1.08 billion. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that SHIB peaked at $0.00001762 on May 11, following a broader crypto market rally. Since then, it has dropped to $0.00001275, breaking below the lower boundary of an ascending broadening wedge pattern. SHIB has also moved below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, reinforcing a bearish bias. The Relative Strength Index remains above the oversold zone, suggesting that further downside is still possible. Given the current setup, capitulation may continue, with sellers likely targeting the next key support level at $0.000010, the lowest point from April 7. A move above the 200-day moving average at $0.00001570 would be required to invalidate the current bearish outlook.

2025-06-05T16:37:33,"Bitcoin and altcoins are crashing as investors ‘are locking profits’","Bitcoin and other altcoins continued their downward trend on Thursday as the recent bullish momentum faded. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped briefly below $104,000 as the market capitalization of all coins fell by 1% to $3.27 trillion. Some of the top laggards were altcoins like Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Jupiter ( JUP ), and Ethena ( ENA ). Analysts suggest the ongoing pullback is a typical occurrence during bull markets, as some investors begin locking in profits. In a statement to crypto.news, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said: “After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. This behavior is not unusual in bull cycles, where sharp rallies often lead to a wave of corrections as traders seek to de-risk their portfolios.” Ryan added that the ongoing geopolitical developments like trade tensions from the US had contributed to market uncertainty and triggered a risk-off sentiment. He added that: “While the overall outlook for digital assets remains positive, current price action suggests a cooling period, especially in speculative altcoins that saw outsized gains. Investor sentiment is being recalibrated in response to these developments.” Historically, Bitcoin tends to pull back after reaching a key resistance level, often triggering a broader correction across altcoins. For example, BTC hit a record high of $108,335 in December before retreating to $88,987 in January. It later surged to a new all-time high of $109,300 in the same month. Bitcoin price chart analysis points to an eventual rebound BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally, which could spark a broader altcoin rebound. On the daily chart, BTC is gradually forming a bullish flag pattern — characterized by a steep vertical rally (the flagpole) followed by a downward-sloping consolidation channel (the flag). This setup is typically viewed as a continuation pattern. Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the recent pullback forming the handle section. The cup features a depth of approximately 30%, or 34,000 points. Using standard technical analysis, the target for a cup-and-handle breakout is calculated by adding the cup’s depth to its upper boundary. In this case, adding $38,000 to the top of the pattern yields a projected target of $146,000.

2025-06-05T16:34:03,"Bitcoin price could reach reach $125k in June: Bitfinex","Bitcoin’s short-term price performance will largely be influenced by Friday’s U.S. jobs report and a continued increase in ETF inflows, according to Bitfinex analysts. Bitcoin (BTC) could climb to $125,000 by the end of June if macroeconomic conditions remain favorable, analysts told crypto.news on June 5. The primary catalyst in the near term is Friday’s non-farm payroll report, which is expected to show a slowdown in employment. Current forecasts for new non-farm payrolls range between 125,000 and 130,000 — down from April’s 177,000. Bitfinex analysts believe that a weaker-than-expected print would be bullish for Bitcoin, as it could accelerate the Federal Reserve’s timeline for interest rate cuts, a move generally favorable for risk assets like BTC. “We believe if Bitcoin maintains support above $105,000, it could target the $120,000–$125,000 range in June. This will not be catalysed just from the labour market but it could be a domino in multiple catalysts prompting the Fed to cut rates at a faster than expected pace,” Bitfinex analysts. Still, a stronger-than-expected jobs report could make rate cuts less likely. This would strengthen the dollar, but hurt Bitcoin and other crypto assets. In any case, the effects of the jobs data will trickle down to other Bitcoin price catalysts. This includes ETF inflows, which will be influenced by rate cuts and the strength of the dollar. You might also like: Elon Musk called it an “abomination” — but the Big Beautiful Bill might be crypto’s backdoor stimulus Jobs data remains in focus for Bitcoin’s price Investor sentiment remains divided ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report, given the mixed signals from earlier labor market data. For instance, the latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey showed strength, with job openings climbing to 7.39 million, up from 7.2 million in March. On the other hand, ADP private payrolls came in significantly below expectations, posting just 37,000 new jobs versus the anticipated 110,000. The breakdown revealed that small businesses shed 13,000 jobs, and large firms cut 3,000, while midsized companies added 49,000. While the U.S. labor market remains resilient , employers are concerned about the potential negative effects of the U.S. tariffs on its major trading partners.

2025-06-05T16:30:53,"Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure – Bearish Target At $142","Solana (SOL) is currently navigating a challenging environment as the broader crypto market experiences a cooldown. After an impressive run earlier this year, momentum has slowed significantly, and SOL is struggling to reclaim the $160 level with conviction. The lack of strong demand has been evident in recent sessions, as buying pressure fades and volume remains low across major altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout Despite this cooling phase, many investors remain optimistic. A growing number of market participants believe Solana could lead the next altseason once conditions stabilize and liquidity returns to the market. Historically, SOL has shown the ability to recover rapidly and outperform in bullish phases, making it one of the top contenders for explosive upside when sentiment shifts. However, in the short term, caution prevails. Top analyst Carl Runefelt has highlighted a key technical development, noting that Solana might be on the verge of breaking a horizontal support zone. This event could trigger further downside in the near term. If this support fails, traders should prepare for increased volatility. Still, the broader consensus remains that SOL’s structural strength and ecosystem development position it well for long-term upside once macro conditions align. Solana Faces Bear Flag Breakdown Risk As Uncertainty Grows Solana has been locked in a tight range just below the $160 mark, struggling to reclaim key levels despite multiple attempts. For several days, momentum has faded, and with global markets under pressure, traders are bracing for increased volatility. The broader crypto market is losing steam as Bitcoin and Ethereum fail to sustain upward moves, which puts added pressure on altcoins like Solana. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, with ongoing tariff disputes and rising bond yields fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. The US bond market, in particular, is flashing signs of stress, adding to the caution in risk-on assets. If these conditions persist, altcoins may face a challenging period as capital retreats to more stable assets like Bitcoin or exits the market altogether. Runefelt recently highlighted a key technical pattern on Solana’s chart—a bear flag forming around horizontal support. According to his analysis, this structure could break down any hour now, which would confirm the bearish setup and potentially send SOL down toward the $142 level. This target aligns with previous support zones and could act as a temporary bottom if the broader market stabilizes. Despite the short-term risks, long-term sentiment around Solana remains cautiously optimistic. The network’s continued development and strong DeFi presence could fuel a recovery once market conditions improve. For now, however, traders are closely watching the $160 resistance and the $150–$152 support area, which could determine the next directional move. A clean break below support would likely trigger a wave of selling, while a reclaim of the $160 level could invalidate the bearish setup and open the door for a bullish reversal. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? SOL Tests Key Support As Bearish Momentum Builds Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $152.62 on the 4-hour chart, testing a critical horizontal support zone as bearish momentum continues. The recent price action shows a clear downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows forming since the rejection from the $176–$180 area in late May. All key moving averages—34 EMA, 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA—are positioned above the current price, signaling short-term weakness and a lack of bullish momentum. Volume has picked up slightly as price nears support, suggesting increasing market interest at this level. However, the failure to break above the 34 EMA (currently at $157.70) reinforces the view that sellers are still in control. The flattening 200 SMA at $165.31 and declining 50 SMA around $159.82 indicate that SOL must reclaim the $160–$165 zone to regain strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst If the $150–$152 support range fails to hold, Solana could break down and target the next key support area around $142, in line with the projected move of the bear flag pattern identified by analysts.

2025-06-05T16:30:30,"XRP Lawsuit Faces Critical Deadline—Lawyer Warns No Motion, No Mercy","With just days remaining before a pivotal status update is due in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the XRP lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) case has once again entered a high-stakes phase. As of June 5, neither Ripple nor the Securities and Exchange Commission has refiled their joint request to amend the final judgment—an omission that could force the appeals court to resume briefing on unresolved issues. The procedural logjam began on May 15, when Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York denied a motion for an indicative ruling. “If jurisdiction were restored to this Court,” Torres wrote, “the Court would deny the parties’ motion as procedurally improper.” Both Ripple and the SEC had sought the court’s signal that it would be willing to vacate the longstanding injunction if remanded. XRP community lawyer Fred Rispoli immediately weighed in, noting that the denial was less about substance and more about flawed procedure. “The meaning here is that the parties didn’t request relief under the right rule of civil procedure,” he explained at the time. “So they will refile it under the correct rule but, me reading between the lines, is that Ripple and the SEC need to get on all fours and beg for relief.” Ticking Clock In XRP Lawsuit Now, nearly three weeks later, no refile has appeared on the docket, prompting renewed speculation and concern. “Twenty days later, no refile yet by SEC and Ripple in district court and the June 16 deadline for the status update in the 2nd Circuit looms large,” Rispoli wrote on June 4. “Expect the refile before Judge Torres to happen by then. If there is nothing pending before Torres when the parties file the status report, the 2nd Circuit only has Torres’ denial of the first request and will restart the briefing. If a motion is pending before Torres at the time of the 6/16 status report, the 2nd Circuit will likely push it out another 60 days,” he added. While the parties remain officially silent, legal observers are increasingly focused on the political and institutional implications of this delay. “What is the next step?” Rispoli asked rhetorically. “The message by Torres was clear that both parties need to beg for forgiveness. Ripple will say whatever to get it done—but how much public groveling is the SEC willing to do? And how much groveling will be authorized? We have 12 days to find out.” That sentiment was echoed by community members, including @xrp_hodl_r (Random Shark), who stressed the difficulty of the task at hand. “I don’t think that many of the respondents to this post realize what a high bar it is to convince a judge to amend a final judgement,” he wrote. “I suspect that both the SEC and Ripple will utilize all of the allotted time to prepare their detailed briefs.” Rispoli agreed with the procedural point. “It is a very high bar,” he wrote, “but that is because usually only one side wants to amend the judgment. The parties thought, and I did too, that because both sides wanted the same thing that she would go along.” The broader context makes the current impasse even more critical. With the SEC under new leadership and proposed crypto legislation advancing in Congress, both parties may have incentive to wrap the litigation quietly. But Judge Torres appears unwilling to rubber-stamp a compromise that lacks rigorous justification. James Farrell, General Counsel at JST Digital, added further nuance to the legal dilemma. “They don’t need her permission to settle the $ or drop the appeals,” he clarified. “It’s only to vacate the obey-the-law injunction. Hand waving ‘new admin, new policy, fairness, SEC ok with it’—not gonna cut it with ‘why is it tough to do what the injunction requires, which is just don’t go crime-ing.’” As of now, the June 16 deadline stands as a moment of truth. If no refile reaches Judge Torres by then, the case could revert to a new appellate battle—undoing months of attempted resolution and extending the legal shadow that has loomed over XRP for years.

2025-06-05T16:27:19,"White House Crypto Chief Bo Hines Met With El Salvador’s Bukele to Discuss Bitcoin","El Salvador and the United States are looking to ramp up their crypto partnership. Bo Hines, the executive director of the White House’s Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday. “The aspiring Bitcoin Superpower came to meet with the OG Bitcoin Country to discuss areas of mutual interest and possible collaboration relating to bitcoin, stablecoins and digital assets,” Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, told CoinDesk. “Over the coming months, I believe we will see some extraordinary things happen for both partners as a result of this meeting,” she added, without elaborating further. Hines is an important player in Washington when it comes to crypto policy, working alongside David Sacks, who chairs the crypto council and took on the role of AI and crypto czar. The two countries have gotten closer since U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Bukele was welcomed by Trump at the White House in April, where they discussed security agreements. El Salvador has agreed to take custody of some of the illegal immigrants deported by the U.S. in the country’s maximum security mega-prison, CECOT, built in 2022 as part of the government’s crackdown on violent gangs. El Salvador’s crypto regulation agency, the National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD), has also already met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the purpose of establishing a cross-border regulatory sandbox. The idea, according to CNAD President Juan Carlos Reyes, is for the U.S. to take advantage of El Salvador’s experience in regulating digital assets to evaluate streamlined regulatory approaches for its own framework.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/05/white-house-crypto-chief-bo-hines-met-with-el-salvadors-bukele-to-discuss-bitcoin,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Policy|El Salvador|Bitcoin|White House|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T16:15:38,"Trump's Truth Social files S-1 for a Bitcoin ETF","Donald Trump’s Truth Social is submitting its S-1 form to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a Bitcoin ETF. This corresponds to the company’s 19b-4 filing. Like the other spot BTC ETFs, the fund is designed to track the price of Bitcoin and offer a simpler way for investors to gain exposure without holding the asset directly. Crypto.com will be the only company that stores, executes, and provides liquidity for the ETF’s Bitcoin. However, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF launch is pending until the Registration Statement goes into effect and a Form 19b-4 filing with the SEC is approved. NYSE Arca will list the Shares when they go public. Trump Media looks to add to current market offerings The NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 form to list and sell shares of this fund and has already started the approval process in earnest. According to the S-1 form , Yorkville America is supporting the fund. However, some important information is missing from the file, like the fund’s ticker, seed capital, or share price. The filing statement for a Bitcoin ETF by Trump Media is a big step for the company to grow beyond its current social media, streaming, and fintech businesses. With this move, DJT can take advantage of the growing interest among institutions in Bitcoin investment vehicles. The business is setting this up as a physically-backed Bitcoin product. The ETF will hold real Bitcoin instead of swaps or futures contracts. This project aligns with the company’s “Bitcoin treasury strategy,” which was partly talked about in forward-looking statements. It suggests that the company is interested in crypto in more ways than just the ETF product. Truth Social Bitcoin ETF survival odds in the competitive market The market’s reception remains uncertain because Trump Media is a relatively new company dealing with well-known financial institutions with deeper experience in ETF management and distribution. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs came out in January 2024, the market has grown to have more than $130 billion in assets. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), which has assets worth nearly $69 billion, is the leader. The company already has a fintech brand called “Truth.Fi” that could be used as a distribution route, but the filing doesn’t say how this new product fits in with what they’re already doing. Analysts believe it could be a new ground for this industry because it involves a company with ties to the US president. But Truth Social is late to the party because it is filing in an area where many ETFs are already very cheap and easy to trade. In addition, this adds to the controversy about Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry. This might make it harder as investors doubt Trump’s crypto companies’ viability after his tenure. However, it is good timing for Trump’s organization. As reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan will start allowing its trading and wealth clients to borrow cash using crypto-related assets as collateral. Also, the bank will start including some clients’ crypto assets in their net worth figures. This means that Bitcoin and other digital assets will be treated the same as stocks, cars, and art.

2025-06-05T16:00:28,"Bitcoin futures rack $5M trading volume on its first day on Moscow Exchange","Russia’s largest stock trading venue, the Moscow Exchange, registered over $5 million of Bitcoin futures trading volume on the day it launched its crypto derivatives. More than 4,000 investors participated, the exchange announced, noting it will take into account customer demand when planning the development of the new market. Moscow Exchange releases first Bitcoin futures trading stats The volume of Bitcoin futures traded on Moscow Exchange exceeded 420 million rubles (over $5.3 million) at the end of June 4, the day the new product was offered to investors, a representative of the platform’s operator announced. Nearly 8,600 transactions were carried out and the number of clients involved in the trading reached 4,137, the Russian business daily Kommersant reported, quoting Maria Patrikeeva, managing director of the Moscow Exchange Derivatives Market. The executive emphasized that the leading Russian exchange intends to develop the new segment in accordance with customer requests and elaborated: “90% of the turnover on the futures market comes from qualified investors. Therefore, the launch of futures on shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF investment fund — an instrument available exclusively to this category of investors — was a logical and timely step in the development of our line.” The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) started trading futures contracts for the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) on Wednesday. The value is expressed in U.S. dollars per lot, and settlements are made in Russian rubles. The contracts will expire in September. The trading platform revealed it’s going to launch the product right after the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) said it’s authorizing the offering of crypto derivatives in the country. The regulator did that while warning both financial firms and their clients against direct investments in cryptocurrencies. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, managed by the American investment firm BlackRock, is one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds allowing investors to gain exposure to the price changes of BTC without directly holding the crypto. The fund has $70 billion in assets. Legalization opens crypto derivatives market for Russian investors Following the CBR’s announcement , Russia’s largest credit institution, majority state-owned Sberbank, launched structured bonds tied to the value of Bitcoin, which were also listed on MOEX. Another government-controlled bank, VTB, said it will offer the bonds to its clients. Sergey Selyutin, head of trading operations at the bank’s “VTB My Investments” arm, commented that the trading results from the Moscow Exchange indicate that Russian investors are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios and are ready to work with new assets. Currently, cryptocurrency derivatives are only available to “ highly qualified ” investors as the Bank of Russia favors restricting access to volatile assets and products based on them. The regulator has been a strong opponent to legalizing the free circulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian economy. To be treated as qualified investors, private individuals should prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $633,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (almost $1.27 million), the CBR suggested earlier this year. This week, the monetary authority proposed to raise the limit for non-qualified investors who want to buy digital financial assets (DFAs) from the current 600,000 rubles to 1 million rubles (around $12,500). Under Russian DFA law, the category includes various tokenized assets and rights, other than crypto. The CBR’s regulatory nod sparked a race between financial and banking institutions in Russia to tap into the domestic crypto derivatives market. One of the companies competing for a share, the Russian broker Finam, said it will launch products based on the most popular coins, including BTC and ETH.

Here Are the Details of the Call","US President Donald Trump announced that he had a phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping that lasted approximately 1.5 hours. The main agenda item of the meeting was the new trade agreement recently agreed between the two countries. Trump said the meeting had produced positive results for both sides and that complexities, especially on the rare earths issue, had been resolved. Trump said on social media, “I had a very productive phone call with President Xi of China. During this call that lasted about an hour and a half, we discussed some of the sensitive points of the trade agreement we recently agreed on. The meeting was very positive for both countries. There should no longer be any question marks about the complexity of rare earth products.” It was also stated that representatives of the two countries will hold face-to-face meetings at a location to be determined shortly. It was announced that the US side will be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Trump also said that President Xi invited him and his wife Melania Trump to China and that in response to this kind invitation, Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were invited to the U.S. Trump noted that the meeting focused almost entirely on trade issues, and that other geopolitical issues such as Russia-Ukraine or Iran were not brought up. Related News: Fresh Whales Are Very Active in Bitcoin: They Are Accumulating BTC at Record Levels - Here's What It Means The call came just days after Trump accused China of violating the initial trade deal reached in May last week and just a day after a Truth Social post in which he said Xi was “extremely difficult to make deals with.” As a result of negotiations between the parties, it was decided that the US would reduce customs duties on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%, while China would reduce duties on US imports from 125% to 10%. Trump, however, expressed disappointment that China had not fully complied with the agreement. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC: “The United States has done its part, but China has been slow to remove the non-tariff barriers that are in the agreement. This is completely unacceptable and must be addressed.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping – Is the Trade War Coming to an End?

2025-06-05T15:54:00,"Introducing The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF","Summary The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF is an actively managed strategy that synthetically provides exposure to bitcoin ETPs, seeking to gain indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin. Every week, BCCC seeks to write call options against a portion of its notional holdings in an effort to harvest option premiums and perform distributions. By writing call options against only a portion of its bitcoin ETP exposure, BCCC maintains the potential ability to benefit from a portion of the gains that may be realized. On June 4 th , 2025, we listed the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF ( BCCC ) on the Cboe BZX Exchange. BCCC is the latest addition to Global X’s covered call and growth ETF suite, and it is designed to offer investors the opportunity to indirectly participate in the price performance of bitcoin ETPs (exchange-traded products), while seeking to harvest option premiums and manage volatility by selling call options on the same underlying security. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) intrigue as an investment opportunity stems from a variety of factors, but whether investors choose to lean into its status as a decentralized currency, or simply view it as a speculative potential growth opportunity, the trajectory it has assumed over the last few years has been difficult to ignore. These days, new innovations in exchanges and products have made investing in bitcoin easier than ever. However, should investors wish to take positions, it’s likely they would still need to deal with the levels of volatility it has historically demonstrated. With wide price swings representing a potential deterrent, gaining indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin ETPs that provide exposure to bitcoin, while employing a call option writing strategy to exchange a portion of upside price appreciation potential for a stream of premiums, may represent an interesting value proposition. BCCC Offers Indirect Exposure to Bitcoin Within the Wrapper of an ETF Investors have sought various means by which to gain exposure to bitcoin over the years. From mining bitcoin itself, to trading it on crypto exchanges and engaging with bitcoin trusts, access has become increasingly seamless and potentially more efficient. Benefits of the progression have included wider accessibility and liquidity. Most recently, the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and ETFs that trade bitcoin futures have ushered in a new means by which to achieve this exposure. The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF seeks to achieve indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin by buying and selling options on bitcoin ETPs. Specifically, it utilizes long call options and short put options to obtain synthetic exposure to the price returns of these products. For illustrative purposes only. Illustration assumes the options positions are made at-the-money and does not include the effect of the premiums paid or received for establishing the option positions. BCCC’s options positions may not always be made at-the-money, which could affect the correlation of the returns. Gaining exposure to bitcoin ETPs in this fashion is potentially less expensive than buying the ETP outright, as options often cost less to purchase than the underlying vehicles they reference. It may also result in fund returns that deviate modestly from that of the underlying ETPs amid a weekly roll period. That said, upon the outcome period’s conclusion, returns are expected to converge to an approximate 1:1 rate. The Fund Seeks to Provide Weekly Distributions, Utilizing a Systematically Active Approach Although the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF is an active investment strategy, a series of functions within the fund are aimed at remaining relatively consistent. For instance, portfolio managers will seek to write weekly call options that are at-the-money or slightly out-of-the-money, from which approximately 75% of the call premiums received are expected to be ultimately distributed to shareholders. Additionally, only a portion of the funds’ notional holdings are expected to be covered, on a roll-to-roll basis, which is designed to allow for upside price appreciation potential to be consistently pursued. One of the important levers that BCCC engages to promote potentially higher premium values is weekly option writing. By writing options week after week, in succession, the fund may be able to generate larger premiums than it would by writing options with longer tenors (time until expiration). Options naturally lose value as they approach their expiration date, and this decay happens more rapidly during the final days before expiration. By repeatedly selling short-term weekly options, rather than longer-term options, the fund can potentially capture this accelerated value decrease more efficiently, allowing it to collect more premiums over time when compared to a strategy using longer-dated options. In conjunction with the writing of weekly options, the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF also aims to provide investors with a stream of weekly distributions. Each week, when call options are written, approximately 75% of the premium that is received from writing the call option is expected to be distributed to shareholders, while the balance of the premium is reinvested back into the fund. A distribution will offer investors the opportunity to pursue reinvestment or utilize the proceeds elsewhere. Meanwhile, any automatically re-invested premiums ought to provide a measure of support to the fund’s net asset value (NAV). BCCC May Be Considered a Hedged Bitcoin Strategy The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF writes call options on bitcoin ETPs that are either at-the-money or slightly out-of-the-money. For the portion of the portfolio on which call options are written, its upside is theoretically capped at the strike level of the written call options. An important consideration, however, is that by leaving a portion of the fund’s notional holdings uncovered, investors may still be able to participate in some of the upside of these bitcoin-tracking products. On the other side of the coin, BCCC will remain fully exposed to the downside price movements of the underlying ETPs. This downside is expected to be partially offset by the premiums that are pursued from writing the options. Operating in this fashion, the fund might make a bitcoin investment more palatable for those that still believe it can produce outsized returns but are apprehensive owing to its historically elevated levels of volatility. Conveniently, the same measure of volatility that might promote disinterest in a bitcoin investment is something that may well allow BCCC to procure better option premiums and provide more generous distributions. Bitcoin has shown the propensity to operate under these wider levels of volatility, as illustrated by the standard deviation of its daily returns over time relative to some major domestic equity indices. Conclusion: BCCC May Strike a Balance Between Growth and Distributions Based on the intermittent periods of remarkable price appreciation that bitcoin has been able to realize over the years, it’s no mystery why it has garnered interest from a broad segment of the investment community. Nonetheless, the peaks and valleys that have been associated with these advances may make an unhedged position in bitcoin feel like a roller coaster ride. By writing call options on a portion of bitcoin holdings, investors have the opportunity to maintain a degree of upside price appreciation potential associated with bitcoin, while managing its volatility through the pursuit of option premiums and distributions. The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF provides that potential exposure and may help accomplish that goal.

However, the subsequent decline made investors nervous, and an analyst made a prediction of $150,000. Accordingly, Foresight Ventures CEO Alice Li predicted that BTC could reach $150,000. The famous CEO said that increased regulatory clarity in the US could push Bitcoin above $150,000 this market cycle. At this point, the famous CEO said that positive US policy changes, including US President Donald Trump’s executive order approving the Bitcoin reserve and stablecoin developments, will be the main drivers of the rally in the rest of 2025. “The 2025 rally in the cryptocurrency market is mainly driven by the change in US policy. One of the strongest drivers of the rally is certainly policy change, with US President Donald Trump’s reserve approval and stablecoin developments as the main catalysts for Bitcoin. These developments could push Bitcoin above $150,000 in this market cycle.” The famous CEO added that the first interest rate cut of the year by the FED could significantly increase Bitcoin's price momentum. Li stated that the GENIUS law is a good start for stablecoin regulations and that the rest of the world will follow the US. “This law has set a great innovation example for the rest of the world.

2025-06-05T15:50:54,"Strategic Move: Smarter Web Company Expands Corporate Bitcoin Holdings","BitcoinWorld Strategic Move: Smarter Web Company Expands Corporate Bitcoin Holdings In a significant move signaling continued confidence in digital assets, UK-listed firm Smarter Web Company has once again increased its Bitcoin reserves. This latest announcement underscores a broader trend of companies exploring and executing strategies to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their treasury management. Smarter Web Company Bitcoin: Expanding Digital Reserves Smarter Web Company recently took to the social media platform X to announce a notable addition to its balance sheet. The company confirmed the purchase of an additional 39.52 BTC. This acquisition wasn’t a one-off decision but fits within a previously stated long-term vision. With this latest purchase, Smarter Web Company’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached an impressive 122.76 BTC. This accumulation demonstrates a clear commitment to Bitcoin as a component of their corporate assets. For a UK-listed entity, such a public and consistent approach to acquiring Bitcoin is noteworthy and provides a real-world example of evolving corporate finance strategies. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Smarter Web Company is not operating in a vacuum. Over the past few years, there has been an observable increase in the number of companies, both public and private, adding Bitcoin to their treasury. This trend, often referred to as adopting Corporate Bitcoin Holdings, is driven by various factors. Many companies see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in a macroeconomic environment characterized by quantitative easing and rising debt levels. Others view it as a store of value akin to digital gold. Furthermore, some corporations believe in the long-term appreciation potential of Bitcoin as the digital asset class matures and gains wider adoption globally. Examples of companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin include: MicroStrategy: A pioneer in the corporate Bitcoin treasury space, holding the largest amount. Tesla: Added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, though its holdings have fluctuated. Block (formerly Square): Another tech company that has allocated capital to Bitcoin. While Smarter Web Company’s holdings are smaller compared to these giants, their systematic approach highlights that this isn’t just a strategy for large tech firms but is being considered and implemented by companies across different sectors and sizes. What Drives Smarter Web Company’s Bitcoin Investment Plan? The recent purchase aligns perfectly with Smarter Web Company’s publicly stated Bitcoin Investment Plan. The company had previously revealed an ambitious long-term strategy to acquire Bitcoin over a 10-year period. This isn’t about timing the market but rather a systematic accumulation approach. A 10-year acquisition plan suggests a strategy similar to Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This approach can help mitigate the risk associated with price volatility, as purchases are made at various price points over time. For a volatile asset like Bitcoin, a long-term DCA strategy can smooth out the average purchase price and potentially yield favorable results over an extended horizon. This long-term view indicates that Smarter Web Company sees Bitcoin not as a short-term speculative play, but as a strategic asset intended to provide value over a decade or more. This commitment over such a long timeframe is a strong signal about their belief in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role within their financial framework. UK Company Bitcoin Strategy: A Look at Adoption Smarter Web Company’s actions provide insight into the evolving UK Company Bitcoin Strategy. While not as widespread as in some other regions, there is growing interest among UK businesses in understanding and potentially adopting digital assets. Factors influencing a UK company’s decision to hold Bitcoin include: Macroeconomic Climate: Concerns about inflation and the stability of traditional fiat currencies. Diversification: Seeking alternative assets uncorrelated or less correlated with traditional markets. Innovation & Future Readiness: Positioning the company at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. Shareholder Value: The potential for asset appreciation to benefit shareholders in the long run. However, UK companies also face unique considerations, including navigating the specific regulatory landscape within the UK, accounting standards for digital assets, and potential public perception. Smarter Web Company’s willingness to publicly pursue a Bitcoin strategy could serve as a case study for other UK firms contemplating similar moves. Their experience navigating the operational and financial aspects of holding Bitcoin will be valuable for the broader market. Benefits and Considerations of Strategic BTC Acquisition Engaging in a Strategic BTC Acquisition, as Smarter Web Company is doing, comes with potential benefits but also important considerations: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often cited as a protection against currency debasement. Store of Value: Its characteristics make it a candidate for preserving wealth over time. Potential for Appreciation: As adoption grows and network effects strengthen, the price could increase significantly. Diversification: Adds an asset class that may behave differently from traditional stocks and bonds. Transparency: Holdings on the blockchain are verifiable. Key Considerations & Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and substantial swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and within the UK. Security Risks: Requires robust security measures to protect private keys and prevent theft. Accounting Treatment: How to classify and account for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current standards. Public & Investor Perception: Some stakeholders may be skeptical or unfamiliar with crypto assets. Companies must carefully weigh these factors, conduct thorough due diligence, and establish clear policies and security protocols before undertaking a strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan. In conclusion, Smarter Web Company’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin, culminating in 122.76 BTC holdings, is a tangible example of a UK-listed company executing a long-term Bitcoin Investment Plan. Their Strategic BTC Acquisition highlights the growing trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings and provides a relevant case study for understanding the motivations, strategies, and considerations involved in adopting digital assets within a corporate treasury framework. As the digital asset space continues to mature, observing the progress and outcomes of companies like Smarter Web Company will offer valuable insights into the future intersection of corporate finance and cryptocurrency.

2025-06-05T15:20:54,"Visa Stablecoin Cards: Revolutionizing Payments Across Asia-Pacific","BitcoinWorld Visa Stablecoin Cards: Revolutionizing Payments Across Asia-Pacific Big news is hitting the wires for anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance and the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies! Visa, a global leader in digital payments, is making a significant move in Asia-Pacific with the introduction of Visa stablecoin cards . This development signals a growing acceptance and integration of digital currencies into everyday transactions, promising exciting possibilities for users and businesses across the region. What Are Visa Stablecoin Cards? At its core, this initiative involves creating payment cards that are directly linked to stablecoin balances. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or sometimes to commodities or other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes them far more practical for everyday transactions and payments. The new Visa stablecoin cards, launched through collaborations with key partners, allow users to convert their fiat currency into supported stablecoins and then use those stablecoins to make purchases anywhere Visa is accepted worldwide. The conversion from stablecoin back to fiat happens seamlessly at the point of sale, meaning the merchant receives traditional currency, while the user spends their digital assets. Exploring the Visa Partnership in Asia Visa isn’t doing this alone. This strategic push into stablecoin payments in Asia-Pacific is a result of a Visa partnership Asia with three notable entities: DCS Singapore, DTC Pay, and StraitsX. Each partner brings a unique strength to the table: DCS Singapore: Likely involved in the card issuance and processing infrastructure. DTC Pay: A payment provider specializing in digital assets, helping to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional payment rails. StraitsX: A prominent stablecoin issuer in Southeast Asia, known for its Singapore Dollar-pegged stablecoin, XSGD, and potentially others. Their role is crucial in providing the stable digital asset layer for these cards. This collaborative approach leverages the expertise of digital asset specialists alongside Visa’s vast global payment network, aiming to create a robust and user-friendly system for stablecoin payments Asia . Driving Stablecoin Payments in Asia-Pacific Why is Visa focusing on stablecoin payments in Asia-Pacific? The region is a hotbed for innovation and has shown significant interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Many countries in Asia-Pacific have rapidly growing digital economies and populations increasingly comfortable with digital finance. The partnership aims to tap into this market by offering a practical use case for stablecoins. By enabling users to spend stablecoins easily at millions of locations, Visa and its partners are providing a tangible benefit that could accelerate the adoption of digital currencies for commerce. This move could significantly boost stablecoin payments Asia -wide, making digital assets more than just speculative investments. Bridging Crypto and Fiat: A New Crypto Payment Solution One of the biggest hurdles for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption has been the difficulty in using digital assets for everyday purchases. You often have to convert crypto back to fiat through an exchange, which can be slow and involve fees, before you can spend it. These new cards act as a crucial bridge. They represent a significant step forward as a crypto payment solution that simplifies the process dramatically. Users can hold stablecoins and spend them directly, with the complexity of conversion handled in the background by the payment processor. This creates a smoother experience akin to using a traditional debit or credit card, but powered by digital assets. Benefits of this approach include: Global Acceptance: Spend stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted. Speed: Transactions can potentially be faster than traditional methods in some cases, depending on the underlying stablecoin network and processing. Reduced Costs: Depending on the card provider and stablecoin network, transaction fees might be lower compared to traditional international transfers or card fees. Ease of Use: Converts a digital asset into a universally accepted payment method. This makes it easier for individuals and potentially businesses to utilize stablecoins for various transactions, from buying groceries to paying for online services. Implications for Digital Currency Adoption Visa’s involvement is a powerful endorsement for the use of stablecoins in commerce. As a globally recognized brand, their participation lends credibility and visibility to digital asset payments. This partnership is likely to have significant implications for overall digital currency adoption , not just in Asia-Pacific but potentially as a model for other regions. Here’s how this could impact the landscape: Increased User Confidence: Seeing a trusted network like Visa facilitate stablecoin transactions can make potential users feel more secure and willing to experiment with digital assets. Broader Merchant Acceptance: While the conversion happens instantly for the merchant, Visa’s integration makes it easier for businesses to effectively ‘accept’ stablecoins without changing their existing payment systems. Regulatory Push: As major players like Visa enter the space, it often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines, which can further legitimize and facilitate digital currency adoption. Innovation Catalyst: This move could inspire other payment networks and financial institutions to explore similar integrations, accelerating the development of crypto payment solutions. While challenges remain, including navigating diverse regulatory environments across Asia-Pacific and ensuring user education, this partnership represents a tangible step towards a future where digital currencies play a more integrated role in the global economy. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite the exciting potential, launching stablecoin-backed cards isn’t without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity surrounding stablecoins varies significantly from country to country in Asia-Pacific. Partners must navigate different legal frameworks regarding digital assets, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Furthermore, ensuring seamless technical integration across different platforms and providing adequate customer support for users who might be new to digital assets are crucial for widespread success. The user experience needs to be as smooth and reliable as using a traditional Visa card. However, the collaboration between a global payment giant and innovative fintech and stablecoin companies suggests a commitment to overcoming these challenges and building a robust infrastructure for the future of payments. Conclusion The launch of Visa stablecoin cards in Asia-Pacific, facilitated by partnerships with DCS Singapore, DTC Pay, and StraitsX, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital payments. By creating a simple and globally accepted way to spend stablecoins, Visa is helping to bridge the gap between the traditional financial system and the digital asset economy. This initiative has the potential to significantly boost stablecoin payments Asia-wide, serving as a powerful new crypto payment solution and accelerating overall digital currency adoption. It’s a clear signal that stablecoins are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative assets, but as viable tools for everyday commerce.

2025-06-05T15:16:08,"Crypto Self Custody Is the Future, and People Say Best Wallet Leads the Way","What does crypto want to be when it grows up? Centralized exchanges like Coinbase have long marketed themselves as crypto’s answer to convenience. User-friendly, regulated, and custodial. Just give them the keys and let them drive. They’ll handle all the boring details – like on/off ramps, UI, integrated swapping, and little things like taking control of your crypto. And in return, all you need to do is trust. But increasingly, that deal sounds like a bad one. The trade-off between trust and control is no longer worth it. Trust Coinbase and other custodial platforms too much, and what do you get? Hacks and data breaches , among other things. There’s a better path forward – and more and more crypto users are looking for it. A Better Custody Deal So, what should the future of crypto be? Crypto should still be easy. It should still be intuitive. But it should also be private, safe, secure, and truly self-custodial. After all, the old adage of ‘not your keys, not your crypto’ shouldn’t just be a slogan – it is, and should be, the foundation of decentralized finance. That’s where wallets like Best Wallet come in. Unlike centralized platforms, self-custody crypto wallets like Best Wallet don’t hold your private keys. You have complete control of your assets at all times. There are no middlemen, no single points of failure, and no need to put your trust in third parties. But what about the convenience of swapping crypto, sending crypto, and exploring new crypto opportunities all from one app? Bridging the Gap: Self-Custody Meets Convenience The future of crypto points to tools that combine the convenience of centralized exchanges like Coinbase, including KYC and AML requirements, with the security of self-custody, without sacrificing usability. We’ve already seen this with tools like Railgun , which complies with KYC while enabling private transactions on DeFi platforms, and which Vitalik Buterin just used to transfer $2.6M in crypto. While transactions of that size may well be just another day in the office for the Ethereum founder, it demonstrates how increasingly important privacy, control, and functionality are in the developing crypto economy. This is nothing new; it’s often the people most deeply involved in tech who understand just how important it is to control your own data (and your own crypto). Remember Zuckerberg’s camera? That was the time he was promoting Meta, and everyone realized he’d taped across his laptop’s microphone and camera. Was that paranoia or an understanding of just how vulnerable our data is? That’s the balance that Best Wallet wants to deliver, beating MetaMask at its own game and dominating the Web3 self-custody wallet market. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Self-Custody Crypto Wallet Presale Token Crypto wallets aren’t just handy places to stash some spare Bitcoin, at least not anymore. The best crypto wallets – like Best Wallet – serve as all-in-one control hubs for crypto investors, whether you’re operating multiple wallets, swapping tokens, ot investing in crypto presales. And that’s not all. The Best Wallet ecosystem is supercharged by its own token, $BEST . Best Wallet Token holders get: Lower transaction fees Higher staking rewards Earlier presale access Eligibility for bonus crypto airdrops (such as BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrop) Best Wallet and the $BEST token are building the crypto future that Buterin and others are looking for: interconnected, seamless, and self-custodial. It’s everything you could want or ever need from a crypto wallet. You can manage your portfolio, browse upcoming token launches (including the best new meme coins ), and spend your crypto in real life with the upcoming Best Card. Buying, selling, and swapping are as easy as tapping a few buttons. And all this is secured with multi-party computation (MPC) and biometric authentication to keep your crypto safe without sacrificing ease of use. The Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $13.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.025135. That could rise to $0.035215 by the end of the year, according to our $BEST price prediction , delivering gains of 40% to current presale investors. Learn more about how to buy Best Wallet Token with our guide. Best Wallet: Building the Self-Custodial Future of Crypto No longer does crypto have to choose between usability and control. Tools like Best Wallet are showing that self-custody platforms can match – or even beat – the convenience that centralized exchanges offer while staying true to the core values of crypto. As more self-custodial models appear in a post-Coinbase world, Best Wallet wants to lead the charge and dominate this $11B sector. If it succeeds, it will be by delivering a product that is convenient and completely crypto-native. Always do your own research before investing in crypto; this isn’t financial advice.

Best Wallet is helping to build that future.",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-self-custody-is-the-future-best-wallet-leads-the-way/,"BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|AIRDROP","Cryptocurrency Market News",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T15:07:03,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Hovers Around $105,000 As Indecisiveness Persists","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade around $105,000 as selling pressure and buyer exhaustion weigh on the price. The flagship’s cryptocurrency’s price action indicates indecision after its sharp retracement from its all-time high of $111,970. Momentum stalled after BTC reached this level as investors locked in their profits, leading to a decline that gradually transitioned into a sideways consolidation phase. BTC had dipped to a low of $103,734 at the beginning of the week before recovering and moving to current levels. The price is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,825. New Whales Scoop Up Billions in Bitcoin Bitcoin is facing a significant pullback in recent sessions, with its price trading below key levels after surging to a new all-time high. Despite the decline, on-chain data has revealed a startling discovery. A new set of Bitcoin whales, wallets with 1000 Bitcoin aged less than six months, have been accumulating the asset at a frenetic pace. According to CryptoQuant analysts, this accumulation could indicate renewed conviction among participants for future catalysts and price jumps. The amount held by the new Bitcoin whales doubled from 500,000 BTC to over 1.1 million BTC between March 1 and June 4, representing an increase of over $63 billion in value. The share of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply grew from 2.5% to 5.6%, removing an amount equivalent to ten months of Bitcoin mining output from active circulation. Analysts believe new whale activity indicates a shift in the market. If these whales continue to remove BTC from circulation, it could herald a period of price compression followed by upside volatility. Vitalik Buterin Concedes Bitcoin Dominance in Some Areas Of Crypto Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has conceded that Bitcoin is ahead of Ethereum in some aspects of the crypto space. Buterin made the comments in response to users who were debating about the protocol’s strengths and what it must improve upon. Some users believe Ethereum is leading the industry in terms of censorship resistance but not transactions per second. Buterin confirmed this but stated that there are some aspects of the crypto space dominated by Bitcoin . “I believe Ethereum is leading in terms of CR and security. There are some aspects of this where Bitcoin is ahead (eg. less code complexity, lower rate of protocol change, higher full node count, less dependence on RPCs).” He stated that Bitcoin was superior to Ethereum in terms of coding simplicity, fewer protocol changes, node count, and lesser dependency on services like Infura, Alchemy, or Ankr. Buterin believes Ethereum is more advanced in censorship resistance and security thanks to its flexible and evolving protocol. JPMorgan To Accept Bitcoin ETFs As Collateral JPMorgan is expanding its financing options to include spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing its customers to use their crypto ETFs as collateral when applying for a loan. According to sources, the new offering will apply to the banking giant’s wealthy clients. Recently, the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, announced it will allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. Dimon, a crypto skeptic, had stated that he would defend the people’s right to buy Bitcoin. The new service will begin with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $40 billion in cumulative inflows and over $70 billion in net assets. The bank could expand its offering to include other Bitcoin ETFs. Reports have also claimed that JPMorgan plans to add crypto holdings to the list of assets considered when financial managers assess a client’s net worth. The bank will also include crypto in the assessment of liquid assets, treating it like real estate, stocks, and motor vehicles. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action remained subdued as it struggled to build momentum and cross the 20-day SMA. The price briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session but crashed back below it, moving to its current level of $104,770. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced significant selling pressure after reaching its all-time high as investors locked in their profits and buyer exhaustion set in. Data shows that long liquidations are stabilizing after hitting a peak of $206 million. The past 24 hours saw $200 million worth of long positions flushed as markets opened facing strong selling pressure. Market sentiment has also waned, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index. The index peaked at 76 in May but has fallen to 57, indicating the prevalence of a neutral attitude among investors. Investors may be adopting a wait-and-watch approach, thanks to renewed trade tensions between the US and China. According to some analysts, BTC could slip below $100,000 if the current downtrend continues, falling as low as $92,000. However, others have stated that while BTC’s pullback is concerning, investors are still optimistic about a recovery. Crypto market sentiment remains strong. Some analysts believe BTC could surge to a new all-time high above $115,000 next month if institutional interest continues and US job data is weaker than expected. “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July.” The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report on June 6. Job data is a crucial indicator for Bitcoin as it impacts the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, which in turn, influences sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. “A stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin.” On the other hand, a softer-than-expected report could encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates sooner. BTC traded in positive territory last weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. The price continued to push higher on Monday, rising to $109,453, but lost momentum on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $109,000 and settle at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell over 1% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 2.01%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as the price fell 1.61%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Source: TradingView BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and 0.95% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. The price plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 as the week started on a bearish note. However, the price recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903.

One in a Million Chances! According to Mempool data, a Bitcoin miner earned a block reward of $330,000 despite the network difficulty reaching a record high of 126.98 trillion. According to the data, the solo miner earned $327,625 in subsidy rewards and approximately $2,761 in total transaction fees and claimed 3.15 BTC. A solo miner successfully mined block number 899,826 and earned a rare reward worth $330,386. The miner achieved the feat by mining block 300 from the solo.ckpool Bitcoin mining pool. “Congratulations to miner bc1qa8r4up9nchkvdnhcf9feexv2jfantrk48ef374 who increased his hash rate to solve block 300 solved on solo.ckpool.org!” said CKpool developer Con Kolivas. Kolivas said that based on Bitcoin’s hash rate, a single miner is likely renting additional hash rate to increase his chances of winning the block reward. “Although the miner has been mining at a much lower hash rate for some time, the reason the hash rate has increased to these levels is most likely a rental due to there being only one worker.” Bitcoin blocks are produced approximately every 10 minutes and are typically mined by mining pools that have the highest chance of winning the block reward. The reward for successfully mining a block is currently 3,125 Bitcoins after a halving event earlier this year. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T15:00:58,"BTC whales back to stacking Bitcoin, shifting from distribution mode","Glassnode analytics revealed that the largest Bitcoin holders are now back in accumulation after briefly being in distribution. According to the firm, all wallet cohorts indicated varying degrees of buying. At the time of publication, BTC is currently exchanging hands at $104,786, a 3.75% drop in the last 7 days. The digital asset is also a few percentage points shy of its all-time high of $111.970, but despite its small pullback, BTC is still up 13% this year. BTC struggles to push past its all-time high While its price may appear stable on the surface, on-chain data suggests a shift from distribution to accumulation among Bitcoin’s largest holders. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score, a measure of accumulation behavior across various wallet-size cohorts, suggested the shift in BTC’s market dynamics. The metric evaluates purchasing strength by combining the size of wallet entities with the volume of BTC acquired over the past 15 days. The firm also noted that wallets associated with exchanges and miners are excluded from the analysis to provide a clearer picture of investor behavior. Data from Glassnote showed that the strongest wallet activity of cohorts was at the 10-100 groups, while the least wallet activity was below 1 group. The analytics company also noted that both scored 1.0, which is the highest possible. A reading of 1 indicates strong bullish momentum, while a level near 0 points to a market sell-off. Bitcoin Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort. Source: Glassnode According to Glassnode, wallets holding 10,000 BTC or more, typically classified as whales, were the first to begin accumulating at the market’s April lows at around $75,000.

The analytics firm suggests a strategic shift, potentially driven by a desire to lock in profits near historic highs or a more cautious outlook on short-term price direction. Analyst Willy Woo argued that BTC’s failure to sustain its bounce on June 3 suggests a lack of demand at higher levels, with expectations it may fall to the psychological $100K level. Woo also cautioned that buying Bitcoin in six figures may not make sense in the short term, but it might be “one of the best investments you’ll see in your investment career” within the next 10 years. According to Sygnum Bank’s Monthly Investment Outlook, its analysts noted that institutional adoption and the rise of Bitcoin acquisition vehicles had resulted in a 30% drop in Bitcoin’s liquid supply. The bank’s analysts believe it could create the conditions for demand shocks and upside volatility. Bitcoin’s price depends on coming macroeconomic developments Bitfinex analysts predicted that Bitcoin could reach the $120,000 – $125,000 range as early as June, contingent on favorable macroeconomic developments. They believe that if BTC could maintain support above $105K, it could target its forecasted range this month. The analyst also argued that the rise would not be catalyzed just by the labor market but could be a domino with multiple catalysts prompting the Fed to cut rates faster than expected. Analysts believe Friday’s U.S. jobs report will catalyze Bitcoin upwards past its current accumulation face. Employment data is expected to show 125,000 to 130,000 new nonfarm payrolls, representing a lower figure from April’s 177,000 additions. Dr. Kirill Kretov from CoinPanel suggested that a weaker-than-expected NFP figure of a rise in the employment rate could signal a cooling labor market, increasing the likelihood of Fed rate cuts. He also believes such a scenario might boost risk appetite, driving investor interest toward digital assets like Bitcoin. Bitfinex also stated that a softer-than-expected NFP report could reinforce the disinflation narrative and prompt the Fed to consider rate cuts sooner, which could be bullish for BTC. The firm also argued that a stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting selling momentum on Bitcoin.

2025-06-05T15:00:54,"Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over","The Bitcoin price is falling fast, and with bears currently taking control, a crypto analyst has forecasted an impending crash below $100,000. While this potential downturn may sound alarming, the analyst has also revealed that after the pullback, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to undergo a significant price rally to new all-time highs. Bitcoin Price Faces Immediate Crash Risk Bitcoin appears to be entering a cooling phase after experiencing a significant bullish run that spanned several weeks and led to its current all-time high of almost $112,000. ‘MelikaTrader94’, the TradingView crypto analyst responsible for this new technical analysis, predicts that during this cooling period, bears could take over and send the Bitcoin price crashing down to former lows under $100,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings On a 4-hour chart presented by the analyst, Bitcoin has consistently respected a descending trendline acting as a strong resistance threshold. This line, which formed after the recent peak, has now rejected price action multiple times, preventing further upward movement and hinting at growing bearish pressure in the short term. At the time of the analysis, Bitcoin was trading at $106,432, attempting to test the descending trendline once again. However, the chart shows that BTC lacks strong momentum, suggesting that another rejection is likely. If this rejection occurs, BTC’s price action is expected to correct downward toward the $99,000 region, marked on the chart as a key horizontal support zone. Bitcoin’s projected pullback is consistent with typical market behavior, especially after an extended bullish phase. Based on the TradingView expert’s analysis, a drop to the $99,000 support level could shake out weak hands and provide fresh buy-dip opportunities for traders. While the structure of the projected downward move is not entirely bearish, it suggests a necessary retest of lower support areas before any sustainable rally can resume. Bullish Continuation Expected After Pullback MelikaTrader94 has suggested that correcting down to the $99,000 support zone is critical for determining Bitcoin’s next rally. If this crash successfully occurs and buyers step in to defend the support, BTC could begin forming a strong bullish continuation structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch The TradingView analyst’s chart outlines a possible rebound from the support area, which could trigger a breakout above the descending trendline. A sustained move above this trendline would potentially invalidate the short-term bearish structure and set the stage for a new all-time high, with price targets extending beyond $114,000. Notably, Bitcoin’s consolidation around its current price of $104,500, followed by a possible dip to the well-established support zone, fits the analyst’s narrative that the market is preparing for a big move. The TradingView expert has urged investors and traders to keep an eye out for a strong bounce, as this projected pullback could be a healthy one that comes just before a bullish leg up.

2025-06-05T14:56:15,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As JPMorgan Set to Accept Bitcoin as Collateral","When long-standing critics of crypto begin to loosen their grip and shift strategy, it often signals more than a trend. It suggests legitimacy is no longer up for debate. Bitcoin is now being treated as a financial instrument that carries real weight, not just speculative interest. That shift became undeniably clear with JPMorgan’s recent decision to allow Bitcoin to be used as collateral for loans. Once known for its skepticism, the Wall Street institution is now rolling out crypto-backed lending services for its wealthiest clients. As banking giants change their views, the narrative changes within the global finance space. It’s no longer about whether crypto will be accepted. The real question is how fast it integrates into everything else. Jamie Dimon Backs Down as Bitcoin Enters JPMorgan’s Loan Books Jamie Dimon’s public stance on Bitcoin has long walked a fine line between resistance and reluctant acknowledgment. The JPMorgan CEO, once vocal about his distrust in crypto, now finds his bank pioneering a lending structure that accepts Bitcoin ETF holdings as legitimate collateral. And not just in theory—the move is already rolling out for high-net-worth clients globally. The program begins with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, the most heavily funded spot ETF in the market. But insiders suggest this is just the start. Other ETFs and crypto-based products could soon be eligible. Even more significant is the bank’s internal shift. Bitcoin is now part of net worth assessments and liquid asset evaluations, treated in the same category as stocks or real estate. That’s not just a policy change, but essentially a redefinition of the asset as a whole, since it could now become a recognized transfer of value. JUST IN: $3.6 trillion asset manager JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin & crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. pic.twitter.com/znmDyJvyVG — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 4, 2025 While the market hasn’t reacted dramatically to the announcement, the implications stretch far. JPMorgan’s decision gives institutional investors a clear signal that Bitcoin isn’t fringe anymore. It’s collateral-worthy, and that could open the floodgates for other entities too. Crypto-backed lending isn’t new, but when the biggest U.S. bank begins offering it to its elite clientele, the perception shifts across the board. It may start small, but this kind of move makes it easier for crypto to weave into traditional finance in ways that once seemed impossible. Best Crypto to Buy Now SUBBD There is a shift happening in crypto. Meme-fueled hype cycles are no longer enough to keep investor interest intact. What the market now seems to favor are projects that come built with function, long-term use cases, and real user demand. SUBBD is one of those rare tokens designed with an actual ecosystem in mind. Instead of promising vague future utilities, SUBBD builds on a model that redefines how creators, influencers, and their audiences interact. It opens the door to monetization without intermediaries. Content creators get to issue exclusive digital passes, while fans can back their favorite personalities through a decentralized rewards structure. The SUBBD token functions not as a placeholder, but as a transaction layer within the creator economy. Every purchase, every vote of support, every unlockable reward runs through it. This transforms the project into a working protocol, not a marketing experiment. Utility-based tokens like SUBBD are becoming the ones investors lean toward when the noise clears. They speak to actual value flow, where the token is involved in processes people want to participate in. And with the rise of social monetization models, SUBBD seems particularly timed to scale. Platforms that allow creators to own the economics of their work are gaining traction globally. SUBBD just happens to offer that with blockchain-based infrastructure. For investors watching projects with long arcs, this one sits at the intersection of culture and decentralization. Not flashy, but functional. And sometimes, that’s what sticks around longest. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper focuses on a problem that has existed for years. Bitcoin, while dominant in value and recognition, has never been known for fast or affordable transactions. This project introduces a Layer 2 structure intended to change that without modifying the Bitcoin protocol itself. Instead, it builds around it, using Ethereum-based tools to create an auxiliary system that aims to handle transfers, staking, and DeFi functions at a pace and cost that the original network cannot achieve alone. The project draws from several established scaling technologies. These include components that facilitate off-chain computation, batch transaction processing, and side networks that interact with the main chain only when needed. In doing so, Bitcoin Hyper attempts to preserve the integrity of Bitcoin while expanding its use case in real time. These systems are not theoretical. They already exist in various parts of the Ethereum ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper brings them together under one framework and adjusts them for compatibility. The token plays multiple roles. It fuels transactions, governs protocol-level decisions, and supports staking within the ecosystem. The presale includes a feature where buyers can begin staking at the point of purchase, which reduces the friction that often comes with onboarding. The $HYPER Pre-Sale is now LIVE!Get up to speed 👇 https://t.co/yzXqAckjDw pic.twitter.com/sij7UFBOcb — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) May 8, 2025 It is also riding a subtle macro theme. As Bitcoin finds greater institutional use—from treasury holdings to collateral agreements like the JPMorgan rollout—the appetite for projects tied to Bitcoin’s image could increase. Bitcoin Hyper benefits from being on-brand while offering something more aggressive in structure. That might not appeal to conservative investors, but it speaks directly to those who want velocity, not just security. Early interest has been consistent, and the presence of an audit by a recognized third party suggests a level of operational planning. The project does not try to redefine Bitcoin. It offers a structure around it that supports what users want today without compromising what Bitcoin was built to protect. Solaxy Solaxy is the kind of project that emerges when two different networks need a bridge without giving up their identities. Essentially, Solaxy aims to make transactions between Ethereum and Solana feel less like a workaround and more like a native experience. But it does not stop at just being another cross-chain protocol. It introduces a reward-heavy structure that incentivizes users to not just move assets, but to hold and participate. Built as a Layer 2 network with high-speed confirmation, Solaxy allows users to stake their tokens while enjoying considerably lower gas fees. It appeals to those who understand that future scaling does not lie with singular chains but in systems that allow fluidity across platforms. With both Ethereum’s security and Solana’s speed being critical to various sectors, Solaxy acts like a glue that holds together the best parts of each. Featured in several popular YouTuber channels like Cilinix Crypto and more, SOLX is described as more than a network access token. It has staking built in with good APY returns, rewarding users not just for trust, but for engagement. And as more projects begin launching in environments that demand cheaper transaction costs and faster execution, the infrastructure layer that Solaxy offers becomes more relevant. In a year where institutional support for crypto infrastructure is becoming more public, Solaxy’s model feels ahead of its time. If the integration of assets into mainstream finance is truly happening, as with JPMorgan’s Bitcoin move, then the demand for smart bridges like Solaxy is set to rise fast. Best Wallet Token At some point, crypto wallets stopped being just tools and started becoming ecosystems of their own. Best Wallet took that idea and refined it into something that feels usable, familiar, and technically superior. What began as a multi-chain wallet quickly turned into a central platform for managing portfolios, accessing DeFi protocols, and even participating in presales. That broader vision is precisely why the Best Wallet Token is drawing serious attention from both seasoned holders and newcomers looking for access without complexity. Its main product, Best Wallet, is now among the few crypto apps to be featured by legacy media - including a recent mention in the New York Post as one of the most polished and secure wallets currently available. That kind of recognition does not come easily, especially in a space where most wallet apps either overpromise or underdeliver. But Best Wallet seems to have struck a rare balance between security, design, and extensibility. The token itself is more than a governance label. It gives holders access to exclusive perks such as staking rewards, early access to curated presales, and native trading fee discounts. More importantly, it is fully integrated into the ecosystem. That makes it less speculative and more utility-bound. In a market gradually shifting toward all-in-one solutions, the presence of a platform like Best Wallet is more than convenient. It is a signal of where crypto UX is heading. If decentralization is going mainstream, it will need familiar tools. Best Wallet just might be one of them. Conclusion When institutions once skeptical of crypto begin adding crypto to their main services, the bar for quality rises across the board. It is no longer about novelty or narrative. Projects that offer function, infrastructure, or access are beginning to align with where the market is clearly heading. The examples above reflect that shift, not because they chase trends, but because they anticipate what a mature digital economy will require. That makes them worth more than a glance.

2025-06-05T14:52:26,"Trump’s Truth Social Bitcoin ETF could shake up $130B crypto fund market","Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) has filed to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, joining a crowded but rapidly growing market of crypto investment products. The S-1 registration form , submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aims to secure approval for listing the ETF on NYSE Arca. If granted, it would mark a strategic leap for Trump Media from social media into the financial sector, specifically the $130 billion Bitcoin ETF market. While the application process is still underway, this proposed ETF would provide retail investors with a simplified, regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, something that aligns with former President Donald Trump’s growing public endorsement of digital assets. Trump Media expands beyond social media Originally launched to challenge mainstream platforms, Truth Social has evolved into the public face of Trump Media’s broader tech ambitions. Following its ventures into streaming via Truth+ and fintech via Truth. Fi, the company is now targeting cryptocurrency investment. The proposed ETF would be backed by Yorkville America Digital, a self-described “America-First” asset manager, with Crypto.com named as the Bitcoin custodian and primary liquidity provider. These partnerships suggest an effort to combine Trump branding with established crypto infrastructure to attract investor confidence. The move into digital assets comes at a time when Trump Media is still a relatively small player in the tech world. However, its listed status on the NASDAQ and the former president’s continued public influence have given the firm a visibility advantage over its peers. Trump Media recently announced a $2.5 billion investment in Bitcoin to build a corporate treasury. The aim is to diversify its revenue streams and align with the growing trend of corporate crypto holdings. SEC review to determine market entry Approval from the SEC remains the biggest hurdle before the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF can go live. Should it receive the green light, trading would commence on NYSE Arca, one of the main venues for existing Bitcoin ETFs. This ETF would join products from asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, which have already drawn billions in inflows since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024. Yet the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF hopes to stand out through its political branding and direct appeal to Trump’s base of supporters. Retail investors who have previously hesitated due to a lack of clarity around crypto wallets, keys, or exchanges may find the ETF format easier to navigate. If listed, the ETF would offer exposure to Bitcoin without the complications of managing digital assets directly. Questions raised over brand ethics and timing Trump Media’s push into financial services has reignited debate over ethical boundaries, particularly concerning the use of Donald Trump’s name and influence. While Trump is no longer officially involved in the day-to-day operations of his businesses, his name remains tied to their identity and marketing. Critics argue that this ETF could serve as a vehicle for Trump-aligned investors to support his brand while gaining crypto exposure. Others point out that his recent comments on Bitcoin as a “financial freedom” tool may help sway investors towards the fund. The timing is also significant. Trump is currently the sitting president, and while he has stepped away from direct business involvement, the proximity of this product to his political image could invite scrutiny from regulators and watchdogs.

2025-06-05T14:43:49,"Bitcoin’s Current Bull Cycle Is Unlike Anything We’ve Seen Before","As Bitcoin continues to navigate a turbulent upward trajectory after the recent drawdown from its ATH in May, analysts are revisiting historical bull markets for context. However, this time around, some trends appear to be evolving. What may have worked as a predictive model before might not fully explain the current market behavior. This Cycle Is Breaking a Few Rules The ongoing crypto bull cycle shows both parallels and key differences when compared to previous cycles. The 2017 bull market was largely upward with intermittent short corrections, including a notable 7-8-month-long correction toward the latter half, similar in duration to the 2024 correction. On the other hand, the 2021 cycle experienced an early extended correction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted roughly a year before transitioning into a major rally with minimal interruptions. That sequence, characterized by deep corrections followed by sharp gains, has become a hallmark of crypto bull runs. The present cycle began with familiar short-lived pullbacks and rallies, but since early 2024, Bitcoin has undergone two distinct phases of rapid gains followed by steep corrections. Between March-November 2024 and January-April 2025, altcoins notably lagged behind Bitcoin, which caused widespread caution and weakened sentiment. While brief surges reignited optimism, continued resistance has capped momentum. Unlike prior cycles, this one appears to be influenced by repeated episodes of abrupt suppression following strong rallies, which CryptoQuant interprets as interventions by large entities in a bid to temper excessive speculation and extend the overall cycle. This behavior suggests a deliberate slowdown to prevent overheating, thereby deviating from past euphoric breakouts. Ultimately, despite these moderating patterns, the cycle is anticipated to conclude with a classic euphoric blow-off phase. Bitcoin’s “Boring” Year, But What’s Ahead? Though current price action lacked fireworks, market observers believe it marks the most important inflection point in crypto history. The asset’s sideways trading conceals a significant shift in investor base, from retail speculators to corporate and institutional holders like Fidelity and BlackRock. Between long-time holders cashing out above $100,000 while Millennials allocate generational wealth into Bitcoin, Swan analysts argue this is a strategic accumulation phase. Mounting macroeconomic uncertainty further tightens supply, which positions the market for future explosive moves as Bitcoin becomes a permanent balance sheet fixture for major entities.

2025-06-05T14:36:48,"Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $5.2b as all-time high fuels institutional demand","In May, key trends in crypto centered on institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, driven by positive regulatory developments. Strong inflows into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange traded funds coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in May. According to a Binance Research report , released on June 5, crypto markets remained resilient despite volatility triggered by uncertainty around U.S. trade policy. Heightened volatility led to nearly $1 billion in liquidations following the trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. An additional $183 million in liquidations occurred after the U.S. announced a tariff pause on the European Union. Despite the large volume of liquidations, interest in Bitcoin ETFs remained robust. These products attracted $5.2 billion in net inflows, the highest level since November 2024. Notably, these inflows coincided with Bitcoin hitting its all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. Monthly net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs | Source: Binance Research ETF inflows were largely supported by positive regulatory momentum. In the U.S. Senate, the GENIUS Act gained traction, proposing the first stablecoin regulation framework in the country. The report also cited growing regulatory support for stablecoins in Hong Kong.
