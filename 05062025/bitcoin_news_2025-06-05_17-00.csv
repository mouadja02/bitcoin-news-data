2025-06-05T14:56:15,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As JPMorgan Set to Accept Bitcoin as Collateral","When long-standing critics of crypto begin to loosen their grip and shift strategy, it often signals more than a trend. It suggests legitimacy is no longer up for debate. Bitcoin is now being treated as a financial instrument that carries real weight, not just speculative interest. That shift became undeniably clear with JPMorgan’s recent decision to allow Bitcoin to be used as collateral for loans. Once known for its skepticism, the Wall Street institution is now rolling out crypto-backed lending services for its wealthiest clients. As banking giants change their views, the narrative changes within the global finance space. It’s no longer about whether crypto will be accepted. The real question is how fast it integrates into everything else. Jamie Dimon Backs Down as Bitcoin Enters JPMorgan’s Loan Books Jamie Dimon’s public stance on Bitcoin has long walked a fine line between resistance and reluctant acknowledgment. The JPMorgan CEO, once vocal about his distrust in crypto, now finds his bank pioneering a lending structure that accepts Bitcoin ETF holdings as legitimate collateral. And not just in theory—the move is already rolling out for high-net-worth clients globally. The program begins with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, the most heavily funded spot ETF in the market. But insiders suggest this is just the start. Other ETFs and crypto-based products could soon be eligible. Even more significant is the bank’s internal shift. Bitcoin is now part of net worth assessments and liquid asset evaluations, treated in the same category as stocks or real estate. That’s not just a policy change, but essentially a redefinition of the asset as a whole, since it could now become a recognized transfer of value. JUST IN: $3.6 trillion asset manager JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin & crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. pic.twitter.com/znmDyJvyVG — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 4, 2025 While the market hasn’t reacted dramatically to the announcement, the implications stretch far. JPMorgan’s decision gives institutional investors a clear signal that Bitcoin isn’t fringe anymore. It’s collateral-worthy, and that could open the floodgates for other entities too. Crypto-backed lending isn’t new, but when the biggest U.S. bank begins offering it to its elite clientele, the perception shifts across the board. It may start small, but this kind of move makes it easier for crypto to weave into traditional finance in ways that once seemed impossible. Best Crypto to Buy Now SUBBD There is a shift happening in crypto. Meme-fueled hype cycles are no longer enough to keep investor interest intact. What the market now seems to favor are projects that come built with function, long-term use cases, and real user demand. SUBBD is one of those rare tokens designed with an actual ecosystem in mind. Instead of promising vague future utilities, SUBBD builds on a model that redefines how creators, influencers, and their audiences interact. It opens the door to monetization without intermediaries. Content creators get to issue exclusive digital passes, while fans can back their favorite personalities through a decentralized rewards structure. The SUBBD token functions not as a placeholder, but as a transaction layer within the creator economy. Every purchase, every vote of support, every unlockable reward runs through it. This transforms the project into a working protocol, not a marketing experiment. Utility-based tokens like SUBBD are becoming the ones investors lean toward when the noise clears. They speak to actual value flow, where the token is involved in processes people want to participate in. And with the rise of social monetization models, SUBBD seems particularly timed to scale. Platforms that allow creators to own the economics of their work are gaining traction globally. SUBBD just happens to offer that with blockchain-based infrastructure. For investors watching projects with long arcs, this one sits at the intersection of culture and decentralization. Not flashy, but functional. And sometimes, that’s what sticks around longest. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper focuses on a problem that has existed for years. Bitcoin, while dominant in value and recognition, has never been known for fast or affordable transactions. This project introduces a Layer 2 structure intended to change that without modifying the Bitcoin protocol itself. Instead, it builds around it, using Ethereum-based tools to create an auxiliary system that aims to handle transfers, staking, and DeFi functions at a pace and cost that the original network cannot achieve alone. The project draws from several established scaling technologies. These include components that facilitate off-chain computation, batch transaction processing, and side networks that interact with the main chain only when needed. In doing so, Bitcoin Hyper attempts to preserve the integrity of Bitcoin while expanding its use case in real time. These systems are not theoretical. They already exist in various parts of the Ethereum ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper brings them together under one framework and adjusts them for compatibility. The token plays multiple roles. It fuels transactions, governs protocol-level decisions, and supports staking within the ecosystem. The presale includes a feature where buyers can begin staking at the point of purchase, which reduces the friction that often comes with onboarding. The $HYPER Pre-Sale is now LIVE!Get up to speed 👇 https://t.co/yzXqAckjDw pic.twitter.com/sij7UFBOcb — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) May 8, 2025 It is also riding a subtle macro theme. As Bitcoin finds greater institutional use—from treasury holdings to collateral agreements like the JPMorgan rollout—the appetite for projects tied to Bitcoin’s image could increase. Bitcoin Hyper benefits from being on-brand while offering something more aggressive in structure. That might not appeal to conservative investors, but it speaks directly to those who want velocity, not just security. Early interest has been consistent, and the presence of an audit by a recognized third party suggests a level of operational planning. The project does not try to redefine Bitcoin. It offers a structure around it that supports what users want today without compromising what Bitcoin was built to protect. Solaxy Solaxy is the kind of project that emerges when two different networks need a bridge without giving up their identities. Essentially, Solaxy aims to make transactions between Ethereum and Solana feel less like a workaround and more like a native experience. But it does not stop at just being another cross-chain protocol. It introduces a reward-heavy structure that incentivizes users to not just move assets, but to hold and participate. Built as a Layer 2 network with high-speed confirmation, Solaxy allows users to stake their tokens while enjoying considerably lower gas fees. It appeals to those who understand that future scaling does not lie with singular chains but in systems that allow fluidity across platforms. With both Ethereum’s security and Solana’s speed being critical to various sectors, Solaxy acts like a glue that holds together the best parts of each. Featured in several popular YouTuber channels like Cilinix Crypto and more, SOLX is described as more than a network access token. It has staking built in with good APY returns, rewarding users not just for trust, but for engagement. And as more projects begin launching in environments that demand cheaper transaction costs and faster execution, the infrastructure layer that Solaxy offers becomes more relevant. In a year where institutional support for crypto infrastructure is becoming more public, Solaxy’s model feels ahead of its time. If the integration of assets into mainstream finance is truly happening, as with JPMorgan’s Bitcoin move, then the demand for smart bridges like Solaxy is set to rise fast. Best Wallet Token At some point, crypto wallets stopped being just tools and started becoming ecosystems of their own. Best Wallet took that idea and refined it into something that feels usable, familiar, and technically superior. What began as a multi-chain wallet quickly turned into a central platform for managing portfolios, accessing DeFi protocols, and even participating in presales. That broader vision is precisely why the Best Wallet Token is drawing serious attention from both seasoned holders and newcomers looking for access without complexity. Its main product, Best Wallet, is now among the few crypto apps to be featured by legacy media - including a recent mention in the New York Post as one of the most polished and secure wallets currently available. That kind of recognition does not come easily, especially in a space where most wallet apps either overpromise or underdeliver. But Best Wallet seems to have struck a rare balance between security, design, and extensibility. The token itself is more than a governance label. It gives holders access to exclusive perks such as staking rewards, early access to curated presales, and native trading fee discounts. More importantly, it is fully integrated into the ecosystem. That makes it less speculative and more utility-bound. In a market gradually shifting toward all-in-one solutions, the presence of a platform like Best Wallet is more than convenient. It is a signal of where crypto UX is heading. If decentralization is going mainstream, it will need familiar tools. Best Wallet just might be one of them. Conclusion When institutions once skeptical of crypto begin adding crypto to their main services, the bar for quality rises across the board. It is no longer about novelty or narrative. Projects that offer function, infrastructure, or access are beginning to align with where the market is clearly heading. The examples above reflect that shift, not because they chase trends, but because they anticipate what a mature digital economy will require. That makes them worth more than a glance.

2025-06-05T14:43:49,"Bitcoin’s Current Bull Cycle Is Unlike Anything We’ve Seen Before","As Bitcoin continues to navigate a turbulent upward trajectory after the recent drawdown from its ATH in May, analysts are revisiting historical bull markets for context. However, this time around, some trends appear to be evolving. What may have worked as a predictive model before might not fully explain the current market behavior. This Cycle Is Breaking a Few Rules The ongoing crypto bull cycle shows both parallels and key differences when compared to previous cycles. The 2017 bull market was largely upward with intermittent short corrections, including a notable 7-8-month-long correction toward the latter half, similar in duration to the 2024 correction. On the other hand, the 2021 cycle experienced an early extended correction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted roughly a year before transitioning into a major rally with minimal interruptions. That sequence, characterized by deep corrections followed by sharp gains, has become a hallmark of crypto bull runs. The present cycle began with familiar short-lived pullbacks and rallies, but since early 2024, Bitcoin has undergone two distinct phases of rapid gains followed by steep corrections. Between March-November 2024 and January-April 2025, altcoins notably lagged behind Bitcoin, which caused widespread caution and weakened sentiment. While brief surges reignited optimism, continued resistance has capped momentum. Unlike prior cycles, this one appears to be influenced by repeated episodes of abrupt suppression following strong rallies, which CryptoQuant interprets as interventions by large entities in a bid to temper excessive speculation and extend the overall cycle. This behavior suggests a deliberate slowdown to prevent overheating, thereby deviating from past euphoric breakouts. Ultimately, despite these moderating patterns, the cycle is anticipated to conclude with a classic euphoric blow-off phase. Bitcoin’s “Boring” Year, But What’s Ahead? Though current price action lacked fireworks, market observers believe it marks the most important inflection point in crypto history. The asset’s sideways trading conceals a significant shift in investor base, from retail speculators to corporate and institutional holders like Fidelity and BlackRock. Between long-time holders cashing out above $100,000 while Millennials allocate generational wealth into Bitcoin, Swan analysts argue this is a strategic accumulation phase. Mounting macroeconomic uncertainty further tightens supply, which positions the market for future explosive moves as Bitcoin becomes a permanent balance sheet fixture for major entities.

2025-06-05T14:36:48,"Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $5.2b as all-time high fuels institutional demand","In May, key trends in crypto centered on institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, driven by positive regulatory developments. Strong inflows into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange traded funds coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in May. According to a Binance Research report , released on June 5, crypto markets remained resilient despite volatility triggered by uncertainty around U.S. trade policy. Heightened volatility led to nearly $1 billion in liquidations following the trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. An additional $183 million in liquidations occurred after the U.S. announced a tariff pause on the European Union. Despite the large volume of liquidations, interest in Bitcoin ETFs remained robust. These products attracted $5.2 billion in net inflows, the highest level since November 2024. Notably, these inflows coincided with Bitcoin hitting its all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. Monthly net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs | Source: Binance Research ETF inflows were largely supported by positive regulatory momentum. In the U.S. Senate, the GENIUS Act gained traction, proposing the first stablecoin regulation framework in the country. The report also cited growing regulatory support for stablecoins in Hong Kong.

On June 3, NYSE Arca submitted a rule change to the SEC to list this new spot ETF, backed by Trump-linked Yorkville America Digital. Unlike typical ETFs, this fund’s branding taps into partisan identity, potentially unlocking interest from Trump’s political base and retail traders alike. The ETF intends to track Bitcoin performance while extending exposure without requiring traders and investors to directly carry BTC. Moreover, it copies existing offerings from BlackRock and Grayscale, which have secured regulatory approval and custody protections. NYSE Arca has submitted a filing to list Truth Social’s proposed Bitcoin ETF, which is designed to simplify Bitcoin exposure for investors. Could this drive broader adoption of Bitcoin ETFs? Source: Reuters, June 2025 pic.twitter.com/pVGl0sFTs0 — American Bitcoin (@AmericanBTC) June 4, 2025 Yet, the market reaction remains cautious. Bitcoin has not broken out on the ETF news, underscoring short-term headwinds such as regulatory overhang and investor fatigue despite long-term bullish catalysts. Truth Social ETF filed on NYSE Arca, SEC review pending Branded ETF may pull in political retail demand Bitcoin remains under $106K despite ETF buzz JPMorgan Unlocks Lending Against Bitcoin ETFs While retail flows are slow, institutional finance is moving. JPMorgan is now allowing ultra high net worth clients to borrow against spot Bitcoin ETF shares like BlackRock’s IBIT. This is a big deal because Bitcoin ETFs are now alongside stocks and real estate as acceptable collateral. This is a significant milestone for crypto’s integration into the traditional financial system. This is especially interesting given CEO Jamie Dimon’s public skepticism towards digital assets. But behind the scenes, Bitcoin’s utility is becoming too big to ignore. By allowing crypto backed loans, the bank is formalizing Bitcoin as an asset class in the secured lending framework. JPMorgan launches lending against Bitcoin ETFs IBIT and other spot ETFs now collateral-eligible Institutional credibility grows despite volatility Could Trump Push Bitcoin Into National Reserves? The question gaining traction among crypto analysts is whether Trump’s ETF push signals broader plans for Bitcoin on a national scale. While there’s no official move toward BTC adoption in national reserves, the combination of political branding and institutional financial integration is noteworthy. A Trump administration endorsement of Bitcoin, even symbolic, could dramatically shift public and government sentiment. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For now, Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading range-bound, but the chart shows a tightening symmetrical triangle. BTC is trading above the 50-period EMA, and the MACD just printed a bullish crossover. A decisive 2-hour candlestick closing just above $106,000 would confirm a breakout, with bullish targets at around $107,811 and $108,933. Quick Technical Summary: Current Price: $105,750 Breakout Trigger: Close above $106,000 Upside Levels: $107,811 → $108,933 Support Levels: $105,285 → $104,098 Whether the Truth Social ETF succeeds or not, it introduces a powerful narrative that blends crypto with politics. As the 2024 election cycle ramps up, Bitcoin could become a battleground, not just in markets, but in national policy, too. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.78M Cap as 61% APY Staking Draws Yield Hunters With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $6,801,303 out of its $7,789,647 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002545 is expected to rise once the cap is met. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

2025-06-05T14:30:10,"Bitcoin Flashing Bearish Signal After Failing To Break Above Major Resistance, Says Crypto Trader – Here Are His Targets","A closely followed crypto strategist believes that Bitcoin ( BTC ) is on the verge of a pullback after facing resistance at a key level. Analyst Justin Bennett tells his 115,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may be forming a bear flag pattern and decline more than 7% of its current value. Bearish flag patterns are used in technical analysis to forecast abrupt moves to the downside. They are formed when price consolidates upwards after a strong downtrend, but fails to break a key support level. “Here’s a different perspective of BTC with the same conclusion: April trend line break plus failure to hold $106,600 plus a potential bear flag below resistance. $97,000-$98,000 is the objective. $106,600-$106,800 is my invalidation. Simple.” Source: Justin Bennett/X However, the analyst says Bitcoin may not dip below six figures if the stock market continues to rally, based on BTC’s historic correlation with stocks. “The big wildcard with any bearish crypto stance is the US stock market. Without a pullback there, you have to wonder if we’ll get a further pullback here. Time will tell.” Lastly, the analyst says Bitcoin is flashing bearish based on the whale versus retail delta indicator (WRD), which gauges whether whales or retail traders are more bullish. A higher value means more whales are longer Bitcoin than retail traders. The declining WRD value is bearish for Bitcoin since whales tend to be a better predictor of the market direction. “Not a great sign for Bitcoin. The Hyblock Capital whale versus retail delta was trending sideways to slightly higher, but is back to trending lower again. Translation: whales are once again increasing their BTC short exposure versus retail.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,069 at time of writing, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $92.6 billion, still relatively low. Only one of the top 10 coins per market capitalization is green today, but it’s unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 1%, currently trading at $104,891. Ethereum (ETH) also fell 1.3%, now changing hands at $2,609. The category’s best performer is Tron (TRX) , but it has increased by only 0.1%, meaning it’s unchanged. Its price is currently $2,609 At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) decreased the most: 3.4% to $0.1896. Moreover, most of the top 100 coins have turned red today. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) fell the most in this category. It’s now down 9.4% to the price of $1.76. On the other side, six coins are green. Toncoin (TON) appreciated the most: 0.9% to $3.24. Botanix Launches Decentralized Bitcoin Blockchain with 16-Node Founding Federation Botanix Labs , the protocol research team developing the Bitcoin-based blockchain Botanix , announced that the chain officially transitioned to a decentralized federation. Mainnet plans to launch later this quarter. Per the press release, the project has onboarded sixteen independent node operators. Besides Botanix itself, these include Galaxy , Fireblocks , Alchemy , XBTO , Antpool , UTXO Management , Kiln , Chorus One , UndefinedXBlockPI , DAIC , Pier Two , Stakin , Vertex , Stake.fish , and Hashkey Cloud . This means that starting now, no single party—not even Botanix—can unilaterally influence or censor the network. All changes, upgrades, and operational execution will be coordinated across 16 independent entities, geographically spread around the world. — Botanix (@BotanixLabs) June 5, 2025 The team says that, with this launch, Botanix “becomes the first and only Bitcoin-based blockchain that is decentralized from the start.” No single entity can unilaterally influence or control the network, they claim. Botanix Labs is fully removed from all operational responsibilities, handing governance and consensus over to this federation of node operators. Additionally, the founding federation is intentionally distributed geographically with different hardware configurations to eliminate a singular point of failure. The network will soon migrate to a dynamic federation to support hundreds of nodes, says the announcement. The eventual goal is to allow anyone in to run their own Botanix node.

Crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, who is sponsoring the fund, filed an S-1 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, just two days after filing a 19b-4 document. Typically, issuers upload the S-1, a document used to register an offering of asset-backed securities, first. The listing exchange then files a 19b-4 — necessary to propose a rule change by a self-regulatory organization (SRO), after. But NYSE Arca, an arm of the New York Stock Exchange, uploaded documents before Truth Social filed its own paperwork. While the reasons are unclear, the 19-b4 filing ties the SEC to a strict deadline of 240 days to approve or reject the filing, while the agency doesn’t have to adhere to a deadline when an S-1 is filed. If approved and listed, Trump’s bitcoin ETF would trade under the name Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with its assets being custodied by Foris DAX Trust Company, which also serves as the custodian for Crypto.com’s assets. The fund would join a long list of already existing spot bitcoin ETFs, including from issuers like BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and more. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the most successful ETF launches in the history of U.S. ETFs, with nearly $70 billion in assets since launch.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/05/trump-s-truth-social-takes-next-step-in-launching-spot-bitcoin-etf,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Policy|Bitcoin ETF|Donald Trump|News",cryptocompare

In the past six months, Bitcoin rose by 8.67%, showing a gradual upward trend despite short-term dips. Indicators show mixed signals for Bitcoin’s future. Some suggest the market is neutral, while others indicate it might be oversold, hinting at a possible rebound. Yet, there are signs of bearish momentum that could continue to influence the price. The average price over the past 10 days is slightly higher than the average over the past 100 days, which could mean a short-term upward trend. Bitcoin faces resistance at $114,097. If it breaks this level, it could reach $121,625, gaining about 10%. If the price falls, it may find support at $99,039 or $91,511, which would be a drop of around 5% to 10%. Traders are watching these levels to see where Bitcoin goes next. Conclusion While established coins like Bitcoin are solid, XYZVerse’s unique mix of sports and memes, community focus, and growth plans position it for standout success in the 2025 bull run.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which snapped its latest five-day winning streak on June 4, opened in the green but after 40 minutes of trading turned slightly negative. While the trading showed a lack of upbeat momentum, enthusiasm on Wall Street reflected the news that Trump and Xi talked over the phone. The call, reported by Xinhua , comes just days after Trump claimed China violated a recently agreed trade agreement. Stock markets rallied in April after U.S.-China trade talks in Switzerland. As stocks edged higher following this latest move, Bitcoin ( BTC ) hovered just above $105k. You might also like: JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for loans While Wall Street is eyeing gains that could see major U.S. indexes clock out another winning week, worries around global economic growth persist. Latest to add to the overall downbeat mood is the ADP report on private-sector hiring growth. On Thursday, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that weekly jobless claims rose for the second consecutive week. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest weekly jump since October 2024. The figure came in above economists’ expectations of 237,000 new claims. In parallel, U.S. worker productivity fell in the first quarter of 2025, driving unit labor costs up 6.6% amid persistent tariff uncertainty. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm productivity declined at an annualized rate of 1.5% during Q1.

This marks the ECB’s seventh consecutive rate cut, down from a peak of 4% in mid-2023. The ECB’s move follows eurozone inflation data showing a decline to 1.9% in May, below the bank’s 2% target. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has recently criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates. Ongoing uncertainty around tariffs and monetary policy continues to shape investor sentiment in risk asset markets.

2025-06-05T14:04:08,"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Weak in June! Will History Repeat Itself? Here's What Analysts Say","Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies have struggled to provide investors with a clear directional signal amid a historically bearish June, further deepening the slump as inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have slowed. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Weak in June: ETF Inflows Slow According to data published by 10x Research, June is generally a mixed or negative month for Bitcoin. Over the past 10 years, BTC's average return this month was recorded as 1.9%, with half of them being positive and half being negative months. Ethereum (ETH) has performed less well: it has only risen in two of the last seven Junes, with an average decline of 11.7%. XRP has performed even worse, while Solana (SOL) has remained relatively more resilient. This weak outlook is also reflected in the waning interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the U.S. According to SoSoValue data, the ETFs saw net inflows on only two of the last five trading days. ETF inflows remained at $87 million on Wednesday, a sharp drop from Tuesday’s $387 million. Inflows into Ethereum ETFs also fell to $57 million, the lowest since May. “The weakening pace of institutional inflows suggests that we are losing momentum and forces us to remain cautious about the near-term outlook,” said Valentin Fournier, chief research analyst at BRN. However, some analysts are more optimistic. “Despite the seasonal summer lull, structurally positive ground remains. BTC and ETH supply growth rates are now lagging behind global money supply growth, increasing the likelihood of positive price action in the long term. New treasury buyers are absorbing supply,” QCP Capital said. The company also pointed out the relative strength of Ethereum, noting that the ETH-BTC ratio is trading near recent highs. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T14:03:00,"Good News for XRP and DOGE? Coinbase Unveils Wrapped Versions on Base Network","The largest American crypto exchange, Coinbase, has launched wrapped versions of XRP and Dogecoin on its Ethereum-based layer-2 network, Base. According to a series of tweets from the Coinbase Assets X account, the crypto exchange holds 1:1 reserves for the underlying assets of cbXRP and cbDOGE in its custody. cbXRP, cbDOGE Go Live on Base The launch of wrapped tokens for XRP and DOGE will enable cross-chain functionality for the assets. Market participants can now use cbXRP and cbDOGE to interact with applications on the Base network. So far, Coinbase has issued 10.4 million cbDOGE worth approximately $1.88 million per Dogecoin’s price at the time of writing. The exchange has also issued at least 2.3 million cbXRP worth more than $5 million. To prevent scammers from misleading users, Coinbase has provided the Base contract addresses for cbXRP and cbDOGE. cbXRP and cbDOGE have joined the growing list of wrapped assets across the Base network. Coinbase has already issued Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC) and Wrapped Ether (cbETH). The company plans to launch similar versions for Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) in the coming weeks. Coinbase’s Wins and Challenges Since last year, the exchange has been expanding its market for wrapped tokens, especially after the successful launch of cbBTC. The product went live on Base and Ethereum in mid-September 2024, becoming the third-largest wrapped bitcoin version within a week. It has maintained that position with a market capitalization of at least $4.7 billion, according to data from CoinGecko, trailing behind Binance’s wrapped BTC (BTCB) and BitGo’s product, WBTC. This latest milestone comes shortly after Coinbase joined the S&P 500 stock market index, marking the first time a crypto company has achieved this distinction. The firm has also recently entered into an agreement to acquire Deribit, the largest crypto derivatives platform, for $2.9 billion. While the crypto exchange records new wins, it is also tackling certain challenges. Coinbase faced a massive data breach that affected at least 69,000 users. The incident not only compromised user data and Coinbase’s support infrastructure but also led to a loss of up to $400 million. As the firm tries to handle the situation, it has come under intense scrutiny for failing to disclose the cyberattack when it was first noticed. The post Good News for XRP and DOGE?

2025-06-05T14:00:00,"Galaxy, Fireblocks to Operate Nodes on Bitcoin Layer-2 Botanix","Botanix Labs has onboarded a couple of crypto industry heavyweights as node operators for its bitcoin layer-2 network. Mike Novogratz's digital asset financial services firm Galaxy and crypto custody specialist Fireblocks are among 16 new node operators on Botanix, the company announced on Thursday. The operators have been onboarded and will be live once the Botanix mainnet launches later this quarter. With the creation of a federation of different entities running nodes, Botanix Labs is establishing its eponymous network as ""decentralized from the start."" ""The network will soon migrate to a dynamic federation to support hundreds of nodes, with the eventual goal of allowing anyone in the world to run their own Botanix node,"" Botanix Labs said in Thursday's announcement. Also joining the federation are blockchain developer Alchemy, bitcoin mining pool Antpool and hedge fund manager UTXO Management. Botanix's testnet, known as Aragog , introduced various tools that will form the basis of its decentralized finance (DeFi) offering: BTC-backed stablecoin Palladium, decentralized exchange Bitzy and lending and borrowing market Spindle. Botanix's protocol Spiderchain was built to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that powers Ethereum. This in theory would make any smart contract or DeFi application on Ethereum compatible with Bitcoin-based Botanix. Developing Bitcoin into a settlement layer for DeFi activity elsewhere in the blockchain world has become a matter of increasing interest among the great and the good of the crypto industry. With BTC's market cap consistently accounting for over 60% of the entire crypto market, developers see the opportunity in harnessing the deep reserves held in BTC to finance applications on networks more technically suited to DeFi, such as Ethereum, Solana or Cardano. At the Dubai Token2049 conference last month Franklin Templeton's managing principal of blockchain venture capital Kevin Farrelly described this as trend as ""infrastructure evolution...not narrative dilution,"" in response to those in the Bitcoin community who believe it dilutes from BTC's core purpose as a store of value. The involvement of the likes of Galaxy and Fireblocks demonstrates that Bitcoin DeFi may become a sector that grows and grows.

2025-06-05T13:59:16,"Bitcoin (BTC) gears up for Next Price Surge: Market Analysis","After two weeks of sideways and downwards price action following the $112,000 all-time high, the Bitcoin bulls may be getting ready for the next upward price surge. Source: TradingView The price action for $BTC has followed within a descending channel for the last two weeks. This is a bullish formation, and so it might be expected that the price breaks out the top of the pattern at some point. There is also resistance at the current price, but $BTC is rising and the cross-over of the indicators on the Stochastic RSI can help the bulls to push the price up and through the top of the channel. Could this result in the price climbing back to the all-time high level? Quite possibly, although bulls will need to be careful to avoid a potential double-top. $102,000 remains the major support should the price fall back from here. Source: TradingView Looking at the $BTC price action on the daily time frame it does rather look like a bull flag has formed. If the price can break out here, the next decent upward surge could indeed take place. Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for Bitcoin shows a very clear higher high and higher low structure. Yes, the Stochastic RSI has the indicators crossing down from the top, but with the 2-week and the monthly Stochastic RSI indicators heading up, price momentum should be on the side of the bulls. If the support band between $102,000 and $104,000 is strong enough to prevent a bigger correction, a bounce could take place from there which takes the price up to the next level, which could be $120,000, $130,000 or maybe higher.

Youtube embed: Next 500X AI Altcoin How Ozak AI Stands Apart While many altcoins boast speculative narratives with little utility, Ozak AI distinguishes itself through functionality and demand-driven design. In an era where AI is rapidly transforming every industry—from finance to healthcare—Ozak AI is positioning itself at the convergence of two explosive sectors: AI and blockchain. What makes it even more attractive to early investors is its low entry point. Currently priced at $0.005 in its third Ozak AI presale phase, Ozak AI has already raised over $1 million, reflecting rising investor confidence. If the token hits its projected $1 target, that would represent a 300x gain—a return that would rival the early days of Ethereum or Solana. Why It Could Be the Next Big Thing Several factors make Ozak AI a serious contender for the next altcoin superstar: Real-World Utility: It solves real problems—helping investors make better, faster decisions using AI-generated insights. Scalability: Its architecture is built to handle massive data volumes and user growth without compromising performance. Decentralization and Security: By integrating DePIN and secure vaults, Ozak ensures data integrity and user control. Customizability: Prediction Agents allow users to shape the AI model around their specific needs and strategies—a major innovation in personalized finance. Of course, becoming the next Bitcoin or Ethereum isn’t easy. Ozak AI will need to continue hitting its roadmap milestones, deliver consistent utility, and build a thriving user base. But with a solid foundation, growing visibility, and market demand for predictive analytics, Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most promising new projects in the space. In a sea of speculative tokens, Ozak AI stands out with purpose and potential. It might not replace Bitcoin or Ethereum in market cap any time soon, but it could very well become the next superstar altcoin—delivering major returns to early believers and reshaping how we interact with financial data. If users are scouting the market for the next big thing, Ozak AI deserves a serious look. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto project that provides a technology platform that specializes in predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets.

2025-06-05T13:43:10,"Retail traders dumped $258m in Nvidia stock: Will they buy Bitcoin instead?","Several reports suggest that retail investors who bought the Nvidia dip are now selling. Traders are asking whether they will use their profits to buy crypto. Retail investors are taking profits from their Nvidia purchases, while institutions continue to buy. According to a report by Vanda Research, retail investors dumped $258 million of Nvidia stock during the week ending on June 4. Many retail investors made significant gains from their Nvidia investments between 2023 and 2024. Now, they appear to be searching for new opportunities, according to a sentiment survey by Vanda Research. Retail sentiment has sharply dropped in 2025, shifting from 10 points leaning to buy to over 15 points leaning toward sell. Retail sentiment in Nvidia, 10-day average | Source: CNBC This analysis is in line with a report by Sherwood, which recorded $4.9 billion in retail outflows during the third week of May. It was the largest dollar outflow for Nvidia since 2015 and marked the longest retail selling streak, two consecutive weeks, since March 2022. The report also notes similar activity in another retail favorite, Tesla. You might also like: AI crypto tokens at risk as Nvidia faces restrictions on China exports Why are retail investors dumping Nvidia? Retail investors who bought the dip after Nvidia shares fell on the DeepSeek launch are now looking for more lucrative opportunities. Analyst Ben Bajarin notes that Nvidia stock has already priced in much of its growth potential. As a result, traders are seeking higher upside elsewhere. Additionally, many are concerned about the impact of U.S. tariffs and chip restrictions on China. In this environment, investors with higher risk tolerance are turning to AI stocks and crypto. According to Vanda Research , retail investors are now eyeing more volatile small-cap AI stocks to chase further gains. Nvidia and Bitcoin (BTC) have historically shared a strong connection. A 2024 study found a consistent correlation above 0.80 between the two assets, largely due to Nvidia’s role in powering crypto mining infrastructure. This suggests that many Nvidia investors are already familiar with, or actively involved in, the crypto market. At the same time, retail investors are taking a back seat when it comes to Bitcoin, letting institutions accumulate. The most established crypto asset has actually underperformed Nvidia in the last five years, returning 992% vs Nvidia’s 1,523.1%. Still, there is no clear indication yet of a broad retail pivot from Nvidia into Bitcoin. While historical correlations and overlapping investor profiles suggest a potential bridge between the two, current sentiment doesn’t make the case for a clear rotation into Bitcoin.

2025-06-05T13:35:12,"Crypto Price Analysis 6-5: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, DOGECOIN: DOGE, HEDERA: HBAR, INTERNET COMPUTER: ICP","The crypto market stumbled into bearish territory as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies lost momentum thanks to macroeconomic factors. BTC slipped below $105,000 as selling pressure and buyer exhaustion weighed on the price. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,600. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is also down almost 1% as it struggles to stay above $2,600. Ripple (XRP) is down over 2%, trading around $2.18, and Solana (SOL) is down over 2%, trading at $152. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 4%, while Cardano (ADA) is down nearly 3%, trading at $0.678. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable declines. US Stocks Register Mixed Wednesday US stocks ended Wednesday’s trading session mixed after weak private payrolls report and a cautious outlook from the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book led to renewed concerns about inflation, growth, and tariffs. As a result, the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a four-day streak, falling 0.22%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 traded flat, and the Nasdaq Composite traded 0.32%. Market sentiment was rocked by a weaker-than-expected ADP employment report, which showed that private payrolls rose only 37,000 in May, significantly lower than estimates. The reading comes just before Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data and could force the Fed to cut interest rates. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book reported a marginal decline in US economic activity over the past six weeks, with hiring mostly flat as business owners put off expansion plans due to policy uncertainty. The Fed stated, “All Districts reported elevated levels of economic and policy uncertainty.” Crypto.com Sues Nevada Gaming Body Crypto.com’s derivatives arm has sued the Nevada gaming and gambling regulator over its restriction of trading and sporting event contracts. The North American Derivatives Exchange Inc., which operates as Crypto.com’s North American derivatives business, sued the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB) in the state’s federal court on June 3, claiming the board improperly blocked the exchange from offering derivatives contracts that reference sporting events on its federally regulated market. The lawsuit also claimed that the regulator asserted jurisdiction with the mistaken premise that contracts traded on the exchange constitute “wagering on sporting events.” “NGCB has no authority to regulate, let alone prohibit, derivatives trading offered by a federally regulated DCM [designated contract market] operating pursuant to federal law.” It also cited federal injunctions involving prediction marketplace KalshiEX, where courts ruled that state gaming authorities in Nevada and New Jersey could not regulate federally approved event contracts. The courts ruled that the Commodity Exchange Act preempts state law and that the CFTC has exclusive authority. “Federal courts have consistently recognized that the CFTC’s regulation of the national derivatives market is exclusive and preempts state involvement.” South Korea’s New President Backs Crypto South Korea’s new President Lee Jae-myung’s incoming administration is expected to speed up crypto integration into South Korea’s regulatory and financial systems. The President is expected to oversee several crypto policy changes in South Korea, including enacting the Digital Asset Basic Act (DABA). Work on the act began under former President Yoon, but he could not see it through due to his dismissal. The Democratic Party has formed a Digital Asset Committee, led by lawmaker Min Byoung-dug, aiming to pass DABA through the National Assembly this year. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin's (BTC) price action remained subdued as the flagship cryptocurrency struggled to recover from a low of $104,253. BTC has been sluggish all week as it struggles to overcome the resistance at around $107,000. The world’s largest cryptocurrency had surged to a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level as investors locked in profits and buyer exhaustion set in. As a result, the price plunged nearly 4% the following day. BTC’s downward trajectory continued as it fell to a low of $103,199 on May 31. BTC has struggled to reclaim $105,000 since. Analysts have stated that while BTC’s pullback is concerning, investors are still optimistic about a recovery. Crypto market sentiment remains strong, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index showing a score of 57 out of 100. Some analysts believe BTC could surge to a new all-time high above $115,000 next month if institutional interest continues and US job data comes in weaker than expected. “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July.” The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report on June 6. Job data is a crucial indicator for Bitcoin as it impacts the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, which in turn, influences sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin . “A stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin.” On the other hand, a softer-than-expected report could encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates sooner. The analysts noted, “If the jobs report indicates a stronger labor market, Bitcoin might test support levels around $102,000 or lower. Overall, the report’s outcome will be pivotal for lower timeframe traders but will only be a smaller piece of a larger puzzle in the larger scheme of things.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), falling nearly 4% to $107,356. The price recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% and 1.16% to cross $109,000 and settle at $109,103. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC rose 0.32% to $109,453. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to slip below $109,000 and settle at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday, dropping over 1% to $107,834. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $105,662. BTC continued to decline on Friday, falling 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and 0.95% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. The price fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell nearly 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,755. The current session sees BTC marginally up as it looks to reclaim $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) continued trading sideways as it consolidated around the $2,600 mark, as the crypto market entered a subdued phase following BTC’s surge to a new all-time high. Investors are waiting for the next catalyst to dictate price action, with trade tensions and policy uncertainty impacting investor sentiment. However, open interest in ETH futures jumped to a record $37.6 billion. High open interest levels indicate bullish momentum but also increase the risk of a strong pullback as markets get too one-sided. ETH has faced repeated rejections around the 200-day SMA and $2,700. A break above these levels could push ETH beyond $3,000, as no strong resistance exists until that price level. ETH’s latest rejection from $2,700 was on Friday (May 23), when it fell to $2,527. The price recovered over the weekend, registering a marginal increase on Saturday and increasing nearly 1% on Sunday to settle at $2,551. ETH continued pushing higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase to $2,564. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ETH rose nearly 4% to reclaim $2,600 and settle at $2,662. Buyers retained control on Wednesday, with the price rising almost 1% to $2,683. ETH raced to an intraday high of $2,790 on Thursday. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and fell 1.89% to $2,632. Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as the price dropped almost 4%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and $2,600 to $2,532. Source: TradingView Price action was mixed over the weekend as ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday before rising 0.44% on Sunday to settle at $2,539. ETH fell to a low of $2,476 on Monday as selling pressure intensified.

Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continues to trade downwards as it struggles to stay above $150. The altcoin faced a sudden decline on Tuesday, dropping from a high of $165 to $164. Sellers retained control in the subsequent session, with SOL down almost 1%. SOL started the previous weekend positively, rising 1.09% on Saturday and settling at $175.

2025-06-05T13:34:22,"Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Nears $85B, More Than Doubling in a Year","Bitcoin BTC has taken deeper root in corporate treasuries, with 116 public companies now holding a combined 809,100 BTC, worth around $85 billion based on current prices, at the end of May. That’s a dramatic rise from 312,200 BTC held a year ago in corporate treasuries, according to Binance Research’s latest report . Nearly 100,000 BTC has been added since early April alone. The surge appears driven by a mix of rising prices and structural tailwinds. Donald Trump adopted a pro-crypto stance during his 2024 presidential campaign, vowing to make the U.S. a global hub for the asset class and create a “crypto capital of the planet.” Since Trump took office he has moved to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile , while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped numerous lawsuits against major crypto firms.. Binance’s report shows that bitcoin treasury accumulation grew in November, when Trump won the election . Adding to that, new fair-value accounting rules introduced by the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB) this year allow companies to recognize gains on BTC holdings, removing a longstanding deterrent. Newer entrants including GameStop (GME) and PSG have recently started accumulating BTC as a well, yet Strategy still holds the lion’s share of BTC in corporate treasuries, with over 70% of holdings. Some companies are also tiptoeing into other assets. SharpLink holds $425 million in ETH, while DeFi Development and Classover are betting on solana SOL. China-based firm Webus recently filed for a $300 million XRP strategic reserve. Still, these altcoin holdings remain relatively small and are often tied to firms trying to rebrand as token-forward entities, Binance noted. Binance’s report also flagged the rapid rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), which have climbed more than 260% from $8.6 billion to $23 billion this year.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/06/05/corporate-bitcoin-holdings-nears-85b-more-than-doubling-in-a-year,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB","Markets|Bitcoin|Treasury|News",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T13:30:48,"Solana Sees Another Large Spike In Coin Days Destroyed, Could A Price Shift Be Next?","The growing bearish market performance appears to have heavily impacted Solana’ s price action, causing the altcoin to resist key support levels after a period of bullish movements. Given the prevailing waning price performance, indications of profit-taking are starting to emerge as SOL witnesses a major surge in Coin Days Destroyed. Coins Days Destroyed Explodes On Solana Solana’s current bearish trend has triggered a notable shift in its on-chain dynamics. Following this weakening period is the recent massive spike in Coin Days Destroyed as reported by Glassnode, a leading financial and on-chain data platform, in a post on X. The Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) is a key metric that measures the movement of coins by weighting transactions based on how long these assets have been held. Thus, such a huge uptick in the metric signals a significant movement of long-held coins. Furthermore, the development points to a possible profit-taking from long-dormant wallets or a strategic realignment by seasoned investors. Should this trend persist, it is likely to have implications for Solana’s price trajectory. According to the on-chain platform, the coin days destroyed for Solana year-to-date (YTD) reached approximately 3.55 billion SOL on Tuesday, marking its third-largest spike since the beginning of this year. In prior spikes, the coin days destroyed increased sharply to 5.53 billion SOL on February 26, which currently stands as the biggest so far this year. Meanwhile, the second-largest surge in coin days destroyed was recorded on March 3, reaching about 4.64 billion SOL. Glassnode noted that these consistently large spikes are hinting at a shift in holders’ conviction as the SOL price struggles to regain upward momentum. With previous massive spikes preceding heightened volatility, SOL’s waning price may be extended in the upcoming weeks. A continuation of the ongoing volatile period is likely to trigger distribution among these wallets, driven by reduced volume and technical flashes of mean oversold setups. SOL’s Network Fundamentals Showing Strength Despite the substantial upticks in the coin days destroyed, the Solana network activity remains strong. The Solana Post, an informative platform on X, disclosed that the network is flexing its strength, consistently surpassing all other chains in the number of active addresses and transactions processed in a single day. Data from the platform shows that the daily active wallet addresses on the network have increased to 7 million, while the daily transaction count exceeds 100 million. This notable performance could be attributed to the network’s low transaction costs and fast throughput, which keep attracting users and developers. SOL’s heightened user engagement, surpassing that of all other major chains, highlights i ts growing dominance in blockchain activity, cementing its position as a leading network.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-coin-days-destroyed-spike/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","Solana|CDD|Coin Days Destroyed|Glassnode|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana network|Solana news|Solana price|solusd|SOLUSDT|The Solana Post|Year-To-Date|YTD",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T13:30:39,"Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup – Historic Run Incoming?","Ethereum is trading at critical levels after breaking past the $2,500 mark earlier this quarter, now attempting to reclaim momentum and push into higher resistance. Despite global macroeconomic pressures—including rising US Treasury yields and persistent trade tensions between the US and China—ETH continues to show resilience. Market analysts believe that Ethereum could be leading the charge into a long-anticipated altseason, provided it holds key levels and breaks above current supply. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target – Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? Top analyst Ted Pillows recently pointed to a compelling technical pattern: Ethereum has now posted four consecutive two-week green candles, a formation that mirrors Bitcoin’s price structure in early 2020 following the March crash. That period marked the beginning of Bitcoin’s legendary bull run to $69,000. According to Pillows, the similarities between BTC in 2020 and ETH in 2025 are “just mind blowing,” sparking renewed interest from traders who see Ethereum’s current consolidation as a bullish continuation. With investor sentiment slowly recovering and technicals turning favorable, the market is watching ETH closely. If history is any guide, this consolidation could mark the calm before Ethereum’s next major leg higher. However, macro risks still linger, and timing will be critical. Ethereum Resilience Sparks Hopes Of 2020-Like Rally Ethereum is holding strong above the $2,600 level, showing resilience amid global macro uncertainty and volatile market conditions. This consolidation around key support has many investors and analysts anticipating a breakout that could lead Ethereum into a new rally phase, potentially triggering a broader altseason. Despite growing concerns around systemic risk in the bond market and geopolitical tensions between the US and China, Ethereum continues to attract buyers, signaling confidence in its long-term strength. Analysts are watching this range closely. Many believe that if Ethereum can maintain support and break above near-term resistance, it could gain serious momentum. One of the more compelling arguments for a bullish outlook comes from Ted Pillows, who highlights a striking similarity between Ethereum’s current structure and Bitcoin’s behavior in 2020. According to Pillows, Ethereum has now printed four consecutive two-week green candles since bottoming, just as Bitcoin did after the March 2020 crash. That pattern marked the start of BTC’s legendary run to $69,000. The comparison has sparked optimism that ETH may be preparing for a similar breakout, especially if it clears resistance near $2,700–$2,800. While the macro environment remains tense, this technical structure—paired with rising confidence in ETH’s strength—keeps bulls hopeful that a major move is on the horizon. Related Reading: Ethereum Consolidates Against BTC – Altseason Hopes Hinge On ETH/BTC Breakout ETH Price Analysis: Consolidation Above Support Ethereum (ETH) is holding steady around $2,607, consolidating just above the 34-period EMA on the 4-hour chart, which currently sits near $2,594. After the strong surge in early May that saw ETH rally from under $2,000 to highs near $2,850, the price has moved into a tight consolidation range. This sideways action reflects market indecision as buyers and sellers battle for control. Despite the recent volatility, ETH has continued to post higher lows, indicating ongoing bullish pressure. The 50, 100, and 200-period SMAs are aligned below the current price, all trending upward, signaling that the broader trend remains intact. The price is finding consistent support from the 50-period SMA around the $2,590–$2,600 zone, which is a key level to watch. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst A decisive break above the short-term resistance near $2,680 would be needed to confirm continuation toward $2,800 and potentially retest previous highs.

(DJT) has filed an S-1 registration with the SEC for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF (B.T.). This ETF, if approved, would let regular investors buy into Bitcoin in a simpler way, even though the market is already crowded with many other Bitcoin investment funds. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF could become the next big thing for retail investors eager to get a piece of Bitcoin. Truth Social File For Bitcoin ETF Application Trump Media isn’t just about social media anymore. After building the Truth Social platform and exploring other tech projects like Truth+ streaming and Truth.Fi fintech, it’s now setting its sights on Bitcoin. The ETF will be sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, which calls itself an “America-First” asset manager. Crypto.com will play a key role too, acting as the Bitcoin custodian, main executor, and liquidity provider. But before any of this happens, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has to give the green light. If the SEC approves the plan, the ETF will be listed on NYSE Arca. That’s when investors will have a new, easy way to bet on Bitcoin’s ups and downs—using Trump’s trusted brand name. A Small Company Entering a Big Field This new ETF shows Trump Media’s big push into the crypto world, using the Truth Social brand name to grab attention. The New York Stock Exchange Group has already filed regulatory paperwork for this ETF, signaling that things are moving forward quickly. Support and Criticism Over BTC ETF President Trump has spoken many times in support of Bitcoin, calling it a sign of financial freedom. Many of his supporters might see this ETF as a trusted way to get involved in Bitcoin investing. However, some critics worry that this could personally benefit Trump because of his name’s connection to the fund. The White House has said Trump himself is no longer directly tied to the businesses that use his name. Still, there are concerns about the ethics of such a close link. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : $566M Bitcoin Escape?

2025-06-05T13:21:23,"Bitcoin News Today: Whales Buy 600K BTC – June Rally Ahead?","The post Bitcoin News Today: Whales Buy 600K BTC – June Rally Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price has fluctuated by only 0.66% intraday and has hardly moved beyond the 20-day EMA band. While the current intraday price action may seem dull, the real excitement lies in the activities of crypto whales operating in the shadows. In the past 24 hours, the whale alert’s official X account has posted 10 different BTC transfers by 12:16 PM UTC on June 5th. Among them, 8 posts indicate that nearly 12,907 BTC, amounting to $1.3 billion, was transferred to wallets from exchanges. Moreover, the data from Santiment highlighted that over the past week, the whales have added 79,244 BTC, which amounts to over $8.3 billion. The whale activity in early June is hinting that a market resurgence in June seems more likely than ever. The whales are getting active was confirmed by Cryptoquant’s analysis, too, which says a fresh cohort of Bitcoin whales, with an average coin age under six months, has been stacking at a record pace. Keep reading to know more, as whale activity is set to send the Bitcoin price higher in June. Will June Bitcoin Price Rally Be Triggered By New Money In The Market? A recent CryptoQuant analysis highlighted that supply held by new whales has advanced, and these are the fresh cohort that’s buying it. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Reasons Why Ethereum Price Rally is on the Cards , The data highlights that the new whale’s supply share has jumped from 2.5% to 5.6%, which means holding has doubled from 500K BTC to 1.1 million BTC that the new cohort holds. This increase of 600K BTC is worth $63 billion. The increase clearly shows that positions have been built recently, assuming around Q2 of 2025, and this is the new money. This increase in supply share indicates that newly minted BTC crypto’s are getting absorbed rapidly, which is tightening the float. Therefore, clearing the all-time high is more in demand than ever, once pierced, then $134K is the number for June 2025. But if it falls, then $95K is the level, BTC price could take as support. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T13:11:17,"Bitcoin consolidates above key support: is a breakout imminent?","Bitcoin has spent the majority of the week trading within a tight consolidation range. But unlike previous consolidations, this one carries a bullish undertone. With price action holding above major support levels and forming potential structural shifts, traders are on alert for a breakout move. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent price action has been marked by low volatility and declining volume, but this may not be a sign of weakness. Instead, the technical structure and support dynamics suggest that the market is coiling before its next move. Price remains above critical support zones, and volume behavior is characteristic of accumulation, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Key technical points Point of Control Support: Bitcoin is holding above the POC, which aligns with both the bullish channel low and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement. Rounded Bottom Formation: Price structure on the 4-hour chart is morphing into a rounded bottom pattern, often a precursor to upward momentum. Volume Decline Indicates Accumulation: Volume has been declining as price compresses above support — a common signal of accumulation before expansion. BTCUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView Bitcoin has been consolidating within a narrow range, but the location of this range is what makes it significant. Instead of compressing beneath resistance or within a neutral zone, price is resting on a technically strong support cluster. The Point Of Control, the price level with the highest traded volume, coincides with the channel low support and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, creating a robust zone that has held through multiple retests. You might also like: Lightchain AI grabs watchlist spots while Litecoin waits for a market shift that never comes On the 4-hour timeframe, candles have been consistently closing above this level, signaling that buyers are defending the zone. The price structure is gradually forming what appears to be a rounded bottom, suggesting a possible reversal pattern and strength building at support. Volume has been tapering off during this period, a common feature in accumulation phases. Typically, such low-volume compressions resolve in sharp, directional breakouts once volume re-enters the market. In Bitcoin’s case, a reclaim of the value area high will be the first signal of strength. This level has acted as a ceiling in recent weeks and marks the upper boundary of the current volume profile. What to expect in the coming price action If Bitcoin continues to hold above the POC and confirms a breakout with volume, a push toward a new all-time high is likely. Until then, traders should monitor volume closely, a spike could signal the end of this accumulation phase and the beginning of a major move.

2025-06-05T13:10:29,"Bitcoin Exchange Holdings Drop to Seven-Year Low as HODLing Grows","Bitcoin’s presence on cryptocurrency exchanges has dropped to its lowest level in nearly seven years, falling below 11% of total supply for the first time since March 2018. This trend, revealed in new Glassnode data, points to a rising preference for long-term holding and institutional custody. HODLers Show Long-Term Conviction The decline from a 17.2% peak in March 2020 suggests a shift in investor behavior. Over 1.26 million BTC, or about 6% of the total supply, has moved away from exchanges during that time. According to CryptoQuant, the Exchange Flows to Network Activity Ratio has reached its lowest level since early 2023. This indicates that even as Bitcoin prices climb, fewer coins are being deposited on trading platforms. The current 30-day moving average of the ratio sits at around 1.2—well below its 365-day average and nearing -1 standard deviation. Such levels often signal strong holding sentiment and a reduced willingness to sell. Rise of Institutional Custodians Much of Bitcoin’s migration away from exchanges is being driven by institutional players favoring third-party custody over public platforms. Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Franklin Templeton are now using platforms like Coinbase Prime, which reported $212 billion in assets under custody in Q1 2025. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s exchange recorded over $500 million in BTC outflows during the same period, with another $761 million in withdrawals on June 5. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are also absorbing large amounts of BTC. As of June 5, ETF holdings had ballooned to $44.54 billion, up from just $1 billion at their launch in January 2024. Trust in Exchanges Falters Post-FTX The collapse of FTX in late 2022 appears to have triggered a long-lasting erosion of trust in centralized exchanges. Glassnode data shows consistent outflows from November 2022 to May 2023, including several weeks with more than 10,000 BTC withdrawn. In total, more than 200,000 BTC left exchanges during that six-month stretch. This indicates a lasting shift toward self-custody and alternative trading platforms. A 2025 joint survey by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon found that 83% of institutional investors plan to increase their crypto exposure, with nearly 60% allocating over 5% of assets under management to digital assets. Standard Chartered estimates that 61 public companies already control more than 3% of the total 21 million BTC supply. With growing confidence in self-custody and institutional infrastructure, exchange balances may continue to decline—even as Bitcoin aims for new highs.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-exchange-holdings-drop-to-seven-year-low-as-hodling-grows/,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING","Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence",cryptocompare
