2025-06-05T15:57:07,"Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping – Is the Trade War Coming to an End? Here Are the Details of the Call","US President Donald Trump announced that he had a phone conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping that lasted approximately 1.5 hours. The main agenda item of the meeting was the new trade agreement recently agreed between the two countries. Trump said the meeting had produced positive results for both sides and that complexities, especially on the rare earths issue, had been resolved. Trump said on social media, “I had a very productive phone call with President Xi of China. During this call that lasted about an hour and a half, we discussed some of the sensitive points of the trade agreement we recently agreed on. The meeting was very positive for both countries. There should no longer be any question marks about the complexity of rare earth products.” It was also stated that representatives of the two countries will hold face-to-face meetings at a location to be determined shortly. It was announced that the US side will be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Trump also said that President Xi invited him and his wife Melania Trump to China and that in response to this kind invitation, Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were invited to the U.S. Trump noted that the meeting focused almost entirely on trade issues, and that other geopolitical issues such as Russia-Ukraine or Iran were not brought up.

Trump, however, expressed disappointment that China had not fully complied with the agreement. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC: “The United States has done its part, but China has been slow to remove the non-tariff barriers that are in the agreement. This is completely unacceptable and must be addressed.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Donald Trump Talks to Chinese President Xi Jinping – Is the Trade War Coming to an End?

2025-06-05T15:54:00,"Introducing The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF","Summary The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF is an actively managed strategy that synthetically provides exposure to bitcoin ETPs, seeking to gain indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin. Every week, BCCC seeks to write call options against a portion of its notional holdings in an effort to harvest option premiums and perform distributions. By writing call options against only a portion of its bitcoin ETP exposure, BCCC maintains the potential ability to benefit from a portion of the gains that may be realized. On June 4 th , 2025, we listed the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF ( BCCC ) on the Cboe BZX Exchange. BCCC is the latest addition to Global X’s covered call and growth ETF suite, and it is designed to offer investors the opportunity to indirectly participate in the price performance of bitcoin ETPs (exchange-traded products), while seeking to harvest option premiums and manage volatility by selling call options on the same underlying security. Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) intrigue as an investment opportunity stems from a variety of factors, but whether investors choose to lean into its status as a decentralized currency, or simply view it as a speculative potential growth opportunity, the trajectory it has assumed over the last few years has been difficult to ignore. These days, new innovations in exchanges and products have made investing in bitcoin easier than ever. However, should investors wish to take positions, it’s likely they would still need to deal with the levels of volatility it has historically demonstrated. With wide price swings representing a potential deterrent, gaining indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin ETPs that provide exposure to bitcoin, while employing a call option writing strategy to exchange a portion of upside price appreciation potential for a stream of premiums, may represent an interesting value proposition. BCCC Offers Indirect Exposure to Bitcoin Within the Wrapper of an ETF Investors have sought various means by which to gain exposure to bitcoin over the years. From mining bitcoin itself, to trading it on crypto exchanges and engaging with bitcoin trusts, access has become increasingly seamless and potentially more efficient. Benefits of the progression have included wider accessibility and liquidity. Most recently, the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and ETFs that trade bitcoin futures have ushered in a new means by which to achieve this exposure. The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF seeks to achieve indirect exposure to the price returns of bitcoin by buying and selling options on bitcoin ETPs. Specifically, it utilizes long call options and short put options to obtain synthetic exposure to the price returns of these products. For illustrative purposes only. Illustration assumes the options positions are made at-the-money and does not include the effect of the premiums paid or received for establishing the option positions. BCCC’s options positions may not always be made at-the-money, which could affect the correlation of the returns. Gaining exposure to bitcoin ETPs in this fashion is potentially less expensive than buying the ETP outright, as options often cost less to purchase than the underlying vehicles they reference. It may also result in fund returns that deviate modestly from that of the underlying ETPs amid a weekly roll period. That said, upon the outcome period’s conclusion, returns are expected to converge to an approximate 1:1 rate. The Fund Seeks to Provide Weekly Distributions, Utilizing a Systematically Active Approach Although the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF is an active investment strategy, a series of functions within the fund are aimed at remaining relatively consistent. For instance, portfolio managers will seek to write weekly call options that are at-the-money or slightly out-of-the-money, from which approximately 75% of the call premiums received are expected to be ultimately distributed to shareholders. Additionally, only a portion of the funds’ notional holdings are expected to be covered, on a roll-to-roll basis, which is designed to allow for upside price appreciation potential to be consistently pursued. One of the important levers that BCCC engages to promote potentially higher premium values is weekly option writing. By writing options week after week, in succession, the fund may be able to generate larger premiums than it would by writing options with longer tenors (time until expiration). Options naturally lose value as they approach their expiration date, and this decay happens more rapidly during the final days before expiration. By repeatedly selling short-term weekly options, rather than longer-term options, the fund can potentially capture this accelerated value decrease more efficiently, allowing it to collect more premiums over time when compared to a strategy using longer-dated options. In conjunction with the writing of weekly options, the Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF also aims to provide investors with a stream of weekly distributions. Each week, when call options are written, approximately 75% of the premium that is received from writing the call option is expected to be distributed to shareholders, while the balance of the premium is reinvested back into the fund. A distribution will offer investors the opportunity to pursue reinvestment or utilize the proceeds elsewhere. Meanwhile, any automatically re-invested premiums ought to provide a measure of support to the fund’s net asset value (NAV). BCCC May Be Considered a Hedged Bitcoin Strategy The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF writes call options on bitcoin ETPs that are either at-the-money or slightly out-of-the-money. For the portion of the portfolio on which call options are written, its upside is theoretically capped at the strike level of the written call options. An important consideration, however, is that by leaving a portion of the fund’s notional holdings uncovered, investors may still be able to participate in some of the upside of these bitcoin-tracking products. On the other side of the coin, BCCC will remain fully exposed to the downside price movements of the underlying ETPs. This downside is expected to be partially offset by the premiums that are pursued from writing the options. Operating in this fashion, the fund might make a bitcoin investment more palatable for those that still believe it can produce outsized returns but are apprehensive owing to its historically elevated levels of volatility. Conveniently, the same measure of volatility that might promote disinterest in a bitcoin investment is something that may well allow BCCC to procure better option premiums and provide more generous distributions. Bitcoin has shown the propensity to operate under these wider levels of volatility, as illustrated by the standard deviation of its daily returns over time relative to some major domestic equity indices. Conclusion: BCCC May Strike a Balance Between Growth and Distributions Based on the intermittent periods of remarkable price appreciation that bitcoin has been able to realize over the years, it’s no mystery why it has garnered interest from a broad segment of the investment community. Nonetheless, the peaks and valleys that have been associated with these advances may make an unhedged position in bitcoin feel like a roller coaster ride. By writing call options on a portion of bitcoin holdings, investors have the opportunity to maintain a degree of upside price appreciation potential associated with bitcoin, while managing its volatility through the pursuit of option premiums and distributions. The Global X Bitcoin Covered Call ETF provides that potential exposure and may help accomplish that goal.

However, the subsequent decline made investors nervous, and an analyst made a prediction of $150,000. Accordingly, Foresight Ventures CEO Alice Li predicted that BTC could reach $150,000. The famous CEO said that increased regulatory clarity in the US could push Bitcoin above $150,000 this market cycle. At this point, the famous CEO said that positive US policy changes, including US President Donald Trump’s executive order approving the Bitcoin reserve and stablecoin developments, will be the main drivers of the rally in the rest of 2025. “The 2025 rally in the cryptocurrency market is mainly driven by the change in US policy. One of the strongest drivers of the rally is certainly policy change, with US President Donald Trump’s reserve approval and stablecoin developments as the main catalysts for Bitcoin. These developments could push Bitcoin above $150,000 in this market cycle.” The famous CEO added that the first interest rate cut of the year by the FED could significantly increase Bitcoin's price momentum. Li stated that the GENIUS law is a good start for stablecoin regulations and that the rest of the world will follow the US. “This law has set a great innovation example for the rest of the world. I believe that all other countries, especially Asian countries, Singapore and Hong Kong, will follow suit in a short time,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T15:50:54,"Strategic Move: Smarter Web Company Expands Corporate Bitcoin Holdings","BitcoinWorld Strategic Move: Smarter Web Company Expands Corporate Bitcoin Holdings In a significant move signaling continued confidence in digital assets, UK-listed firm Smarter Web Company has once again increased its Bitcoin reserves. This latest announcement underscores a broader trend of companies exploring and executing strategies to incorporate cryptocurrencies into their treasury management. Smarter Web Company Bitcoin: Expanding Digital Reserves Smarter Web Company recently took to the social media platform X to announce a notable addition to its balance sheet. The company confirmed the purchase of an additional 39.52 BTC. This acquisition wasn’t a one-off decision but fits within a previously stated long-term vision. With this latest purchase, Smarter Web Company’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached an impressive 122.76 BTC. This accumulation demonstrates a clear commitment to Bitcoin as a component of their corporate assets. For a UK-listed entity, such a public and consistent approach to acquiring Bitcoin is noteworthy and provides a real-world example of evolving corporate finance strategies. The Growing Trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Smarter Web Company is not operating in a vacuum. Over the past few years, there has been an observable increase in the number of companies, both public and private, adding Bitcoin to their treasury. This trend, often referred to as adopting Corporate Bitcoin Holdings, is driven by various factors. Many companies see Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, especially in a macroeconomic environment characterized by quantitative easing and rising debt levels. Others view it as a store of value akin to digital gold. Furthermore, some corporations believe in the long-term appreciation potential of Bitcoin as the digital asset class matures and gains wider adoption globally. Examples of companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin include: MicroStrategy: A pioneer in the corporate Bitcoin treasury space, holding the largest amount. Tesla: Added Bitcoin to its balance sheet, though its holdings have fluctuated. Block (formerly Square): Another tech company that has allocated capital to Bitcoin. While Smarter Web Company’s holdings are smaller compared to these giants, their systematic approach highlights that this isn’t just a strategy for large tech firms but is being considered and implemented by companies across different sectors and sizes. What Drives Smarter Web Company’s Bitcoin Investment Plan? The recent purchase aligns perfectly with Smarter Web Company’s publicly stated Bitcoin Investment Plan. The company had previously revealed an ambitious long-term strategy to acquire Bitcoin over a 10-year period. This isn’t about timing the market but rather a systematic accumulation approach. A 10-year acquisition plan suggests a strategy similar to Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA). DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This approach can help mitigate the risk associated with price volatility, as purchases are made at various price points over time. For a volatile asset like Bitcoin, a long-term DCA strategy can smooth out the average purchase price and potentially yield favorable results over an extended horizon. This long-term view indicates that Smarter Web Company sees Bitcoin not as a short-term speculative play, but as a strategic asset intended to provide value over a decade or more. This commitment over such a long timeframe is a strong signal about their belief in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role within their financial framework. UK Company Bitcoin Strategy: A Look at Adoption Smarter Web Company’s actions provide insight into the evolving UK Company Bitcoin Strategy. While not as widespread as in some other regions, there is growing interest among UK businesses in understanding and potentially adopting digital assets. Factors influencing a UK company’s decision to hold Bitcoin include: Macroeconomic Climate: Concerns about inflation and the stability of traditional fiat currencies. Diversification: Seeking alternative assets uncorrelated or less correlated with traditional markets. Innovation & Future Readiness: Positioning the company at the forefront of technological and financial innovation. Shareholder Value: The potential for asset appreciation to benefit shareholders in the long run. However, UK companies also face unique considerations, including navigating the specific regulatory landscape within the UK, accounting standards for digital assets, and potential public perception. Smarter Web Company’s willingness to publicly pursue a Bitcoin strategy could serve as a case study for other UK firms contemplating similar moves. Their experience navigating the operational and financial aspects of holding Bitcoin will be valuable for the broader market. Benefits and Considerations of Strategic BTC Acquisition Engaging in a Strategic BTC Acquisition, as Smarter Web Company is doing, comes with potential benefits but also important considerations: Potential Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply is often cited as a protection against currency debasement. Store of Value: Its characteristics make it a candidate for preserving wealth over time. Potential for Appreciation: As adoption grows and network effects strengthen, the price could increase significantly. Diversification: Adds an asset class that may behave differently from traditional stocks and bonds. Transparency: Holdings on the blockchain are verifiable. Key Considerations & Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience rapid and substantial swings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally and within the UK. Security Risks: Requires robust security measures to protect private keys and prevent theft. Accounting Treatment: How to classify and account for Bitcoin holdings can be complex under current standards. Public & Investor Perception: Some stakeholders may be skeptical or unfamiliar with crypto assets. Companies must carefully weigh these factors, conduct thorough due diligence, and establish clear policies and security protocols before undertaking a strategic Bitcoin acquisition plan. In conclusion, Smarter Web Company’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin, culminating in 122.76 BTC holdings, is a tangible example of a UK-listed company executing a long-term Bitcoin Investment Plan. Their Strategic BTC Acquisition highlights the growing trend of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings and provides a relevant case study for understanding the motivations, strategies, and considerations involved in adopting digital assets within a corporate treasury framework. As the digital asset space continues to mature, observing the progress and outcomes of companies like Smarter Web Company will offer valuable insights into the future intersection of corporate finance and cryptocurrency.

2025-06-05T15:20:54,"Visa Stablecoin Cards: Revolutionizing Payments Across Asia-Pacific","BitcoinWorld Visa Stablecoin Cards: Revolutionizing Payments Across Asia-Pacific Big news is hitting the wires for anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance and the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrencies! Visa, a global leader in digital payments, is making a significant move in Asia-Pacific with the introduction of Visa stablecoin cards . This development signals a growing acceptance and integration of digital currencies into everyday transactions, promising exciting possibilities for users and businesses across the region. What Are Visa Stablecoin Cards? At its core, this initiative involves creating payment cards that are directly linked to stablecoin balances. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar, or sometimes to commodities or other cryptocurrencies. This stability makes them far more practical for everyday transactions and payments. The new Visa stablecoin cards, launched through collaborations with key partners, allow users to convert their fiat currency into supported stablecoins and then use those stablecoins to make purchases anywhere Visa is accepted worldwide. The conversion from stablecoin back to fiat happens seamlessly at the point of sale, meaning the merchant receives traditional currency, while the user spends their digital assets. Exploring the Visa Partnership in Asia Visa isn’t doing this alone. This strategic push into stablecoin payments in Asia-Pacific is a result of a Visa partnership Asia with three notable entities: DCS Singapore, DTC Pay, and StraitsX. Each partner brings a unique strength to the table: DCS Singapore: Likely involved in the card issuance and processing infrastructure. DTC Pay: A payment provider specializing in digital assets, helping to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional payment rails. StraitsX: A prominent stablecoin issuer in Southeast Asia, known for its Singapore Dollar-pegged stablecoin, XSGD, and potentially others. Their role is crucial in providing the stable digital asset layer for these cards. This collaborative approach leverages the expertise of digital asset specialists alongside Visa’s vast global payment network, aiming to create a robust and user-friendly system for stablecoin payments Asia . Driving Stablecoin Payments in Asia-Pacific Why is Visa focusing on stablecoin payments in Asia-Pacific? The region is a hotbed for innovation and has shown significant interest and adoption of cryptocurrencies and digital assets. Many countries in Asia-Pacific have rapidly growing digital economies and populations increasingly comfortable with digital finance. The partnership aims to tap into this market by offering a practical use case for stablecoins. By enabling users to spend stablecoins easily at millions of locations, Visa and its partners are providing a tangible benefit that could accelerate the adoption of digital currencies for commerce. This move could significantly boost stablecoin payments Asia -wide, making digital assets more than just speculative investments. Bridging Crypto and Fiat: A New Crypto Payment Solution One of the biggest hurdles for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption has been the difficulty in using digital assets for everyday purchases. You often have to convert crypto back to fiat through an exchange, which can be slow and involve fees, before you can spend it. These new cards act as a crucial bridge. They represent a significant step forward as a crypto payment solution that simplifies the process dramatically. Users can hold stablecoins and spend them directly, with the complexity of conversion handled in the background by the payment processor. This creates a smoother experience akin to using a traditional debit or credit card, but powered by digital assets. Benefits of this approach include: Global Acceptance: Spend stablecoins anywhere Visa is accepted. Speed: Transactions can potentially be faster than traditional methods in some cases, depending on the underlying stablecoin network and processing. Reduced Costs: Depending on the card provider and stablecoin network, transaction fees might be lower compared to traditional international transfers or card fees. Ease of Use: Converts a digital asset into a universally accepted payment method. This makes it easier for individuals and potentially businesses to utilize stablecoins for various transactions, from buying groceries to paying for online services. Implications for Digital Currency Adoption Visa’s involvement is a powerful endorsement for the use of stablecoins in commerce. As a globally recognized brand, their participation lends credibility and visibility to digital asset payments. This partnership is likely to have significant implications for overall digital currency adoption , not just in Asia-Pacific but potentially as a model for other regions. Here’s how this could impact the landscape: Increased User Confidence: Seeing a trusted network like Visa facilitate stablecoin transactions can make potential users feel more secure and willing to experiment with digital assets. Broader Merchant Acceptance: While the conversion happens instantly for the merchant, Visa’s integration makes it easier for businesses to effectively ‘accept’ stablecoins without changing their existing payment systems. Regulatory Push: As major players like Visa enter the space, it often prompts regulators to provide clearer guidelines, which can further legitimize and facilitate digital currency adoption. Innovation Catalyst: This move could inspire other payment networks and financial institutions to explore similar integrations, accelerating the development of crypto payment solutions. While challenges remain, including navigating diverse regulatory environments across Asia-Pacific and ensuring user education, this partnership represents a tangible step towards a future where digital currencies play a more integrated role in the global economy. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite the exciting potential, launching stablecoin-backed cards isn’t without its hurdles. Regulatory clarity surrounding stablecoins varies significantly from country to country in Asia-Pacific. Partners must navigate different legal frameworks regarding digital assets, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. Furthermore, ensuring seamless technical integration across different platforms and providing adequate customer support for users who might be new to digital assets are crucial for widespread success. The user experience needs to be as smooth and reliable as using a traditional Visa card. However, the collaboration between a global payment giant and innovative fintech and stablecoin companies suggests a commitment to overcoming these challenges and building a robust infrastructure for the future of payments. Conclusion The launch of Visa stablecoin cards in Asia-Pacific, facilitated by partnerships with DCS Singapore, DTC Pay, and StraitsX, marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital payments. By creating a simple and globally accepted way to spend stablecoins, Visa is helping to bridge the gap between the traditional financial system and the digital asset economy. This initiative has the potential to significantly boost stablecoin payments Asia-wide, serving as a powerful new crypto payment solution and accelerating overall digital currency adoption. It’s a clear signal that stablecoins are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative assets, but as viable tools for everyday commerce.

2025-06-05T15:16:08,"Crypto Self Custody Is the Future, and People Say Best Wallet Leads the Way","What does crypto want to be when it grows up? Centralized exchanges like Coinbase have long marketed themselves as crypto’s answer to convenience. User-friendly, regulated, and custodial. Just give them the keys and let them drive. They’ll handle all the boring details – like on/off ramps, UI, integrated swapping, and little things like taking control of your crypto. And in return, all you need to do is trust. But increasingly, that deal sounds like a bad one. The trade-off between trust and control is no longer worth it. Trust Coinbase and other custodial platforms too much, and what do you get? Hacks and data breaches , among other things. There’s a better path forward – and more and more crypto users are looking for it. A Better Custody Deal So, what should the future of crypto be? Crypto should still be easy. It should still be intuitive. But it should also be private, safe, secure, and truly self-custodial. After all, the old adage of ‘not your keys, not your crypto’ shouldn’t just be a slogan – it is, and should be, the foundation of decentralized finance. That’s where wallets like Best Wallet come in. Unlike centralized platforms, self-custody crypto wallets like Best Wallet don’t hold your private keys. You have complete control of your assets at all times. There are no middlemen, no single points of failure, and no need to put your trust in third parties. But what about the convenience of swapping crypto, sending crypto, and exploring new crypto opportunities all from one app? Bridging the Gap: Self-Custody Meets Convenience The future of crypto points to tools that combine the convenience of centralized exchanges like Coinbase, including KYC and AML requirements, with the security of self-custody, without sacrificing usability. We’ve already seen this with tools like Railgun , which complies with KYC while enabling private transactions on DeFi platforms, and which Vitalik Buterin just used to transfer $2.6M in crypto. While transactions of that size may well be just another day in the office for the Ethereum founder, it demonstrates how increasingly important privacy, control, and functionality are in the developing crypto economy. This is nothing new; it’s often the people most deeply involved in tech who understand just how important it is to control your own data (and your own crypto). Remember Zuckerberg’s camera? That was the time he was promoting Meta, and everyone realized he’d taped across his laptop’s microphone and camera. Was that paranoia or an understanding of just how vulnerable our data is? That’s the balance that Best Wallet wants to deliver, beating MetaMask at its own game and dominating the Web3 self-custody wallet market. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Self-Custody Crypto Wallet Presale Token Crypto wallets aren’t just handy places to stash some spare Bitcoin, at least not anymore. The best crypto wallets – like Best Wallet – serve as all-in-one control hubs for crypto investors, whether you’re operating multiple wallets, swapping tokens, ot investing in crypto presales. And that’s not all. The Best Wallet ecosystem is supercharged by its own token, $BEST . Best Wallet Token holders get: Lower transaction fees Higher staking rewards Earlier presale access Eligibility for bonus crypto airdrops (such as BTC Bull Token’s Bitcoin airdrop) Best Wallet and the $BEST token are building the crypto future that Buterin and others are looking for: interconnected, seamless, and self-custodial. It’s everything you could want or ever need from a crypto wallet. You can manage your portfolio, browse upcoming token launches (including the best new meme coins ), and spend your crypto in real life with the upcoming Best Card. Buying, selling, and swapping are as easy as tapping a few buttons. And all this is secured with multi-party computation (MPC) and biometric authentication to keep your crypto safe without sacrificing ease of use. The Best Wallet Token presale has raised over $13.1M, with tokens currently priced at $0.025135. That could rise to $0.035215 by the end of the year, according to our $BEST price prediction , delivering gains of 40% to current presale investors. Learn more about how to buy Best Wallet Token with our guide. Best Wallet: Building the Self-Custodial Future of Crypto No longer does crypto have to choose between usability and control. Tools like Best Wallet are showing that self-custody platforms can match – or even beat – the convenience that centralized exchanges offer while staying true to the core values of crypto. As more self-custodial models appear in a post-Coinbase world, Best Wallet wants to lead the charge and dominate this $11B sector. If it succeeds, it will be by delivering a product that is convenient and completely crypto-native. Always do your own research before investing in crypto; this isn’t financial advice.

2025-06-05T15:07:03,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Hovers Around $105,000 As Indecisiveness Persists","Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade around $105,000 as selling pressure and buyer exhaustion weigh on the price. The flagship’s cryptocurrency’s price action indicates indecision after its sharp retracement from its all-time high of $111,970. Momentum stalled after BTC reached this level as investors locked in their profits, leading to a decline that gradually transitioned into a sideways consolidation phase. BTC had dipped to a low of $103,734 at the beginning of the week before recovering and moving to current levels. The price is up over 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $105,825. New Whales Scoop Up Billions in Bitcoin Bitcoin is facing a significant pullback in recent sessions, with its price trading below key levels after surging to a new all-time high. Despite the decline, on-chain data has revealed a startling discovery. A new set of Bitcoin whales, wallets with 1000 Bitcoin aged less than six months, have been accumulating the asset at a frenetic pace. According to CryptoQuant analysts, this accumulation could indicate renewed conviction among participants for future catalysts and price jumps. The amount held by the new Bitcoin whales doubled from 500,000 BTC to over 1.1 million BTC between March 1 and June 4, representing an increase of over $63 billion in value. The share of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply grew from 2.5% to 5.6%, removing an amount equivalent to ten months of Bitcoin mining output from active circulation. Analysts believe new whale activity indicates a shift in the market. If these whales continue to remove BTC from circulation, it could herald a period of price compression followed by upside volatility. Vitalik Buterin Concedes Bitcoin Dominance in Some Areas Of Crypto Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has conceded that Bitcoin is ahead of Ethereum in some aspects of the crypto space. Buterin made the comments in response to users who were debating about the protocol’s strengths and what it must improve upon. Some users believe Ethereum is leading the industry in terms of censorship resistance but not transactions per second. Buterin confirmed this but stated that there are some aspects of the crypto space dominated by Bitcoin . “I believe Ethereum is leading in terms of CR and security. There are some aspects of this where Bitcoin is ahead (eg. less code complexity, lower rate of protocol change, higher full node count, less dependence on RPCs).” He stated that Bitcoin was superior to Ethereum in terms of coding simplicity, fewer protocol changes, node count, and lesser dependency on services like Infura, Alchemy, or Ankr. Buterin believes Ethereum is more advanced in censorship resistance and security thanks to its flexible and evolving protocol. JPMorgan To Accept Bitcoin ETFs As Collateral JPMorgan is expanding its financing options to include spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing its customers to use their crypto ETFs as collateral when applying for a loan. According to sources, the new offering will apply to the banking giant’s wealthy clients. Recently, the bank’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, announced it will allow its clients to buy Bitcoin. Dimon, a crypto skeptic, had stated that he would defend the people’s right to buy Bitcoin. The new service will begin with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $40 billion in cumulative inflows and over $70 billion in net assets. The bank could expand its offering to include other Bitcoin ETFs. Reports have also claimed that JPMorgan plans to add crypto holdings to the list of assets considered when financial managers assess a client’s net worth. The bank will also include crypto in the assessment of liquid assets, treating it like real estate, stocks, and motor vehicles. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin’s (BTC) price action remained subdued as it struggled to build momentum and cross the 20-day SMA. The price briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session but crashed back below it, moving to its current level of $104,770. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced significant selling pressure after reaching its all-time high as investors locked in their profits and buyer exhaustion set in. Data shows that long liquidations are stabilizing after hitting a peak of $206 million. The past 24 hours saw $200 million worth of long positions flushed as markets opened facing strong selling pressure. Market sentiment has also waned, as indicated by the Fear and Greed Index. The index peaked at 76 in May but has fallen to 57, indicating the prevalence of a neutral attitude among investors. Investors may be adopting a wait-and-watch approach, thanks to renewed trade tensions between the US and China. According to some analysts, BTC could slip below $100,000 if the current downtrend continues, falling as low as $92,000. However, others have stated that while BTC’s pullback is concerning, investors are still optimistic about a recovery. Crypto market sentiment remains strong. Some analysts believe BTC could surge to a new all-time high above $115,000 next month if institutional interest continues and US job data is weaker than expected. “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July.” The US Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its monthly jobs report on June 6. Job data is a crucial indicator for Bitcoin as it impacts the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates, which in turn, influences sentiment towards risk assets like Bitcoin. “A stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting downward pressure on Bitcoin.” On the other hand, a softer-than-expected report could encourage the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates sooner. BTC traded in positive territory last weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. The price continued to push higher on Monday, rising to $109,453, but lost momentum on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline to slip below $109,000 and settle at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell over 1% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC fell 2.01%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as the price fell 1.61%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Source: TradingView BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and 0.95% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. The price plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 as the week started on a bearish note. However, the price recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. BTC was back in the red on Tuesday, falling 0.44% to $105,435. BTC continued to decline on Wednesday, falling 0.65% to slip below $105,000 and settle at $104,755.

One in a Million Chances! According to Mempool data, a Bitcoin miner earned a block reward of $330,000 despite the network difficulty reaching a record high of 126.98 trillion. According to the data, the solo miner earned $327,625 in subsidy rewards and approximately $2,761 in total transaction fees and claimed 3.15 BTC. A solo miner successfully mined block number 899,826 and earned a rare reward worth $330,386. The miner achieved the feat by mining block 300 from the solo.ckpool Bitcoin mining pool. “Congratulations to miner bc1qa8r4up9nchkvdnhcf9feexv2jfantrk48ef374 who increased his hash rate to solve block 300 solved on solo.ckpool.org!” said CKpool developer Con Kolivas. Kolivas said that based on Bitcoin’s hash rate, a single miner is likely renting additional hash rate to increase his chances of winning the block reward. “Although the miner has been mining at a much lower hash rate for some time, the reason the hash rate has increased to these levels is most likely a rental due to there being only one worker.” Bitcoin blocks are produced approximately every 10 minutes and are typically mined by mining pools that have the highest chance of winning the block reward. The reward for successfully mining a block is currently 3,125 Bitcoins after a halving event earlier this year. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T15:00:58,"BTC whales back to stacking Bitcoin, shifting from distribution mode","Glassnode analytics revealed that the largest Bitcoin holders are now back in accumulation after briefly being in distribution. According to the firm, all wallet cohorts indicated varying degrees of buying. At the time of publication, BTC is currently exchanging hands at $104,786, a 3.75% drop in the last 7 days. The digital asset is also a few percentage points shy of its all-time high of $111.970, but despite its small pullback, BTC is still up 13% this year. BTC struggles to push past its all-time high While its price may appear stable on the surface, on-chain data suggests a shift from distribution to accumulation among Bitcoin’s largest holders. Glassnode’s Accumulation Trend Score, a measure of accumulation behavior across various wallet-size cohorts, suggested the shift in BTC’s market dynamics. The metric evaluates purchasing strength by combining the size of wallet entities with the volume of BTC acquired over the past 15 days. The firm also noted that wallets associated with exchanges and miners are excluded from the analysis to provide a clearer picture of investor behavior. Data from Glassnote showed that the strongest wallet activity of cohorts was at the 10-100 groups, while the least wallet activity was below 1 group. The analytics company also noted that both scored 1.0, which is the highest possible. A reading of 1 indicates strong bullish momentum, while a level near 0 points to a market sell-off. Bitcoin Trend Accumulation Score by Cohort. Source: Glassnode According to Glassnode, wallets holding 10,000 BTC or more, typically classified as whales, were the first to begin accumulating at the market’s April lows at around $75,000. The data indicated that the cohorts are now reducing their holdings while others remain in accumulation mode. The analytics firm suggests a strategic shift, potentially driven by a desire to lock in profits near historic highs or a more cautious outlook on short-term price direction. Analyst Willy Woo argued that BTC’s failure to sustain its bounce on June 3 suggests a lack of demand at higher levels, with expectations it may fall to the psychological $100K level. Woo also cautioned that buying Bitcoin in six figures may not make sense in the short term, but it might be “one of the best investments you’ll see in your investment career” within the next 10 years. According to Sygnum Bank’s Monthly Investment Outlook, its analysts noted that institutional adoption and the rise of Bitcoin acquisition vehicles had resulted in a 30% drop in Bitcoin’s liquid supply. The bank’s analysts believe it could create the conditions for demand shocks and upside volatility. Bitcoin’s price depends on coming macroeconomic developments Bitfinex analysts predicted that Bitcoin could reach the $120,000 – $125,000 range as early as June, contingent on favorable macroeconomic developments. They believe that if BTC could maintain support above $105K, it could target its forecasted range this month. The analyst also argued that the rise would not be catalyzed just by the labor market but could be a domino with multiple catalysts prompting the Fed to cut rates faster than expected. Analysts believe Friday’s U.S. jobs report will catalyze Bitcoin upwards past its current accumulation face. Employment data is expected to show 125,000 to 130,000 new nonfarm payrolls, representing a lower figure from April’s 177,000 additions. Dr. Kirill Kretov from CoinPanel suggested that a weaker-than-expected NFP figure of a rise in the employment rate could signal a cooling labor market, increasing the likelihood of Fed rate cuts. He also believes such a scenario might boost risk appetite, driving investor interest toward digital assets like Bitcoin. Bitfinex also stated that a softer-than-expected NFP report could reinforce the disinflation narrative and prompt the Fed to consider rate cuts sooner, which could be bullish for BTC. The firm also argued that a stronger-than-expected report might delay rate cuts, strengthening the dollar and possibly exerting selling momentum on Bitcoin.

2025-06-05T15:00:54,"Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over","The Bitcoin price is falling fast, and with bears currently taking control, a crypto analyst has forecasted an impending crash below $100,000. While this potential downturn may sound alarming, the analyst has also revealed that after the pullback, Bitcoin (BTC) is expected to undergo a significant price rally to new all-time highs. Bitcoin Price Faces Immediate Crash Risk Bitcoin appears to be entering a cooling phase after experiencing a significant bullish run that spanned several weeks and led to its current all-time high of almost $112,000. ‘MelikaTrader94’, the TradingView crypto analyst responsible for this new technical analysis, predicts that during this cooling period, bears could take over and send the Bitcoin price crashing down to former lows under $100,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings On a 4-hour chart presented by the analyst, Bitcoin has consistently respected a descending trendline acting as a strong resistance threshold. This line, which formed after the recent peak, has now rejected price action multiple times, preventing further upward movement and hinting at growing bearish pressure in the short term. At the time of the analysis, Bitcoin was trading at $106,432, attempting to test the descending trendline once again. However, the chart shows that BTC lacks strong momentum, suggesting that another rejection is likely. If this rejection occurs, BTC’s price action is expected to correct downward toward the $99,000 region, marked on the chart as a key horizontal support zone. Bitcoin’s projected pullback is consistent with typical market behavior, especially after an extended bullish phase. Based on the TradingView expert’s analysis, a drop to the $99,000 support level could shake out weak hands and provide fresh buy-dip opportunities for traders. While the structure of the projected downward move is not entirely bearish, it suggests a necessary retest of lower support areas before any sustainable rally can resume. Bullish Continuation Expected After Pullback MelikaTrader94 has suggested that correcting down to the $99,000 support zone is critical for determining Bitcoin’s next rally. If this crash successfully occurs and buyers step in to defend the support, BTC could begin forming a strong bullish continuation structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash: Why $107,500 And $103,500 Are The Levels To Watch The TradingView analyst’s chart outlines a possible rebound from the support area, which could trigger a breakout above the descending trendline. A sustained move above this trendline would potentially invalidate the short-term bearish structure and set the stage for a new all-time high, with price targets extending beyond $114,000. Notably, Bitcoin’s consolidation around its current price of $104,500, followed by a possible dip to the well-established support zone, fits the analyst’s narrative that the market is preparing for a big move. The TradingView expert has urged investors and traders to keep an eye out for a strong bounce, as this projected pullback could be a healthy one that comes just before a bullish leg up.

The company filed a Form 6-K with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) detailing the moves it has so far made to create this XRP-focused treasury. Webus Files Form 6-K For XRP Treasury With US SEC A SEC filing shows that Webus has filed the Form 6-K for its XRP treasury with the Commission. The Chinese firm noted the signing of a Delegated Digital-Asset Management agreement with Samara Alpha, aimed at establishing a strategic framework for potential future digital asset treasury operations. Webus last week announced that it was exploring a financing strategy of up to $300 million to establish an XRP reserve for supporting global payment solutions. The company intends to use available cash reserves, bank lending, shareholder guarantees, and third-party institutional-backed credit facilities from traditional banks to fund this endeavor. The company further declared that an XRP blockchain integration has the potential to revolutionize how they handle cross-border payments for both partners and travelers worldwide. Besides Webus, Nasdaq-listed VivoPower is another company that is looking to establish an XRP Treasury. Bitcoinist reported that VivoPower has secured $121 million in its bid to become the first public company to execute an XRP-focused treasury and DeFi strategy. As part of its move to achieve this, the company has entered into a strategic partnership with BitGo to facilitate the initial $100 million XRP acquisition for its treasury strategy. VivoPower will use BitGo as an exclusive over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk to acquire the $100 million XRP tokens. The company will also use the crypto platform for the trading of its XRP holdings through BitGo’s 24/7 OTC trading desk and holding of its assets through the custody platform. Odds For An XRP ETF On The Rise Amid these developments, the odds of an XRP ETF launching this year have skyrocketed in the past few weeks. Polymarket data shows that there is a 92% chance that the SEC approves this ETF before December 31. However, this fund is unlikely to be available before the first half of the year ends, as there is only an 18% chance of approval before July 31. The XRP ETFs will drive more institutional inflows into the XRP ecosystem, which is bullish for the altcoin’s price. Crypto analyst BarriC had previously predicted that the altcoin could rally to between $10 and $20 once the ETFs get approved. Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, Wisdomtree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton have all filed to offer an XRP ETF. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.18, down over 2.14% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/chinese-company-buy-xrp/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|21Shares|BarriC|BitGo|Bitwise|Canary Capital|Coinmarketcap|CoinShares|DeFi|Delegated Digital-Asset Management|Franklin Templeton|Grayscale|OTC|Over-the-counter|Polymarket|Samara Alpha|Spot XRP ETF|US SEC|VivoPower|Webus|wisdomtree|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T14:56:15,"Best Crypto to Buy Now As JPMorgan Set to Accept Bitcoin as Collateral","When long-standing critics of crypto begin to loosen their grip and shift strategy, it often signals more than a trend. It suggests legitimacy is no longer up for debate. Bitcoin is now being treated as a financial instrument that carries real weight, not just speculative interest. That shift became undeniably clear with JPMorgan’s recent decision to allow Bitcoin to be used as collateral for loans. Once known for its skepticism, the Wall Street institution is now rolling out crypto-backed lending services for its wealthiest clients. As banking giants change their views, the narrative changes within the global finance space. It’s no longer about whether crypto will be accepted. The real question is how fast it integrates into everything else. Jamie Dimon Backs Down as Bitcoin Enters JPMorgan’s Loan Books Jamie Dimon’s public stance on Bitcoin has long walked a fine line between resistance and reluctant acknowledgment. The JPMorgan CEO, once vocal about his distrust in crypto, now finds his bank pioneering a lending structure that accepts Bitcoin ETF holdings as legitimate collateral. And not just in theory—the move is already rolling out for high-net-worth clients globally. The program begins with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, the most heavily funded spot ETF in the market. But insiders suggest this is just the start. Other ETFs and crypto-based products could soon be eligible. Even more significant is the bank’s internal shift. Bitcoin is now part of net worth assessments and liquid asset evaluations, treated in the same category as stocks or real estate. That’s not just a policy change, but essentially a redefinition of the asset as a whole, since it could now become a recognized transfer of value. JUST IN: $3.6 trillion asset manager JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin & crypto ETFs as collateral for loans. pic.twitter.com/znmDyJvyVG — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) June 4, 2025 While the market hasn’t reacted dramatically to the announcement, the implications stretch far. JPMorgan’s decision gives institutional investors a clear signal that Bitcoin isn’t fringe anymore. It’s collateral-worthy, and that could open the floodgates for other entities too. Crypto-backed lending isn’t new, but when the biggest U.S. bank begins offering it to its elite clientele, the perception shifts across the board. It may start small, but this kind of move makes it easier for crypto to weave into traditional finance in ways that once seemed impossible. Best Crypto to Buy Now SUBBD There is a shift happening in crypto. Meme-fueled hype cycles are no longer enough to keep investor interest intact. What the market now seems to favor are projects that come built with function, long-term use cases, and real user demand. SUBBD is one of those rare tokens designed with an actual ecosystem in mind. Instead of promising vague future utilities, SUBBD builds on a model that redefines how creators, influencers, and their audiences interact. It opens the door to monetization without intermediaries. Content creators get to issue exclusive digital passes, while fans can back their favorite personalities through a decentralized rewards structure. The SUBBD token functions not as a placeholder, but as a transaction layer within the creator economy. Every purchase, every vote of support, every unlockable reward runs through it. This transforms the project into a working protocol, not a marketing experiment. Utility-based tokens like SUBBD are becoming the ones investors lean toward when the noise clears. They speak to actual value flow, where the token is involved in processes people want to participate in. And with the rise of social monetization models, SUBBD seems particularly timed to scale. Platforms that allow creators to own the economics of their work are gaining traction globally. SUBBD just happens to offer that with blockchain-based infrastructure. For investors watching projects with long arcs, this one sits at the intersection of culture and decentralization. Not flashy, but functional. And sometimes, that’s what sticks around longest. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper focuses on a problem that has existed for years. Bitcoin, while dominant in value and recognition, has never been known for fast or affordable transactions. This project introduces a Layer 2 structure intended to change that without modifying the Bitcoin protocol itself. Instead, it builds around it, using Ethereum-based tools to create an auxiliary system that aims to handle transfers, staking, and DeFi functions at a pace and cost that the original network cannot achieve alone. The project draws from several established scaling technologies. These include components that facilitate off-chain computation, batch transaction processing, and side networks that interact with the main chain only when needed. In doing so, Bitcoin Hyper attempts to preserve the integrity of Bitcoin while expanding its use case in real time. These systems are not theoretical. They already exist in various parts of the Ethereum ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper brings them together under one framework and adjusts them for compatibility. The token plays multiple roles. It fuels transactions, governs protocol-level decisions, and supports staking within the ecosystem. The presale includes a feature where buyers can begin staking at the point of purchase, which reduces the friction that often comes with onboarding. The $HYPER Pre-Sale is now LIVE!Get up to speed 👇 https://t.co/yzXqAckjDw pic.twitter.com/sij7UFBOcb — Bitcoin Hyper (@BTC_Hyper2) May 8, 2025 It is also riding a subtle macro theme. As Bitcoin finds greater institutional use—from treasury holdings to collateral agreements like the JPMorgan rollout—the appetite for projects tied to Bitcoin’s image could increase. Bitcoin Hyper benefits from being on-brand while offering something more aggressive in structure. That might not appeal to conservative investors, but it speaks directly to those who want velocity, not just security. Early interest has been consistent, and the presence of an audit by a recognized third party suggests a level of operational planning. The project does not try to redefine Bitcoin. It offers a structure around it that supports what users want today without compromising what Bitcoin was built to protect. Solaxy Solaxy is the kind of project that emerges when two different networks need a bridge without giving up their identities. Essentially, Solaxy aims to make transactions between Ethereum and Solana feel less like a workaround and more like a native experience. But it does not stop at just being another cross-chain protocol. It introduces a reward-heavy structure that incentivizes users to not just move assets, but to hold and participate. Built as a Layer 2 network with high-speed confirmation, Solaxy allows users to stake their tokens while enjoying considerably lower gas fees. It appeals to those who understand that future scaling does not lie with singular chains but in systems that allow fluidity across platforms. With both Ethereum’s security and Solana’s speed being critical to various sectors, Solaxy acts like a glue that holds together the best parts of each. Featured in several popular YouTuber channels like Cilinix Crypto and more, SOLX is described as more than a network access token. It has staking built in with good APY returns, rewarding users not just for trust, but for engagement. And as more projects begin launching in environments that demand cheaper transaction costs and faster execution, the infrastructure layer that Solaxy offers becomes more relevant. In a year where institutional support for crypto infrastructure is becoming more public, Solaxy’s model feels ahead of its time. If the integration of assets into mainstream finance is truly happening, as with JPMorgan’s Bitcoin move, then the demand for smart bridges like Solaxy is set to rise fast. Best Wallet Token At some point, crypto wallets stopped being just tools and started becoming ecosystems of their own. Best Wallet took that idea and refined it into something that feels usable, familiar, and technically superior. What began as a multi-chain wallet quickly turned into a central platform for managing portfolios, accessing DeFi protocols, and even participating in presales. That broader vision is precisely why the Best Wallet Token is drawing serious attention from both seasoned holders and newcomers looking for access without complexity. Its main product, Best Wallet, is now among the few crypto apps to be featured by legacy media - including a recent mention in the New York Post as one of the most polished and secure wallets currently available. That kind of recognition does not come easily, especially in a space where most wallet apps either overpromise or underdeliver. But Best Wallet seems to have struck a rare balance between security, design, and extensibility. The token itself is more than a governance label. It gives holders access to exclusive perks such as staking rewards, early access to curated presales, and native trading fee discounts. More importantly, it is fully integrated into the ecosystem. That makes it less speculative and more utility-bound. In a market gradually shifting toward all-in-one solutions, the presence of a platform like Best Wallet is more than convenient. It is a signal of where crypto UX is heading. If decentralization is going mainstream, it will need familiar tools. Best Wallet just might be one of them. Conclusion When institutions once skeptical of crypto begin adding crypto to their main services, the bar for quality rises across the board. It is no longer about novelty or narrative. Projects that offer function, infrastructure, or access are beginning to align with where the market is clearly heading. The examples above reflect that shift, not because they chase trends, but because they anticipate what a mature digital economy will require. That makes them worth more than a glance.

2025-06-05T14:52:26,"Trump’s Truth Social Bitcoin ETF could shake up $130B crypto fund market","Trump Media and Technology Group (NASDAQ: DJT) has filed to launch the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, joining a crowded but rapidly growing market of crypto investment products. The S-1 registration form , submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), aims to secure approval for listing the ETF on NYSE Arca. If granted, it would mark a strategic leap for Trump Media from social media into the financial sector, specifically the $130 billion Bitcoin ETF market. While the application process is still underway, this proposed ETF would provide retail investors with a simplified, regulated way to gain exposure to Bitcoin, something that aligns with former President Donald Trump’s growing public endorsement of digital assets. Trump Media expands beyond social media Originally launched to challenge mainstream platforms, Truth Social has evolved into the public face of Trump Media’s broader tech ambitions. Following its ventures into streaming via Truth+ and fintech via Truth. Fi, the company is now targeting cryptocurrency investment. The proposed ETF would be backed by Yorkville America Digital, a self-described “America-First” asset manager, with Crypto.com named as the Bitcoin custodian and primary liquidity provider. These partnerships suggest an effort to combine Trump branding with established crypto infrastructure to attract investor confidence. The move into digital assets comes at a time when Trump Media is still a relatively small player in the tech world. However, its listed status on the NASDAQ and the former president’s continued public influence have given the firm a visibility advantage over its peers. Trump Media recently announced a $2.5 billion investment in Bitcoin to build a corporate treasury. The aim is to diversify its revenue streams and align with the growing trend of corporate crypto holdings. SEC review to determine market entry Approval from the SEC remains the biggest hurdle before the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF can go live. Should it receive the green light, trading would commence on NYSE Arca, one of the main venues for existing Bitcoin ETFs. This ETF would join products from asset management giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, which have already drawn billions in inflows since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024. Yet the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF hopes to stand out through its political branding and direct appeal to Trump’s base of supporters. Retail investors who have previously hesitated due to a lack of clarity around crypto wallets, keys, or exchanges may find the ETF format easier to navigate. If listed, the ETF would offer exposure to Bitcoin without the complications of managing digital assets directly. Questions raised over brand ethics and timing Trump Media’s push into financial services has reignited debate over ethical boundaries, particularly concerning the use of Donald Trump’s name and influence. While Trump is no longer officially involved in the day-to-day operations of his businesses, his name remains tied to their identity and marketing. Critics argue that this ETF could serve as a vehicle for Trump-aligned investors to support his brand while gaining crypto exposure. Others point out that his recent comments on Bitcoin as a “financial freedom” tool may help sway investors towards the fund. The timing is also significant. Trump is currently the sitting president, and while he has stepped away from direct business involvement, the proximity of this product to his political image could invite scrutiny from regulators and watchdogs.

2025-06-05T14:43:49,"Bitcoin’s Current Bull Cycle Is Unlike Anything We’ve Seen Before","As Bitcoin continues to navigate a turbulent upward trajectory after the recent drawdown from its ATH in May, analysts are revisiting historical bull markets for context. However, this time around, some trends appear to be evolving. What may have worked as a predictive model before might not fully explain the current market behavior. This Cycle Is Breaking a Few Rules The ongoing crypto bull cycle shows both parallels and key differences when compared to previous cycles. The 2017 bull market was largely upward with intermittent short corrections, including a notable 7-8-month-long correction toward the latter half, similar in duration to the 2024 correction. On the other hand, the 2021 cycle experienced an early extended correction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which lasted roughly a year before transitioning into a major rally with minimal interruptions. That sequence, characterized by deep corrections followed by sharp gains, has become a hallmark of crypto bull runs. The present cycle began with familiar short-lived pullbacks and rallies, but since early 2024, Bitcoin has undergone two distinct phases of rapid gains followed by steep corrections. Between March-November 2024 and January-April 2025, altcoins notably lagged behind Bitcoin, which caused widespread caution and weakened sentiment. While brief surges reignited optimism, continued resistance has capped momentum. Unlike prior cycles, this one appears to be influenced by repeated episodes of abrupt suppression following strong rallies, which CryptoQuant interprets as interventions by large entities in a bid to temper excessive speculation and extend the overall cycle. This behavior suggests a deliberate slowdown to prevent overheating, thereby deviating from past euphoric breakouts. Ultimately, despite these moderating patterns, the cycle is anticipated to conclude with a classic euphoric blow-off phase. Bitcoin’s “Boring” Year, But What’s Ahead? Though current price action lacked fireworks, market observers believe it marks the most important inflection point in crypto history. The asset’s sideways trading conceals a significant shift in investor base, from retail speculators to corporate and institutional holders like Fidelity and BlackRock. Between long-time holders cashing out above $100,000 while Millennials allocate generational wealth into Bitcoin, Swan analysts argue this is a strategic accumulation phase. Mounting macroeconomic uncertainty further tightens supply, which positions the market for future explosive moves as Bitcoin becomes a permanent balance sheet fixture for major entities.

2025-06-05T14:36:48,"Bitcoin ETF inflows hit $5.2b as all-time high fuels institutional demand","In May, key trends in crypto centered on institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, driven by positive regulatory developments. Strong inflows into Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange traded funds coincided with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high in May. According to a Binance Research report , released on June 5, crypto markets remained resilient despite volatility triggered by uncertainty around U.S. trade policy. Heightened volatility led to nearly $1 billion in liquidations following the trade agreement between the U.S. and the U.K. An additional $183 million in liquidations occurred after the U.S. announced a tariff pause on the European Union. Despite the large volume of liquidations, interest in Bitcoin ETFs remained robust. These products attracted $5.2 billion in net inflows, the highest level since November 2024. Notably, these inflows coincided with Bitcoin hitting its all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. Monthly net inflows for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs | Source: Binance Research ETF inflows were largely supported by positive regulatory momentum. In the U.S. Senate, the GENIUS Act gained traction, proposing the first stablecoin regulation framework in the country. The report also cited growing regulatory support for stablecoins in Hong Kong.

On June 3, NYSE Arca submitted a rule change to the SEC to list this new spot ETF, backed by Trump-linked Yorkville America Digital. Unlike typical ETFs, this fund’s branding taps into partisan identity, potentially unlocking interest from Trump’s political base and retail traders alike. The ETF intends to track Bitcoin performance while extending exposure without requiring traders and investors to directly carry BTC. Moreover, it copies existing offerings from BlackRock and Grayscale, which have secured regulatory approval and custody protections. NYSE Arca has submitted a filing to list Truth Social’s proposed Bitcoin ETF, which is designed to simplify Bitcoin exposure for investors. Could this drive broader adoption of Bitcoin ETFs? Source: Reuters, June 2025 pic.twitter.com/pVGl0sFTs0 — American Bitcoin (@AmericanBTC) June 4, 2025 Yet, the market reaction remains cautious. Bitcoin has not broken out on the ETF news, underscoring short-term headwinds such as regulatory overhang and investor fatigue despite long-term bullish catalysts. Truth Social ETF filed on NYSE Arca, SEC review pending Branded ETF may pull in political retail demand Bitcoin remains under $106K despite ETF buzz JPMorgan Unlocks Lending Against Bitcoin ETFs While retail flows are slow, institutional finance is moving. JPMorgan is now allowing ultra high net worth clients to borrow against spot Bitcoin ETF shares like BlackRock’s IBIT. This is a big deal because Bitcoin ETFs are now alongside stocks and real estate as acceptable collateral. This is a significant milestone for crypto’s integration into the traditional financial system. This is especially interesting given CEO Jamie Dimon’s public skepticism towards digital assets. But behind the scenes, Bitcoin’s utility is becoming too big to ignore. By allowing crypto backed loans, the bank is formalizing Bitcoin as an asset class in the secured lending framework. JPMorgan launches lending against Bitcoin ETFs IBIT and other spot ETFs now collateral-eligible Institutional credibility grows despite volatility Could Trump Push Bitcoin Into National Reserves? The question gaining traction among crypto analysts is whether Trump’s ETF push signals broader plans for Bitcoin on a national scale. While there’s no official move toward BTC adoption in national reserves, the combination of political branding and institutional financial integration is noteworthy. A Trump administration endorsement of Bitcoin, even symbolic, could dramatically shift public and government sentiment. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview For now, Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC is trading range-bound, but the chart shows a tightening symmetrical triangle. BTC is trading above the 50-period EMA, and the MACD just printed a bullish crossover. A decisive 2-hour candlestick closing just above $106,000 would confirm a breakout, with bullish targets at around $107,811 and $108,933. Quick Technical Summary: Current Price: $105,750 Breakout Trigger: Close above $106,000 Upside Levels: $107,811 → $108,933 Support Levels: $105,285 → $104,098 Whether the Truth Social ETF succeeds or not, it introduces a powerful narrative that blends crypto with politics. As the 2024 election cycle ramps up, Bitcoin could become a battleground, not just in markets, but in national policy, too. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.78M Cap as 61% APY Staking Draws Yield Hunters With Bitcoin trading near $105K, investor focus is shifting toward altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . The project has now raised $6,801,303 out of its $7,789,647 cap, leaving less than $1 million before the next token price hike. The current price of $0.002545 is expected to rise once the cap is met. BTC Bull Token links its value directly to Bitcoin through two core mechanisms: BTC Airdrops reward holders, with presale participants receiving priority. Supply Burns occur automatically every time BTC increases by $50,000, reducing $BTCBULL’s circulating supply. The token also features a 61% APY staking pool holding over 1.73 billion tokens, offering: No lockups or fees Full liquidity Stable passive yields, even in volatile markets This staking model appeals to both DeFi veterans and newcomers seeking hands-off income. With just hours left and the hard cap nearly reached, momentum is building fast. BTCBULL ’s blend of Bitcoin-linked value, scarcity mechanics, and flexible staking is fueling strong demand. Early buyers have a limited time to enter before the next pricing tier activates.

Analyst Justin Bennett tells his 115,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may be forming a bear flag pattern and decline more than 7% of its current value. Bearish flag patterns are used in technical analysis to forecast abrupt moves to the downside. They are formed when price consolidates upwards after a strong downtrend, but fails to break a key support level. “Here’s a different perspective of BTC with the same conclusion: April trend line break plus failure to hold $106,600 plus a potential bear flag below resistance. $97,000-$98,000 is the objective. $106,600-$106,800 is my invalidation. Simple.” Source: Justin Bennett/X However, the analyst says Bitcoin may not dip below six figures if the stock market continues to rally, based on BTC’s historic correlation with stocks. “The big wildcard with any bearish crypto stance is the US stock market. Without a pullback there, you have to wonder if we’ll get a further pullback here. Time will tell.” Lastly, the analyst says Bitcoin is flashing bearish based on the whale versus retail delta indicator (WRD), which gauges whether whales or retail traders are more bullish. A higher value means more whales are longer Bitcoin than retail traders. The declining WRD value is bearish for Bitcoin since whales tend to be a better predictor of the market direction. “Not a great sign for Bitcoin. The Hyblock Capital whale versus retail delta was trending sideways to slightly higher, but is back to trending lower again. Translation: whales are once again increasing their BTC short exposure versus retail.” Source: Justin Bennett/X Bitcoin is trading for $105,069 at time of writing, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours.

At the time of writing, the daily crypto trading volume is $92.6 billion, still relatively low. Only one of the top 10 coins per market capitalization is green today, but it’s unchanged. Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 1%, currently trading at $104,891. Ethereum (ETH) also fell 1.3%, now changing hands at $2,609. The category’s best performer is Tron (TRX) , but it has increased by only 0.1%, meaning it’s unchanged. Its price is currently $2,609 At the same time, Dogecoin (DOGE) decreased the most: 3.4% to $0.1896. Moreover, most of the top 100 coins have turned red today. Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) fell the most in this category. It’s now down 9.4% to the price of $1.76. On the other side, six coins are green. Toncoin (TON) appreciated the most: 0.9% to $3.24. Botanix Launches Decentralized Bitcoin Blockchain with 16-Node Founding Federation Botanix Labs , the protocol research team developing the Bitcoin-based blockchain Botanix , announced that the chain officially transitioned to a decentralized federation. Mainnet plans to launch later this quarter. Per the press release, the project has onboarded sixteen independent node operators. Besides Botanix itself, these include Galaxy , Fireblocks , Alchemy , XBTO , Antpool , UTXO Management , Kiln , Chorus One , UndefinedXBlockPI , DAIC , Pier Two , Stakin , Vertex , Stake.fish , and Hashkey Cloud . This means that starting now, no single party—not even Botanix—can unilaterally influence or censor the network. All changes, upgrades, and operational execution will be coordinated across 16 independent entities, geographically spread around the world. — Botanix (@BotanixLabs) June 5, 2025 The team says that, with this launch, Botanix “becomes the first and only Bitcoin-based blockchain that is decentralized from the start.” No single entity can unilaterally influence or control the network, they claim. Botanix Labs is fully removed from all operational responsibilities, handing governance and consensus over to this federation of node operators. Additionally, the founding federation is intentionally distributed geographically with different hardware configurations to eliminate a singular point of failure. The network will soon migrate to a dynamic federation to support hundreds of nodes, says the announcement. The eventual goal is to allow anyone in to run their own Botanix node.

Crypto asset manager Yorkville America Digital, who is sponsoring the fund, filed an S-1 document with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, just two days after filing a 19b-4 document. Typically, issuers upload the S-1, a document used to register an offering of asset-backed securities, first. The listing exchange then files a 19b-4 — necessary to propose a rule change by a self-regulatory organization (SRO), after. But NYSE Arca, an arm of the New York Stock Exchange, uploaded documents before Truth Social filed its own paperwork. While the reasons are unclear, the 19-b4 filing ties the SEC to a strict deadline of 240 days to approve or reject the filing, while the agency doesn’t have to adhere to a deadline when an S-1 is filed. If approved and listed, Trump’s bitcoin ETF would trade under the name Truth Social Bitcoin ETF with its assets being custodied by Foris DAX Trust Company, which also serves as the custodian for Crypto.com’s assets. The fund would join a long list of already existing spot bitcoin ETFs, including from issuers like BlackRock, Grayscale, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, and more. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has become one of the most successful ETF launches in the history of U.S. ETFs, with nearly $70 billion in assets since launch.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/05/trump-s-truth-social-takes-next-step-in-launching-spot-bitcoin-etf,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Policy|Bitcoin ETF|Donald Trump|News",cryptocompare

In the past week, its price decreased by 3.18%, settling between $102,407 and $109,936.19. However, over the last month, it increased by 11.83%. In the past six months, Bitcoin rose by 8.67%, showing a gradual upward trend despite short-term dips. Indicators show mixed signals for Bitcoin’s future. Some suggest the market is neutral, while others indicate it might be oversold, hinting at a possible rebound. Yet, there are signs of bearish momentum that could continue to influence the price. The average price over the past 10 days is slightly higher than the average over the past 100 days, which could mean a short-term upward trend. Bitcoin faces resistance at $114,097. If it breaks this level, it could reach $121,625, gaining about 10%. If the price falls, it may find support at $99,039 or $91,511, which would be a drop of around 5% to 10%. Traders are watching these levels to see where Bitcoin goes next. Conclusion While established coins like Bitcoin are solid, XYZVerse’s unique mix of sports and memes, community focus, and growth plans position it for standout success in the 2025 bull run.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which snapped its latest five-day winning streak on June 4, opened in the green but after 40 minutes of trading turned slightly negative. While the trading showed a lack of upbeat momentum, enthusiasm on Wall Street reflected the news that Trump and Xi talked over the phone. The call, reported by Xinhua , comes just days after Trump claimed China violated a recently agreed trade agreement. Stock markets rallied in April after U.S.-China trade talks in Switzerland. As stocks edged higher following this latest move, Bitcoin ( BTC ) hovered just above $105k. You might also like: JPMorgan to accept Bitcoin ETFs as collateral for loans While Wall Street is eyeing gains that could see major U.S. indexes clock out another winning week, worries around global economic growth persist. Latest to add to the overall downbeat mood is the ADP report on private-sector hiring growth. On Thursday, the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that weekly jobless claims rose for the second consecutive week. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest weekly jump since October 2024. The figure came in above economists’ expectations of 237,000 new claims. In parallel, U.S. worker productivity fell in the first quarter of 2025, driving unit labor costs up 6.6% amid persistent tariff uncertainty. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nonfarm productivity declined at an annualized rate of 1.5% during Q1.

This marks the ECB’s seventh consecutive rate cut, down from a peak of 4% in mid-2023. The ECB’s move follows eurozone inflation data showing a decline to 1.9% in May, below the bank’s 2% target. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has recently criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the Fed’s decision not to cut interest rates.

2025-06-05T14:04:08,"Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Weak in June! Will History Repeat Itself? Here's What Analysts Say","Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies have struggled to provide investors with a clear directional signal amid a historically bearish June, further deepening the slump as inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have slowed. Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies Weak in June: ETF Inflows Slow According to data published by 10x Research, June is generally a mixed or negative month for Bitcoin. Over the past 10 years, BTC's average return this month was recorded as 1.9%, with half of them being positive and half being negative months. Ethereum (ETH) has performed less well: it has only risen in two of the last seven Junes, with an average decline of 11.7%. XRP has performed even worse, while Solana (SOL) has remained relatively more resilient. This weak outlook is also reflected in the waning interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs traded in the U.S. According to SoSoValue data, the ETFs saw net inflows on only two of the last five trading days. ETF inflows remained at $87 million on Wednesday, a sharp drop from Tuesday’s $387 million. Inflows into Ethereum ETFs also fell to $57 million, the lowest since May. “The weakening pace of institutional inflows suggests that we are losing momentum and forces us to remain cautious about the near-term outlook,” said Valentin Fournier, chief research analyst at BRN. However, some analysts are more optimistic. “Despite the seasonal summer lull, structurally positive ground remains. BTC and ETH supply growth rates are now lagging behind global money supply growth, increasing the likelihood of positive price action in the long term. New treasury buyers are absorbing supply,” QCP Capital said. The company also pointed out the relative strength of Ethereum, noting that the ETH-BTC ratio is trading near recent highs. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T14:03:00,"Good News for XRP and DOGE? Coinbase Unveils Wrapped Versions on Base Network","The largest American crypto exchange, Coinbase, has launched wrapped versions of XRP and Dogecoin on its Ethereum-based layer-2 network, Base. According to a series of tweets from the Coinbase Assets X account, the crypto exchange holds 1:1 reserves for the underlying assets of cbXRP and cbDOGE in its custody. cbXRP, cbDOGE Go Live on Base The launch of wrapped tokens for XRP and DOGE will enable cross-chain functionality for the assets. Market participants can now use cbXRP and cbDOGE to interact with applications on the Base network. So far, Coinbase has issued 10.4 million cbDOGE worth approximately $1.88 million per Dogecoin’s price at the time of writing. The exchange has also issued at least 2.3 million cbXRP worth more than $5 million. To prevent scammers from misleading users, Coinbase has provided the Base contract addresses for cbXRP and cbDOGE. cbXRP and cbDOGE have joined the growing list of wrapped assets across the Base network. Coinbase has already issued Wrapped Bitcoin (cbBTC) and Wrapped Ether (cbETH). The company plans to launch similar versions for Cardano (ADA) and Litecoin (LTC) in the coming weeks. Coinbase’s Wins and Challenges Since last year, the exchange has been expanding its market for wrapped tokens, especially after the successful launch of cbBTC. The product went live on Base and Ethereum in mid-September 2024, becoming the third-largest wrapped bitcoin version within a week. It has maintained that position with a market capitalization of at least $4.7 billion, according to data from CoinGecko, trailing behind Binance’s wrapped BTC (BTCB) and BitGo’s product, WBTC. This latest milestone comes shortly after Coinbase joined the S&P 500 stock market index, marking the first time a crypto company has achieved this distinction. The firm has also recently entered into an agreement to acquire Deribit, the largest crypto derivatives platform, for $2.9 billion. While the crypto exchange records new wins, it is also tackling certain challenges. Coinbase faced a massive data breach that affected at least 69,000 users. The incident not only compromised user data and Coinbase’s support infrastructure but also led to a loss of up to $400 million. As the firm tries to handle the situation, it has come under intense scrutiny for failing to disclose the cyberattack when it was first noticed. The post Good News for XRP and DOGE?

2025-06-05T14:00:00,"Galaxy, Fireblocks to Operate Nodes on Bitcoin Layer-2 Botanix","Botanix Labs has onboarded a couple of crypto industry heavyweights as node operators for its bitcoin layer-2 network. Mike Novogratz's digital asset financial services firm Galaxy and crypto custody specialist Fireblocks are among 16 new node operators on Botanix, the company announced on Thursday. The operators have been onboarded and will be live once the Botanix mainnet launches later this quarter. With the creation of a federation of different entities running nodes, Botanix Labs is establishing its eponymous network as ""decentralized from the start."" ""The network will soon migrate to a dynamic federation to support hundreds of nodes, with the eventual goal of allowing anyone in the world to run their own Botanix node,"" Botanix Labs said in Thursday's announcement. Also joining the federation are blockchain developer Alchemy, bitcoin mining pool Antpool and hedge fund manager UTXO Management. Botanix's testnet, known as Aragog , introduced various tools that will form the basis of its decentralized finance (DeFi) offering: BTC-backed stablecoin Palladium, decentralized exchange Bitzy and lending and borrowing market Spindle. Botanix's protocol Spiderchain was built to be compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the software that powers Ethereum. This in theory would make any smart contract or DeFi application on Ethereum compatible with Bitcoin-based Botanix. Developing Bitcoin into a settlement layer for DeFi activity elsewhere in the blockchain world has become a matter of increasing interest among the great and the good of the crypto industry. With BTC's market cap consistently accounting for over 60% of the entire crypto market, developers see the opportunity in harnessing the deep reserves held in BTC to finance applications on networks more technically suited to DeFi, such as Ethereum, Solana or Cardano. At the Dubai Token2049 conference last month Franklin Templeton's managing principal of blockchain venture capital Kevin Farrelly described this as trend as ""infrastructure evolution...not narrative dilution,"" in response to those in the Bitcoin community who believe it dilutes from BTC's core purpose as a store of value. The involvement of the likes of Galaxy and Fireblocks demonstrates that Bitcoin DeFi may become a sector that grows and grows.
