2025-06-05T18:46:37,"California Crypto Bill Rockets Forward, Promising New Protections for Dormant Assets","California is moving to reshape how unclaimed digital assets are handled after the State Assembly unanimously approved Assembly Bill 1052 (AB 1052) on June 3. The bill, which passed 78–0, would update the state’s unclaimed property laws to prevent dormant cryptocurrencies from being automatically liquidated. Instead, assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum would be held in their native form by a licensed custodian designated by the state. The bill now heads to the California Senate for further consideration. New California Bill Protects Dormant Crypto Wallets JUST IN : California Assembly passes bill to regulate Digital Assets under 'Unclaimed Property' law. The bill now moves to the Senate. Law explained: Assets left on an exchange for 3 years will transferred to the state, and can then be claimed by the owner. pic.twitter.com/u9XftO0XRy — Bitcoin Laws (@Bitcoin_Laws) June 4, 2025 The bill only affects digital assets held by third-party custodians such as centralized exchanges or banks. Anyone using self-hosted wallets or holding their private keys directly is entirely excluded from the bill’s reach. Even for custodial accounts, the law applies only after three full years of complete inactivity. That inactivity must meet two strict conditions: the custodian must be unable to establish contact, and the account must show no signs of ownership. Additionally, the clock resets with virtually any user activity. If the account holder logs in, makes a transaction, responds to an email, clicks a verification link, or even contacts the platform about another account, the three-year countdown restarts. These safeguards ensure that genuinely active or intermittently used accounts cannot be deemed abandoned. Once that full period passes with no contact or activity, custodians are required to notify the state and report the asset. However, unlike older forfeiture laws, this legislation mandates that the cryptocurrency be transferred in its native form into the care of a licensed state-appointed custodian. The bill’s provisions also place responsibility on licensed custodians to safeguard these assets, raising new compliance challenges. Questions around key storage, asset verification, and technical protocols are likely to become focal points in Senate deliberations. ‘Not Your Keys’ Gets a Legal Boost The bill also clarifies how digital assets like Bitcoin should be handled when left unclaimed, potentially strengthening the principle of “not your keys, not your coins” by requiring clearer custodial accountability. The legislation arrives as other states also move to define crypto ownership and unclaimed property rights, but with different strategies. Arizona recently enacted House Bill 2749 on May 7, creating a Bitcoin and Digital Assets Reserve Fund. Under the law, digital assets can be held in their native form if unclaimed for three years. Arizona Governor Hobbs signed House Bill 2749 into law, which allows the state to establish a reserve fund to hold unclaimed crypto, airdrops. #Arizona #CryptoBill #UnclaimedCrypto https://t.co/Hhu4wJa2Tm — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 8, 2025 Qualified custodians are authorized to stake or receive rewards on those assets, with earnings deposited into the new state fund. The bipartisan bill, championed by House Commerce Committee Chair Rep. Jeff Weninger, marks one of the first formal crypto reserve initiatives at the state level. Florida has become the latest US state to abandon efforts to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, dealing another setback. #Bitcoin #Reserve https://t.co/kRZo2V0BzE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 6, 2025 Meanwhile, Florida has taken a different path. On May 3, it withdrew two key bills, House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 , intended to establish a Bitcoin reserve. The Florida Senate confirmed both proposals were removed from consideration just one day after the legislative session ended, indicating a pause in the state’s crypto ambitions. Texas is exploring its own frameworks, and Wyoming continues to lead with digital asset-friendly laws . However, the lack of federal clarity still leaves the U.S. with a patchwork of crypto rules.

2025-06-05T18:45:00,"Ordinals price prediction 2025 – 2031: Can ORDI surge 100X?","Key Takeaways: Our Ordinals price prediction anticipates a high of $29.81 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $50.88 and $59.50, with an average price of $52.31. In 2030, it will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. In December 2023, ORDI became the first BRC-20 token to breach $1 billion in market capitalization. Following this achievement, ORDI gained attention from DeFi enthusiasts for its role in innovation. The Ordinals protocol allows data to be embedded directly on Bitcoin’s smallest unit—the Satoshi. ORDI was the first token inscribed on the Ordinals protocol; like Bitcoin, it has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 coins. Currently trading at the $48 mark, investors can’t help but speculate on Ordi’s price trajectory. How high will ORDI go? Can ORDI surge 100x? What will the price of ORDI be in 2030? Let’s explore the ORDI price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Ordinals Symbol ORDI Current price $8.60 Market cap $179.91M 24-hour trading volume $46.8M Circulating supply 21M All-time high $96.17 on Mar 5, 2024 All-time low $2.86 on Sep 11, 2023 24-hour high $8.98 24-hour low $8.50 ORDI price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 12.60% 50-day SMA $9.05 200-day SMA $18.20 Sentiment Bearish Fear and Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green days 15/30 (50%) ORDI price analysis: ORDI moves into consolidation On the day of writing (May 6), ORDI’s price dropped by 3.59% in 24 hours and rose 19.67% in the last thirty days. Its trading volume dropped by 5.87% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. ORDI/USD 1-day chart ORDI/USD 1-day price chart. Source TradingView The Ordinal daily chart shows that ORDI trades below the William alligator trendlines, signaling a bearish market sentiment. The move comes as Bitcoin pulls back from $105,000. The signal and MACD lines of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator are below zero, with the histograms in negative territory signaling a bearish market. At the same time, the relative strength index shows that the price is in neutral territory at 49.94. It is oversold when it drops below 30. ORDI/USD 4-hour chart ORDI/USD 4-hour chart. Image source: TradingView Technical analysis of the 4-hour chart shows that ORDI has reversed from last month’s high at $13.61 and is at $8.90, losing over 20% of its value. Its volatility is dropping on the 4-hour timeframe. ORDI technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 8.13 BUY SMA 5 8.59 BUY SMA 10 9.52 SELL SMA 21 9.97 SELL SMA 50 9.05 SELL SMA 100 9.27 SELL SMA 200 18.20 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 9.38 SELL EMA 5 8.97 SELL EMA 10 8.40 BUY EMA 21 8.39 BUY EMA 50 9.99 SELL EMA 100 14.31 SELL EMA 200 21.18 SELL What to expect from ORDI price analysis next? ORDI is bearish at current levels, with the fear and greed index showing greed among investors. On the charts, it is consolidating after correcting from the month’s high. Recent news: Ordinals can now bridge to Cardano Cardano has continued to advance as a venue for Bitcoin Defi, facilitating a transfer of Ordinals to its mainnet. The transaction between Bitcoin and Cardano was facilitated by BitVMX, an interoperability protocol built using the BitVM programming language and unveiled at the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas. Why is ORDI down? ORDI is in a bear run this year. The drop in the ORDI value could be attributed to the market’s correction from the bull run in the last quarter of 2024. Will ORDI recover? ORDI is trading at its lowest this year and is ripe for a reversal. It should recover in the coming months. Will ORDI reach $50? Yes, ORDI should rise above $50 in 2027. The move will come as the market recovers to previous highs. Will ORDI reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, ORDI will reach $100 in 2029 and reach a maximum price of $130.84. Will ORDI reach $1,000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that ORDI will get to $1,000 before 2030. What is the prediction for Ordi in 2030? According to the 2030 Ordinals price prediction, they will range between $154.84 and $186.05, with an average price of $160.42. What is the Sats ordinal price prediction for 2050? When we extrapolate Ordi’s price predictions, we find that it is likely to reach a high of $421 in 2050. Does ORDI have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ORDI will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is ORDI a good investment? ORDI had the first-mover advantage on the Ordinals protocol. ORDI, like Bitcoin, has a capped supply of 21 million coins and should, therefore, become scarce over time. Our Cryptopolitan Price Prediction shows how the coin will gain value in the years to come. Ordinals price prediction June 2025 The Ordinals forecast for June is a maximum price of $9.01 and a minimum price of $6.25. The average trading price will be $7.02.

Note that the predictions are not investment advice. Seek independent consultation or do your research. ORDI’s historic price sentiment ORDI price history. Source: CoinStats According to CoinMarketCap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $8 in May.",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ordinals-price-prediction/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI","Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T18:41:31,"Former DOGE Head Elon Musk Tells Lawmakers To Kill Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful’ Bill","After stepping down from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Elon Musk is publicly attacking the President’s “big, beautiful” bill. In a post on the social media platform X, the platform which he owns, Musk urges Americans to contact their representatives to prevent Trump’s plan from “bankrupting America.” “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.” According to Musk , Trump’s highly self-touted economic plan is a “disgusting abomination.” “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.” Furthermore, Musk says the shortcomings of Trump’s bill are significant enough to require the entire document to be redrafted. “A new spending bill should be drafted that doesn’t massively grow the deficit and increase the debt ceiling by 5 TRILLION DOLLARS.” Musk’s opposition to a budget plan that increases the debt ceiling should come as little surprise. The former DOGE head has long publicly stated that America’s growing debt will ultimately lead to financial ruin. “DOGE has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.” According to a NBC News report, during a bilateral meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump had the following to say about his former ally : “I’m very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill. I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot… Elon’s upset because we took the EV (electric vehicle) mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles and they’re having a hard time with electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy. Elon knew this from the beginning.” However, according to Musk, Trump wouldn’t even be president without him. “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-06-05T18:39:13,"XRP holds key support: is a new bullish trend forming?","XRP is currently holding firm at a critical technical zone, defying broader market weakness. With volume poised to return and support levels stacking up, could this mark the beginning of a bullish continuation? Despite market-wide consolidation and uncertainty, XRP ( XRP ) has maintained its footing at a crucial support level. A combination of high-timeframe support, trend line confluence, and the 200-day moving average is creating a foundation for a potential bullish structure. All eyes are now on volume, the missing ingredient that could fuel XRP’s next move. Key technical points Support Confluence: XRP is holding at the intersection of a key trend line, high-timeframe support, and the 200 moving average – a rare triple-layered support structure. Volume Profile Decline: A noticeable volume drop suggests accumulation; a volume influx is likely and may lead to a sharp breakout. I mpulsive Breakout Candle: The recent trend line break was backed by an impulsive candle, establishing a local high and validating early bullish acceptance. XRPUSDT (4H) Chart, Source: TradingView XRP’s current consolidation at support is more than just a pause, it’s a potential base. Price is respecting a long-term trend line that intersects perfectly with high-timeframe horizontal support and the 200-day moving average, forming a strong technical confluence. This level has consistently held across multiple timeframes, and recent price behavior confirms that bulls are actively defending the zone. Adding to the case for bullish continuation, the volume profile shows a significant decline during this retest. This low-volume environment is often indicative of accumulation, a phase that typically precedes expansion, especially when paired with structural strength. Once volume returns, price often moves decisively in the direction of the dominant trend, in this case, upward. You might also like: Buyers are winning big in BlockDAG while Solaxy hits $43M and BTC bull raises $6.7M The recent breakout above the trend line was confirmed by an impulsive candle that printed a new local high. Price is now undergoing a bullish retest of that breakout zone. If this retest holds and forms a higher low, it will solidify a new bullish market structure and open the door to a move toward the swing high and potentially beyond. What to expect in the coming price action If XRP maintains support and volume re-enters the market, expect a continuation toward recent highs. A confirmed higher low in the current retest zone will signal a structural shift and the potential start of a new rally. Until volume returns, however, the risk of continued sideways price action remains.

On June 4, experienced crypto trader Bob Paulus shared a pessimistic outlook on WIF, pointing to a clear downtrend in its daily market structure.

Memecoins crashes more than 10% on the week/ Source: CoinMarketCap Solana Slips Toward $150—What That Means for $WIF and Other Memecoins Solana’s struggles often dictate the fate of its memecoins, and right now, the signs are worrying. With SOL down more than 12% in the past week and hovering near $150, concerns are growing.

On the other hand, roughly 166,000 wallets were completely wiped out, including one high-profile trader who lost over $1 million. These trends suggest deepening pessimism in the memecoin market. As Solana struggles, the tokens built on it face mounting pressure, leaving traders to question whether the downturn will continue or if a reversal is imminent. “Summer Price Action Is Trash”: Top Binance Trader Goes All-In on Shorts Matter Trades, currently ranked #2 on Binance’s perpetuals leaderboard, isn’t betting on a turnaround.

After rallying to nearly $1.50 in May, the price has since retraced to around $0.86. $WIF price prediction/ Source: TradingView The correction appears to be unfolding in a classic A-B-C pattern, with the price now heading from point (B) toward a potential low at point (C). Support between $0.65 and $0.70, shown by previous breakout levels, could provide a temporary floor. Unless $WIF sees a strong reversal with rising volume and reclaims the $1.00 mark, the outlook remains bearish.

2025-06-05T18:26:06,"PTSD-Afflicted Crypto Investors Hit the Sell Button After Circle's Euphoric IPO","Is it 2021 all over again? Circle (CRCL) debuted to wild upside action on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, its shares more than tripling from the IPO price of $31. The event was the culmination of a long journey for the USDC stablecoin issuer, which had been pursuing an IPO for several years. For the crypto industry, it’s certainly a win — a sign of strong traditional investor demand and that under the Trump administration, crypto native firms really do have a path to going public. But cryptocurrencies themselves weren’t enthused. Bitcoin BTC slid more than 2% to $102,800, its weakest level in about a month, while the CoinDesk 20 (an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization except for stablecoins, memecoins and exchange coins) fell over 3%. Leading the selloff are tokens such as SOL, AVAX and AAVE, all lower by roughly 6%. It’s too early to tell whether the downtrend will persist in the short, medium or long term, but for industry veterans, it’s hard not to see shades of another crypto IPO — that of Coinbase (COIN), which took place on April 14, 2021 and marked a then-epic top of $65,000 for bitcoin. Roughly two months following the COIN debut, bitcoin had plunged nearly 60% to about the $28,000 level. A sharp autumn bounce in prices did have bitcoin again re-claiming that $65,000 level, but the selling quickly took hold once again. A brutal bear market ensued through late 2021 and throughout 2022, with bitcoin ultimately bottoming at around $15,000. Bitcoin wouldn't reclaim a fresh record price until March 2024, nearly three years after the Coinbase IPO.

Zeberg tells his 182,800 followers on the social media platform X that the altseason, when altcoins outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ), is just getting started, and massive alt breakouts are likely to occur in the coming days. He says the Ethereum ( ETH /BTC) ratio is flashing bullish for altcoins, after increasing since tapping a local low in late April. Analysts often use the ETH/BTC ratio as an indicator of potential altcoin seasons. “Altseason has already started. First slowly, later in a more explosive manner. I think we are max three to eight days away from the beginning of that explosive phase. ETH/BTC ratio tells us why… It is close to setting off in the explosive phase!” ETH/BTC is trading for 0.02478 BTC ($2,595) at time of writing. Zeberg suggests that certain altcoins will start breaking out at different times. “In the altseason it will be about identifying the next altcoin which is about to skyrocket. And then have an idea of how far it may run.” Among the alts the economist believes will soon print new all-time highs is Solana ( SOL )-based memecoin dogwifhat ( WIF ). “I maintain my extreme Bullish perspective on WIF.” In January, he suggested WIF could eventually hit $19. WIF is trading for $0.86 at time of writing, down 9.9% in the last 24 hours. Zeberg is also bullish on the Internet of Things (IoT) project Jasmy ( JASMY ). The analyst uses the Elliott Wave theory to forecast a massive run for altcoins. The theory states that an asset tends to witness a five-wave rally with wave three being the longest and the strongest move up. “Ready for Jasmy’s takeoff? We seem to be getting closer to the wave two bottom, little lower. Wave three should take Jasmy much much higher.” Jasmy is trading for $0.01413 at time of writing, down 4.8% on the day.

With crypto and blockchain adoption on the rise, Keeta Network ( KTA ) has announced the upcoming launch of PASS, a verified financial identity platform. The initiative is a collaboration between Keeta and SOLO, a credit data infrastructure provider, according to a press release published on June 5. According to the Keeta team, the PASS platform is designed as a bank-grade, blockchain-native credit bureau with features including Know Your Customer, Know Your Business, and verifiable credentials for income and crypto asset holdings. These tools are intended to allow banks and lenders to extend services to crypto-native users by leveraging PASS’s on-chain visibility to underwrite credit. “As digital asset adoption accelerates, Keeta’s blockchain is the first to tackle the scale and regulatory overhead for an on-chain credit bureau, opening the door for lending, borrowing, mortgages, stablecoin payments, and more,” Ty Schenk, chief executive officer and founder of Keeta, said in a statement. Schenk emphasized that PASS is built to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem.

2025-06-05T17:58:50,"Stablecoins Spark AI-Agent Payment Boom, $140B Windfall in Sight","The stablecoin market is currently valued at over $140 billion, but could see substantial growth as new use cases emerge. When combined with artificial intelligence (AI)—another billion-dollar market—stablecoins could quickly rise in demand. This will likely be the case, as a recent trend the Web3 sector is witnessing is the combination of stablecoins and AI-agents. Rebecca Liao, CEO of Layer-1 network Saga, told Cryptonews that autonomous payments and transactions are perhaps the most direct and widespread use case. “AI agents are being designed to make payments, settle transactions, and manage funds on behalf of users or even autonomously,” Liao said. “A recent example of this is Mastercard’s Agent Pay and Visa’s Intelligent Commerce platform, allowing verified AI-agents to make tokenized payments.” #Stablecoins , meet 150M+ checkout counters.

Illia Otychenko, lead analyst at CEX.IO, believes that stablecoins are a missing link for AI-agents. He noted that stablecoins are capable of addressing several issues that AI-agents may face when performing financial transactions without human support. “Stablecoins typically operate in networks that don’t rely on user expectations or behavior to confirm transactions,” Otychenko said. “Furthermore, bots already play a key role in this space. In 2024, bots accounted for 70% of all stablecoin transfer volume, and this trend has continued into 2025. These networks and infrastructures are already designed with machines in mind.” Otychenko explained that traditional payment rails are human-centric, where a human user exists at one or both ends of a transaction. However, he pointed out that AI-driven transactions don’t resemble this process. Echoing this, Jesse Shrader—co-founder of Bitcoin payment platform Amboss—told Cryptonews that AI agents require a digital form of value to transact, and traditional payment systems simply don’t work in these instances. “Traditional payments like wires, ACH, and card payments don’t scale for micropayments and take too long to settle. Stablecoin payments are better positioned to have rapid settlement, which work within the timeframes of AI queries,” Shrader said. Otychenko added that the combination of stablecoins and AI-agents has the most potential for use cases like micropayments, subscriptions, and investment activities such as arbitrage, liquidity provision, or portfolio rebalancing. “These transactions are fee and value sensitive, making predictability paramount,” he said. “Moreover, using altcoins instead of stablecoins would require hedging against price volatility, introducing an inefficient and unnecessary layer.” How Stablecoins Allow AI-Agents To Transact Although this is still an emerging concept, a few use cases are being applied today. Erik Reppel, head of engineering at Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP), told Cryptonews that stablecoins allow AI-agents the ability to transact instantly, globally, and autonomously—without human intervention. For example, Reppel explained that CDP recently introduced “x402.” This is an open standard that leverages the original HTTP “402 Payment Required” status code . The x402 standard from CDP embeds stablecoin payments directly into web integrations. “Tools like x402 enable agents to pay for data, APIs, and services,” Reppel said. “And because stablecoins are programmable, they come with powerful built-in security primitives—like signed intents and scoped approvals – that will be critical as agents scale their autonomy and capabilities.” While x402 only recently went live, Reppel explained that the standard is already being leveraged. For instance, he shared that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is exploring how x402 could be used for paid compute. This could be a game changer, as statistics show the global Cloud Computing Market is expected to reach $1902.66 billion by 2030. This growth is being driven by the increasing adoption of advanced technologies like AI and machine learning (ML). Reppel added that the decentralized compute and AI-as-a-Service platform Heurist is using x402 to pay for deep research. Web3 file storage platform Pinata is also using x402 to pay per file stored . 1/ Ever wondered why every internet service needs API keys and subscriptions? Why users can't just… pay for things? We launched Heurist Deep Research using @coinbase 's groundbreaking x402 protocol. Here's how we built it pic.twitter.com/mCGstwkbKQ — Heurist (@heurist_ai) June 2, 2025 “We’ve seen solo developers build everything from monetized music playlists to research bots that pay per article. It’s still early, but the momentum is real—x402 is unlocking a whole new class of apps and agents that can pay as they go,” Reppel said. AI-Agents Integrate Stablecoins With The Lightning Network Shrader pointed out that the next wave of AI-agents may also see an integration with stablecoins on the Bitcoin Lightning Network . “Tether’s recent announcement of issuing USDT on the Lightning Network signals a shift away from crypto’s everything-on-the-blockchain mindset to unbounded scalability through Lightning’s off-chain scaling,” he stated. Shrader added that the Lightning Network already maintains the “ L402 protocol ,” which provides a universal HTTP-based payment flow. According to the L402 protocol document, this combines the strengths of Macaroons for better authentication with the strengths of the Lightning Network for better payments. Macaroons are described as “bearer authentication tokens.” Shrader shared that Amboss, along with a handful of other companies, are already combining the Lightning Network and AI in anticipation of stablecoin issuance on the Lightning Network. A Financial Institution Powered Entirely By AI In addition to HTTP payment flows, Circle co-founder and Catena Labs CEO Sean Neville recently launched a project that seeks to create a financial institution powered entirely by AI. Neville said in a news release that AI agents will soon conduct most economic transactions. Catena Labs will therefore use its recent $18 million led by a16z crypto to develop the “first fully regulated AI-native financial institution (FI). ” Catena Labs further remarked that while AI-agents can use traditional systems and financial rails, stablecoins should be viewed as “AI-native money.” The company mentioned that regulated stablecoins like USDC allow near-instant, low-cost, global transactions, which are essential for agents. Challenges To Consider While there is huge potential behind stablecoins and AI-agents, a number of challenges remain. Reppel believes that the biggest challenge with agentic payments is making sure agents act accordingly. He thinks that stablecoins can help ensure this. “Stablecoins are natively programmable, which makes it easy to add guardrails like spend limits or keeping a human in the loop,” he said. Yet Reppel commented that the tradeoff for this type of programmability is that it introduces a wallet, which can be tricky to implement or secure properly. Liao further told Cryptonews that fragmentation, regulatory uncertainty, and on-and-off ramp limitations are problematic. Liao explained that Saga is addressing these challenges in different ways. For example, she elaborated that Saga has a “chainlet infrastructure” tool that provides infinite horizontal scalability and dedicated blockspace for applications. “This is crucial for AI agents, as it means they won’t be bogged down by network congestion or unpredictable gas fees, allowing them to execute high-frequency transactions with stablecoins reliably,” she said. Additionally, Saga has built a “Liquidity Integration Layer” designed to create a unified liquidity environment across different blockchain ecosystems. This is meant to facilitate seamless and automated asset movement. “For AI agents, this means they can more easily access and utilize stablecoins from various sources and move them where needed without complex bridging,” Liao said. Challenges aside, stablecoin and AI-agent use cases are expected to thrive. Reppel commented that on-chain tools that handle key management can make it easier for developers to build safe and reliable agentic systems. “In short, these challenges are being solved with tools that bridge AI and Web3, making them more accessible, intuitive, and developer-friendly,” Reppel said.

The site is said to have trafficked in millions of stolen credit cards and personally identifiable information. The operation, which was unveiled on June 5 by the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, was carried out in collaboration with the US Secret Service and FBI. Seized domains now divert to law enforcement-controlled servers. BidenCash Enabled Widespread Data Theft Launched in March 2022, BidenCash quickly became a hub for cybercrime activity with over 117,000 users. It facilitated the sale of over 15 million payment card numbers and personally identifiable information that were stolen. As a promotional effort from October 2022 to February 2023, the site gave away 3.3 million stolen card records for free—an aggressive marketing tactic aimed at attracting new customers. Authorities estimate the marketplace generated more than $17 million in illicit revenue. Crypto Assets Also Targeted Along with the domain seizures, US officials obtained court permission to seize cryptocurrency assets linked to the operations of BidenCash. The amount of cryptocurrency seized was not disclosed. The operation was led by the Frankfurt Resident Office of the US Secret Service, its Cyber Investigative Section, and the Albuquerque Field Office of the FBI. Officials stated that the operation is part of a sustained effort to dismantle crypto-enabled criminal networks across the dark web. BidenCash Added to the Growing List of Takedowns The BidenCash shutdown follows Operation RapTor, a massive dark web crackdown in May that brought down various drug trafficking websites. That effort led to 270 arrests in 10 countries and the seizure of around $200 million in assets, much of it in cryptocurrency. Earlier in March, US officials sanctioned Nemesis darknet marketplace operators, another closed-down darknet market. The assets sanctioned were 44 Bitcoin and five Monero addresses that had collectively received over $850,000 between 2022 and 2024. Darknet Market Activity Surging Dark markets generated $1.7 billion in revenue in 2024, a modest year-on-year increase, per TRM Labs’ 2025 Crypto Crime Report. The report notes that Russian-language markets dominate the sector, in great part due to the fact that there is no expectation of Russian law enforcement cracking down on them.

2025-06-05T17:13:35,"Donald Trump’s Truth Social Advances with Bitcoin ETF S-1 Filing","Truth Social, a social media company linked to President Donald Trump, is boldly moving towards crypto investment. The company has filed a critical S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing, announced on June 5, aims to launch a Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). Truth Social wants to offer investors a new, regulated way to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) through a fund. Truth Social Awaits SEC Approval The filing reveals that Truth Social plans for its Bitcoin ETF to be supported mainly by real Bitcoin. A company named Foris DAX, which acts as the fund’s custodian, will keep these Bitcoins safe. Another company, Yorkville America, is the sponsor responsible for managing the ETF. However, the filing did not provide some key information, such as the ticker symbol, the amount of money that will start the fund, or the price for each share. This SEC filing came after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca submitted a related form called a 19b-4 on June 4. This is essential in getting permission to list and trade the ETF shares on the stock exchange. Now, regulators will review these applications to decide if they will approve the ETF. Truth Social’s Bitcoin ETF Eyes Real BTC Backing Truth Social’s Bitcoin ETF aims to closely follow the price of the flagship crypto. This fund will allow large investors, such as institutions, to invest in Bitcoin in a more traditional and regulated way without buying the digital coin directly. This is similar to other Bitcoin ETFs that hold real Bitcoin, not just futures or contracts. Truth Social hopes this fund will attract investors who want to invest in Bitcoin but prefer the safety and ease of an investment fund product. Truth Social’s ETF To Join A Competitive Market Experts in the finance industry have noticed Truth Social’s move into the Bitcoin ETF space. In a recent post on X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said this filing is unusual because it is linked to a company connected to a U.S. president. This connection gives the ETF a unique profile. However, Balchunas noted that Truth Social’s crypto fund will compete in a market already full of Bitcoin ETFs. Many of these existing ETFs have low fees and attract many investors, making it hard for Truth Social’s ETF to stand out, even with its unique political connection. This ETF filing comes as President Donald Trump’s involvement in cryptocurrency has faced criticism and controversy. This may further add some challenges to this new project.

2025-06-05T17:05:55,"About 31% of Kenyan banks are open to start facilitating crypto deals","Nearly a third of Kenyan banks are set to start facilitating crypto deals. The interest was sparked by the government’s intentions to legalize and regulate crypto amidst increasing illicit activities. The report came out of a survey done by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK). According to the survey, commercial and microfinance banks said that the assets could provide potential opportunities in enhancing financial access to the unbanked. “31% of the respondents indicated that they were highly likely to undertake activities in the area of virtual assets,” CBK’s Innovation Survey says. The report also indicated that they were “highly likely” to undertake activities in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as non-fungible tokens(NFTs) and digital tokens. The findings signal a shifting view of banks about virtual assets on the back of increased use across sectors such as finance, entertainment, real estate, and art. This report comes after the US banks consequently dealt with debanking. Also, as reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan will start counting crypto assets in some clients’ net worth calculations, putting Bitcoin and other digital holdings in the same category as stocks, cars, and artwork. Kenyan banks emphasize the need for a regulatory framework According to the United Nations Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the government has seen a lot of potential in the crypto market. There are about four million users of crypto in the country. The report states, “Most financial institutions (35 percent) emphasized the need for regulatory frameworks governing digital innovation. This includes areas such as digital lending, open banking, application programming interfaces standardization, digital identity blockchain, virtual assets including crypto assets, and digital-only banking.” Kenya was put on the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list” in 2014 because it didn’t have a clear plan for prosecuting money laundering crimes, among other things. Another problem was that no rules were in place to monitor and control how crypto was used. However, recently, the government moved to regulate the sector through the Virtual Asset Service Providers Bill 2025. This law requires crypto companies that do business in the country to set up local offices and hire directors, but only after getting approval from regulators like the Capital Markets Authority (CMA). Crypto taxes reduced by half In addition, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has also said that it will create a new tax system that includes real-time tracking of crypto transactions. This is so that the government can use the local crypto sector to catch tax cheats and criminals. At the same time, the government has tried to encourage people to use crypto. The National Treasury is cutting the 3% tax on the sale of digital assets that was put in place in 2023 by half, to 1.5%, in the 2025 Finance Bill.

For the first time in history, the bank will also factor crypto holdings into net worth and liquid asset calculations equating digital assets to stocks, property, and pieces of fine art in qualifying for loans. The risk model is conservative: only regulated, liquid ETFs like BlackRock's IBIT meet the cut. The collateral values will be marked to market on a daily basis, and JPMorgan will require healthy loan-to-value ratios, the same way it does for equities. It de-risks but allows clients to leverage their crypto exposure without having to give up their assets. “JPMorgan will begin accepting shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) as collateral for loans... putting them on par with traditional securities like stocks.” — @CoinDesk Why Now? Wall Street, Politics, and the ETF Boom JPMorgan's U-turn comes as investor and political pressure grows. President Trump's administration easing crypto regulation, and spot Bitcoin ETFs managing a record $128 billion in assets, banks can no longer ignore customer demand for exposure to digital. JPMorgan's famously crypto-skeptical CEO Jamie Dimon recently caved: ”I don't think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.” Wealth management firms are seeing a wave of clients agreeing to use Bitcoin ETF shares to access liquidity, especially as such ETFs like IBIT have surged 138% since their approval by the SEC in January 2024. Feature JPMorgan Goldman Sachs Collateral Accepted Spot Bitcoin ETF shares (e.g., IBIT) Direct Bitcoin holdings, select crypto assets Loan Clients Trading & wealth management, global Institutional (e.g., Coinbase), high-net-worth Risk Controls Daily mark-to-market, conservative LTV, regulated ETFs only 24-hour risk management, direct crypto custody Crypto Integration Scope Net worth/liquidity calculations include crypto ETF holdings Expanding to tokenized assets and blockchain lendingShareExportRewrite The action also puts JPMorgan squarely in contention with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley repo desks, which have now begun adding crypto ETFs to their own trading and lending businesses. Turbocharging ETF Liquidity Through using ETF shares as collateral, JPMorgan can boost spot Bitcoin ETF liquidity and trading volumes. The analysts feel that this would make ETFs even more attractive to institutions considering the reality that clients would be in a position to use their holdings to finance leverage.”. This action is already challenging the difference between mainstream finance and crypto, as Bitcoin Magazine indicates: ”JPMorgan just made Bitcoin ETF shares mainstream collateral.”. The lines between TradFi and crypto are officially blurred.” The sentiment is echoed by fintech analyst Frank Chaparro, who remarked, “Jamie Dimon: ‘I defend your right to buy Bitcoin.’ JPMorgan: ‘We’ll lend against it.’ Wild times.” For many in the industry, this is a clear signal that Wall Street is not just tolerating crypto — it’s actively integrating it into the core mechanics of global finance. The news has also created a furor of discussion among traders and institutional investors. All of them see JPMorgan's action as an accelerator that will turbocharge ETF liquidity and motivate other big banks to join the bandwagon. With assets under management of Bitcoin ETF increasing, the ability to trade these shares as collateral is going to drive more volume, tighter spreads, and increasing usage of crypto-backed financial products. The bottom line: JPMorgan's use of Bitcoin ETF shares as collateral is a watershed moment for both Wall Street and crypto. By satisfying the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, the bank is improving ETF liquidity while opening the door to wider institutional acceptance of crypto as an acceptable financial tool.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9456/jp-morgan-to-accept-bitcoin-etf-shares-for-loans,"BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Announcements",cryptocompare

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solaxy’s $45 million presale, BTC Bull’s giveaways, and BDAG’s Buyer Battles make waves in crypto. Table of Contents Buyer battles are minting daily BDAG millionaires Why the Solaxy token presale ends upfront winners Bitcoin milestones are fueling the BTC bull presale Don’t just watch, win with BlockDAG What do Solaxy (SOLX) token buyers and BTC Bull presale participants have in common? They’re not waiting around. Solaxy’s presale is closing in on $45m as it gears up to become Solana’s first Layer-2. BTC Bull is giving out Bitcoin for free to holders as BTC hits new milestones, and it’s already raised over $6.7m. Meanwhile, the real-time action is happening at BlockDAG (BDAG), where one bold move can win someone millions of BDAG in a single day. Buyer Battles are flipping the game, no luck, no referrals, just the biggest purchase of the day takes home what’s left of a 150m BDAG prize pool. And with BDAG still at just $0.0018, this is the lowest price it’ll ever be. It’s arguably one of the best crypto presales to be in right now. With the June 13 GO LIVE event closing in, every day that passes is a chance missed. You might also like: Integrating LI.FI into banking APIs for blockchain-powered transactions Buyer battles are minting daily BDAG millionaires Every day, someone is winning millions of BDAG tokens, just by making the biggest buy. BlockDAG’s Buyer Battles reset every 24 hours and set aside 150 million BDAG for one winner. No referrals, no waiting for luck, just the highest single purchase of the day walks away with what’s left of the bonus pool. And with presale activity rising fast, these overnight wins are getting bigger. Don’t watch this opportunity pass by. Make a move while it lasts! The current BDAG price is just $0.0018, the lowest it’ll ever be before listings hit. Over 21.9 billion BDAG have already been sold, with more than $287 million raised. That’s not small interest, it’s heavy buying from people who know what they’re doing. And with the GO LIVE event confirmed for June 13, this window is closing fast. What makes this the best crypto presale right now isn’t just the low price. It’s the mechanics. Tokens can 2x through the Double Up offer, available to buyers who reinvest 50% of their original purchase. And they can stack even more by winning a Buyer Battle. It’s one of the few presales where early action pays in real time, every single day. Whether using the mobile-friendly X1 miner or scaling up to the powerful X100 ASIC, BlockDAG has the hardware and ecosystem to back its momentum. The best crypto presale right now is the one rewarding bold moves before the market even opens. Why the Solaxy token presale ends upfront winners The token is positioning itself as Solana’s first Layer-2, with a dual-chain model that brings in Ethereum’s strengths too. The presale ends June 16, and over $43.4m has already been raised. At the current rate of $0.001744 per token, buyers are stacking in bulk ahead of its planned listings. With staking rewards hitting 94% APY and the first tools like the block explorer already live, the early ecosystem is already taking shape. There’s a clear push behind this project: a total supply of 138 billion tokens, solid tokenomics with 30% for development and 25% for rewards, and a roadmap that includes a DEX and a no-code launchpad. Predictions put the Solaxy token at $0.00879 by the end of 2025, with long-term forecasts crossing $0.05 in a few years. That makes now a strong entry point before the presale closes and price discovery kicks in. Bitcoin milestones are fueling the BTC bull presale The BTC Bull presale is built around a simple idea, reward holders in actual Bitcoin as BTC crosses key price levels. With milestones set at $150k, $200k, and $250k, buyers are positioning early to collect those airdrops. The presale has already raised over $6.7 million, with the current token price sitting at $0.002545. Add a 61% staking APY and regular token burns when BTC hits other benchmarks like $125k and $175k, and there’s plenty of incentive to hold long-term. Running on Ethereum and fully audited by Coinsult and SolidProof, BTC Bull offers simple entry options through ETH, USDT, or card via Best Wallet. The presale runs until June 30, so the window to get in early is still open. Forecasts expect the token to hit $0.0076 by the end of 2025 and $0.0151 by 2026. Don’t just watch, win with BlockDAG Solaxy token buyers are stacking in ahead of the June 16 presale close, with over $43 million already raised and strong forecasts ahead. Meanwhile, the BTC Bull presale is giving out real Bitcoin as rewards, with airdrops and token burns tied to BTC milestones, plus a 61% APY for staking. But while both projects are building momentum, BlockDAG is rewarding action daily. Its Buyer Battles give away up to 150 million BDAG every 24 hours, no luck needed, just the biggest buy wins. At just $0.0018, BDAG is at its lowest entry point, and with GO LIVE reveal on June 13, prices are set to change. Investors who are still watching from the sidelines may be missing what could be the best crypto presale right now. With bold buyers already winning millions daily, this is a shot to multiply holdings before the market even opens. Don’t wait, jump in or miss out.

Pal’s first chart looks at the US labor force participation rate against the inverted chart for US government debt as a percentage of GDP. Source: Raoul Pal/X His second chart looks at U.S. Federal Reserve net liquidity compared to the normal chart for US government debt as a percentage of GDP. Source: Raoul Pal/X Pal says the charts highlight a serious macroeconomic challenge, and the end result will be currency debasement. “At over 100% of GDP in debt there isn’t enough economic cash flow to fund the debt growth, so it gets ‘printed’ via Fed Net Liquidity and also forced, via regulation, onto the balance sheet of the banks. That debases the currency and lowers the denominator, optically making scarce assets more valuable. Crypto (mainly Bitcoin) is the life raft as it not only offsets the annual 8% debasement but also gains value due to adoption effects.” In the long run, Pal says he believes artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics will improve the dilemma and play a key role in mitigating the pressures of aging demographics.

2025-06-05T16:49:37,"Binance Research: RWA Token Market Hits $23B as Private Credit Leads 260% Surge in H1 2025","The tokenized real-world asset (RWA) sector has witnessed huge growth in 2025, according to new findings from Binance Research, authored by Moulik Nagesh, Joshua Wong, Michael JJ, and Asher Lin Jiayong. In just the first half of the year, the RWA market has ballooned from $8.6 billion to over $23 billion—a massive 260% surge. This expansion shows a dramatic shift in how traditional financial assets are being integrated into the blockchain sector. Tokenized Private Credit Takes the Lead Driving this explosive growth is tokenized private credit, which now represents a dominant 58% of the total RWA market . This asset class has outpaced even tokenized U.S. Treasuries, which hold an estimated 34% market share. The appeal of private credit lies in its yield-generating potential and growing demand from DeFi-native and institutional investors seeking alternatives to saturated lending protocols. Time to look at June's market insights! Discover the current market landscape and key insights on: Spot ETF Flows Corporate BTC Treasuries Sector Divergence Tokenized RWAs …and more. Read here https://t.co/XItAOGvn5O — Binance Research (@BinanceResearch) June 5, 2025 According to the report, a standout contributor in this category is Tradable, a protocol built on ZKSync Era that launched in January 2025. Tradable has already tokenized more than US$2 billion in assets, becoming a clear front-runner in the race to bridge TradFi and DeFi. Its meteoric rise reflects both product-market fit and a growing appetite for tokenized debt instruments among investors and protocols. DeFi Integration Shows Maturity A major development in the RWA space is its increasing integration with decentralized finance. The BlackRock BUIDL fund , now the largest tokenized treasury product with $2.9 billion in assets (up from $649 million at the start of the year), recently launched its first direct DeFi integration through Euler Finance. This allows users to lend and borrow directly against tokenized treasury assets, introducing a new era of composability and utility for on-chain financial products. Other players, such as Centrifuge and Securitize, have launched tokenized funds on the Solana blockchain, connecting with DeFi platforms like Kamino Finance. These integrations improve liquidity and accessibility, allowing RWAs to serve as a reliable source of yield and helping DeFi evolve from a self-contained ecosystem into a more robust and externally linked financial system. A Broader Bull Market Boost According to the report, the growth of tokenized RWAs also coincides with a broader bullish trend in crypto markets. In May 2025, the overall crypto market rose by 10.3% despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of US$5.2 billion, the strongest since late 2024, helping Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of around US$112K. This rally was bolstered by stablecoin legislation progress in both the U.S. and Hong Kong, as well as growing corporate treasury adoption. With 116 public companies now holding over 809,000 BTC, and firms starting to cautiously diversify into ETH, SOL, and XRP, the market is showing signs of increasing maturity. While Gaming and Layer 2 sectors lagged, DeFi surged by 19% in May, reflecting a rotation of capital into yield-bearing sectors—like RWAs. According to Binance Research, the fusion of RWAs with DeFi could be a defining narrative of this cycle, offering a scalable and sustainable model for blockchain-based finance.

2025-06-05T16:47:35,"On-Chain Data Signals ‘Buy the Dip’ as Bitcoin Hashrate Hits New Highs","Bitcoin (BTC) is down almost 7% from its all-time high (ATH), and on-chain signals are flashing a buying opportunity. According to Darkfost, a pseudonymous analyst at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, this buy signal is coming from the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons indicator. This metric tracks the Bitcoin hashrate and is used to identify potential entry points during a market correction. Is it Time to Buy the Dip? The Hash Ribbon monitors Bitcoin mining activity and tells when miners are under stress or capitulating by comparing the 30-day and 60-day moving averages of the hashrate. Miner capitulation refers to a period when miners shut down their hardware and sell off their coin reserves to remain afloat because BTC has fallen below a certain price. On most occasions, the capitulation coincides with the hashrate recovery. The hashrate metric tells how much computational power is required to solve complex math problems and approve transactions on the Bitcoin network. During this period of recovery, mining becomes more difficult. Market experts say buying BTC during miner capitulation yields significant returns, and the best buy signals are seen during hashrate recoveries. Recently, Bitcoin’s hashrate has been reaching new highs, with the latest being 1.016 billion TH/S. The network’s mining difficulty also surged past 126 trillion during the last adjustment on May 30. “We recently got a new buy signal from the Hash Ribbons indicator. This metric helps us assess the level of stress in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. It’s not a big surprise considering that the hashrate has recently reached new all-time highs,” Darkfost stated. Miners Are Selling Their BTC Furthermore, the CryptoQuant analyst noted that the Hash Ribbon’s flashing a buy signal is a short-term negative. This is because miners selling their BTC to stay operational create long-term profitable opportunities. Darkfost explained that the indicator has always been accurate except once, during the 2021 China mining ban event. Hence, the possibility of the metric being correct this time is high. “Bottom line, this signal is telling you that buying the dip around here is a smart move,” he added. The analysis comes as a solo BTC miner defied hashrate odds and beat mining giants to validate a block on the Bitcoin network, earning a reward worth over $330,000. Mining successes like this are extremely rare due to the high computational power required to approve transactions.

Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) dropped to $0.00001275, its lowest level since May 9, and is now down 28% from its May peak. The meme coin has struggled in recent weeks as demand weakened and investors began exiting positions following prolonged underperformance. On-chain data shows that Shiba Inu’s network realized profit/loss (NPL) has remained negative for several months. The NPL metric measures the average profit or loss of all coins that change addresses daily, calculated by the difference between the last move price and the new transaction price.

Meanwhile, the supply of SHIB on exchanges has been rising steadily, signaling increased selling pressure. Shiba Inu NPL and whale transaction | Source: Santiment Additional data shows Shiba Inu’s spot market volume has also declined. Over the past 24 hours, SHIB recorded just $141.8 million in daily trading volume, significantly lower than other meme coins. Dogecoin registered $764 million, while Pepe topped the list with $1.08 billion. Shiba Inu price technical analysis SHIB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that SHIB peaked at $0.00001762 on May 11, following a broader crypto market rally. Since then, it has dropped to $0.00001275, breaking below the lower boundary of an ascending broadening wedge pattern. SHIB has also moved below the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, reinforcing a bearish bias. The Relative Strength Index remains above the oversold zone, suggesting that further downside is still possible. Given the current setup, capitulation may continue, with sellers likely targeting the next key support level at $0.000010, the lowest point from April 7. A move above the 200-day moving average at $0.00001570 would be required to invalidate the current bearish outlook.

While Ripple’s XRP threatened a decline to the crucial $2 support barrier, Lagrange (LA) soared over 300% in the past day, propelled by top-tier exchange listings. Let’s explore further details about the duo’s performance over the last 24 hours and what to anticipate in the short term. XRP: $2 in danger as inverted cup and handle emerges Ripple’s native token fails to keep pace as massive token supply meets unclear regulatory developments. XRP trades at $2.18 after surrendering 20% of its value from last month’s peak of $2.658. The alt’s trading volume plunged 15% in the past day, signaling weakness. Moreover, the daily chart reveals a crucial technical pattern. XRP has formed an inverted cup & handle setup on its daily chart. Source – TradingView This is a classic bearish pattern that often heralds sharp price dips. The formation signals dwindling buyer momentum, leaving XRP prone to substantial declines in the coming sessions. Bears will target the vital support at $2, below which the digital asset could witness massive slumps or prolonged consolidations. XRP risks dipping to the multi-month foothold at $1.71, leading to a 22% dip from its current market value. Buyers should hold above $2 to keep the remittance token afloat in the near term. Moreover, bullish developments such as XRP spot ETF approval could mean stable uptrends in the coming months. Polymarket shows a 93% chance of the SEC authorizing XRP exchange-traded funds in 2025, a significant increase from 68% in April. Source – Polymarket Lagrange soars over 300% after tier-1 listings While XRP exhibited bearishness, Lagrange (LA) stole the show with staggering gains in the past day. LA climbed from $0.409 to an intraday high of $1.7803, translating to an over 330% upswing. It hovers at $1.45, with an over 35,900% surge in daily trading volume, signaling colossal trader and investor interest. Chart by CoinMarketCap What drove Lagrange’s latest outperformance? LA’s massive uptrend comes after the project confirmed listing on multiple leading exchanges via its X handle . The altcoin is now available in leading trading platforms, including KuCoin, Gate.io, Coinbase, Bitget, Bybit, and Binance Alpha. These developments saw Lagrange dominate social media chatter, with heightened developer and trader activities propelling LA prices. Lagrange is a crypto ecosystem that prioritizes modular blockchain infrastructure, enabling developers to create secure and scalable decentralized applications (dApps). LA will enjoy increased visibility and liquidity after the latest exchange listings. However, LA will hardly remain elevated after the massive rally. The alt exhibits significant volatility, calling for a cautious approach. Potential profit-taking could send the alt tumbling in the upcoming hours.

2025-06-05T16:37:33,"Bitcoin and altcoins are crashing as investors ‘are locking profits’","Bitcoin and other altcoins continued their downward trend on Thursday as the recent bullish momentum faded. Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped briefly below $104,000 as the market capitalization of all coins fell by 1% to $3.27 trillion. Some of the top laggards were altcoins like Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), Jupiter ( JUP ), and Ethena ( ENA ). Analysts suggest the ongoing pullback is a typical occurrence during bull markets, as some investors begin locking in profits. In a statement to crypto.news, Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at Bitget Research, said: “After a period of notable gains, many investors are locking in profits, which has triggered short-term sell-offs. This behavior is not unusual in bull cycles, where sharp rallies often lead to a wave of corrections as traders seek to de-risk their portfolios.” Ryan added that the ongoing geopolitical developments like trade tensions from the US had contributed to market uncertainty and triggered a risk-off sentiment. He added that: “While the overall outlook for digital assets remains positive, current price action suggests a cooling period, especially in speculative altcoins that saw outsized gains. Investor sentiment is being recalibrated in response to these developments.” Historically, Bitcoin tends to pull back after reaching a key resistance level, often triggering a broader correction across altcoins. For example, BTC hit a record high of $108,335 in December before retreating to $88,987 in January. It later surged to a new all-time high of $109,300 in the same month. Bitcoin price chart analysis points to an eventual rebound BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news Technical indicators suggest that Bitcoin may be preparing for another rally, which could spark a broader altcoin rebound. On the daily chart, BTC is gradually forming a bullish flag pattern — characterized by a steep vertical rally (the flagpole) followed by a downward-sloping consolidation channel (the flag). This setup is typically viewed as a continuation pattern. Bitcoin has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the recent pullback forming the handle section. The cup features a depth of approximately 30%, or 34,000 points. Using standard technical analysis, the target for a cup-and-handle breakout is calculated by adding the cup’s depth to its upper boundary. In this case, adding $38,000 to the top of the pattern yields a projected target of $146,000.

2025-06-05T16:34:03,"Bitcoin price could reach reach $125k in June: Bitfinex","Bitcoin’s short-term price performance will largely be influenced by Friday’s U.S. jobs report and a continued increase in ETF inflows, according to Bitfinex analysts. Bitcoin (BTC) could climb to $125,000 by the end of June if macroeconomic conditions remain favorable, analysts told crypto.news on June 5. The primary catalyst in the near term is Friday’s non-farm payroll report, which is expected to show a slowdown in employment. Current forecasts for new non-farm payrolls range between 125,000 and 130,000 — down from April’s 177,000. Bitfinex analysts believe that a weaker-than-expected print would be bullish for Bitcoin, as it could accelerate the Federal Reserve’s timeline for interest rate cuts, a move generally favorable for risk assets like BTC. “We believe if Bitcoin maintains support above $105,000, it could target the $120,000–$125,000 range in June. This will not be catalysed just from the labour market but it could be a domino in multiple catalysts prompting the Fed to cut rates at a faster than expected pace,” Bitfinex analysts. Still, a stronger-than-expected jobs report could make rate cuts less likely. This would strengthen the dollar, but hurt Bitcoin and other crypto assets. In any case, the effects of the jobs data will trickle down to other Bitcoin price catalysts. This includes ETF inflows, which will be influenced by rate cuts and the strength of the dollar. You might also like: Elon Musk called it an “abomination” — but the Big Beautiful Bill might be crypto’s backdoor stimulus Jobs data remains in focus for Bitcoin’s price Investor sentiment remains divided ahead of Friday’s non-farm payrolls report, given the mixed signals from earlier labor market data.

On the other hand, ADP private payrolls came in significantly below expectations, posting just 37,000 new jobs versus the anticipated 110,000. The breakdown revealed that small businesses shed 13,000 jobs, and large firms cut 3,000, while midsized companies added 49,000. While the U.S. labor market remains resilient , employers are concerned about the potential negative effects of the U.S. tariffs on its major trading partners.

However, in the short term, caution prevails. Top analyst Carl Runefelt has highlighted a key technical development, noting that Solana might be on the verge of breaking a horizontal support zone. This event could trigger further downside in the near term. If this support fails, traders should prepare for increased volatility. Still, the broader consensus remains that SOL’s structural strength and ecosystem development position it well for long-term upside once macro conditions align. Solana Faces Bear Flag Breakdown Risk As Uncertainty Grows Solana has been locked in a tight range just below the $160 mark, struggling to reclaim key levels despite multiple attempts. For several days, momentum has faded, and with global markets under pressure, traders are bracing for increased volatility. The broader crypto market is losing steam as Bitcoin and Ethereum fail to sustain upward moves, which puts added pressure on altcoins like Solana. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China continue to weigh on investor sentiment, with ongoing tariff disputes and rising bond yields fueling macroeconomic uncertainty. The US bond market, in particular, is flashing signs of stress, adding to the caution in risk-on assets. If these conditions persist, altcoins may face a challenging period as capital retreats to more stable assets like Bitcoin or exits the market altogether. Runefelt recently highlighted a key technical pattern on Solana’s chart—a bear flag forming around horizontal support. According to his analysis, this structure could break down any hour now, which would confirm the bearish setup and potentially send SOL down toward the $142 level. This target aligns with previous support zones and could act as a temporary bottom if the broader market stabilizes. Despite the short-term risks, long-term sentiment around Solana remains cautiously optimistic. The network’s continued development and strong DeFi presence could fuel a recovery once market conditions improve. For now, however, traders are closely watching the $160 resistance and the $150–$152 support area, which could determine the next directional move. A clean break below support would likely trigger a wave of selling, while a reclaim of the $160 level could invalidate the bearish setup and open the door for a bullish reversal.

SOL Tests Key Support As Bearish Momentum Builds Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $152.62 on the 4-hour chart, testing a critical horizontal support zone as bearish momentum continues. The recent price action shows a clear downtrend, with lower highs and lower lows forming since the rejection from the $176–$180 area in late May. All key moving averages—34 EMA, 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA—are positioned above the current price, signaling short-term weakness and a lack of bullish momentum. Volume has picked up slightly as price nears support, suggesting increasing market interest at this level. However, the failure to break above the 34 EMA (currently at $157.70) reinforces the view that sellers are still in control. The flattening 200 SMA at $165.31 and declining 50 SMA around $159.82 indicate that SOL must reclaim the $160–$165 zone to regain strength. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Chart Signals Strength Amid Market Uncertainty – Analyst If the $150–$152 support range fails to hold, Solana could break down and target the next key support area around $142, in line with the projected move of the bear flag pattern identified by analysts. For now, bulls must defend this level to prevent deeper losses and keep hopes of a recovery alive in the near term.

2025-06-05T16:30:30,"XRP Lawsuit Faces Critical Deadline—Lawyer Warns No Motion, No Mercy","With just days remaining before a pivotal status update is due in the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, the XRP lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) case has once again entered a high-stakes phase. As of June 5, neither Ripple nor the Securities and Exchange Commission has refiled their joint request to amend the final judgment—an omission that could force the appeals court to resume briefing on unresolved issues. The procedural logjam began on May 15, when Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York denied a motion for an indicative ruling. “If jurisdiction were restored to this Court,” Torres wrote, “the Court would deny the parties’ motion as procedurally improper.” Both Ripple and the SEC had sought the court’s signal that it would be willing to vacate the longstanding injunction if remanded. XRP community lawyer Fred Rispoli immediately weighed in, noting that the denial was less about substance and more about flawed procedure. “The meaning here is that the parties didn’t request relief under the right rule of civil procedure,” he explained at the time. “So they will refile it under the correct rule but, me reading between the lines, is that Ripple and the SEC need to get on all fours and beg for relief.” Ticking Clock In XRP Lawsuit Now, nearly three weeks later, no refile has appeared on the docket, prompting renewed speculation and concern. “Twenty days later, no refile yet by SEC and Ripple in district court and the June 16 deadline for the status update in the 2nd Circuit looms large,” Rispoli wrote on June 4. “Expect the refile before Judge Torres to happen by then. If there is nothing pending before Torres when the parties file the status report, the 2nd Circuit only has Torres’ denial of the first request and will restart the briefing. If a motion is pending before Torres at the time of the 6/16 status report, the 2nd Circuit will likely push it out another 60 days,” he added. While the parties remain officially silent, legal observers are increasingly focused on the political and institutional implications of this delay. “What is the next step?” Rispoli asked rhetorically. “The message by Torres was clear that both parties need to beg for forgiveness. Ripple will say whatever to get it done—but how much public groveling is the SEC willing to do? And how much groveling will be authorized? We have 12 days to find out.” That sentiment was echoed by community members, including @xrp_hodl_r (Random Shark), who stressed the difficulty of the task at hand. “I don’t think that many of the respondents to this post realize what a high bar it is to convince a judge to amend a final judgement,” he wrote. “I suspect that both the SEC and Ripple will utilize all of the allotted time to prepare their detailed briefs.” Rispoli agreed with the procedural point. “It is a very high bar,” he wrote, “but that is because usually only one side wants to amend the judgment. The parties thought, and I did too, that because both sides wanted the same thing that she would go along.” The broader context makes the current impasse even more critical. With the SEC under new leadership and proposed crypto legislation advancing in Congress, both parties may have incentive to wrap the litigation quietly. But Judge Torres appears unwilling to rubber-stamp a compromise that lacks rigorous justification. James Farrell, General Counsel at JST Digital, added further nuance to the legal dilemma. “They don’t need her permission to settle the $ or drop the appeals,” he clarified. “It’s only to vacate the obey-the-law injunction. Hand waving ‘new admin, new policy, fairness, SEC ok with it’—not gonna cut it with ‘why is it tough to do what the injunction requires, which is just don’t go crime-ing.’” As of now, the June 16 deadline stands as a moment of truth. If no refile reaches Judge Torres by then, the case could revert to a new appellate battle—undoing months of attempted resolution and extending the legal shadow that has loomed over XRP for years. At press time, XRP traded at $2.19.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-critical-deadline/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T16:27:19,"White House Crypto Chief Bo Hines Met With El Salvador’s Bukele to Discuss Bitcoin","El Salvador and the United States are looking to ramp up their crypto partnership. Bo Hines, the executive director of the White House’s Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, met with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Wednesday. “The aspiring Bitcoin Superpower came to meet with the OG Bitcoin Country to discuss areas of mutual interest and possible collaboration relating to bitcoin, stablecoins and digital assets,” Stacy Herbert, director of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office, told CoinDesk. “Over the coming months, I believe we will see some extraordinary things happen for both partners as a result of this meeting,” she added, without elaborating further. Hines is an important player in Washington when it comes to crypto policy, working alongside David Sacks, who chairs the crypto council and took on the role of AI and crypto czar. The two countries have gotten closer since U.S. President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. Bukele was welcomed by Trump at the White House in April, where they discussed security agreements. El Salvador has agreed to take custody of some of the illegal immigrants deported by the U.S. in the country’s maximum security mega-prison, CECOT, built in 2022 as part of the government’s crackdown on violent gangs. El Salvador’s crypto regulation agency, the National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD), has also already met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the purpose of establishing a cross-border regulatory sandbox. The idea, according to CNAD President Juan Carlos Reyes, is for the U.S. to take advantage of El Salvador’s experience in regulating digital assets to evaluate streamlined regulatory approaches for its own framework.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/06/05/white-house-crypto-chief-bo-hines-met-with-el-salvadors-bukele-to-discuss-bitcoin,"BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Policy|El Salvador|Bitcoin|White House|News",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T16:15:38,"Trump's Truth Social files S-1 for a Bitcoin ETF","Donald Trump’s Truth Social is submitting its S-1 form to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer a Bitcoin ETF. This corresponds to the company’s 19b-4 filing. Like the other spot BTC ETFs, the fund is designed to track the price of Bitcoin and offer a simpler way for investors to gain exposure without holding the asset directly. Crypto.com will be the only company that stores, executes, and provides liquidity for the ETF’s Bitcoin. However, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF launch is pending until the Registration Statement goes into effect and a Form 19b-4 filing with the SEC is approved. NYSE Arca will list the Shares when they go public. Trump Media looks to add to current market offerings The NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 form to list and sell shares of this fund and has already started the approval process in earnest. According to the S-1 form , Yorkville America is supporting the fund. However, some important information is missing from the file, like the fund’s ticker, seed capital, or share price. The filing statement for a Bitcoin ETF by Trump Media is a big step for the company to grow beyond its current social media, streaming, and fintech businesses. With this move, DJT can take advantage of the growing interest among institutions in Bitcoin investment vehicles. The business is setting this up as a physically-backed Bitcoin product. The ETF will hold real Bitcoin instead of swaps or futures contracts. This project aligns with the company’s “Bitcoin treasury strategy,” which was partly talked about in forward-looking statements. It suggests that the company is interested in crypto in more ways than just the ETF product. Truth Social Bitcoin ETF survival odds in the competitive market The market’s reception remains uncertain because Trump Media is a relatively new company dealing with well-known financial institutions with deeper experience in ETF management and distribution. Since spot Bitcoin ETFs came out in January 2024, the market has grown to have more than $130 billion in assets. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), which has assets worth nearly $69 billion, is the leader. The company already has a fintech brand called “Truth.Fi” that could be used as a distribution route, but the filing doesn’t say how this new product fits in with what they’re already doing. Analysts believe it could be a new ground for this industry because it involves a company with ties to the US president. But Truth Social is late to the party because it is filing in an area where many ETFs are already very cheap and easy to trade. In addition, this adds to the controversy about Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry. This might make it harder as investors doubt Trump’s crypto companies’ viability after his tenure. However, it is good timing for Trump’s organization. As reported by Cryptopolitan, JPMorgan will start allowing its trading and wealth clients to borrow cash using crypto-related assets as collateral. Also, the bank will start including some clients’ crypto assets in their net worth figures. This means that Bitcoin and other digital assets will be treated the same as stocks, cars, and art. A law called the US Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) makes it easy to pledge stocks in the US. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

More than 4,000 investors participated, the exchange announced, noting it will take into account customer demand when planning the development of the new market. Moscow Exchange releases first Bitcoin futures trading stats The volume of Bitcoin futures traded on Moscow Exchange exceeded 420 million rubles (over $5.3 million) at the end of June 4, the day the new product was offered to investors, a representative of the platform’s operator announced. Nearly 8,600 transactions were carried out and the number of clients involved in the trading reached 4,137, the Russian business daily Kommersant reported, quoting Maria Patrikeeva, managing director of the Moscow Exchange Derivatives Market. The executive emphasized that the leading Russian exchange intends to develop the new segment in accordance with customer requests and elaborated: “90% of the turnover on the futures market comes from qualified investors. Therefore, the launch of futures on shares of the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF investment fund — an instrument available exclusively to this category of investors — was a logical and timely step in the development of our line.” The Moscow Exchange (MOEX) started trading futures contracts for the shares of BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) on Wednesday. The value is expressed in U.S. dollars per lot, and settlements are made in Russian rubles. The contracts will expire in September. The trading platform revealed it’s going to launch the product right after the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) said it’s authorizing the offering of crypto derivatives in the country. The regulator did that while warning both financial firms and their clients against direct investments in cryptocurrencies. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF, managed by the American investment firm BlackRock, is one of the largest Bitcoin ETFs, or exchange-traded funds allowing investors to gain exposure to the price changes of BTC without directly holding the crypto. The fund has $70 billion in assets. Legalization opens crypto derivatives market for Russian investors Following the CBR’s announcement , Russia’s largest credit institution, majority state-owned Sberbank, launched structured bonds tied to the value of Bitcoin, which were also listed on MOEX. Another government-controlled bank, VTB, said it will offer the bonds to its clients. Sergey Selyutin, head of trading operations at the bank’s “VTB My Investments” arm, commented that the trading results from the Moscow Exchange indicate that Russian investors are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios and are ready to work with new assets. Currently, cryptocurrency derivatives are only available to “ highly qualified ” investors as the Bank of Russia favors restricting access to volatile assets and products based on them. The regulator has been a strong opponent to legalizing the free circulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian economy. To be treated as qualified investors, private individuals should prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $633,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (almost $1.27 million), the CBR suggested earlier this year. This week, the monetary authority proposed to raise the limit for non-qualified investors who want to buy digital financial assets (DFAs) from the current 600,000 rubles to 1 million rubles (around $12,500). Under Russian DFA law, the category includes various tokenized assets and rights, other than crypto. The CBR’s regulatory nod sparked a race between financial and banking institutions in Russia to tap into the domestic crypto derivatives market. One of the companies competing for a share, the Russian broker Finam, said it will launch products based on the most popular coins, including BTC and ETH.
