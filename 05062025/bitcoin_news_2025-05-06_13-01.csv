For investors, it opens access to high-growth, venture-backed companies in a more efficient and transparent manner.“We are excited to welcome Citi to the SDX platform and together deliver this landmark project in the tokenization of private shares,” said David Newns, head of SDX.Newns added that this will “enable the efficient distribution of shares in mature international private companies, which are expected to generate strong investor interest.”Citi announcing the partnership.

However, lawyers still need to catch up. “Most blockchains nowadays, especially things like Solana, are fast enough for institutions to use them,” Federa said. “It’s really more about the institutions and the institution’s lawyers getting comfortable with crypto.”Federa added that institutional lawyers and compliance teams are still addressing regulatory concerns. The executive said this may slow adoption despite the growing regulatory clarity in key markets like the United States. DoubleZero Labs founder Austin Federa. Source: CointelegraphInstitutions are coming; they just move slowAccording to Federa, technical infrastructure is no longer a primary barrier for large firms. Tools needed to support enterprise-scale activity on networks like Solana are already in place:  “Especially on networks like Solana and other fast networks, the infrastructure is there today for high amounts of institutional adoption.”While crypto community members may feel like institutional adoption should be bigger than it is, Federa said that these organizations are not quick at onboarding new technologies.  “Institutions are coming on board, but they just move really slow,” Federa told Cointelegraph. “People expect these massive institutions to move fast, but that’s just not what they’re good at.” Until legal departments are fully satisfied with risk controls and compliance structures, Federa said meaningful adoption may unfold gradually. Related: DoubleZero’s alternative to public internet targets mainnet rollout in H2Institutional involvement in crypto infrastructureFedera also highlighted a growing trend of institutional involvement in the crypto infrastructure space. He said that bare-metal infrastructure providers and venture capital firms have offered financial support and contributed actual fiber infrastructure to DoubleZero. This kind of commitment was almost unthinkable just a few years ago, he said. “Most of those companies two years ago would not have had any interest or thought it was way too legally risky to take something and contribute fiber to it.”Unlike running a validator node, deploying fiber and infrastructure is a major commitment. Federa said that institutional players now allocating serious resources to crypto-native projects reflects a shift in how traditional finance views the sector.Despite this, he acknowledged that while institutional adoption grew, the broader crypto product landscape isn’t fully mature. “The products are not quite there yet for the most part,” Federa said.Magazine: Solana ‘will be a trillion-dollar asset’: Mert Mumtaz, X Hall of Flame",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/institutional-infrastructure-crypto-austin-federa-doublezero?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-06T11:19:48.000Z,"Research DAO claims paralyzed rats recover after spinal cord fix","Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) HydraDAO claims that its researchers were able to use a novel technique to repair severed spines in rats.In a May 5 X post, decentralized science (DeSci) project HydraDAO said that one of its research projects resulted in “rats who had their spines fully transected” being able to walk again. More notably, recovery from surgery reportedly only took five days.Source: HydraDAOThe post featured a video of partially shaved (presumably due to surgery) rats walking in what appeared to be a laboratory setting. The effort in question is the Dowell spinal fusogens project led by Michael Lebenstein-Gumovski, which raised 380,700 USDC (USDC) from donors. The dedicated HydraDAO page reads:“The Dowell team submitted a project proposal to HydraDAO. After careful consideration and two peer reviews, HydraCore deems it in the interest of HydraDAO’s community.“Related: Experts to gather in Miami to drive longevity research forwardMore than smoke and mirrors?Fusogens are chemicals capable of fusing cell membranes and have long been researched as a means to reconnect severed nerve fibers. One such chemical is polyethylene glycol (PEG), which was shown to promote membrane fusion and seal axonal membranes in other research.The Dowell team adds a biopolymer from crustacean shells called chitosan, resulting in a PEG-chitosan compound dubbed neuro-PEG. This compound is also photopolymerizable, meaning it can be rapidly solidified using light.This presumably allows for creating a solid scaffolding that can weld the spinal cord more permanently than liquid PEG-based solutions. Dowell also implements neuroprotection techniques such as localized hypothermia and cellular death inhibitors to prevent further damage to nerve tissue. A 2023 research paper by Gumovski published in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Surgical Neurology International claimed that pigs treated with the compound recovered mobility in two months. The study’s conclusion read:“Neuro-PEG affords sensorimotor recovery after complete spinal cord transection. This opens the door to human experimentation, including trials of spinal cord transplantation.“The Dowell team also filed a patent for developed technologies, with a 2022 Russian patent describing a “method of restoring spinal cord functions after transection using a PEG-chitosan conjugate,” listing Lebenstein-Gumovski among its inventors.The HydraDAO proposal suggests that “revenue streams include specialized surgical kits priced between $3,500 and $20,000, depending on the market and region.” Furthermore, the team would also provide “comprehensive training and certification for neurosurgeons and emergency medical services” personnel.Related: Major scientific journal Nature features DeSci project ResearchHubSome interesting connectionsGumovski is a neurosurgery researcher based in Russia (Stavropol State Medical University and affiliated institutes). He was a member of Sergio Canavero’s research head-transplant project, cited in at least one relevant paper.Those articles were also published in Surgical Neurology International, while most top scientific publications shied away from the subject. The neurosurgeon from Turin, Italy, claimed to have performed a successful head transplant on a monkey back in 2016.The team also experimented on human cadavers in preparation for a 2017 live human head transplant, which never took place. Neuroscientist Dean Burnett said at the time that head transplantation presented insurmountable challenges and that Canavero had “offered no feasible explanation or science for his claims to be able to overcome these hurdles.”While the Dowell team’s project builds on established research and should not be dismissed outright, it is hard not to notice the similarity in making public claims not unlike those that characterized Canavero’s career. Furthermore, fusogens are well studied and less dramatic but similar results have been reported by other teams in the past (2019 example from the University of Texas).Will the paralyzed walk again?The evidence provided is promising, but it is advisable to exercise caution, especially until multiple third-party teams independently reproduce the results.HydraDAO promised additional electrophysiology experiments and tracing dyes to assess connectivity between the brain and lower spine. This extra data may enhance the credibility of the research results.Still, further research is needed to assess whether it will result in a clinically viable technique for real-world spinal injuries.Magazine: DeSci: Can crypto improve scientific research?",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hydradao-spinal-cord-repair-neuropeg-rats?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

This equates to about 17.88% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply of 19.69 million coins.If the company tapped only its estimated $295.98 billion in US Treasury, it could buy around 3.12 million BTC, or 15.85% of the circulating supply, positioning it as a dominant player in the crypto market.Berkshire Hathaway is 20th Century Bitcoin.— Michael Saylor (@saylor) May 3, 2025Such a move would easily eclipse Nasdaq-listed Strategy Inc.

However, Berkshire surprised markets by buying Barrick Gold shares (a gold mining company) in 2020, though it later sold that position.Under Abel, Berkshire may not dive straight into Bitcoin, but its cautious, indirect approach could expand as markets evolve.

He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. “We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”Mercuryo Petr Kozyakov at the Token2049 event in Dubai.

Kozyakov told Cointelegraph that more companies are settling employee salaries with crypto assets. “That is a growing trend,” Kozyakov said. “I see a lot of businesses that are starting to settle with their full-time employees and with their gig employees all over the world, in crypto.”As more employees receive crypto salaries, new challenges can emerge. According to Kozyakov, workers paid in crypto may ask what they can do next with their funds. “You won’t invest everything and just wait. You need to use it for everyday purchases,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. This is where practical spending options are needed. Kozyakov said that crypto earners are looking for ways to use their digital asset incomes in daily life scenarios, whether buying coffee, going out for drinks or settling utility bills. As crypto becomes an option for employee salaries, there has also been a growing acceptance of crypto in employee contracts in some jurisdictions. In August 2024, a Dubai court recognized crypto as a valid form of salary payment. Related: OKX exec warns against hype amid real-world asset tokenization boomCrypto, a powerful tool for moving and storing moneyThe executive also told Cointelegraph that Mercuryo views crypto as more than just a speculative asset but a powerful tool for moving and storing value. “Crypto is not only an asset; it’s the perfect rail to move money and store money. And it is essential to be able to spend it.”The executive said that in practice, spending crypto can still be complex. He said it takes a few steps, including moving it to an exchange, sending it to a bank account and answering “weird” questions from banks. Because of this, he highlighted a need for easier ways to spend crypto directly.

And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.He said hype can drive project growth in the Web3 space, but providing everyday value should be the priority. OKX MENA CEO Rifad Mahasneh at the Token2049 media lounge. Source: CointelegraphRWA tokenization gains traction in the UAEMahasneh’s comments come amid an increase in real-world asset tokenization projects in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates. On May 1, MultiBank Group signed a $3 billion RWA agreement with the UAE-based real-estate firm MAG and blockchain infrastructure provider Mavryk — the largest RWA initiative worldwide to date. In addition to billions in RWA deals, the UAE government has started working on RWA tokenization. On March 19, the Dubai Land Department — the government agency responsible for promoting, organizing and registering real estate in Dubai — announced a pilot phase of its real-estate tokenization project. The agency is working with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the emirate’s crypto regulator. On Jan. 9, RWA project Mantra also signed a $1 billion deal with Damac Group to tokenize the assets of the UAE-based conglomerate. However, months later, Mantra saw one of the biggest token collapses in crypto history, wiping out billions in market capitalization on April 13. Mahasneh told Cointelegraph that the region’s clear regulations help drive bigger institutions to get into tokenization and crypto. He said regulatory clarity allows understanding of how key players in the space, like exchanges, are governed. Related: Real estate not the best asset for RWA tokenization — Michael SonnensheinUAE stablecoin framework gives institutions confidenceThe executive also praised the region’s progress in stablecoin regulations. In June 2024, the Central Bank of the UAE approved a regulatory framework for stablecoin licensing. This clarified the issuance, supervision and licensing of dirham-backed payment tokens. According to Mahasneh, this demonstrates the UAE’s speed in regulating crypto-related technologies. The executive also highlighted that the central bank's involvement gives institutions extra confidence in entering the business. “Other markets are still debating whether they should have crypto regulations.

2025-05-06T09:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin vs. digital fiat is freedom vs. serfdom","Opinion by: Simon Cain, contributor at Bitcoin Policy UKMost jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks. Lamenting the authorities’ current inability to control cash transactions, he says that with a CBDC, a “central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine use... also we will have the technology to enforce that.. that makes a huge difference with respect to what cash is.”How “absolute control” might workCBDCs could be programmed so you can only buy certain things from certain people, at certain times, within specific dates, or only in approved locations. Their validity could depend on compliance with all government policies (climate, medical, social, and tax). They could be subject to maximum or minimum holding limits. They could be programmed to discourage saving and encourage 'investing' in approved shares and bonds (such as the new EU 'SIU' initiative or in line with UK financial industry lobbying and 'research'). Politicians and central bankers may say they do not intend to implement any such controls, but such assurances are worthless. To quote the UK Parliament's own Economic Affairs Committee, \""while the Governor of the Bank of England told the committee that he did not see a CBDC as a way to implement monetary policy, the committee noted that his successors may disagree\"".Freedom to transact is fundamental to freedom itself. Once you can no longer choose what you do with your money, you're on the road to monetary serfdom. How can you defend yourself? Bitcoin fixes more than monetary serfdom Bitcoin fights financial subjugation. Because it's the world's most decentralized and censorship-resistant money, Bitcoin held in self-custody cannot be frozen or confiscated, and its transactions cannot be stopped. This isn't theoretical. It has already been proven in countless cases of financial repression all over the world, whether in Russia and Ukraine, Afghanistan and Cuba, or globally by organizations from WikiLeaks in 2011 to the Bitcoin Humanitarian Alliance in 2025. Recent: Is Bitcoin’s future in circular economies or national reserves?But financial serfdom isn't the only risk with CBDCs. The UK's Economic Affairs Committee also points out that \""a centralized CBDC ledger, which would be a critical piece of national infrastructure, could be a target for attack from hostile state and non-state actors.\"" Governments and public entities are always being hacked and leaking data, which they exacerbate by constantly hacking each other. Having your access to money entirely dependent on their competence is a terrible idea. Bitcoin fights financial institutional failure. And again, this isn't theoretical — it has also already been proven. When banks fail, or their systems go down, Bitcoin always remains up and running because it is the world's most reliable computer network. For well over a decade, Bitcoin has not been down for even a fraction of a second. Bitcoin is ultra-decentralized, and there have been zero successful hacks of the Bitcoin ledger itself during that period, despite its worth being in the trillions of dollars. Public or private, monetary or otherwise, no other large network can come close to this reliability and resistance to physical, virtual or political attack.Nowhere is immune from digital fiat CBDCs look to be coming to the major Western economies. The European Central Bank is set to complete preparations for its 'digital euro' CBDC this year. Americans may now have a presidential order \""prohibiting… a CBDC within the jurisdiction of the United States,\"" but stablecoins look set to become government CBDCs disguised in decentralized private-bank clothing, able to perform the same functions. The current US administration's enthusiasm for stablecoins is remarkably aligned with the favored CBDC framework of the BIS, \""a hybrid model which allows the division of labor between the central bank and private intermediaries.\"" For a peek into this potential stablecoin-as-CBDC world, just look at what being embedded in the US dollar system already means for the world's leading stablecoin. \""We follow US laws and regulations when it comes to freezing,\"" says Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, which doesn't even operate inside the United States. \""We have on-boarded the FBI and US secret services; we work with the Department of Justice almost daily and the Treasury.\""Whether it's called a CBDC or not, you'll likely soon be subjected to some form of digital fiat. But, at present, there's nothing to stop you from accessing some self-sovereign 'outside-the-system' money. As permissionless peer-to-peer digital cash, Bitcoin can defend against monetary serfdom and protect from the failures of financial institutions. And, in its own sly roundabout way, it is the best and only truly decentralized tool for doing so.Opinion by: Simon Cain, contributor at Bitcoin Policy UK.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

The event came just days after hosting a $1 million-per-plate fundraiser for the MAGA super PAC.He also plans to hold a gala dinner with major Official Trump (TRUMP) memecoin holders on May 22, despite multiple US lawmakers expressing concerns.Source: Elizabeth WarrenRelated: America’s crypto renaissance is already failing; but we can fix itGENIUS Act faces roadblocksThe Trump family’s controversial $2 billion crypto deal comes as the Senate prepares to vote on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act and other crypto-related bills.The fallout is already being felt in Congress. Some Democratic lawmakers are pushing for additional hearings before advancing any legislation, while others question whether Trump’s personal stake in digital assets is undermining bipartisan support for crypto regulation.On May 5, Senate Majority Leader John Thune signaled a willingness to amend the GOP-backed stablecoin legislation to pass the bill in the coming weeks.Speaking to reporters, Thune said changes can be made on the floor and that he is waiting to hear what Democrats are asking for, per a report from Politico.Internal GOP challenges also remain, with Senator Rand Paul expressing uncertainty about backing the bill, according to the report.The stalling isn’t limited to the Senate.

He added that users “can refuse to upgrade and stay on 29.0 or run another implementation” of the network. Critics said that the proposal was introduced without a proper consensus process. “I think one thing is pretty clear, there is no consensus at the moment on this OP_RETURN issue,” said Ten31 Fund managing partner Marty Bent.Some also expressed concerns about deprioritizing Bitcoin’s financial utility and raised questions about undisclosed conflicts of interest.Critics of OP_RETURN limit removal.

2025-05-06T06:01:33.000Z,"Celsius’ Mashinsky lashes out at ‘death-in-prison sentence’","Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto lending platform Celsius, has blasted the government's 20-year “venom-laced” sentence request, declaring it a “death-in-prison sentence.”The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.  “The government's venom-laced submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” they said.“It concludes by recommending that a first time, nonviolent offender who pled guilty and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.”Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argue the DOJ has ignored their client's background in its sentencing request. Source: Court ListenerMashinsky pleaded guilty to two out of seven charges As part of a plea agreement, Mashinsky pleaded guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed in June 2022. Prosecutors initially filed seven charges in July 2023.Lawyers acting for Mashinsky allege the DOJ’s push for a 20-year sentence is because their client is unwilling to “capitulate to the government’s exaggerated characterizations of his actions,” specifically that he was a “fraud from the get-go.” “Alex is inserted as the scapegoat for every corporate action, every group decision, every unanimous vote, every market fluctuation, and every employee's watercooler speculation,” they said.As part of its April 28 sentencing request, the DOJ said Mashinsky’s guilty plea showed that his crimes were deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive and steal.Days earlier on April 23, US federal prosecutors also filed statements from hundreds of victims who lost money due to the Celsius collapse. They detailed how some had entrusted their life savings to the protocol, believing Mashinsky’s assurances that it was safe.Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, owing $4.7 billion to creditors after halting withdrawals in June, citing volatile market conditions.In November 2023, a US bankruptcy court approved Celsius' restructuring plan to repay customers, and in August 2024, $2.53 billion was paid to 251,000 creditors.Former Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon also pleaded guilty in September 2023 to similar charges, but his Dec. 11 sentencing has been delayed until after Mashinsky is sentenced.Magazine: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/celsius-mashinsky-lashes-govt-death-in-prison-sentence?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

(HOOD), which saw crypto trading dip in the first quarter but whose shares have climbed by nearly 30% so far this year, according to Google Finance.In the filing, eToro said some BlackRock funds and accounts indicated interest in buying up to $100 million worth of shares at IPO. eToro has also put aside 500,000 shares to sell through a directed share program, typically targeted at employees.The company reported that its revenue from crypto in 2024 was $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It expected crypto to account for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of 2025, down from 43% in the year-ago quarter.Source: Matthew SigelIn a section of its filing listing possible risks to the business, eToro warned its users could leave, or it could struggle to get more users, due to negative perceptions of the cryptocurrencies it lists, “either as a result of media coverage or by experiencing significant losses.”Other crypto-related risks the eToro flagged included US state-level crypto regulation, which it said “may place strain on our resources and make it difficult to operate in certain jurisdictions, if at all.”It also said it expects “to continue to incur significant costs” due to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) laws “on an ongoing basis.”IPOs ready to push after Trump tariff jolt EToro initially made confidential filings with the SEC in January for a public offering, before publicly announcing the plans on March 24.The company reportedly delayed its IPO after President Donald Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped many in-the-works public offerings.Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?Crypto companies are also lining up to go public, with stablecoin issuer Circle filing on April 1 but then pausing its plans amid the uncertainty.Crypto exchange Kraken is also reportedly considering a public offering for early next year, which has accelerated its plan with Trump’s election.EToro’s public offering is led by Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, UBS Investment Bank and Citigroup.Legal Panel: Crypto wanted to overthrow banks, now it’s becoming them in stablecoin fight",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/etoro-us-ipo-4-billion-valuation-500-million-raise?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

However, Nomad never heard back from him after that.Alleged messages between Gurevich and Nomad’s James Prestwich were shared on X by Israel-based Walla News journalist Yoav Itiel.

2025-05-06T02:38:34.000Z,"New crypto bill draft seen to curb big crypto firm influence","The new “Digital Asset Market Structure Discussion Draft” introduced by House Republicans on May 5 could work to reduce the dominance of large crypto firms and promote more participation in the broader market, according to an executive from Paradigm. The discussion draft, led by the House agricultural and financial services committee chairs Glenn Thompson and French Hill, is an “incremental, albeit meaningful, rewrite” of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), Paradigm’s vice president of regulatory affairs Justin Slaughter said in a May 5 X post.One-pager of the digital asset market structure discussion draft submitted by House Republicans on May 5. Source: US House Agriculture CommitteeOne of the major changes from FIT21 is that the draft defines an affiliated person as anyone who owns more than 1% of a digital commodity issued by the project — down from 5% in the FIT21 bill — a move Slaughter said may curb the influence of big crypto firms and lead to more participation in the crypto market.“This is a portent of the entire bill. There are often criticisms of crypto being too dominated by a few large firms. This bill makes clear the regulatory regime proposed is going to push against that fact and strongly encourage more small-d ‘democratization’ of the space.”The draft also defines a “mature blockchain system” as one that, together with its related digital commodity, is not under the “common control” of any person or group.Source: Justin SlaughterThe Securities and Exchange Commission would be the main authority regulating activity on crypto networks until they become sufficiently decentralized, Slaughter noted.The draft also clarified that decentralized finance trading protocols are those that enable users to engage in a financial transaction in a “self-directed manner.” Protocols that meet this criterion are exempt from registering as digital commodity brokers or dealers.The draft also referred to digital commodities as “investment contract assets” to distinguish their treatment from stocks and other traditional assets under the Howey test.According to Slaughter’s analysis, securities laws won’t be triggered unless the secondary sale of tokens also transfers ownership or profit in the underlying business.Crypto firms would also have a path to raise funds under the SEC’s oversight while also having a “clear process” to register their digital commodities with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the committee members said in a separate May 5 statement.Joint rulemaking, procedures, or guidelines related to crypto asset delisting must be established by the CFTC and SEC should a registered asset no longer comply with rules laid out by the regulators.A ‘clear opportunity’ to advance crypto innovation, rules once and for allSpeaking about the need for a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework, the House committee members said crypto is a “clear opportunity” to advance innovation in the US — most notably through modernizing America’s financial infrastructure and reinforcing US dollar dominance.The Republicans criticized the previous Biden administration and the Gary Gensler-led SEC for adopting a regulation-by-enforcement strategy rather than creating clear rules for market participants.Related: VanEck files for BNB ETF, first in USMany crypto firms were stuck in “legal limbo” as a result of the unclear rules, which pushed some industry players overseas, where clearer rules exist, the House committee members said.“America needs to be the powerhouse for digital asset investment and innovation.

The government alleged the platform helped with over $2 billion in illegal transactions and facilitated over $100 million worth of money laundering transactions from online black markets and scammers.Rodriguez and Hill both pleaded not guilty.In the letter, their lawyers said prosecutors shared details of a call with Kevin O’Connor, chief of FinCEN’s Virtual Assets and Emerging Technology Section in the Enforcement and Compliance Division, and Policy Division staffer Lorena Valente.According to an email from one of the prosecutors summarizing the call, FinCEN said that “because Samourai does not take ‘custody’ of the cryptocurrency by possessing the private keys to any addresses where the cryptocurrency is stored, that would strongly suggest that Samourai is NOT acting as an MSB [money services business].”An excerpt of an email from prosecutor Andrew Chan said FinCEN “did not have a sense” of what it would decide on Samourai. Source: CourtListenerThe email said O’Connor and Valente agreed that the government could try to argue that Samourai functionally controlled the crypto, “but that has never been addressed in the guidance, and so it could be a difficult argument” for prosecutors.Samourai’s lawyers asked the court for a hearing “to determine the circumstances surrounding the Government’s late disclosure” and to administer a remedy.Samourai to renew dismissal bid if case goes onRodriguez and Hill’s lawyers said that, using this latest information, they would again ask for the charges to be dismissed, arguing they lacked fair notice and “understood they were acting lawfully.”Related: US Treasury’s OFAC can’t restore Tornado Cash sanctions, judge rules Prosecutors and Samourai asked the court for more time on April 28 to consider potentially dismissing the case after the Justice Department rolled back its crypto enforcement.Rodriguez and Hill bid to dismiss the case in early April, arguing it should be dropped as Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in an April 7 memo that the Justice Department wouldn’t prosecute crypto mixers for “unwitting violations of regulations.” In the latest letter, their lawyers said if the government “were to resist the Blanche Memo’s directive and push forward,” then they would bid to dismiss as “if they were not money transmitters under FinCEN’s guidance, then they could not possibly be prosecuted for not having a license.”Magazine: Tornado Cash 2.0 — The race to build safe and legal coin mixers",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/samourai-wallet-feds-hid-advice-crypto-mixer-didnt-need-license?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.It’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy. Nocella said he intended to help prosecute “narcotics-traffickers, gang members, terrorists, human-traffickers and other criminals.”The former SafeMoon CEO asked the court in February to consider pushing back the start of the trial based on “significant changes” Trump had proposed affecting US securities laws, potentially impacting his criminal case.Related: What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Though not as well known for criminal cases involving high-profile figures in the crypto industry, the Eastern District of New York has been responsible for overseeing cases against individuals tied to digital assets, including a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) complaint against Hex founder Richard Heart and fraudsters.

2025-05-05T21:33:00.000Z,"OpenAI to stay nonprofit, scrap proposed overhaul","ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has abandoned plans to become a for-profit company and reaffirmed commitment to its nonprofit status. In a May 5 blog post, OpenAI confirmed plans to convert its for-profit business unit into a so-called Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would remain under the nonprofit’s control. PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity. “OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit. Going forward, it will continue to be overseen and controlled by that nonprofit,” the ChatGPT-maker said. This can be done without compromising OpenAI’s ability to raise funds for AI development, which “currently requires hundreds of billions of dollars and may eventually require trillions of dollars,” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, said in a letter to employees announcing the decision. In 2024, OpenAI took a starkly different view, asserting that the for-profit entity was “necessary” for raising capital to amass the “vast quantities of compute” needed to run AI models. OpenAI’s May 5 governance announcement. Source: OpenAIRelated: OpenAI expects to 3X revenue in 2025 but Chinese AI firms are heating upControversial Plans OpenAI was originally founded as a nonprofit in 2015, and in 2019 it created a for-profit entity purportedly to help AI developers raise funds. The for-profit unit has remained under the nonprofit’s control since then. In 2024, Tesla CEO Elon Musk — one of OpenAI’s cofounders — sued Altman for allegedly “violating terms of Musk’s foundational contributions to the charity,” according to a November court filing. In the lawsuit, Musk alleges Altman “assiduously manipulated Musk into co-founding their spurious nonprofit venture, OpenAI,” while secretly planning to convert OpenAI to a for-profit entity. Musk has since launched xAI, the developer of AI chatbot Grok, which he said has fallen victim to OpenAI’s allegedly anti-competitive practices.OpenAI’s leadership expects its revenue to hit $29.4 billion by 2026, Bloomberg reported in March. It forecasts earning revenues of $12.7 billion in 2025. In March, OpenAI raised $40 billion from Softbank at a $300 billion valuation.

2025-05-05T21:15:00.000Z,"Good actors were &#039;unfairly targeted&#039; by SEC — OpenSea&#039;s CEO","The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement approach on crypto firms has left a lasting “regulatory overhang” within the industry, according to Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”The SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities. At the time, Finzer criticized the SEC for taking an approach of “regulation by enforcement” and said that OpenSea was prepared to “stand up and fight.”With the SEC under new leadership by Chair Paul Atkins, Finzer is hopeful for a more balanced regulatory framework. “Good crypto regulation needs to balance, sort of, protecting consumers but also preserving the ability to innovate,” Finzer said. “It’s not just a one-size-fits-all problem, right?”Under the Trump administration, the SEC has scaled back enforcement actions against several crypto firms, marking a policy shift in the US after years of enforcement actions led by former Chair Gary Gensler.For instance, the agency has withdrawn legal challenges against exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, NFT companies Yuga Labs and OpenSea, and decentralized finance protocol Uniswap — most of them opened during Gensler’s term. The SEC has even dismissed its years-long case against Ripple.During the 2024 US election cycle, the crypto industry widely backed then-candidate Donald Trump, who promised to make the United States “the crypto capital of the planet.” Overall, crypto super political action committees, or PACs, donated over $119 million into the coffers of pro-crypto candidates, helping shape the elections.Related: Crypto’s debanking problem persists despite new regulationsNFTs: Low trading volume, high innovationThe SEC crackdown on crypto firms had weighed on the markets downturn following FTX collapse in November 2022, driving investors away from crypto products such as nonfungible tokensSince then, NFT trading volume has plummeted from its 2021 peak, affecting protocols and platforms such as OpenSea. In 2023, the company laid off 50% of its staff amid the market turmoil.Finzer says the NFT space is still flourishing, with innovation and new applications coming to life — especially in the gaming industry and art collectibles. Despite this, OpenSea has started exploring other areas, seeking to diversify its business to become a destination for all onchain trading beyond NFTs.“I mean, for the first time in the history of the internet, people have the ability to own digital stuff, right, in a real way,” Finzer said. “[...] you can move them around between different applications and take them with you wherever you go on the internet. And that's something that's really powerful.”Related: OpenSea denies NFT airdrop rumors, calls website a test page",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/good-actors-were-unfairly-targeted-by-sec-new-approach-thoughtful-devin-finzer?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-05T20:53:56.000Z,"Trump’s crypto dealings face scrutiny as House Republicans unveil digital asset bill","US President Donald Trump’s crypto businesses are drawing increased scrutiny on Capitol Hill and beginning to influence the progress of US digital asset legislation. As Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives unveiled their draft of a digital asset market structure bill on May 5, Democrats prepared for a united response to Donald Trump’s deepening connections with the industry.Speaking to Cointelegraph on May 5, a Democratic staffer with knowledge of the matter said that House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters planned to lead some members of her party out of a Republican-led hearing discussing digital assets. The May 6 hearing, entitled “American Innovation and the Future of Digital Assets” and led by Committee Chair French Hill, could address draft legislation proposed by Republican lawmakers to establish a crypto market regulatory structure.In a May 5 statement, Rep. Hill and three top Republicans unveiled the draft bill, which could clarify the treatment of digital assets by the US’s financial regulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Hill and others echoed some of Trump’s talking points on crypto — e.g, making the US a “crypto capital of the world” — suggesting deference to the president’s previously announced policies.The draft bill included a provision requiring the SEC and CFTC to issue joint rules defining digital commodities. According to the text, transactions involving digital commodities “shall be deemed not to be an offer or sale of an investment contract” as long as the purchaser did not have “an ownership interest or other interest in the revenues, profits, or assets.”According to the Democratic staffer, rules required all members of the House Financial Services Committee to agree to move forward with the digital asset hearing, suggesting that Waters intended to block the Republican-controlled event and conduct a shadow hearing to explore Trump’s and his family’s ties to the crypto industry. At least nine Democrats have reportedly considered a similar move to oppose a proposed stablecoin bill in the Senate.Calls for impeachment, criticism from both sidesSome members of Congress have already called for Trump’s impeachment after he offered the opportunity for some of his top memecoin holders to tour the White House and attend a private dinner. In addition to the memecoin, the president’s family has backed the firm World Liberty Financial, which recently launched its own stablecoin, and an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm used the USD1 stablecoin to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance.Related: US Senator calls for Trump impeachment, cites memecoin dinnerWaters, according to the staffer, requested that Hill and Republicans amend any proposed legislation to explicitly prevent potential conflicts of interest in which Trump could personally enrich himself through crypto ventures. Cointelegraph reached out to Hill’s office but did not receive a response at the time of publication. The Arkansas lawmaker reportedly said in March that the Trump family’s involvement in the crypto industry makes related legislation “more complicated.”Republican lawmakers in the United States currently have control of the House, Senate, and presidency. At least two senators supportive of Trump have criticized his memecoin dinner, hinting that the president was selling access to his office.

Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.Bitcoin market share excluding stablecoins. Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitcoin’s dominance over the broader cryptocurrency market has surged, currently standing at 70%, its highest since January 2021. This has occurred despite a wave of new token launches, including several top-50 projects such as SUI, Toncoin (TON), PI, Official Trump (TRUMP), Bittensor (TAO), Ethena (ENA), and Celestia (TIA). This dominance makes riskier altcoins less appealing to new market entrants.The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $4.5 billion in net inflows between April 22 and May 2. At the same time, the increasing appetite for Bitcoin futures signals growing institutional adoption regardless of whether leverage is used for downside protection or bullish bets.Bitcoin futures aggregate open interest, BTC.

Even after Bitcoin’s price crashed below $75,000 in early April, demand for leveraged positions remained strong. The open interest in BTC futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) alone exceeds $13.5 billion, indicating robust institutional demand.Several factors explain why Bitcoin has struggled to reclaim the $100,000 level. Traders who bought in anticipation of the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill on March 6 are growing increasingly frustrated, as the government has yet to disclose its BTC holdings or announce plans for further purchases. Additionally, similar state-level Bitcoin bills have repeatedly failed, including the latest setback in the US state of Arizona.Strategy doubles its plans for BTC acquisitions despite the global trade war Over the past three months, gold has outperformed most assets, rising 16%, while Bitcoin has declined by 5% and the S&P 500 has corrected by 6.5%. This has challenged the notion of Bitcoin as an uncorrelated asset, as the cryptocurrency has repeatedly failed to decouple from the S&P 500 amid rising economic risks. The global trade war has led investors to favor fixed-income assets and cash positions.5-year US Treasury yield (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD (right). Source: TradingView / CointelegraphBitcoin’s recent drop to $94,000 is particularly concerning given that Strategy, a US-listed company led by Michael Saylor, announced the acquisition of 1,895 BTC on May 5, after doubling its capital increase plan to fund further Bitcoin purchases. However, since investors were previously uncertain about Strategy’s ability to raise additional capital, the announcement of an $84 billion plan on May 1 has reduced some of this risk.For Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high, investors will likely need reassurance that US-China trade relations are improving, as tariffs have negatively impacted overall risk appetite.

Americans “have collectively lost billions of dollars” from scams such as those emanating from Myanmar, the release reads, without specifying an amount.“Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the Karen National Army (KNA), a militia group in Burma, as a transnational criminal organization, along with the group’s leader Saw Chit Thu, and his two sons, Saw Htoo Eh Moo and Saw Chit Chit, for their role in facilitating cyber scams that harm U.S. citizens, human trafficking, and cross-border smuggling,” the release reads.Many international bodies, including the US, continue to refer to “Burma,” the country’s former name, to demonstrate that they don’t recognize the military regimes that have been in power at various times since a 1989 coup in which the military changed the name to Myanmar. The KNA operates in southeastern Myanmar, along the Thailand border.The Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has issued numerous sanctions against crypto-offenders over the past few years, including Middle East-based terrorist groups, cybercrime units operating overseas, and privacy-focused crypto technology like Tornado Cash.Related: FBI warns of North Korean ’social engineering’ schemes to steal cryptoCrypto scams target US residentsAccording to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Americans lost $9.3 billion to crypto scams in 2024, an increase of roughly 66% from 2023. The most affected group is formed by individuals over the age of 60, who reported a cumulative loss total of $2.8 billion.Pig butchering scams are known for their significant impact on victims, both in the crypto space and beyond. The scam consists of a long-term financial fraud where scammers build trust with victims over time, often through social media or messaging platforms, before convincing them to invest in fake or manipulated crypto schemes. According to TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence company, these scams accounted for well over $4.4 billion stolen in 2023.According to the Treasury Department’s press release, this type of scam is currently common in Southeast Asia, primarily involving trafficked individuals defrauding victims.

2025-05-05T18:35:23.000Z,"What do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?","Crypto users are weighing in as Alex Mashinsky, the former CEO of Celsius Network, prepares to stand before a judge on May 8 to face sentencing for commodities fraud and a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price of the platform’s token.In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.“Many of the people who participated in this fraud, benefited from this fraud, and potentially orchestrated this fraud will get away with zero legal consequences,” said Daniel Frishberg of Hillsborough County, Florida, in an April 24 statement. “Please do not allow Mr. Mashinsky to be one of those people (such as with probation/house arrest, as some people supporting him have requested). Please throw the book at him.”A victim impact statement from a Celsius user filed with the SDNY on May 2. Source: PACERProsecutors have requested that Mashinsky serve up to 20 years in prison for his role in Celsius’ fraud, while the former CEO’s legal team asked for a year and one day. The judge will consider guidelines and victim statements at sentencing on May 8.Calls for leniency and harsh prison timeNot everyone who sent in a letter to the prosecutors seemed to be in favor of Mashinsky being sent away for decades, as was former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried. SBF stood before a different federal judge in the same district in March 2024 and was handed a 25-year sentence, which he is currently serving in a California prison. “While Celsius [sic] collapse caused significant losses, particularly for Bitcoin holders, shareholders, and borrowers, despite his mistakes, Mr. Mashinsky was, at times, the more conservative voice in an industry overflowing with unchecked greed,” said Artur Abreu in a victim impact statement.“The twenty-year sentence suggested by the US DOJ is fair in my opinion, as Mashinsky caused pain and suffering for many crypto investors across the globe – even resulting in suicide for some of those involved,” said Web3 Deep Dive podcast host and former Cointelegraph reporter Rachel Wolfson, who lost access to Bitcoin worth about $5,000 at the time. “Harsh punishment for bad actors in the crypto industry has become necessary to ensure that the space legitimizes over time.”Mashinsky’s sentencing will be one of the first in significant crypto cases in the district since Jay Clayton became interim US Attorney for SDNY. A Trump appointee, Clayton was previously the chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission and a crypto proponent on many issues. Critics have suggested that Clayton would take a softer approach to crypto enforcement, given his ties to Wall Street firms and the industry. However, he also released a statement in April regarding a $12-million crypto case, suggesting that he supported accountability for fraudulent actions. His response to Mashinsky’s sentencing and other future cases could be a bellwether for the US Attorney’s approach to crypto.Related: US prosecutors file over 200 victim statements in Celsius ex-CEO’s case",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/alex-mashinsky-celsius-prison-sentencing?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) extended its recovery last week and rose above the 50-day simple moving average (5,575).SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day exponential moving average (5,501) has started to turn up, and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive territory, indicating advantage to buyers. The up move could reach 5,800, which is expected to attract strong selling by the bears. If the price turns down from 5,800, it is likely to find support at the 20-day EMA. Sellers will have to yank the price below the 20-day EMA to suggest that the bullish momentum is weakening. The index may drop to 5,400 and subsequently to 5,300.US Dollar Index price predictionThe US Dollar Index (DXY) bounced off the 99 support on April 29 and reached the 20-day EMA (100.38) on May 1.DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewBuyers are facing stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA, but a minor positive is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That improves the prospects of a break above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the index could rise to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 101.39 and then to the 50-day SMA (102.72).This positive view will be invalidated if the price continues lower and breaks below the 99 level. That could sink the index to the critical support at 97.92.Bitcoin price predictionBitcoin closed below the $95,000 support on May 4, and the bears are trying to extend the pullback to the 20-day EMA ($92,204).BTC/USDT daily chart.

If the price bounces off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to propel the BTC/USDT pair to the psychological level of $100,000. Contrary to this assumption, a break and close below the 20-day EMA signals the bulls are rushing to the exit. That may sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($86,890). A deeper pullback suggests a range formation in the near term.Ether price predictionBuyers have managed to sustain Ether (ETH) above the moving averages, signaling strength.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($1,771) is sloping up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, indicating that the path of least resistance is to the upside.

The ETH/USDT pair could surge to the breakdown level of $2,111, where the bears are expected to sell aggressively.A break and close below the moving averages opens the gates for a fall to $1,537 and later to the critical support at $1,368.XRP price predictionXRP (XRP) remains stuck between the resistance line and the $2 support, indicating buying on dips and selling on rallies.XRP/USDT daily chart.

This equilibrium will tilt in favor of the bulls if they drive the price above the resistance line. The XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3, suggesting a short-term trend change.On the contrary, a break and close below $2 will put the sellers in charge. The pair may then retest the vital support at $1.61, where the buyers are expected to step in.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) slipped below the moving averages on May 4, but the bears are struggling to sustain the lower levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewIf buyers push the price above the moving averages, it suggests buying at lower levels. The bulls will then attempt to overcome the barrier at $620.

2025-05-05T15:00:00.000Z,"Crypto market manipulation schemes are becoming increasingly coordinated","Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXCMarket manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.A tale as old as time Market manipulation is as old as markets themselves. In ancient Greece, a philosopher named Thales of Miletus used his knowledge of weather patterns to predict a bumper olive harvest, quietly leasing all the olive presses in the region at a low rate before the season started. Then, when the harvest came in, and demand for presses spiked, he rented them out at inflated prices, pocketing the difference. For a more recent historical example, albeit still 300 years in the past, see the South Sea Company bubble in which company directors dumped shares at peak prices, leaving regular investors rekt. Or the Dutch tulip bubble of a century earlier. Market manipulation has existed in crypto since the first exchanges came onstream around 2011. Those who were around back then may recall the pump-and-dump schemes on the BTC-E exchange orchestrated by a notorious trader called Fontas. Or they might remember Bear Whale, whose 30,000 BTC sell wall crashed the market at a time when total daily trading volume was less than $30 million — for all of crypto combined. While not technically market manipulation, it showed how easily one individual could move the crypto market.Fast forward to today, and crypto is a multi-trillion dollar asset class, rendering manipulation of large-cap assets virtually impossible for solitary whales. But when a group of nefarious traders team up, it's still possible to move markets — and well-organized insiders are doing just that.Manipulators make their moveThe days when a single whale could set a BTC sell wall that took weeks to topple are long gone. While crypto is magnitudes more liquid these days, it's also much more fragmented. This presents opportunities to enterprising traders who hunt in packs to move markets to their advantage. Often working through private Telegram groups, people coordinate activities targeting markets where they can have the most effect. The trend highlights the growing participation of major players in market manipulation schemes, presenting a new level of risk for the crypto industry. Recent: What are exit liquidity traps — and how to detect them before it is too lateIn February, analyst James CryptoGuru warned of large-scale manipulation risks involving spot Bitcoin ETFs. He explained that these instruments could put downward pressure on Bitcoin's price — particularly when traditional financial markets are closed. Such a strategy could trigger liquidations among leveraged traders and create temporary imbalances, allowing large players to accumulate BTC and ETH at discounted prices.Because crypto — both onchain and on-exchange — is highly interconnected, the ripple effects of a successful manipulation attempt extend far and wide. If a trading pair queried by APIs for feeding other markets is knocked out of sync on one centralized exchange, it can generate arbitrage opportunities elsewhere, including on perps markets. As a result, an attack can be initiated on one exchange, and the profits claimed on another, making it extremely hard to catch the culprits.The integrity of the cryptocurrency market faces increased risk. Coordinated groups have deep pockets, technical tools, and cross-platform access to execute and mask complex operations. The troubling part is that most exchanges remain reactive by design since it's virtually impossible to prevent market manipulation. As a result, attackers have a high chance of retaining the advantage, even if the window in which they're free to run amok is becoming increasingly smaller.Not all manipulators break the rulesJust as Thales of Miletus wasn't breaking the rules when he profited off olive season, much of what constitutes crypto manipulation isn't illegal. When a large fund starts buying a particular token through one of their public wallets to attract attention — is that manipulation? Or when market makers go beyond simply matching bid-ask spreads to actively propping up a token's price at the request of a project? Many things move markets, but mostly things that aren't illegal — at least not now.While the moral code governing influencers, market makers, trading firms, and other players of serious size can be debated at length, other cases require less nuance. The last time anyone checked, using thousands of exchange accounts staffed by dozens of users to inflate a particular asset is blatant manipulation. Exchanges, aided by increasingly sophisticated AI-powered tooling, are fighting back.The days when one user would cause mayhem on the markets may be over. The threat hasn't, however, dissipated in the multichain, multi-exchange era — it's multiplied. As a result, exchanges are now locked into a game of whack-a-mole, trying to detect suspicious behavior initiated by hundreds or thousands of accounts simultaneously.Thankfully, exchanges don't have to do it alone, as successful collaboration cases show. When Bybit was hacked in early 2025, other platforms stepped in to lend ETH and help it meet its withdrawal obligations — a rare but powerful sign of solidarity in the face of crisis.As well-funded, highly organized groups continue to test the system, one thing becomes clear: manipulating the market may be relatively easy — but doing so without being detected is increasingly difficult. Collective vigilance, data sharing, and early detection are becoming the most effective tools in safeguarding the integrity of the crypto trading ecosystem.Opinion by: Tracy Jin, Chief Operating Officer, MEXC.

Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.It all started when a Washington, D.C.-based cryptocurrency investor received a suspicious phone call. The person on the other end posed as a security representative from Google. A second call came from someone claiming to be with Gemini, a well-known crypto exchange.What followed was a textbook case of social engineering. The scammers convinced the victim to download software that gave them remote access to his computer. Moments later, 4,100 Bitcoin worth $243 million at the time vanished from his wallets.And that’s when things really got weird.                  How crypto detectives unmasked the thieves behind the $243M heist              The crypto world may seem like the Wild West, but it has its sheriffs. One of them is ZachXBT, a pseudonymous investigator revered for his blockchain detective work.ZachXBT was walking through an airport when he got an alert about suspicious transactions. By the time he was in the air, he’d already traced the stolen funds to a mysterious wallet.Within hours, he and a team of independent investigators started tracking the money across dozens of exchanges, even notifying the platforms to freeze the assets.But the real breakthrough? A video.A source anonymously sent ZachXBT screen recordings of the thieves celebrating the heist, cheering over Discord and flashing millions on-screen. One of them accidentally revealed his real name: Veer Chetal, an 18-year-old honor student from Danbury, Connecticut.Yes, the same Danbury where the kidnapping took place.Did you know? In January 2025, Ledger co-founder David Balland was kidnapped in France and later safely released following a police intervention. The abduction was linked to a cryptocurrency ransom demand, highlighting the growing intersection of digital assets and real-world crime.                  Real-world consequences: The kidnapping of Veer’s parents              Just one week after the digital heist, Sushil and Radhika Chetal (Veer’s parents) were house-hunting in their $240,000 Lamborghini Urus when two vehicles ambushed them. Authorities have described Veer’s parents solely as victims of the kidnapping, with no indication they were involved in the crypto theft.Reportedly, armed attackers dragged the couple into a van, bound them with duct tape and fled the scene. Thankfully, quick-thinking bystanders (including an off-duty FBI agent) helped police track the van. The Chetals were rescued, and four of the six suspects were caught within hours.But why target the parents?It turned out the motive was chilling: Veer’s co-conspirators wanted to extort him. They knew he was involved in the crypto theft. Now, they viewed his parents as leverage to force him to share the loot — or more of it.From Minecraft to multimillion-dollar crimeVeer Chetal wasn’t just some teenager with a knack for crypto. He was allegedly part of “the Com,” an underground online collective that evolved from Minecraft servers and video game scams into a sophisticated criminal network involved in everything from SIM swapping to crypto fraud.His path from honor student to alleged cybercriminal seems to have accelerated fast. Classmates noticed him suddenly showing up to school in a Corvette, then a BMW, then a Lamborghini. He threw parties on yachts and wore luxury brands that most teens have only seen in rap videos.His digital partner in crime? Malone Lam, a Singaporean hacker known in online circles as “Greavys” and “Anne Hathaway.” After the heist, Lam blew through millions on nightclubs, cars and champagne in Los Angeles and Miami, even trolling ZachXBT online by holding up signs mocking him in clubs.                  The collapse: Arrests, raids and guilty pleas              The lavish lifestyle didn’t last long. The FBI, aided by crypto investigators, tracked Lam, Veer and others across states and continents.Here’s what happened:Lam was arrested in Miami after a SWAT-style raid on a mansion he’d rented.Another suspect was caught at LAX wearing a $500,000 watch.Veer was quietly arrested, too, the son of the kidnapped couple, and is now facing federal charges.By March 2025, five out of six of the Florida-based kidnappers had pleaded guilty. They face up to 15 years in prison. Others involved in the digital theft are still under investigation, and a federal wallet now holds the recovered Bitcoin.Did you know? Despite using sophisticated laundering methods, one co-conspirator failed to use a VPN, exposing his location through an IP address tied to a high-end rental. Authorities traced him to Jeandiel Serrano, aka VersaceGod, who was enjoying a vacation in the Maldives by the time they caught up with him.                  The growing link between digital crime and real-world consequences              What’s frightening is how seamlessly this crime flowed from the digital world into the physical. As cybersecurity expert Allison Nixon put it: “We are seeing an evolution from disorganized crime to organized crime, and we are somewhere in the middle point of that.”Groups like the Com are no longer just pranksters or hackers; they're hardened, organized, and increasingly violent. They share success stories and flaunt wealth, recruiting the next generation through Discord, Telegram and Minecraft.The $243 million crypto heist that led to a real-world kidnapping is more than just a headline. It’s a warning. It shows how cybercrime no longer stays online, and how youthful arrogance, digital anonymity and unchecked greed can have very real-world consequences.And as fast as this group got rich, they got caught even faster.Ultimately, not even Lamborghinis and champagne could protect them from the blockchain breadcrumbs they left behind.                  The dark side of crypto and the need for vigilance              While cryptocurrency offers many advantages, it also has a darker side that cannot be ignored. The very features that make crypto attractive — decentralization, anonymity and ease of transfer — are also what make it a breeding ground for illegal activities. From money laundering and fraud to scams and cybercrime, crypto has become a tool for a wide range of criminals. The lure of quick profits and easy money, combined with the anonymity of digital currencies, makes crypto especially appealing to young, impressionable individuals. Many are introduced to it through seemingly harmless channels, such as online gaming or social media, where they may encounter cybercriminals looking to recruit the next generation of offenders. This makes it all the more important for parents and guardians to stay aware of their child’s digital activities and online behavior.Cryptocurrency is not inherently dangerous, but it can open the door to hazardous paths if misused. For those new to the space, it’s crucial to understand the risks involved. Scammers can use sophisticated techniques to deceive and steal, and the lack of regulation can leave victims without recourse. As crypto continues to grow in popularity, the potential for cybercrime will likely expand, and the consequences of digital theft could become more severe and tangible.Keeping an eye on your child's digital activityWith the rise of cryptocurrencies, it’s essential for parents to educate their children about the risks associated with digital assets. Keeping an eye on their online interactions, including the apps, games and forums they frequent, is critical in ensuring they don't fall prey to digital criminals. Encouraging open conversations about internet safety, teaching them about the dangers of sharing personal information online and monitoring their digital wallets are simple yet effective ways to protect them from the darker side of crypto.As the boundaries between the digital world and real-world consequences continue to blur, it’s important to stay vigilant. Whether it’s ensuring your child’s safety in the digital space or understanding the broader risks posed by crypto, being proactive can help navigate the ever-evolving landscape of digital finance. By taking precautions and staying informed, you can harness the benefits of cryptocurrency while minimizing its dangers.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-a-243-million-crypto-heist-led-to-a-real-world-kidnapping?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

The announcement follows multiple US lawmakers expressing concern over the initiative.In late April, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren called on government officials to address questions related to Trump’s memecoin and his media company. Controversies grew after Trump announced a dinner and White House tour for some holders of his TRUMP memecoin.“President Trump’s announcement promises exclusive access to the presidency in exchange for significant investment in one of the President’s business ventures,” a letter co-signed by California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff read.A call for impeachment over a memecoinAlso in late April, Senator Jon Ossoff expressed support for impeaching Trump during an April 25 town hall, citing the president’s plan to host the dinner for top TRUMP memecoin holders. He said:“When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him. There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.”Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis and at least one other Republican in Congress were reportedly also critical of Trump for offering the top holders of his memecoin a dinner and White House tour. Lummis, of Wyoming, reportedly said that the US president offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.”In a May 4 post on X, Warren claimed the Trump family’s stablecoin surged in market value due to a “shady crypto deal with the United Arab Emirates,” which involved settling the investment using USD1. She argued this raised serious national security concerns and warned against the Senate passing crypto-friendly legislation.Warren expressed concerns around foreign involvement in the US president’s finances. She also suggested that the Senate should refrain from approving pro-crypto bills:“The Senate shouldn’t pass a crypto bill this week to facilitate this kind of corruption.“Related: America’s crypto renaissance is already failing; but we can fix itSource: Elizabeth WarrenWarren’s post included a clip from a recent interview during which Trump gave conflicting answers to whether he has profited from the crypto memecoin he launched in January, just days before he reentered the White House. During the clip, the president claims not to have “even looked” to check whether he profited off his endeavours.Related: Elizabeth Warren joins call for probe of Trump over crypto tokensThe United Arab Emirates dealWarren was likely referring to the recent deal that saw Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX use USD1 to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.

He said during the event:“The US is seeing that the financial world has to progress. It’s a joke. Why do banks run nine to five, Monday to Friday, with an hour and a half of lunch break? It doesn’t make sense.”Much like the memecoin, the USD1 stablecoin also attracted its fair share of criticism.

As a rule, the setup resolves when the price breaks below the flat support level and falls by as much as the triangle’s maximum height.XRP/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe bulls are struggling to keep XRP above the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $2.18, signaling a lack of strength.If this trend continues, a close below the moving averages, namely the 50-day SMA and the 100-day SMA at $2.06, could sink the XRP/USDT pair to the psychological support level at $2.00. Related: Is XRP price going to crash again?If this support fails, XRP price could tumble toward the downside target at around $1.20 by the end of May, down 45% from current price levels.XRP’s descending triangle target echoes an earlier analysis that warned of a possible decline to as low as $1.61 if key support levels don’t hold.Conversely, a clear breakout above the triangle’s resistance line at $2.18 will invalidate the bearish structure, putting XRP in a good position to rally toward the $3.00 psychological level.Declining XRP network activityThe XRP Ledger has experienced a significant drop in network activity compared to Q1 2025. Onchain data from Glassnode shows that the network's daily active addresses (DAAs) are now far below March's peak. On March 19, the ledger recorded a robust 608,000 DAAs, reflecting high user engagement and transaction activity. However, this metric crashed in April and early May, as shown in the chart below. With only around 30,000 daily active addresses, user transactions have decreased, possibly signaling reduced interest or a lack of confidence in XRP's near-term outlook.XRP Daily Active Addresses. Source: GlassnodeHistorically, declines in network activity typically signal upcoming price stagnation or drops, as lower transaction volume reduces liquidity and buying pressure.Meanwhile, XRP’s 1.17% drop over the last 24 hours is accompanied by a 30% increase in daily trading volume to $2 billion. Trading volume increases amid a price decline can be interpreted as profit-taking or repositioning by crypto traders as they wait for XRP’s next move. Popular analyst Dom commented on the increased selling volume, pointing out that “a large amount of market selling over the last week” is why XRP failed to sustain upward moves. Source: DomThis article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

He noted that consumer-focused applications, in particular, are thriving in the network.Web2.5 is a term used to describe platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. These applications avoid full decentralization, often drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.  Ash Pampati at the Token2049 media lounge in Dubai. Source: CointelegraphConsumer-focused Web2.5 platforms generate revenue on AptosPampati told Cointelegraph that one of the trends he sees within the Aptos ecosystem is that founders want to build “great consumer experiences.” He said the Aptos network was built to support projects with almost a Web2-like scale. Because of its Meta origins, Aptos has a developer stack focusing on abstracting friction away from Web3. Pampati described this as more of a Web2 user experience “without sacrificing Web3 principles.” He said platforms that followed such models had found success within the ecosystem:“We see a lot of great consumer Web 2.5 platforms emerging. So, those that are focused on distribution and those that are focused on fan loyalty are also generating tons of revenue because they've created great products.”Pampati said the trend is mainly influenced by their developer stack and what the Aptos platform offers, which focuses on broad consumer applications. Related: From digital identity to outer space: Projects push crypto use casesThe challenge of attracting the next million usersWhile Web2.5 applications address some of the user experience problems for crypto and Web3, Pampati said that one of the challenges in the space remains the onboarding of non-crypto natives to the industry. “I think the biggest challenge is trying to predict the next catalyst that pulls forward the next million, 10 million users into crypto. I think there’s a lot of tendency to go and refight old wars,” Pampati told Cointelegraph, adding that founders often move back into concepts like memecoins and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Still, he said, finding the next catalyst to spur broader mainstream adoption will require creating something new. Pampati added that collaborating and motivating founders to “see through the corners and not just try to recreate what’s already been created before” remains a challenge.

2025-05-05T10:00:28.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin says rollups must prove security before decentralizing","Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has explained when he believes rollup-based layer-2 platforms should go decentralized, and why “as soon as possible” is not the correct answer.In a May 5 X post, Buterin explained that there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang explained in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:“Not all code is created equal. A rollup can be Stage 2, but running fresh code that’s never been tested under real stress.“Rollup development is classified into stages: stage zero, stage one and stage two. Each stage is increasingly decentralized, with stage two being fully decentralized and trustless.Related: Vitalik Buterin’s vision for Ethereum: Pectra, Glamsterdam and beyondCode that experienced warCryptocurrency systems that manage significant assets are exposed to profit-motivated bad actors worldwide. Even if a project does not feature a bug bounty program promising payments to people who find vulnerabilities, it is still taken apart under a microscope — it may just pay more for found faults.This threat is growing as nation-state-backed bad actors increase their crypto activity level. One such example is the Lazarus hacking group, responsible for many high-profile hacks in the crypto space, including the $1.4 billion ByBit hack.Wang suggested introducing a new metric for veteran code that survived the pressure of being exposed to highly motivated advanced hackers and hacker groups: “BattleTested.”  The BattleTested badge would be awarded to a rollup that consistently secured at least $100 million of assets for at least six months, with at least $50 million being in Ether (ETH) and a major stablecoin.Also, this badge would be lost at every update, as the new code needs to survive the onslaught of attackers to earn it as well. Buterin commented on the analysis:“A good reminder that stage 2 is not the only thing that matters for security: the quality of the underlying proof system matters too.“Analyst at Kronos Research Dominick John told Cointelegraph that “to responsibly transition from stage 1 to stage 2, rollup teams must […] take a hard look at correlated risks like shared custody weaknesses or geopolitical chokepoints that can compromise the reliability of multisig security councils.” He said that such risks often go unnoticed until the locked value crosses $100 million. He added:“The real green light for decentralization comes not when the proof system looks good on paper, but when it proves under real economic pressure that it’s more reliable than the potential for coordinated failures among council members.“Related: Vitalik wants to make Ethereum ‘as simple as Bitcoin’ in 5 yearsWhen to go decentralized?Buterin explained that the best time for a protocol to go decentralized is when its onchain proof system is safe enough for the centralized components serving as a centralized point of failure or collusion risk to be the bigger threat. This is because until a system is proven to be secure enough, decentralization, which increases the reliance on this system, may end up making the system less secure.Chart showing example rollup risk analysis per stage. Source: Vitalik ButerinMike Tiutin, chief technology officer at decentralized compliance protocol PureFi, told Cointelegraph that “going decentralized too early […] can leave users vulnerable.” John explained that “decentralization isn’t a race, it’s a long-term responsibility shared by the entire ecosystem.” He explained that rushing to stage two puts ideology before safety and increases risks:“In stage one, councils can step in if something breaks. In Stage 2, a single bug could wipe out billions with no rollback.”While going decentralized right away is recognized as problematic, many experts highlight the issue of not going decentralized at all. Arthur Breitman, co-founder of the Tezos blockchain, told Cointelegraph that “prominent Ethereum L2s” are “fundamentally custodial”:“Privileged entities control core logic, jeopardizing asset integrity; banking on their immunity to collusion is fragile, and failure is likely to be correlated.“Magazine: What are native rollups?

2025-05-05T09:00:00.000Z,"America’s crypto renaissance is already failing; but we can fix it","Opinion by: Shane Molidor, Founder, ForgdFor years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to create the conditions that would make that happen. Killing crypto in AmericaEvery crypto project faces the same fundamental problem: Achieving decentralization is critical to avoid regulatory scrutiny, but until a project launches its token, a degree of centralization is unavoidable.The SEC’s outdated Howey test ensures that nearly every legitimate crypto project gets classified as a security. The logic is self-defeating. Projects can’t decentralize without launching a token, but launching a token in the US instantly puts them in the SEC’s crosshairs.This isn’t just a theoretical issue; it has real consequences. Liquidity providers, essential for all new token launches, won’t engage with US-based projects because they assume their tokens will be classified as securities. Centralized exchanges refuse to list tokens issued from US entities for the same reason. Even decentralized exchanges face pressure from their legal teams to avoid actively seeding liquidity for American projects. The result? US founders are boxed out of the global crypto economy before they even get started.Offshore jurisdictions are winningThis regulatory failure has spawned an entire cottage industry of offshore legal firms specializing in setting up token-issuing entities. With its FINMA no-action letter system, Switzerland has become a hotbed for crypto projects because it offers one of the few structured ways to get legal clarity on a token’s classification. The Cayman Islands and British Virgin Islands have also established themselves as crypto safe havens, providing flexible corporate structures that allow projects to operate with far less regulatory risk. Recent: US Treasury wants to cut off Huione over ties to crypto crimeThe absurdity is that the actual work — the development, the hiring, the innovation — still happens in the US. The token issuance gets pushed offshore via “Associations” and “Foundations,” which serve non-profits operating independently of US-based development shops. American founders are forced to funnel money into unnecessary legal fees, overseas operators, and shell foundations to avoid the inevitable crackdown from US regulators. This isn’t just bad for crypto; it’s bad for America. Until it can be solved, the US will continue to hemorrhage talent, investment, and influence to less myopic jurisdictions.Make America crypto-friendlyThe US has spent years fumbling crypto policy, and now, even with an administration that claims to be pro-crypto, it’s still failing to deliver real change. The solution isn’t to promise capital gains tax exemptions on crypto, as some have suggested. That does little to ameliorate the punishing regulatory landscape US-based projects are forced to navigate. If the US truly wants to lead in crypto, it also must take the lead in providing regulatory clarity.That means finally recognizing that the same regulations that have governed traditional financial markets can’t always be applied to crypto. The Howey test doesn’t work. Instead, the government must provide a new and functional legal framework for the crypto industry. It’s time for US legislators and regulators to acknowledge that crypto tokens can’t achieve decentralization instantaneously and almost always require the efforts of a team of core contributors to bootstrap initial growth and development. The federal government must devise a version of the Howey test that does not automatically classify every new crypto token as a security but instead allows tokens a grace period to decentralize. In conjunction with this, the US must establish new protections to ensure insiders aren’t unduly benefiting from crypto projects while they scale. In addition to swiftly ending the “regulation by enforcement” approach employed under Gary Gensler’s SEC, a tactic seemingly designed to gradually smother crypto activity in the US, the government must provide clear guidelines. It needs to be feasible for market makers to evaluate whether US tokens are commodities or securities with a degree of stability and predictability. This is the only way to end the blanket bans market makers have placed on US tokens and bring crypto development back to America.America’s window of opportunity is closingCrypto founders aren’t waiting for Washington to figure it out. Every day, without clear regulations, more crypto projects are incorporated offshore. The US doesn’t even need to “embrace” crypto. It just needs to stop actively driving it away.If this administration truly wants to make the US the leader in crypto, it needs to move beyond campaign slogans and start fixing the fundamental problems that forced this industry offshore in the first place. And it needs to act fast. Opinion by: Shane Molidor, Founder, Forgd. This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

Source: CointelegraphGamers want a “fun time” with friends In 2024, Notcoin was one of Telegram’s most popular tap-to-earn games, onboarding more than 30 million users within three months of its release. In a previous interview, Sasha attributed the game’s growth to its ability to “solve the issue” of onboarding Telegram users into crypto. While Telegram gaming exploded in 2024, gamers soon went game-hopping, moving to other games as soon as they “farmed” what they could in one project. Sasha told Cointelegraph: “Users who come to farm — their motivation is just to earn something. And with games, it’s more like I have fun, I want to play with my friends, and I want to play within a group.”He added that while Telegram’s first wave of games didn’t provide that social element, Web3 can still play a vital role in the platform’s gaming ecosystem.He told Cointelegraph that Telegram games started to shift to models that move away from simply “farming” tokens. In these new experiences, the Web3 economy part becomes an “add-on” instead of the main value proposition. However, development may take some time. Sasha told Cointelegraph that Telegram has no “real games” yet, but is optimistic for the future.How artificial intelligence improves Web3 gaming developmentVladimir told Cointelegraph that artificial intelligence and Telegram have made creating games easier for Web3 developers. The Notcoin co-founder said that the advent of AI technology allowed developers to be faster and more efficient when writing game code:“It saves time. My speed of delivery becomes faster. I write code faster than usual because I save a lot of time on other easy tasks.”However, he urged developers to pay attention when using AI when creating their projects. “You have to pay a lot of attention, have the expertise and experience because you have to see like how the API will work, how it will be connected to each other, how it will work on high load with a lot of users,” Vladimir said. Related: Web3 games with one wallet still the vision for players — The SandboxTelegram Web3 gaming to grow exponentiallyWhen asked if Telegram’s Web3 gaming industry will still grow despite the perceived death of tap-to-earn, Salo told Cointelegraph that Telegram has a market similar to Facebook and WeChat, which are platforms with their own gaming ecosystems. “We believe in our chances because we already have a similar platform like WeChat and Facebook that already have their game ecosystems, and it’s a huge market. The number of users is practically the same,” she said. Salo noted that Telegram’s gaming scene currently lacks major publishers and investor funding, but she expects exponential growth.  Salo added that they’re trying to get to a point where gamers play not just to get tokens but because it’s fun. “We're trying to get this extra part, like this ‘fun’ with something that people are doing not only for money, just for themselves,” Salo said. Magazine: TV hit Peaky Blinders to launch crypto game, FIFA Rivals on Polkadot: Web3 Gamer",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/notcoin-telegram-gaming-tap-to-earn-dead-token2049?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-05T08:05:00.000Z,"How cybercriminals are exploiting digital twins to scam crypto users","What is a digital twin?              A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In essence, they help prevent costly mistakes by modeling complex systems in the virtual world before implementing them in the real world.Digital twins have taken on a darker role in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. Cybercriminals use digital twin technology rather than simulating physical objects to create synthetic identities, replicas of real individuals, often derived from stolen data. These digital copies are then used to infiltrate online communities, impersonate influencers or executives, or manipulate systems for financial gain.                  How cybercriminals weaponize digital twins to scam crypto users              In the crypto world, where anonymity and trustless transactions reign supreme, digital twins have emerged as a potent tool for cybercriminals to exploit. Scammers can take advantage of the decentralized, unregulated nature of crypto platforms to perpetrate these frauds.  Here’s a deeper look at how scammers weaponize digital twins:Identity cloning: Cybercriminals gather personal data from social media, data breaches and other online sources to create a highly accurate digital twin of a real person. This might include images, voice recordings, writing style and even behavioral patterns. Once the digital twin is created, it can be used to impersonate individuals and gain trust from others in the crypto community.Fake influencers or advisers: Crypto influencers, who often command significant trust and attention, are prime targets for digital twin scams. By replicating their speech patterns, mannerisms and even generating deepfake videos, scammers can pose as trusted personalities in the space. These fake versions may promote fraudulent investment schemes, fake tokens or manipulate users into sending crypto to scam wallets.Synthetic KYC (Know Your Customer) scams: Some digital twins are created to bypass KYC processes on exchanges or decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Attackers can generate fake identities and provide forged documents or images to appear legitimate, gaining access to accounts or executing unauthorized transactions. This can enable criminals to launder stolen funds or impersonate legitimate traders.Phishing with personalization: Phishing scams in the crypto space often target individuals with highly personalized messages. When a scammer creates a digital twin of a known figure, they can tailor their communications to appear more convincing. By using these personalized messages, they trick victims into clicking on malicious links, giving away private keys or downloading harmful software.Did you know? In 2023, a Hong Kong finance employee was tricked into transferring $25 million after joining a video call with what turned out to be deepfake versions of their colleagues, generated using publicly available footage.                  Examples of digital twin-related scams in crypto              While digital twin scams in crypto might sound futuristic, they’re already happening, and AI is a big part of the problem. These scams don’t always rely on evil digital twins alone; many use deepfake videos, AI-generated profiles and hallucinated interfaces to deceive users. Here are some real-world examples:Deepfake CEO scam defrauds chief financial officer via video call: In a sophisticated attack, scammers created digital avatars of a company’s CEO and executives using publicly available video materials. They conducted a video call with the company’s chief financial officer, convincing him to transfer funds under false pretenses. The digital twins were so convincing that the executive did not suspect foul play during the call.UI spoofing mimics trusted crypto platforms: Cybercriminals have employed UI spoofing to create near-perfect replicas of legitimate cryptocurrency platforms. These counterfeit interfaces trick users into entering sensitive information or making transactions, believing they are interacting with the real platform. The high fidelity of these digital twins makes them particularly dangerous, as they can bypass traditional security measures.AdmiralsFX scam uses deepfakes to lure investors: A large-scale scam operated by a call center in Tbilisi, Georgia, used deepfake videos of celebrities to promote a fraudulent cryptocurrency investment platform called AdmiralsFX. Victims were shown AI-generated videos of public figures endorsing the platform, leading them to invest substantial amounts of money. The operation defrauded over 6,000 individuals, highlighting the potent combination of deepfake technology and social engineering.                  How to spot interactions with evil digital twins: 6 Red flags              Digital twin scams rely on sophisticated impersonation techniques, and scammers often use synthetic identities to build trust and manipulate their targets. To help you stay alert, here are six red flags that can help you identify interactions with synthetic identities. Watch for these warning signs to protect yourself from falling victim to fraud.Digital twin scams in crypto often hide behind polished, AI-generated responses that sound perfect but lack authenticity. If someone avoids live video calls and instead offers pre-recorded clips or deepfakes, be skeptical. Real people show up. Scammers frequently use urgency, pushing you to act fast with phrases like “limited offer” to bypass your judgment. One major red flag is receiving unverified crypto requests via DMs — legit professionals don’t do that. Always check profiles for inconsistencies like low follower counts or recent creation dates. Finally, be wary if someone insists on sticking to one platform and refuses to switch to secure or verified channels. These tactics combined often signal a coordinated scam using digital twin or AI deception.Did you know? Unlike traditional simulations, digital twins are dynamic virtual environments powered by real-time data. While a simulation models one process, a digital twin can run multiple simulations at once, constantly learning and adapting through a live feedback loop.                  Can blockchain help prevent digital twin-powered crypto scams?              While blockchain technology is often targeted by cybercriminals due to its decentralized and pseudonymous nature, it also holds the potential to offer powerful solutions for combating digital twin-based scams.Blockchain, with its transparent and immutable features, provides unique tools that can help verify identities and secure transactions, making it harder for scammers to manipulate the system. Leveraging blockchain’s capabilities introduces robust security layers that verify the legitimacy of interactions, helping reduce fraud, identity theft and digital impersonation.Onchain identity verification: One of the most important developments in blockchain technology is the concept of decentralized identity (DID). With DID, individuals can verify their identity on the blockchain without relying on centralized authorities. This ensures that scammers cannot create synthetic identities without being detected. Blockchain provides a transparent, secure and verifiable system for managing identities, reducing the risk of impersonation.NFT identity markers: Some platforms use non-fungible tokens (NFT) as a form of digital identity. NFTs are unique and traceable on the blockchain, which makes it much harder to clone someone’s identity. If you’re engaging with a person who has a verified NFT identity, you can be more confident that they are who they claim to be.Immutable audit trails: Every transaction on the blockchain is permanently recorded and timestamped. This means that if someone tries to impersonate another person or create a fraudulent identity, their actions leave a trace. If a synthetic identity is used to scam individuals, the blockchain’s audit trail can help authorities track the perpetrator.Smart contract protections: Smart contracts on blockchain can be used to implement certain safeguards. For instance, smart contracts can include identity verification processes, ensuring that transactions aren’t processed unless the user’s identity is verified. This can help prevent users from sending crypto to scammers using fake identities.While not a silver bullet, blockchain can significantly strengthen trust and security in increasingly AI-powered digital environments.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/how-cybercriminals-are-exploiting-digital-twins-to-scam-crypto-users?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market. Here are five major stablecoin initiatives projected to grow crypto adoption.Tether to relaunch in the USStablecoin giant Tether is eyeing a relaunch in the US with a dollar-based stablecoin. Tether’s USDt (USDT) is already known worldwide as the largest stablecoin on the market, providing liquidity to crypto trading pairs on numerous exchanges. However, Tether has found itself in hot water with regulators over proof of its reserves, other financial transparency and Anti-Money Laundering concerns. In an April 30 interview with CNBC, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino announced that the firm wants to launch a rebranded coin in the US, separate from its ubiquitous international stablecoin. “A domestic stablecoin would be different from the international stablecoin,” he said.Tether holds the lion’s share of the stablecoin market. Source: NansenThe move would give Tether access to US financial markets as the latter’s exposure to crypto widens under the pro-crypto administration of US President Donald Trump.Trump dabbles in the dollar with USD1At the beginning of March, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the cryptocurrency project tied to the Trump family, launched its dollar-backed stablecoin, USD1, on the BNB Chain and Ethereum.According to CoinMarketCap, the coin has over $2 billion in market capitalization at publishing time. The stablecoins follow other high-profile crypto projects that use the president’s personal brand as a marketing tool, namely the TRUMP and WLFI memecoins that launched ahead of Trump’s inauguration. Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs a legal house of cards?Trump’s ability to influence stablecoin policy has led a group of US senators to call for an inquiry into his personal interests in the project, calling it a clear conflict of interest.

Bridge was founded by two former Coinbase executives, Zach Abrams and Sean Yu, in 2022 and competes with firms using the ubiquitous SWIFT global payments system. The stablecoin initiative is the latest development in the firm’s expanding crypto plans. After a false start on Bitcoin support in 2014, the firm began rebuilding its crypto team in earnest in 2021. On Oct. 9, 2024, the firm opened USDC support for users in 70 countries. UAE’s largest bank to issue stablecoinAbu Dhabi’s International Holding Company, Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) partnered to launch a dirham-backed stablecoin on April 28.According to The National, FAB — the largest bank in the UAE — will issue the stablecoin on the ADI network pending approval from the central bank. The ADI network is a project of the ADI Foundation in Abu Dhabi, which itself is a nonprofit organization founded by Sirius International Holding, a local holding firm with a $243 billion market capitalization. The firms claim that the stablecoin will “have a significant impact on various industries, including finance, commerce, and trade.”Related: Stablecoin adoption grows with new US bills, Japan’s open approachVisa, SBI and Mastercard add more stablecoin support New stablecoin issuances are picking up the pace, and payments firms, banks and financial institutions are adding support for them as well.On April 28, international payments giant Mastercard partnered with OKX to expand its stablecoin card options, which allow cardholders to spend stablecoins through their Mastercard linked with prominent crypto firms. Two days later, Visa announced that it partnered with Stripe and Bridge on April 30 to offer stablecoin payments on its network in Latin America, starting with Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Chile.SBI VC Trade, the cryptocurrency subsidiary of the Japanese financial conglomerate SBI, said it was preparing to add support for USDC after local regulators softened their approach to foreign stablecoins. Pending formal approval, the trading platform will be one of the first in Japan to offer cryptocurrency trading in USDC (USDC).SBI VC Trade CEO Tomohiko Kondo shows the firm getting the go-ahead from Japanese regulators.

Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.”Trump launched his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 17, which hit a peak of $73.43 two days later, just a day before he was inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, according to CoinGecko.The token has been in a steady decline since launch, but it surged late last month after its website offered top holders a chance to dine with Trump on May 22. It's currently trading at $11.35, down nearly 85% from its peak.Trump was apparently unaware of his token’s recent surge, repeatedly asking how much it was now worth.  Two companies, CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of Trump’s sprawling Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which is co-owned by CIC Digital, together own 80% of the token’s total 1 billion supply.Most of those tokens are locked up and will be released over the next three years. The first unlock on April 18 saw 40 million tokens, worth $454 million, go to CIC Digital. Trump-controlled entities own 80% of the TRUMP token supply, which will be released periodically until 2028. Source: Trump MemeTrump’s memecoin project has made at least $350 million so far, according to a March analysis from the Financial Times, which found those behind the token made $314 million from selling them and $36 million from fees.Trump has been criticized over his many crypto dealings, which his opponents say are a conflict of interest as he looks to unburden the sector from regulators. Even those in his own party, Republican Senators Cynthia Lummis and Lisa Murkowski, have criticized Trump’s dinner offer to his top tokenholders. Trump said during the interview that he would contribute his presidential salary “back to the government,” prompting Welker to ask if he would also contribute any potential crypto earnings.“I never thought of that,” Trump answered. “I mean, should I contribute all of my real estate that I’ve owned for many years if it goes up a little bit because I’m president and doing a good job? I don’t think so.”Trump reiterates crypto commitmentIn a part of the interview, Trump made a meandering statement that reiterated his campaign promise to support crypto.“I want crypto. I think crypto’s important because if we don’t do it, China’s going to. And it’s new, it’s very popular, it’s very hot,” he said.Trump claimed former President Joe Biden “went after it violently, and then, before the election, he changed his tune entirely” to garner the crypto vote.

2025-05-05T05:32:12.000Z,"Industry calls for urgent crypto law reforms after Australian election","The Australian crypto industry has called on the newly reelected Labor government to urgently make digital asset legislation a top priority to ensure Australia doesn’t fall further behind global markets.The incumbent Australian Labor Party was returned in a landslide on May 3, picking up 54.9% of the two-party-preferred vote, against the Liberal and National Parties on 45.1%. Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days. Joy Lam, Binance’s head of global regulatory and APAC legal, said the exchange has been consulting with Treasury officials since late 2023 about its proposed legislation, and it was now time for action.“Timing is really quite critical now because obviously it's something that has been discussed and kicked around for quite a few years,” she told Cointelegraph. Coinbase managing director for APAC John O’Loghlen said the reelected Albanese Government has the “opportunity and the responsibility to move quickly on this issue” and called for a Crypto-Asset Taskforce to be established within its first 100 days “with the aim of bringing forward legislation that protects consumers, promotes innovation, and stops the exodus of talent and capital to other markets.”Reelected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Source: Anthony AlbaneseBTC Markets CEO Caroline Bowler said that “beyond the political implications, this result sets the stage for meaningful progress in Australia’s approach to digital asset regulation.”Lam noted that the UK released its draft regulations last week, stablecoin bills are moving forward in the US, and the EU has already implemented its MiCA legislation.“So there's a very clear shift. Everyone's moving towards providing the regulatory framework that is needed for the industry to develop in a sustainable way. So time is really of the essence now.”Draft crypto legislation within monthsTreasurer Jim Chalmers’ office told Cointelegraph that exposure draft legislation would be released sometime this year for consultation, and any legislated reforms would be “phased in over time to minimize disruptions to existing businesses.”Although the Treasury has draft legislation on “regulating digital asset platforms” and “payments system modernization” scheduled for release by the end of June, Lam isn’t confident. \""I don't know whether this quarter specifically is still sort of the timeline,” she said. Related: Australian election will bring pro-crypto laws either way While the ALP has been attacked by some over not taking any action in its first term in government, that may actually have resulted in a better outcome than legislation that took its cues from the approach of Joe Biden’s administration, which took a hard line on banks dealing with cryptocurrency and viewed most coins as securities. Industry figures report a noticeable evolution in the government’s approach to crypto between when proposals were first put out for consultation at the end of 2023 and when the Treasury released its much more positive “Statement on Developing an innovative Australian digital asset industry” in March this year.Australia Votes running tally on the Australian election. Source: ABC The statement sets out key priorities, such as using the existing Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) regime to underpin the regulation of Digital Asset Platforms and payment stablecoins. It’s focused on the safe custody of client assets by centralized providers and sidesteps issues around decentralized finance platforms. Lam welcomed the use of the AFSL regime. “Obviously, we don't need to reinvent the wheel,” she said. “It’s something that people know and understand. It's a pretty sensible move, and it’s also going to be much easier for regulators.”Tokenization and sandboxThe government will also review the Enhanced Regulatory Sandbox, which aims to provide space for innovative digital asset startups to grow free of red tape. The statement also highlights opportunities with tokenization. Lam said the change in emphasis showed the government has been listening to the industry. “It reflects the industry feedback that they would have received in 2023 as a result of the consultation, as well as the changing landscape because obviously it’s been evolving pretty quickly internationally,” Lam said. “They do have the benefit now of looking at what has worked and hasn’t worked in other jurisdictions, and really building on those lessons.”Dea Markovy, policy director at Fireblocks, told Cointelegraph that “a lot of the groundwork and research is done” and it was looking broadly positive.“Of course, a lot of details are still to come around Australia’s Digital Asset Platforms (DAPs) regime. What is significant here is the willingness of the Government to cut through the complexity and uncertainty on crypto intermediaries licensing.” The securities regulator ASIC released its own crypto regulations proposals (INFO 225) in December, and feedback from those consultations will help inform the government's new legislation. “In essence, it details how different token issuances and crypto intermediation will fit into Australia’s existing securities legislation, providing for a transition period,\"" explained Markovy.The draft guidance suggests NFTs, in-game assets and memecoins are not financial products — the local equivalent of a “security” — while a yield-bearing stablecoin or a gold-backed token probably are.The Treasury statement also highlighted issues with debanking. Lam said that simply regulating the industry would go a long way toward solving the issue.“What we really want from governments and regulators is that clean licensing framework, because that goes a long way to mitigating the risk and giving the banks the comfort that they need,” she said. “And then, there’s probably going to need to be some additional guidance given to banks.”Magazine: ZK-proofs are bringing smart contracts to Bitcoin — BitcoinOS and Starknet",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/industry-calls-urgent-crypto-law-reforms-after-australian-election?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound

2025-05-05T05:19:43.000Z,"US Bitcoin ETFs bought 6x more than BTC miners produced last week","Spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States bought up nearly six times as many Bitcoin as were produced by miners over the last week.The US-based Bitcoin (BTC) funds bought a whopping 18,644 Bitcoin over the past week when only 3,150 BTC were mined for the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4.This accumulation by institutions and ETF issuers represents almost six times the amount of the asset being produced since miners only generate 450 coins per day.  The total inflow for the past five trading days was around $1.8 billion, with a net outflow on April 30, according to Farside Investors. There has only been one outflow day since April 16, as the inflows have mirrored market recovery. Last week’s accumulation followed an increase in BTC spot prices in early May when the asset gained 4% to reach a six-week high of $97,700 on May 2. However, the asset has since retreated to the $94,000 level, which is the same price it traded at this time seven days ago. Spot Bitcoin ETF flows.

Imagine what might happen as these restrictions are lifted.” Litecoin ETF decision due Meanwhile, the Canary Capital spot Litecoin (LTC) ETF filing is due for a second deadline decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission by May 5. The issuer filed for a spot Litecoin ETF alongside a spot XRP ETF in October. “If any asset has a chance of early approval, it’s Litecoin IMO,” said Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on May 5. “Personally think a delay is more likely,” he added. Fellow analyst Eric Balchunas echoed the sentiment earlier this year.More than 70 US crypto ETFs are awaiting an SEC decision this year, Bloomberg reported in April. Magazine: Bitcoin to $1M ‘by 2029,’ CIA tips its hat to Bitcoin: Hodler’s Digest",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/us-bitcoin-etfs-bought-6x-more-btc-than-produced-by-miners-last-week?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
2025-05-05T03:30:34.000Z,"OpenAI ignored experts when it released overly agreeable ChatGPT","OpenAI says it ignored the concerns of its expert testers when it rolled out an update to its flagship ChatGPT artificial intelligence model that made it excessively agreeable.The company released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 that made it “noticeably more sycophantic,” which it then rolled back three days later due to safety concerns, OpenAI said in a May 2 postmortem blog post.The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks, and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests.During the latest model’s review process before it went public, OpenAI said that “some expert testers had indicated that the model’s behavior ‘felt’ slightly off” but decided to launch “due to the positive signals from the users who tried out the model.”“Unfortunately, this was the wrong call,” the company admitted. “The qualitative assessments were hinting at something important, and we should’ve paid closer attention. They were picking up on a blind spot in our other evals and metrics.”OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said on April 27 that it was working to roll back changes making ChatGPT too agreeable. Source: Sam AltmanBroadly, text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weighting, impacting how the model responds.OpenAI said introducing a user feedback reward signal weakened the model’s “primary reward signal, which had been holding sycophancy in check,” which tipped it toward being more obliging.“User feedback in particular can sometimes favor more agreeable responses, likely amplifying the shift we saw,” it added.OpenAI is now checking for suck up answersAfter the updated AI model rolled out, ChatGPT users had complained online about its tendency to shower praise on any idea it was presented, no matter how bad, which led OpenAI to concede in an April 29 blog post that it “was overly flattering or agreeable.”For example, one user told ChatGPT it wanted to start a business selling ice over the internet, which involved selling plain old water for customers to refreeze. Source: Tim LeckembyIn its latest postmortem, it said such behavior from its AI could pose a risk, especially concerning issues such as mental health.“People have started to use ChatGPT for deeply personal advice — something we didn’t see as much even a year ago,” OpenAI said. “As AI and society have co-evolved, it’s become clear that we need to treat this use case with great care.”Related: Crypto users cool with AI dabbling with their portfolios: Survey The company said it had discussed sycophancy risks “for a while,” but it hadn’t been explicitly flagged for internal testing, and it didn’t have specific ways to track sycophancy.Now, it will look to add “sycophancy evaluations” by adjusting its safety review process to “formally consider behavior issues” and will block launching a model if it presents issues.OpenAI also admitted that it didn’t announce the latest model as it expected it “to be a fairly subtle update,” which it has vowed to change. “There’s no such thing as a ‘small’ launch,” the company wrote. “We’ll try to communicate even subtle changes that can meaningfully change how people interact with ChatGPT.”AI Eye: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/openai-ignored-experts-overly-agreeable-chatgpt-model-release?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound
