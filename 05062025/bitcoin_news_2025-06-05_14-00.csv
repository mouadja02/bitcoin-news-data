2025-06-05T11:58:08,"How Bitcoin (BTC) Price Signals For The Continuation Of June: Bullish Or Bearish?","While tariff tensions and developments between the US – China and other countries negatively affected Bitcoin, BTC fell to $74,000 levels in April. Afterwards, BTC started to recover with the moderate steps taken by US President Donald Trump and broke a new record by rising above $111,000 in the last days of May. While tariff tensions have had a significant impact on Bitcoin, Swyftx Chief Analyst Pav Hundal identified Trump’s ongoing tariff uncertainty as a significant threat to Bitcoin. At this point, Pav Hundal said that Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in June if trade tensions in the US ease. “The biggest threat to bulls right now is that nothing changes for the next two months and we get stuck in this endless cycle of tariff uncertainty. If the tariff tensions are resolved, Bitcoin could reach $120,000 in June. However, if the bears say 'I told you so', we could see Bitcoin fall below $100,000.” FED Expects Tariff Uncertainty to Be Resolved for Interest Rate Cuts! Hundal said that tariff uncertainty also delayed the FED's interest rate cut decision, adding that there was a risk that the FED would delay monetary expansion until it obtained concrete data on the impact of Trump's tariffs, which would pose a risk of slowing growth. “Trump-induced tariff uncertainty has jeopardized the achievement of the 2% inflation target this year. Six months ago, a 2% inflation target seemed possible; today, it is under long-term threat from tariffs. The US is at a macro turning point and the Fed is walking a fine line right now.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T11:50:09,"Ethereum (ETH) Explosive Surge Signals Promising Altseason Potential","BitcoinWorld Ethereum (ETH) Explosive Surge Signals Promising Altseason Potential The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, presenting unique dynamics for investors and enthusiasts alike. While Bitcoin (BTC) often dominates headlines, recent data suggests a significant shift is occurring, with Ethereum (ETH) taking the lead in terms of short-term performance. This divergence is sparking conversations across the industry about the potential for a broader rally among altcoins – commonly known as an altseason. Understanding the current landscape requires a close look at the key metrics driving this narrative. What Does Ethereum (ETH)’s Outperformance Mean? Recent analysis from crypto data analytics firm Swissblock, shared on X, highlights a compelling trend: Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated remarkable strength over the past month. Specifically, ETH has surged by an impressive 46% over the last 30 days. This performance substantially outpaces Bitcoin (BTC)’s gains during the same period. This kind of relative strength from the second-largest cryptocurrency is often seen as a significant indicator within the market. The disparity in performance between the two crypto giants is a crucial piece of the puzzle when conducting Crypto Market Analysis. Bitcoin’s movements typically set the tone for the overall market, but when Ethereum begins to show independent strength and outperform BTC, it suggests capital might be rotating down the market cap ladder. Why is the ETH/BTC Ratio So Important? The relationship between Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) is often tracked using the ETH/BTC ratio. This ratio measures the price of one ETH in terms of Bitcoin. A rising ETH/BTC ratio means Ethereum is gaining value relative to Bitcoin, while a falling ratio indicates the opposite. According to Swissblock’s report, the ETH/BTC ratio has increased by 30% over the past 30 days. This substantial jump is a direct consequence of ETH’s superior performance during this period. The ETH/BTC ratio is a critical barometer for market sentiment regarding altcoins. When this ratio trends upward, it often signals increasing confidence and interest in Ethereum and, by extension, the broader altcoin market. Traders and analysts closely watch this ratio for clues about potential market rotations and the likelihood of an Altseason. Is a Breakout Approaching for the ETH/BTC Pair? The growing momentum reflected in the rising ETH/BTC ratio is pushing the pair towards a significant technical level. According to Swissblock, the pair is approaching the upper boundary of its weekly trading range. Technical analysts pay close attention to trading ranges and their boundaries. Here’s why this is noteworthy: Resistance Level: The upper boundary of a trading range typically acts as a resistance level, where selling pressure has historically emerged. Breakout Potential: A successful breakout above this level, especially with strong volume and conviction, is often interpreted as a bullish signal. Trend Confirmation: Clearing this resistance could confirm the strengthening trend of ETH relative to BTC and potentially pave the way for further gains. A breakout from this key technical level for the ETH/BTC pair is considered a potential trigger for a significant shift in market dynamics. Could This Signal the Beginning of an Altseason? The term Altseason refers to a period where altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin) experience significant price increases, often outperforming Bitcoin by a large margin. These periods are characterized by capital flowing from Bitcoin into various altcoins as investors seek higher returns and explore emerging technologies or trends. While there’s no single definitive trigger for an altseason, several factors often precede or accompany one: Bitcoin Stability or Sideways Movement: Bitcoin consolidating after a large rally allows capital to look elsewhere. ETH Leading the Charge: As the largest altcoin by market cap and a major ecosystem driver, Ethereum’s strong performance relative to Bitcoin is often a precursor. Increasing Risk Appetite: Market sentiment becomes more bullish, and investors are willing to take on more risk by investing in smaller, more volatile altcoins. Specific Altcoin Narratives: Hype around particular sectors (like DeFi, NFTs, Layer 2s, AI, etc.) can fuel rallies in related altcoins. The current scenario, with Ethereum (ETH) showing such strong relative strength and the ETH/BTC ratio challenging a key resistance, aligns with historical patterns that have preceded altseasons. A successful breakout could indeed act as the catalyst that broadens the rally beyond just ETH. What Factors Are Driving Demand for Ethereum? Beyond simple speculation, several fundamental factors could be contributing to the rising demand for Ethereum (ETH): 1. Staking Yield: The transition to Proof-of-Stake allows ETH holders to earn yield by staking their tokens, making it an attractive asset for passive income. 2. Ecosystem Activity: Ethereum remains the dominant platform for decentralized applications (DApps), including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 scaling solutions. Increased activity in these areas drives demand for ETH as the network’s native currency for gas fees and participation. 3. Potential ETF Developments: While Bitcoin ETFs have launched, speculation continues regarding the potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions, which could open the door to significant institutional investment. 4. Network Upgrades: Ongoing developments and planned upgrades to the Ethereum network aim to improve scalability, security, and sustainability, enhancing its long-term value proposition. These underlying drivers provide a fundamental basis for ETH’s value, complementing the technical and market-driven factors contributing to its recent outperformance in the Crypto Market Analysis. Challenges and Considerations While the signals are promising, it’s important to consider potential challenges and risks: Bitcoin Volatility: A sudden significant downturn in Bitcoin’s price could negatively impact the entire market, including Ethereum and other altcoins, potentially halting or reversing an altseason. Regulatory Headwinds: Uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrency regulation in major markets can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) and dampen investor enthusiasm. Technical Failure to Break Out: The ETH/BTC pair could fail to break above the weekly range resistance, leading to a retracement and delaying any potential altseason. Market Saturation: While some altcoins may rally, not all will participate equally, and many carry high risks. Navigating the market requires careful consideration of both the bullish signals and the potential pitfalls. Actionable Insights for Readers Given the current market dynamics, what should interested individuals consider? Monitor the ETH/BTC Ratio: Keep a close eye on the ETH/BTC chart, specifically the weekly range upper boundary mentioned by Swissblock. A convincing break and hold above this level would be a strong bullish signal. Research Altcoins: If an altseason materializes, not all altcoins will perform equally. Research projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Manage Risk: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin and Ethereum. Employ proper risk management strategies, such as diversification and setting stop-losses. Stay Informed: Follow market analysis, news, and on-chain data to stay ahead of potential shifts. Concluding Thoughts: Is Altseason Imminent? The data from Swissblock painting a clear picture: Ethereum (ETH) is currently showing significant strength relative to Bitcoin (BTC), marked by a substantial 30-day gain and a rising ETH/BTC ratio challenging key resistance. This technical setup, combined with underlying fundamental drivers for Ethereum, presents a compelling case for the potential start of a new Altseason. While a breakout from the ETH/BTC weekly range boundary is seen as a potential trigger, the market remains subject to broader macroeconomic conditions and Bitcoin’s price action. Investors should view these signals as indicators, not guarantees. The potential is certainly building, but careful observation, research, and risk management remain paramount in navigating the exciting, yet volatile, world of cryptocurrency markets.

The program, known as Stabilize Families, is backed by the nonprofit RISE Together Innovation Institute and the Community Shelter Board in Franklin County, Ohio, reports The Columbus Dispatch. The Community Shelter Board will give 80 families a one-off cash handout of $1,500, while RISE Together Innovation Institute will offer monthly payments of $500 to 20 families for 11 months. Data collected by the Community Shelter Board reportedly shows homelessness in Franklin County in 2024 went up six times faster than the population growth. As of January 23rd, according to the report, there were 2,556 homeless people in the Ohio county, up by 7.4% from 2024. Community Shelter Board’s president and CEO Shannon Isom says the guaranteed income pilot program is “about dignity” and will give the beneficiaries “breathing room to stabilize, plan, and dream again.” The report cites RISE Together Innovation Institute’s CEO Danielle Sydnor saying, “Guaranteed income is a viable strategy to promote economic stability and well-being for residents in Franklin County.” According to the report, Ohio State University will be involved in the guaranteed income pilot program and will conduct research on the project’s impact on beneficiaries and the community.

2025-06-05T11:45:01,"Binance maintains 59% dominance of CEX stablecoin reserves: Data","Binance, the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, controls 59% of all stablecoin reserves across centralized exchanges, according to on-chain data. This accounts for $31.45 billion in USDT and USDC alone. It is more than three times the next closest competitor, OKX, which holds $8.2 billion (15.39%). The stablecoin market cap is on a surge as its capitalization breached the $254 billion mark. Tether’s USDT remains the largest stablecoin with a market cap of more than $153 billion, while USDC remains at the second spot with over $61 billion cap. Hype for stablecoins is such that even Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial launched its dollar-pegged USD1 recently. Binance tops Bitcoin inflows According to the data, Binance dominates in its central role in crypto liquidity, while Coinbase leads in total reserves with $129 billion. Binance stands in the second spot in all reserves, holding $110 billion. Combined, Coinbase and Binance hold 60% of the total reserves held across the top 20 crypto exchanges. As of May, Binance received $31 billion in USDT/USDC deposits. It stood just ahead of Coinbase’s $30 billion. A report mentioned that the biggest crypto exchange by trading volume has attracted $180 billion in cumulative stablecoin inflows. Meanwhile, Coinbase does not provide a public Proof-of-Reserves (PoR), but Binance offers transparent PoR reports, and this includes wallet addresses. It added that Coinbase and Binance bagged the largest cumulative inflows in USD terms in 2025. These figures turn out to be $344 and $335 billion, respectively. However, Binance showed the highest average Bitcoin inflow . On May 22, as Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of over $111,900, the exchange saw an average BTC deposit size of 7 BTC, the biggest among major exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant On the other side, major exchanges’ average deposits were lower. Bitfinex accounted for 5, OKX for 1.23, and it was less than 1 BTC for Kraken and Coinbase. Stablecoin boom and politics collide This surge comes as the US Senate is heading into the final stretch of debate on the GENIUS Act . The stablecoin bill could become the first major crypto legislation to pass the chamber as it seeks to regulate the issuers of dollar-pegged tokens like USDT and USDC. However, it has already cleared the Banking Committee and passed an early floor test with bipartisan support. Some Democrats have begun linking the bill to Donald Trump’s personal crypto ventures. This includes one of the projects closely tied to the president, USD1 . Backed by World Liberty Financial, USD1 has exploded in usage. In just 10 days after its Binance listing, the stablecoin recorded over $10.7 billion in transfer volume. Data shows that from May 22 to June 1, trading volumes surged past all prior records. The week of May 19 alone saw a 1,300% jump in transfer activity. It soared from $307M to $4.3 billion, and by June 1, USD1 had already logged another $6.8 billion, setting a new weekly high. That surge follows a rapid rise in market cap as USD1 broke into the top six stablecoins in May, surpassing $2 billion. For lawmakers, this growth complicates the GENIUS Act’s final steps, as some argue the legislation could benefit Trump-linked ventures.

2025-06-05T11:40:38,"Senator Lummis Pushes Crypto Tax Crackdown in GOP Bill","The post Senator Lummis Pushes Crypto Tax Crackdown in GOP Bill appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) is making a strong move to reshape how the U.S. taxes crypto by pushing to include key digital asset provisions in the Senate Republicans’ 2025 tax-and-spending bill. A longtime Bitcoin supporter, Lummis is working with Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) to fold in parts of her bipartisan crypto regulation bill , co-authored with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Her proposals aim to close tax loopholes and support the crypto industry – though not everyone is on the same page. Crypto Wash-Sale Rule Could Raise Billions One of Lummis’s main proposals is to apply the wash-sale rule to crypto. This would stop investors from selling their digital assets at a loss and quickly buying them back to reduce their tax bills – a common tactic that isn’t currently restricted for crypto. Lummis told Semafor, “This bill is the right place to fix crypto taxation,” but skeptics, including Gillibrand, call it “premature,” citing risks of rushed policy. Bitcoin Miners May Catch a Break Another part of Lummis’s plan would exempt Bitcoin miners from reporting capital gains and losses. This would ease the reporting burden on miners, who often face confusing tax requirements despite playing a major role in the crypto ecosystem. This proposal reflects Lummis’s ongoing support for the industry, but it’s expected to face resistance in a divided Senate. Trump Weighs In on GOP Tax Bill On Wednesday, members of the Senate Finance Committee, including Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), met with President Donald Trump at the White House to discuss the bill. According to Cassidy, Trump is focused on including “working account benefits,” adding more complexity to ongoing negotiations. A Defining Moment for U.S. Crypto Policy With the 2025 tax cuts set to expire soon, Lummis’s proposals could help set the direction for how digital assets are taxed and regulated going forward. If adopted, they could provide clarity to the crypto market while also boosting federal revenue. But with mixed support – even among allies – the road ahead for these reforms remains uncertain.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/senator-lummis-pushes-crypto-tax-crackdown-in-gop-bill/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION","News",cryptocompare

It surprised the market by pricing its IPO at $31 per share, well above the expected $27 to $28 range. It sold about 34 million shares, valuing the company at $1.1 billion. Bloomberg reports that the IPO raised a total of $6.9 billion. Second Big Crypto Listing Goes Live The stablecoin issuer was set to go live today on the NYSE under the ticker “CRCL.” Circle has also given its underwriters a 30-day option to buy an extra 5.1 million shares. This IPO is the second big crypto listing under the Trump administration, after eToro’s debut last month. This move gives Circle more access to funding and stronger regulatory oversight that will help improve investor confidence amidst recent volatility in crypto markets. Ripple Shuns Circle Acquisition Rumors This comes shortly after the rumors of a potential acquisition by Ripple were put to rest. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared during a Las Vegas Bitcoin conference that Ripple had never pursued an acquisition of Circle, while some reports had suggested that Circle had denied a $5 billion offer from Ripple. Coinbase was also on the list to acquire Circle. Nevertheless, Circle’s IPO shows rising institutional interest in stablecoins and the broader crypto market. U.S. lawmakers are also pushing for clearer rules for stablecoins, which marks a major shift in how these digital assets will be viewed in the country. Lately, Wall Street giants have also shown interest in exploring their own stablecoin plans. Why Institutions Could Choose Circle- Circle is one of the first big crypto companies. The USDC, issued by Circle, is the second most popular stablecoin, holding 27% of the market, while Tether’s USDT leads at 67%. Circle’s IPO is also one of the biggest since Coinbase’s 2021 Debut. This is a big step for crypto moving into traditional finance. Circle’s USDC coin is likely to be favored by institutions due to the company’s strict regulatory focus. It was the first to get a New York State BitLicense in 2015, which gives it an advantage as banks and fintech firms look to enter the stablecoin space.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/circles-1-1b-ipo-shines-as-ripple-ceo-dismisses-acquisition-claims/,"BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDT|USDC","Uncategorized|Crypto news|Stablecoin",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T11:38:52,"Leverage Reconfigures in Q1: DeFi Recovers, CeFi Quietly Expands, Treasury Debt Mounts","Leverage across the crypto economy is evolving, not evaporating. Total crypto-collateralized lending fell 4.9% quarter-over-quarter to $39.07 billion, the first decline since late 2023, Galaxy Research’s Q1 2025 report shows. But while the headline figure contracted, underlying dynamics suggest leverage is shifting form, not fading. Lending in decentralized finance (DeFi) lending took a hit early in the quarter, sliding as much as 21%, before rebounding sharply in April and May. The turnaround was driven largely by Aave’s integration of Pendle tokens, whose yield-bearing structure and high loan-to-value ratios (up to 90%) sparked a wave of fresh borrowing. By late May, DeFi borrowing had surged more than 30% off the lows, with Ethereum leading the recovery. Centralized finance (CeFi) lending climbed 9.24% to $13.51 billion, led by Tether, Ledn, and Two Prime. Still, Galaxy notes that a narrow set of public disclosures limits visibility into the true scope of centralized lending. Private desks, OTC platforms, and offshore credit providers likely push the actual total far higher. perhaps by 50% or more. Meanwhile, bitcoin BTC treasury companies are quietly becoming a new systemic leverage node. Firms like Strategy (MSTR) have issued billions in convertible debt to fund BTC purchases. As of May, total outstanding debt across treasury firms stood at $12.7 billion, much of it set to mature between 2027 and 2028. In derivatives, CME’s rising open interest especially in ether ETH futures signals accelerating institutional participation. At the same time, upstart exchange Hyperliquid has carved out a growing share of the perpetual futures market, underscoring the continued strength of retail-driven leverage.

2025-06-05T11:32:31,"Pundit Says the Real XRP FOMO Will Start At This Price","In a market often driven by speculation, sentiment, and surprise surges, XRP has long stood as a polarizing asset, either heralded as the future of institutional finance or dismissed as a relic of regulatory entanglement. But according to influential crypto commentator BarriC, the real moment of mass hysteria, true Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), won’t arrive until XRP crosses the astonishing $1,000 mark. BarriC’s Bold Price Forecast Taking to X, BarriC made a compelling case that while XRP has seen its fair share of market cycles, the public has yet to experience what he calls “massive FOMO.” In his words, “When $XRP hits $1,000 , that’s when we see massive FOMO from the masses, desperate to own 1 XRP.” The post, which quickly gained traction, taps into a growing narrative that XRP’s long-term value lies not just in its utility or legal clarity but in its scarcity and psychological appeal. While $1,000 may sound like a fantastical number to many retail investors accustomed to XRP’s historically modest price range, BarriC’s perspective is rooted in a broader understanding of how retail behavior tends to trail institutional adoption. His comment suggests that the bulk of the public has yet to grasp XRP’s full potential and that true market frenzy will only ignite once the price reaches levels most now consider unthinkable. When $XRP hits $1,000 That’s when we see massive FOMO from the masses, desperate to own 1 x #XRP — BarriC (@B_arri_C) June 4, 2025 Institutional Momentum and Utility-Driven Value BarriC’s projection comes amid a wave of growing institutional attention on Ripple, the company closely associated with XRP. Ripple’s cross-border payments network, which continues to expand globally, leverages XRP for on-demand liquidity, a model that has begun to appeal to central banks and large-scale financial institutions looking to modernize outdated payment rails. Ripple has also taken firm steps toward integrating its ecosystem into broader financial frameworks. The launch of RLUSD, its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, is aimed at enhancing XRP Ledger (XRPL) liquidity and promoting enterprise-grade tokenization, setting the stage for further adoption. These developments add a layer of long-term utility to XRP, strengthening the argument for a significantly higher valuation. Moreover, the advent of tokenized assets and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) places XRP at the center of conversations about the future of finance. With its speed, scalability, and low transaction costs, XRP is uniquely positioned to serve as the bridge asset in a rapidly evolving global financial ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Psychological Threshold: The Power of Round Numbers BarriC’s $1,000 target also reflects an important psychological principle in financial markets: the power of round numbers. In the same way, Bitcoin’s rise above $10,000 and $50,000 triggered new waves of interest; XRP crossing a milestone like $1,000 could dramatically shift public perception. Scarcity-driven narratives, especially the idea that owning just one XRP becomes a big deal, have historically sparked major retail interest in other assets. The comparison is not without precedent. Assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum also went through extended periods of underestimation before the masses caught on. By the time BTC crossed $20,000 in late 2020, most of the institutional accumulation had already occurred. Retail investors, driven by headlines and viral posts, often buy the top of the wave. BarriC believes XRP could follow a similar trajectory, with the masses only scrambling to accumulate when supply dries up and price enters four-digit territory. The FOMO Threshold: Speculation or Strategic Forecast? BarriC’s forecast, while bold, aligns with a growing belief that a massive price appreciation for XRP could be triggered not by speculation alone but by fundamentals converging with market psychology. Utility, legal clarity, and scarcity narratives could become catalysts, and in a space as sentiment-driven as crypto, such a tipping point could result in a self-fulfilling surge. As history has shown with other digital assets, today’s improbable can become tomorrow’s inevitable. And if BarriC is right, the XRP FOMO that many expected years ago has yet to begin, it’s merely waiting for the right number to be printed on the charts.

That nominee, Brian Quintenz, is known for his pro-crypto stance and could shift regulation in a more favorable direction. With so much optimism – and just a dash of uncertainty – investors are gearing up for a busy summer. And if you’re looking to profit, here are some of the best crypto to buy before the next wave begins. Why Bitcoin Bulls Are Watching the Job Market and Washington The excitement around Bitcoin’s possible run to $115K isn’t just hype – it’s based on a mix of bullish fundamentals and political developments. Analysts are betting that weak U.S. job data will cool inflation concerns, pushing the Federal Reserve toward more dovish policies. That’s rocket fuel for Bitcoin. But if job numbers come in stronger than expected, we could see a short-term dip. Still, the long-term view remains solid – especially with Washington signaling a shift in how it treats crypto. Trump’s CFTC nominee , Brian Quintenz, is a vocal supporter of digital assets. He believes the CFTC (not the SEC) should take the lead on crypto regulation – and he’s backed that view with action during his time at a16z Crypto. So while the short-term may wobble depending on Friday’s data, the broader picture still looks bullish for crypto. That’s why smart investors are already hunting for opportunities now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – The Meme Coin That Pays You in Real Bitcoin BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) isn’t just riding Bitcoin’s momentum – it’s built to amplify it. With a presale price of $0.00255 and over $6.8M already raised, $BTCBULL is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins of the season. But unlike most meme coins, this one offers more than vibes and hope. BTC Bull Token is a community-driven project designed to reward investors as Bitcoin climbs toward its next big milestones. Every time $BTC hits a key price point – $150K or $200K – $BTCBULL holders can earn real Bitcoin rewards. It’s a simple idea: HODL $BTCBULL, and as Bitcoin pumps, so do your $BTC earnings. On top of that, the token undergoes programmed burns at major $BTC levels (like $125K, $175K, and $225K) shrinking supply and increasing scarcity. The project is integrated with Best Wallet , making rewards frictionless. But here’s the catch: to receive airdrops, you must buy $BTCBULL via Best Wallet and hold it there. No Best Wallet, no Bitcoin. With Bitcoin eyeing $115K and pro-crypto voices gaining ground in Washington, BTC Bull Token could be one of the smartest plays in this bullish environment. 2. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Utility-Packed Token Powering the Next-Gen Crypto Super App While everyone’s waiting on Bitcoin’s attempt at $115K and transformation under a more crypto-friendly CFTC, savvy investors are eyeing tokens with real utility – and Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is leading that charge. Right now, you can buy $BEST for just $0.025135. And with over $13.1M raised in the presale, $BEST is more than just an investment – it’s a key that unlocks a powerful ecosystem. $BEST is the utility token behind Best Wallet , a next-gen Web3 super app that’s taking aim at outdated tools like MetaMask. As a $BEST holder, you get a full suite of benefits: reduced transaction fees, early access to new launches, enhanced staking rewards, and even governance over the growing ecosystem. The token also powers exclusive access to the app’s flagship feature, Upcoming Tokens – a game-changing tool that lets users safely discover and join new crypto presales directly within the app. With a surging user base and 70K+ followers, Best Wallet is gaining traction fast. And as crypto sentiment heats up, $BEST stands out as one of the best altcoins to own as you’re heading into the next rally. 3. Smog Token ($SMOG) – The Multichain Meme Coin Fueling Airdrop Frenzy As Bitcoin eyes a potential surge to $115K and pro-crypto sentiment builds in Washington, meme coins are catching fresh momentum – and Smog Token ($SMOG) is one of them. Currently priced at around $0.008897, this dragon-themed token is turning heads with its multichain strategy and vibrant community incentives. Initially launched on Solana and now expanding to Ethereum, $SMOG is designed to capture attention across ecosystems. With a total supply of 1.4B, the project has committed 35% of tokens to airdrop rewards, encouraging users to stake, trade, and complete quests inside its gamified hub known as ‘The Dragon’s Court.’ Unlike many meme coins that rely on hype alone, $SMOG rewards participation and loyalty – and it’s backed by a strong community that’s rapidly growing. Its multichain approach not only boosts accessibility but positions it well for viral growth as retail interest returns to crypto. With Bitcoin potentially heading for six figures and crypto-favorable regulation gaining traction, Smog Token could ride this wave of optimism higher – making it one of the best new crypto picks this cycle. Best Altcoins to Watch Before the Next Bitcoin Breakout Whether Bitcoin hits $115K or faces short-term resistance, the market is warming up – and altcoin season may be just around the corner. Projects like BTC Bull Token , Best Wallet Token , and Smog Token each offer unique value and early-stage potential. If you’re looking to position ahead of the next rally, these may be the best crypto to buy right now. Before investing in crypto, make sure to do your own research (DYOR).

Predictions suggest BTC could reach $175K in 2025. Long-term forecasts estimate BTC prices could hit $900K by 2030. The Bitcoin price prediction for 2025 is turning increasingly bullish. This surge in optimism is driven by record-breaking inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs, rising institutional interest, and strong political support, including Trump’s plan to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. With companies like GameStop and Trump Media adding BTC to their balance sheets, and the Fed signaling potential rate cuts, investors are asking one critical question: Will Bitcoin go back up and lead the next financial revolution? What is the Bitcoin price prediction for today? The BTC price may range between $$104,232.70 and $105,579.56 today.

Hence, we expect the BTC price to create a 2025 high of ~$168,000. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $71,827.81 $119,713.02 $167,598.22 Bitcoin Price Prediction June 2025 In May 2025, Bitcoin witnessed an unstoppable and steady ascent. This recovery was fueled by easing tensions from the trade tariff war, pushing BTC to a new all-time high of $112K. Now, in the early days of June, Bitcoin is attempting to hold this support level after pulling back from its all-time high. Yet, it continues to face resistance from the 20-day EMA band. If bearish pressure increases again, this support zone becomes crucial. A breakdown below it could lead to a further decline toward the $100K to $95K range in the short term. Additionally, market sentiment has shifted to neutral over the past 24 hours. As the price consolidates in June, the BTC long/short ratio is also hovering near 1.0, signaling a weak directional bias in the short term. However, if sentiment improves, Bitcoin would need to break past its newly formed all-time high to resume upward momentum. If this happens, BTC will enter price discovery mode, targeting a near-term level of $120,000, with the potential for even higher gains in the months ahead. On the contrary, on-chain data suggests caution in the short term, as the 30-day MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) has fallen from a high of “+10.22%” to the current “-0.507%”. This move below the zero line indicates that, on average, recent BTC holders are now at a loss. Additionally, the Network Realized Profit/Loss (NPL) metric saw a large spike on Tuesday, indicating that holders are closing their positions and increasing selling pressure. Similarly, a spike in the Age Consumed index also reveals bearish signals, urging caution in the short term. Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 A key factor driving the potential for higher Bitcoin prices is the relationship with global liquidity. Historical trends reveal that as global M2 increases, Bitcoin often experiences dramatic price surges. Now, with global liquidity beginning to rise again after a prolonged period of stagnation, the stage seems set for another major rally in Bitcoin’s value. This shift in liquidity could create the perfect environment for Bitcoin to soar once more. Also, cryptoquant data suggest that accumulation is on top with exchange reserve declining at more alarming rates. When writing 2.4 Milliion BTC were in total on the exchange reserves, which is a strong decline from a year ago when reserves were 3.1 Million BTC.

2025-06-05T11:23:45,"Solo Miner Defies Odds After Mining Bitcoin Block Earning Over $330K","A solo Bitcoin miner has successfully validated a block on the Bitcoin network, earning a reward worth over $330,000. Identified as Solo CK, the individual mined Bitcoin block #899826 on June 5 at 04:48:18 UTC. $330K Mining Reward On-chain data from mempool shows that the reward included the standard block subsidy and 0.026 BTC in transaction fees. This brought the miner’s total earnings to approximately $330,386 based on current market prices. The block itself measured 1.66 megabytes in size and weighed 3.99 megawatt units (MWU). The hash for the successfully mined block was “000000…d1f8bb3,” with the transaction fees alone being worth around $2,761. Independent Bitcoin mining success remains extremely rare due to the high computational power needed to validate a block. Most of such activities today are done by large-scale operations using warehouses filled with specialized mining equipment. Many of these operations are run by companies publicly listed on U.S. stock exchanges like Bit Digital, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital. As of June 5, data from YCharts reveals that the Bitcoin Network Hash Rate stands at 795.35M. This figure is down from 908.97M yesterday and up by over 40% one year ago. A higher hashrate means increased competition, greater energy demands, and longer verification and transaction times. These conditions make it more difficult for individual miners to succeed without pooled resources. Additionally, Bitcoin mining becomes increasingly hard and energy-intensive over time, requiring greater resources to remain effective. 1 in 1.6 Million Odds Experts estimate the odds of an independent miner successfully validating a block using their own hardware to be roughly 1 in 1.6 million. Statistically, this means a single individual would expect to solve one block every 31 years. Despite the long odds, solo participants occasionally achieve success, as seen in the recent case of Solo CK. Several other individuals have also managed to mine a Bitcoin block on their own. In February 2025, one such user mined Block 883,181, earning 3.158 BTC worth $310,000 at the time. On April 29, 2024, another solo operator validated Block 841,286 and received the full 3.125 BTC reward worth approximately $200,000. In July of the same year, a BitAXE device with a hashrate of just 500 gigahashes per second (Gh/s) successfully mined Block 853,742, securing a Bitcoin reward of $206,000.

2025-06-05T11:20:18,"Astonishing Bitcoin Price Prediction: Could BTC Hit $120K Amid US Trade Tensions?","BitcoinWorld Astonishing Bitcoin Price Prediction: Could BTC Hit $120K Amid US Trade Tensions? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with potential. A bold Bitcoin price prediction has emerged, suggesting the leading digital asset could soar to $120,000 as early as June. But there’s a significant condition attached: an easing of US trade tensions . This forecast comes from a reputable source, highlighting the intricate link between global macroeconomic factors and the volatile crypto market. What’s Behind This Ambitious Bitcoin Price Prediction ? The forecast originates from Pav Hundal, the lead analyst at Swyftx, a prominent Australian crypto exchange. Speaking recently, Hundal pointed to external economic pressures as key determinants for Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. While internal market dynamics, adoption rates, and technological developments always play a role, macro events, particularly those emanating from major global economies like the United States, can exert significant influence. The $120,000 target for June is ambitious, representing a substantial rally from current levels. Achieving this would likely require a confluence of positive factors, with the easing of trade friction being identified as a primary catalyst by the Swyftx analyst . Decoding US Trade Tensions and Their Impact Ongoing uncertainty surrounding tariffs, particularly those linked to potential policies under figures like former President Donald Trump, presents a notable short-term risk for investors in assets like Bitcoin. Here’s why trade tensions matter for the crypto market outlook : Economic Uncertainty: Trade disputes create instability. Businesses face unpredictable costs and market access issues, potentially slowing down investment and economic growth. Investor Sentiment: Heightened tensions often lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment in traditional markets. Investors may retreat from volatile assets, including cryptocurrencies, in favor of perceived safe havens. Currency Fluctuations: Trade policies can impact currency values. While Bitcoin is often seen as an alternative to fiat, significant shifts in major currencies like the USD due to trade wars can indirectly affect crypto trading dynamics and global liquidity. Supply Chain Disruptions: Tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, leading to inflation in certain sectors and potentially impacting overall economic stability, which in turn affects investor confidence across all asset classes. According to the Swyftx analyst , if these trade-related uncertainties were to diminish, it could signal a more stable economic environment, encouraging investors to re-engage with risk assets like Bitcoin. How Macroeconomic Factors Shape the Bitcoin Outlook Beyond trade, the broader economic landscape, particularly monetary policy set by institutions like the Federal Reserve, is crucial for the Bitcoin outlook . The Fed’s decision on May 7 to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% was a key event. However, the analyst notes that rising tariff concerns are now casting doubt on the central bank’s long-term goals, specifically its 2% inflation target. Six months ago, achieving this inflation target seemed more probable. Now, the combination of potential tariff impacts (which can be inflationary) and the Fed’s delicate balancing act leaves the U.S. economy, and by extension, global markets, at a critical juncture. The Fed’s stance on interest rates and its success (or lack thereof) in managing inflation directly influence the liquidity available in the market and the attractiveness of yield-bearing traditional investments versus non-yielding assets like Bitcoin. Navigating the Current Crypto Market Outlook The current crypto market outlook is complex, influenced by a mix of positive fundamental developments (like increased institutional adoption and technological upgrades) and challenging macroeconomic headwinds (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical risks, and yes, trade tensions). The Swyftx analyst’s view underscores that while the potential for significant upside exists, it is heavily conditional on external factors improving. Here are some key aspects influencing the market: Potential Upside Catalysts: Easing trade tensions, successful inflation control allowing for future rate cuts, increased institutional inflows, positive regulatory clarity. Potential Downside Risks: Escalation of trade disputes, persistent inflation leading to higher-for-longer interest rates, unfavorable regulatory actions, broader economic recession fears. Investors are currently weighing these factors, leading to periods of volatility. The path to $120,000 is not guaranteed and depends heavily on how these macroeconomic puzzles are solved. Expert Insights: What the Swyftx Analyst Highlights Pav Hundal’s specific emphasis on trade tensions as a major short-term risk provides a focused insight. While many analysts discuss interest rates and inflation, highlighting tariffs points to a potentially underestimated factor. His perspective suggests that a resolution or significant de-escalation on the trade front could unlock significant positive sentiment and capital flows that are currently held back by uncertainty. This specific angle differentiates the Swyftx analyst’s commentary and offers a unique lens through which to view the current market dynamics and the potential for a rapid price appreciation in June. What’s Next for the Bitcoin Outlook ? Based on this analysis, the Bitcoin outlook for the coming months appears highly sensitive to policy decisions in Washington, both regarding trade and monetary policy.

2025-06-05T11:17:49,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?","The post Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Story Highlights The XRP Price LIVE: $ 2.20397741 . Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets known for its role in cross-border payments, is drawing increased attention as institutional adoption grows and its long-standing legal battle nears a conclusion. Since President Trump took office, Ripple XRP has gained significant traction, fueled by rising on-chain activity, bullish market sentiment, and increasing speculation around a potential XRP ETF Approval in 2025. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 2.20397741 -2.24% Market cap $ 129,505,104,331.94 Circulating Supply 58,759,724,027.00 Trading Volume $ 1,967,947,819.0916 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Crypto Price Prediction June 2025 XRP is currently in a pullback phase after testing the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 in mid-May. Following this, the price slipped below a key high-volume profile level throughout the remainder of the month. In early June, XRP is attempting to hold above the previous swing low of $2.10. However, it’s facing resistance due to a short-term bearish crossover between the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands. If selling pressure continues and XRP breaks below the crucial $2.10 support—closely aligned with the dynamic 200-day EMA—further downside could follow, potentially pushing the price toward $1.88 and even $1.63. However, if XRP manages to rebound and break above the key resistance at $2.40—along with overcoming the recent bearish EMA crossover—it could open the door for a rally toward $2.80, with the potential to retest its all-time high of $3.40 later in June. That said, the current decline in both volume and volatility points to a lackluster, consolidative phase, which poses a challenge for XRP’s price action. Since strong momentum relies on rising volume and heightened volatility, their absence could prolong the downtrend. Conversely, if both metrics begin to rise alongside renewed buying interest, XRP could experience a sharp price surge this month. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.7 $2.45 $3.40 XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025—a major supply zone on the chart—it could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.05 $3.45 $5.05 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.50 6.25 8.50 2027 7.00 9.0 13.25 2028 11.25 13.75 16.00 2029 14.25 16.50 21.50 2030 17.00 19.75 26.50 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP’s rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050. Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2031 25.00 29.50 35.25 2032 31.50 36.75 41.25 2033 35.75 42.25 47.75 2040 97.50 135.50 179.00 2050 219.25 331.50 526.00 Market Analysis Firm Name 2025 2026 2030 Changelly $2.05 $3.49 $17.76 Coincodex $2.38 $1.83 $1.66 Binance $2.16 $2.27 $2.76 Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 Name Target Standard Chartered $5.50 Sistine Research $33 to $50 Final Thoughts: Is XRP Still a Good Investment? Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100—or even higher—in the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-06-05T11:17:04,"XRP Proponent: Owning Just 10,000 XRP Will be Impossible for 99.999%","Edoardo Farina, a prominent voice in the XRP community and founder of Alpha Lions Academy, has voiced concern that accumulating 10,000 XRP may soon be a goal few investors can realistically achieve. Farina has consistently advocated for accumulating and holding XRP, suggesting it could be pivotal for long-term financial security. Farina believes that the digital asset is significantly undervalued and could soon rise substantially. At today’s price of $2.2, obtaining 10,000 XRP would cost around $22,000. While that sum already places it outside the budget of some retail participants, Farina’s statement suggests that more investors will be priced out as the token enters a stronger bullish phase. Owning just 10,000 $XRP will be impossible for 99.999% — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) June 3, 2025 Long-Term Targets and Financial Implications Farina has openly discussed his investment plans, revealing that he intends to begin taking little profits once XRP hits $10, but that he expects to hold the majority of his holdings until it reaches $100 . Under such a scenario, 10,000 XRP would be valued at $1 million. Such a rise would significantly impact accessibility. For example, an individual earning the median U.S. salary of $65,000 annually would find it nearly impossible to purchase 10,000 XRP at $100, unless they saved for more than a decade without spending any of their income. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This is a likely outcome if investors wait too long to enter the market, and one of the primary reasons Farina has consistently warned everyone to buy and hold XRP . In October 2024, Farina advocated buying 10,000 XRP at $0.52, totaling $5,200. Since then, XRP’s price has quadrupled, proving his stance. He still believes the real breakout lies ahead, recently suggesting that if Bitcoin hits $500,000, XRP could surge to $100 . Historical Parallels Highlight the Warning To support his view, we can consider early Bitcoin investment opportunities. In 2013, Bitcoin traded around $110. Back then, early adopters like Davinci Jeremie encouraged investors to acquire even modest amounts. At that price, 10 BTC would have required about $1,000. Today, those same 10 BTC are worth more than $1 million, as Bitcoin is trading at around $104,000. Many experts believe XRP is now at a comparable stage in its market development. Just as most people today would find it impossible to buy 10 BTC, the same may soon be true for XRP if current price forecasts materialize. Farina has previously predicted that 95% of people will miss out on XRP . For those waiting for more confirmation before investing, the opportunity may have passed by the time they act.

2025-06-05T11:15:09,"Russia's central bank proposes strict oversight on crypto trading transfers","The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has called on credit institutions to strengthen control over transactions linked to crypto trading platforms, which it lists among “shadow businesses.” The push comes after the enforcement of a law empowering banks to impose a monthly limit on transfers made by persons suspected of fraudulent activities. It allows them to block card accounts and online banking services. Russian banks told to monitor crypto-related transactions Russia’s monetary authority has instructed commercial banks in the country to catch money transfers between payment cards of private individuals and the corporate cards of ghost firms that show little or no signs of real business activity. Such entities are often used by “shadow businesses,” the regulator said in a circular , listing among these cryptocurrency exchangers, online casinos, financial pyramids, and drug dealers. Russian banks have been asked to swiftly identify these types of transactions, using online monitoring tools “in close to real time mode,” and conduct a thorough analysis of the respective client’s transaction profile, RBC Crypto and Bits.media reported. Banking institutions may restrict transactions of a customer who has been interacting with “counterparties that previously transferred money to droppers” or companies with fictitious activity, the CBR noted. The measures include limiting bank wires and prohibiting cash deposits. “Droppers” is a colloquial Russian term that refers to people lending their bank accounts, cards and wallets to fraudsters who use them to launder criminal proceeds. The central bank has been trying to deal with the phenomenon known as money muling in the West. As part of these efforts, Moscow adopted new legislation, which went into force in mid-May. The law allows authorities to cap the monthly bank transfers of individuals at 100,000 rubles ($1,300) if their bank details have been added to the CBR’s database of suspicious transactions. When the limit is reached, online access to a blacklisted account may be blocked. The account holder is then required to contact the bank and present their passport and payment card before they can use the account again. Dropper law hits peer-to-peer crypto traders in Russia In the notice, the Bank of Russia remarked that its latest recommendations are voluntary for banks, but at the same time, the financial authority emphasized that they can help improve their anti-money laundering procedures. Meanwhile, concerns have been growing that the new regulations targeting droppers are actually hitting crypto traders who have few options to buy and sell digital coins in Russia, where cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are yet to be properly regulated. The central bank’s dropper database is affecting crypto trading in general as it often includes not only the bank details of criminals and their accomplices but also of legitimate participants in peer-to-peer (P2P) crypto exchange, legal analysts told RBC. The business news outlet noted that P2P has remained the only way to buy and sell cryptocurrency for users with a domestically issued card. And while the new limits will certainly make it harder for fraudsters to launder illicit funds, they will also restrict law-abiding participants in the market. In May, the CBR revealed that crypto asset flows linked to Russian residents have spiked by over 51% during the last quarter of 2024 and the first three months of 2025, compared to the previous two quarters. The total reached 7.3 trillion rubles, or $91 billion at the time the bank published its latest financial stability review. This month, the bank proposed to increase the maximum amount that ordinary Russians can invest in digital financial assets, such as tokenized securities, to 1 million rubles (over $12,600) from the current 600,000 rubles. However, the regulator continues to insist on limiting access to decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to only “ highly qualified ” investors. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-06-05T11:15:00,"Crypto Daybook Americas: Bitcoin Faces Bearish June Seasonality as ETF Flows Slow","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies continue to offer little directional clarity to traders, with inflows into spot ETFs slowing during the seasonally bearish period. According to 10x Research , June tends to be a mixed-to-negative month for the largest tokens. Bitcoin has averaged a 1.9% return in June over the past 10 years, evenly split between five positive and five negative occurrences. Ethereum's ether (ETH) averaged an 11.7% decline, with only two out of the last seven Junes in the green. XRP has fared even worse, though SOL has been stronger. The apathy is reflected in the U.S.-listed spot bitcoin ETFs, which recorded net inflows in only two of the past five trading days. Inflows on Wednesday were just $87 million, a sharp decline from Tuesday's $387 million, SoSoValue data show. Ether ETFs recorded a net inflow of $57 million, the least since May 21. ""The weakening pace of institutional flows confirms a loss of momentum — and makes us more cautious on the short-term outlook,"" Valentin Fournier, lead research analyst at BRN, said in an email. Other analysts, however, remain optimistic, citing the rapid pace of institutional adoption. ""Despite the seasonal summer lull, the structural backdrop remains intact,"" QCP Capital said. ""With both BTC and ETH emission rates now trailing global money supply growth, a long-term positive price drift appears increasingly probable. Fresh treasury buyers are absorbing supply."" The firm also noted the relative strength in ether as the ETH-BTC ratio trades close to the recent range highs. The crypto news flow over the past 24 hours has been positive. Circle, the issuer of the regulated USDC stablecoin, priced its initial public offering at $31 per share, above the expected range of $24 to $26. The company sold around 34 million shares in the offering for a valuation of $1.1 billion. The California Assembly approved the AB-1052 bill, classifying long-inactive crypto assets as “unclaimed property” and allowing the state to hold them in custody. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham said that a whale address supposedly linked to Consensys purchased $320 million in ETH from Galaxy Digital and transferred it to a new address. Economic developments, however, have been dismal. Three soft U.S. economic reports, including the Fed's Beige book, sent the Treasury yields tumbling, reviving hopes for the Fed rate cut. Stay alert!

Chain sleuths found 93% of USD1’s circulating supply parked in just three wallets. Traders are concerned the pair’s depth, and therefore DEGO’s new price floor, could be yanked at any moment, sparking “exit-liquidity” accusations. Dego Finance said in a Thursday tweet that “fundamentals, tokenomics, long-term vision"" were unchanged and pinned the price collapse on “short-term market psychology."" The team claimed it is auditing on-chain flows and liaising with exchanges/market makers to dampen volatility. Skeptics warned of “ghost liquidity” and urge the team to court more reputable stablecoins such as USDT, FDUSD and USDC before deploying treasury funds. Dego will publish a post-mortem and treasury-transparency dashboard “within days,” host an AMA with core devs, and outline additional safeguards (e.g., time-locked treasury moves, multi-sig sign-offs) to rebuild confidence. Derivatives Positioning Growth in CME-listed BTC and ETH futures open interest has stagnated this month, leaving the annualized one-month basis between 5% and 10%. The figures show that institutions have scaled back demand. Binance's 1000SHIB perpetual futures and BCH perpetual futures show negative funding rates in a sign of bearish bias. Other major tokens, including BTC and ETH, continue to trade with mildly bullish or positive funding rates. On Deribit, the BTC call bias has weakened across multiple time frames.

2025-06-05T11:14:07,"Legendary Analyst John Bollinger Issues Critical Warning for Bitcoin (BTC)","The leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) made a name for itself with its new record of $111,000 just a few weeks ago, but then experienced a decline. The fact that this decline has come very close to the critical level of $100,000 has increased concerns that the correction could deepen even further. At this point, John Bollinger, a well-known analyst and inventor of Bollinger Bands, warned that the bullish momentum in Bitcoin was weakening and further pullbacks could occur. John Bollinger stated in his post from his X account that a “Three Peaks Push” pattern has formed on the Bitcoin chart. A picture perfect 'Three Pushes to a High' Bollinger Band Pattern marked the end of this rally phase for $BTCUSD . https://t.co/KZ3GWr7a2o — John Bollinger (@bbands) June 4, 2025 This pattern occurs when the Bitcoin price reaches the top of the Bollinger Band three times in a row but fails to move higher. Noting that this pattern has occurred, the analyst said that the pattern means that Bitcoin could experience further declines and the bullish momentum could reverse before experiencing a strong rise again. Looking at the chart shared by Bollinger, the price of Bitcoin reached levels close to $ 108,000 and tested the upper band three times. However, after these tests, the candles became smaller and the BTC price followed an uptrend instead of making a direct upward movement. This is usually interpreted as a sign that buyers have lost their strength and momentum and that the price needs to cool down a bit to start rising again. *This is not investment advice.

2025-06-05T11:13:25,"Altcoin market bracing ‘Big Breakout,’ says crypto analyst","The total cryptocurrency market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), is sitting at a defining moment. As of June 5, 2025, leading crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes the altcoin market is locked in an equilibrium, a period of quiet tension that often precedes explosive movement. “The Altcoin market capitalization (and actually the entire market) are in an equilibrium before the big breakout,” van de Poppe noted in his latest update. “It’s just everywhere, which means that we’ll need some patience and then we’ll be fine.” A look at the 3-day chart paints the picture clearly. The market has rebounded significantly from March lows, but now faces what van de Poppe calls a “crucial resistance zone.” That zone between $1.2 trillion and $1.35 trillion has acted as a ceiling in recent months, capping upside momentum. However, what’s equally notable is the consistent higher lows forming beneath this resistance. The altcoin market appears to be coiling, with price compression signaling reduced volatility, often a precursor to major directional moves. Market in balance, but not for long Equilibrium phases like this are rare and potent. In crypto trading terms, they reflect a standoff between buyers and sellers, one that can’t last forever. Once a breakout does occur, the sheer build-up of energy and sidelined capital can result in aggressive rallies. If the market can breach the $1.35 trillion resistance band convincingly, the next macro target sits near $1.7 trillion, marking a potential 45% move from current levels. Conversely, failure to hold support around $1.1 trillion may spark a retest of previous cycle lows near $875 billion. For now, traders and investors are watching for confirmation: a surge in volume, a break above resistance, or a catalyst that ignites broader market momentum.

2025-06-05T11:07:56,"California Assembly Passes Bill to Regulate Unclaimed Crypto and Merchant Payments","California Passes Bill to Oversee Unclaimed Cryptocurrency and Merchants’ Payments California is moving forward with historic legislation to oversee virtual assets. The Assembly passed Assembly Bill 1052 (AB 1052), which recasts the handling of unclaimed cryptocurrency and enables businesses to accept payment in cryptocurrency. The bill passed unanimously on a 78-0 vote without any opposition on June 3 and will now proceed to the California Senate for deliberation. Crypto Left Untouched for 3 Years Can Be Sent to the State One of the main provisions of AB 1052 applies unclaimed property law to crypto. If an exchange account is inactive for three years—no transactions, logins, or other activity by the owner—the crypto will be transferred to the state. Unlike previous policies in which the assets can be cashed out, the bill requires digital assets to be stored in their original form. Eric Peterson of the Satoshi Action Fund noted that Bitcoin, for example, will not be cashed out but held securely until it is redeemed. “Instead of cashing out your Bitcoin after 3 years of inactivity, custodians must forward your real BTC to a state-authorized custodian of your preference,” Peterson said. Legitimizes Crypto Payments for Goods and Services Probably most significant among the bill’s provisions is its allowance for companies and individuals to accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods and services. This legitimates the use of digital assets in private transactions and places California in line with other crypto-friendly states. Mixed Feedback from the Crypto Community While the bill passed the Assembly unanimously, there has been polarized public opinion. Critics argue that the action is too empowering to the state, while other critics say the law does not do anything more than it currently does with unclaimed property procedures . Peterson responded to critics by saying the law is created to protect holders, not steal their assets. “There’s a lot of misunderstanding,” he insisted, again saying that the state would not sell off the assets as many expect. Hailey Lennon, erstwhile Coinbase regulatory counsel, added some background: “Most states have unclaimed property laws that exchanges follow. It’s returned to the owner when the owner reaches out to the state.” What’s Next? If approved by the Senate and signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom, AB 1052 will become effective on July 1, 2026. It will also require all those involved in digital financial asset business to be licensed by California’s Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). While governments grapple with how to integrate crypto into existing financial systems, AB 1052 offers a blueprint for integrating custodial digital assets into governance while fostering greater adoption of crypto in commerce.",btcpulse,https://btc-pulse.com/california-assembly-passes-regulate-unclaimed-crypto/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION","Blockchain|Sticky|Regulation",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T11:06:08,"Top 6 Free and Trusted Bitcoin Cloud Mining Sites in 2025: Beginner’s Guide to Earning Crypto","Introduction: Why Cloud Mining is Booming in 2025 In 2025, Bitcoin continues to surge in popularity as mainstream adoption grows, institutional interest strengthens, and everyday users look for ways to earn crypto without technical barriers.

Cloud mining allows users to rent mining power from remote data centers. The result? You earn Bitcoin daily while someone else handles the infrastructure, electricity, and hardware.

With calmer markets, pro-crypto policy, and potential regulatory easing, CONY is better positioned to generate consistent income for risk-tolerant investors. Finding the right balance between risk and reward is critical when investing. While many people have similar long-term objectives, certain individuals will have a higher risk-tolerance for the kinds of investments and losses these people are willing to accept. Dividend investing has become increasingly common since 2008. With rates at historically low levels for much of the last 2 decades, individuals seeking income have been more willing to focus on equities, and a number of new investments focus on offering a balance of substantive and consistent payouts have come out. Some of the higher-risk income-focused investments are the YieldMax funds. While some of these covered-call exchanged-traded funds use a buy-write strategy with more traditional equities, many of these ETFs focus on more volatile companies to generate additional income by taking advantage of elevated implied volatility premiums. One of the highest risk YieldMax investments is the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) . This exchange-traded fund's inception date was in August of 2023. Data by YCharts The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF has offered investors total returns of 117.4 percent since August of 2023, while the S&P 500 has offered investors total returns of 37.77 percent during this same time period. Still, CONY has notably underperformed Coinbase ( COIN ), the underlying equity this fund is long through the use of synthetic call spreads. Data by YCharts Coinbase has outperformed CONY by nearly 110 percent since the fund's inception in August of 2023, even though this YieldMax ETF has still delivered both substantive income and impressive overall returns during this same timeframe. I last wrote about the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF in March of 2025, and I rated this fund a sell primarily because of some flaws in the construction of this investment. Today, I am upgrading this investment to a hold. The financial and market environment for CONY is much more favorable today because of Trump's efforts to standardize digital currencies, including most notably bitcoin. The President has installed both a Treasury Secretary and SEC Chairman who have favorable views about cryptocurrencies, and Fed Chair Powell will also likely be replaced next year with someone open to further easing regulations of digital currencies as well. Markets have also calmed down recently with Trump taking a more cautious tone and approach to negotiating trade agreements after implementing broad-based tariffs earlier this year. CONY's risk profile is more favorable now. The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF has an expense ratio of 1.22 percent, a 30-day SEC yield of 3.53 percent, and $1.19 billion in assets under management. CONT's trailing yield is 174.89 percent A List of CONY's Top Holdings (Seeking Alpha) The options strategy that this YieldMax fund uses is to usually buy at-the-money call options and then sell call option contracts that are 0-15 percent out-of-the money. CONY also shorts put options, so the fund caps upside gains while leaving most of the downside risk exposed. This ETF owns call options that expire in 1 to 6 months and sells contracts that expire in one month or less to attempt to generate consistent income. The payouts of this ETF are taxed at ordinary income rates. The ETF seeks to take an 80 percent net long position in the underlying Coinbase Global equity, and a net 20 percent short approach as well. A List of CONY's Options Strategies (CONY prospectus) Coinbase is one of the more volatile companies in the market with a standard deviation of 46.22. This cryptocurrency exchange is significantly correlated with the underlying price of bitcoin which is also prone to large moves in short period of time. Chart of Coinbase compared to Bitcoin (Portfolioslab) YieldMax's approach of not protecting most of the ETF's downside risks while capping upside potential is dangerous when markets become less predictable as was seen earlier this year. Still, today, the market environment should remain more favorable for CONY. Trump has softened his tone and approach to trade negotiations with the EU as well as with other countries. Equities have remained much calmer of recent. The Republican's clear intent to make the 2017 Trump corporate tax cuts permanent should also bolster the market, and the President has made emphasizing the importance of cryptocurrencies thriving in the US a top priority as well. Trump's son Eric is also a top executive at American Bitcoin. The President reiterated in March that he wants the US to become the crypto capital of the world. While digital currencies have always been more volatile for a number of reasons, ranging from lower levels of liquidity to actions taken by some governments against this still largely unregulated market, the overall environment for cryptocurrencies is much more favorable now. The likely appointment of a Federal Reserve Chair who is committed to further integrating digital currencies within the US financial system should be a key catalyst for the crypto markets next year as well. While falling volatility levels both in the markets overall and in Coinbase will likely lower the monthly payouts Cony makes by selling options against the calls the fund owns, as has been seen the last several months, this ETF should continue to pay out consistent and significant income as well. A Table of CONY's Payouts ( stockanalysis.com ) CONY has still paid out nearly $.60 a month of income since February despite lower implied volatility premiums in the options this investment sells. Coinbase is too volatile of a company for CONY to track all or most of the underlying equity's upward moves, and this investment higher-risk options strategy does leave significant downside risks exposed. Still, the primary goal of this YieldMax fund is to generate additional income, not maximize total returns, and this investment should be well positioned to accomplish that goal in the current more favorable market and financial environment.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4792596-cony-fund-better-positioned-current-market-environment?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION","CONY",cryptocompare
2025-06-05T11:00:39,"California Assembly moves to claim custody of inactive crypto assets with new bill","California lawmakers passed AB 1052 on Tuesday in a 78-0 vote, giving the state the mandate to hold crypto assets that remain unclaimed for 3 years in exchange platforms. The event sparked mixed reactions on social platforms, with critics arguing that there has been a misconception about what the bill’s finer details aim to achieve. The draft legislation will move to the Senate, where it could be modified, rejected, or signed into law without changes. If signed into law, cryptocurrencies would be subject to the unclaimed property law, which has the same rules governing the ownership transfer of assets such as bank accounts and safe deposit box holdings. The bill does not allow the state to liquidate those unclaimed crypto assets. It can only be held by a custodian for customers to reclaim later. California bill AB 1052 aims to regulate digital payments to protect consumers According to the bill submission AB 1052, cryptocurrency holders must perform an act of ownership interest at least once every 3 years to prevent their tokens from being subject to the unclaimed property law. The bill defined those actions as conducting transactions involving their digital asset accounts or accessing them electronically. Since @SimplyBitcoinTV and @TFTC21 have had some misunderstandings on AB 1052 which passed the California Assembly last night, I have put together an explainer thread about how this protects #bitcoin for the citizens of California. Let’s say it’s January 2015. You’re curious… pic.twitter.com/MLS6BsgwtH — Eric Peterson (@Eric_Peterson_) June 4, 2025 California’s unclaimed property law is intended to protect consumers, who can reclaim their assets free of charge from the state’s custody. According to Eric Peterson, the bill’s author and a policy director at Satoshi Action Fund, the bill only applies to third-party exchanges, not private custody. He noted that under the current legal regime, if an exchange fails to contact its client for over three years, it could potentially liquidate the user’s assets. Peterson explained that the bill anticipated a problem that may arise if an exchange turned the assets over to state custody instead of liquidating them; the exchange might try to convert them to fiat first. He assured the people of California that the assets would stay in government custody as Bitcoin to preserve value. He argued that since crypto assets like Bitcoin could appreciate over time, users who would later reclaim their assets would benefit from the gains rather than receive the fiat value of the assets at the time of liquidation. Hailey Lennon, a r egulatory counsel at Coinbase , reiterated Peterson’s point, saying that this type of law is common. She added that most states in the U.S. have unclaimed property laws that exchanges comply with, and crypto assets are returned to the owner once they contact them. California bill AB 1180 seeks to complement AB 1052 California Assembly Bill 1180, which passed by a 68-0 vote on June 2 on its third reading, would require the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) to create rules that allow state funds and transactions under the Digital Financial Asset Law (DFAL) to be paid in crypto. The DFPI would be tasked with tracking all cryptocurrency transactions, including regulatory and technical issues, and reporting by 2028. The DFPI would supervise license systems and ensure consumer protection and financial innovation. AB 1052 would make the use of digital assets a valid and legal form of payment in private transactions and prevent public entities from restricting or taxing digital assets based on their use as payment methods. Senator Ben Allen supported giving more attention to crypto interests in California. Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana have been at the forefront of state-level trends toward blockchain integrations. The state of Louisiana started accepting crypto payments in September 2024. John Fleming, Louisiana Treasurer, said that people could make payments for government services using digital currencies. Abroad, Dubai has taken the front seat by integrating crypto into the economy. In May, Dubai’s Department of Finance agreed with Crypto.com to allow citizens to pay government fees in digital currencies.

2025-06-05T11:00:08,"Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows","Bitcoin’s available coins for trading have dropped sharply. That change could push prices higher if demand holds up. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge According to Sygnum Bank’s June 2025 Monthly Investment Outlook, the liquid supply of Bitcoin fell by about 30% over the last 18 months. In that time, nearly 1 million BTC left exchanges. That means fewer coins are ready to move at a moment’s notice. Liquid Supply Tightens Based on reports from Sygnum Bank, exchange balances dropped by around 1 million BTC since late 2023. That amount equals roughly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. When coins leave exchanges, they often go into cold storage or long-term funds. Some of these funds include new exchange-traded funds and corporate buyers issuing equity or debt to buy Bitcoin. If coins are locked away, traders have to compete for a smaller pool of available coins. That gap between supply and demand can cause bigger price swings on the upside. Institutions And State Moves Three US states have now passed laws to hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves. New Hampshire already signed its bill into law. Texas is expected to follow soon. A third state is also moving forward, though details are still pending. In addition, governments abroad are paying attention. Pakistan’s government has said it will look into Bitcoin reserves. In the UK, the Reform Party—currently leading in election polls—plans to study something similar. When a state or country actually buys Bitcoin for its coffers, it can spark more buying. That act has a double effect: it creates immediate demand and it signals that public institutions see Bitcoin as a store of value. Safe-Haven Status Strengthens Rising uncertainty over the US dollar and US debt worries have driven some investors toward Bitcoin. In May, as US Treasury prices slid on concerns about rising debt levels, digital gold and physical gold saw higher interest. Bitcoin is being viewed more like a hedge against dollar weakness. On days when Treasuries wobble, some cash moves into crypto markets. Larger swings on the upside than on the downside also hint that institutions may be soaking up dips more quickly. Sygnum’s data shows that since June 2022, Bitcoin’s upward moves have been larger than its downward moves. That may be a sign that big players have become more confident in holding through small sell-offs.

2025-06-05T10:45:24,"Ripple XRP Escrow Isn’t the Price Killer! Here’s Why the Community Thinks It’s Good","The post Ripple XRP Escrow Isn’t the Price Killer! Here’s Why the Community Thinks It’s Good appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With the beginning of June, Ripple has released a massive 1 billion XRP tokens from its escrow account. This regular monthly release has pushed the price of XRP down by 2%, causing many to wonder if Ripple’s escrow system is hurting the token. But an XRP community member says XRP escrow isn’t the price killer you think! It actually “starves the market”, potentially boosting value. Let’s dive in! What Is Ripple’s Escrow All About? Ripple’s escrow system was first set up back in 2017. At that time, Ripple locked up 55 billion XRP to build trust and avoid flooding the market with too many tokens. Each month, they release 1 billion XRP from escrow. But here’s the twist—Ripple doesn’t spend all of it. In fact, only about 200 to 350 million XRP are used each month to support their payment services and ecosystem projects. The rest gets locked back up in escrow, keeping the market from getting overwhelmed. This careful system was put in place to make sure there’s enough XRP in the market to help with real payments and services, but not so much that it drives the price down. Right now, Ripple still has about 36.5 billion XRP locked in escrow, which shows they’re serious about managing the supply. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DOGE and XRP Go Live on Base: Here’s How to Buy Wrapped XRP , Why Some Are Worried? Some people, especially Bitcoin supporters, think these monthly XRP releases are like “token dumps” that push prices down. Even a few people in the XRP community share this worry. They say too much XRP could hurt the token’s price in the long run. But Abraham Liim, an XRP community member, thinks differently. He says this system is actually “starving” the market, meaning it’s holding back most of the XRP from entering circulation. This can help keep the price from crashing and might even lead to a future price boost if demand picks up. Should Ripple Burn All Escrowed XRP? Others have suggested that Ripple should just burn all the escrowed XRP to make it scarce and push up the price faster. But Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, believes that would waste valuable tokens that could be used for real projects. Instead, he says if Ripple keeps releasing small amounts while demand grows, XRP could see a big price jump naturally. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

While major headlines call it bullish for Bitcoin, critics are calling it something else entirely — a silent Wall Street takeover . A viral thread by crypto user Leshka.eth on X breaks down how BlackRock’s rising influence may strip Bitcoin of its original purpose: decentralization and financial freedom . BlackRock now holds over $70B in Bitcoin ETFs If you think BlackRock is bullish for crypto – It’s not They want control it Leaked iShares files reveal plans to censor and manipulate Bitcoin from the inside. Here’s what they don’t want you to know pic.twitter.com/RPSzRdyOHG — Leshka.eth (@leshka_eth) June 4, 2025 BlackRock Dominates the Bitcoin ETF Market Recent data shows that the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs now collectively hold over 1.2 million BTC . Out of this, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone controls at least 660,137 BTC — over half the ETF market. That makes IBIT the largest crypto ETF by Bitcoin holdings, contributing significantly to BlackRock’s total $70 billion BTC exposure . But not everyone is celebrating this as a win. ETF Bitcoin Isn’t Real Bitcoin, Critics Say One of the biggest concerns? ETF holders don’t actually own Bitcoin . All ETF Bitcoin is held in Coinbase Custody , meaning investors do not control the private keys , nor can they transfer, spend, or verify the Bitcoin independently. Leshka.eth explains this distinction clearly — Bitcoin is now splitting into two paths : Sovereign BTC : Held directly by individuals with full control ETF BTC : Held by institutions, locked in centralized custody While Bitcoin ETFs make it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure, they remove user control , undermining Bitcoin’s core principles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Crypto Market down Today? Whale Sell-Offs Trigger Panic , Can BlackRock Shape Bitcoin’s Future? According to BlackRock’s own iShares Bitcoin Trust filing, the firm can decide which chain to support during a fork . This power could allow them to dictate which version of Bitcoin survives. In addition, ETF giants like BlackRock could push for: OFAC-compliant transactions Miner pressure to follow government-friendly policies Centralized narratives around Bitcoin use and utility This raises concerns that Bitcoin’s future could be shaped by politics and finance , rather than code and consensus. The Real Risk: Bitcoin Becoming Digital Gold 2.0 Leshka.eth draws a parallel to how Wall Street tamed gold. He believes the same could happen to Bitcoin — turning it into a passive, price-driven asset , stripped of purpose and utility. To prevent this, he urges holders to embrace self-custody — not ETFs. “Wall Street wants Bitcoin’s brand and price, not its principles,” he warns. “Hold your private keys. Stay sovereign.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Yes, BlackRock’s ETF prospectus indicates the firm can decide which blockchain fork to support, potentially influencing Bitcoin’s direction. What are the risks of holding Bitcoin via an ETF? Holding Bitcoin through an ETF introduces counterparty risk and removes user control over the asset, contrasting with Bitcoin’s decentralized ethos. Why do some advocate for self-custody over ETFs? Self-custody ensures full control over Bitcoin holdings, aligning with the principle “not your keys, not your coins,” and preserves decentralization.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/blackrocks-70b-bitcoin-bet-bullish-signal-or-silent-takeover/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING","News|Bitcoin",cryptocompare

2025-06-05T10:31:36,"Bitfinex: BTC Price Could Touch $115K by July on Institutional Demand, ETF Flows","Bitcoin could climb to $115,000 or higher by early July, with institutional demand and ETF inflows driving the rally, according to analysts at Bitfinex. Key Takeaways: Bitfinex analysts see Bitcoin potentially reaching $115,000 or higher by early July. Institutional demand, ETF inflows, and macro catalysts like rate cut expectations could fuel the rally. The U.S. jobs report may influence short-term price action, with $95K–$97K viewed as a key accumulation zone. In their latest market outlook shared with Cryptonews.com, Bitfinex analysts flagged this Friday’s upcoming U.S. jobs report as a potential catalyst in a broader macro environment that may accelerate Federal Reserve rate cut expectations. While the labor data alone won’t move Bitcoin, it could contribute to a chain of macro factors, such as disinflation signals and dollar weakness, that support an earlier Fed pivot, which would likely favor risk assets, including BTC. BTC Price Could Touch $115,000 in Bullish Scenario The analysts said that BTC price could hit $115,000 by early July this year. “In a bullish scenario, driven by strong institutional interest and ETF inflows, Bitcoin could touch $115,000 or higher by early July 2025,” the analysts said. “Although the pullback has caused some concern, investors still feel optimistic. On the downside, we see $95,000–$97,000 as a key accumulation zone.” The U.S. May Jobs Report, due Friday, is projected to show 125,000 to 130,000 new nonfarm payrolls, down from April’s 177,000. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.2%, with average hourly earnings projected to rise by 0.2% to 0.3% month-over-month. A weaker-than-expected report could reinforce the disinflation narrative and push the Fed closer to rate cuts—a positive backdrop for Bitcoin. In contrast, a strong report could delay rate cuts and boost the dollar, potentially weighing on BTC. Currently, Bitcoin trades near $105,000. Bitfinex analysts believe maintaining support above this level could open the door to testing the $120,000–$125,000 range in June, although they caution that no single event will trigger this move alone. If the labor data surprises to the upside, Bitcoin may revisit support levels around $102,000 or lower, the analysts said. The report will likely influence short-term market action, but it remains just one component in the broader macro picture shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. BTC Eyes Breakout as Bitcoin Supply Shrinks 30% The available Bitcoin supply has fallen sharply , setting the stage for potential price surges as institutional demand builds, according to Sygnum Bank’s latest Monthly Investment Outlook for June 2025. Over the past 18 months, liquid Bitcoin supply has dropped by 30%, driven by rising institutional adoption and an increase in acquisition vehicles such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), the report stated. In total, one million BTC have moved off exchanges during this period — typically a bullish signal, as coins are often withdrawn for long-term holding. “Bitcoin’s fast-shrinking liquid supply is creating the conditions for demand shocks and upside volatility,” Sygnum wrote.

2025-06-05T10:24:59,"Investment Advisors Become Top Holders of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Ether ETF Demand Rises","There is a strong institutional presence in U.S. spot crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with investment advisors taking a commanding lead, according to the recent SEC filings. Investment advisors now hold over $10.28 billion in spot bitcoin BTC ETF assets, representing 124,753 BTC. Investment advisors hold nearly half of the total crypto assets declared by the various funds.

2025-06-05T10:22:30,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – June 5, 2025","After a brief few hours of upward movement, the crypto market has turned slightly downwards again, reaching a crossroads. Nearly all top 100 coins have seen their prices decrease over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has decreased by 3% to $3.41 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $89 billion, still lower than what we typically see. TLDR: After a brief rise, most coins record additional decreases; BTC volatility has been on a downward trend; Even if BTC rallies, the price will likely not surpass $110,000 at this point; Sentiment has turned bearish in the short term; US spot BTC ETFs sees two days of inflows, spot ETH ETFs record a thirteen-day streak; The rally looks sustainable short-term but is more susceptible for a shift now. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all but one of the top 10 coins per market capitalization are red. Bitcoin (BTC) has decreased by 0.7% over the past day. It’s currently trading at $104,737. Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 0.5%, losing all it has gained over the last day, now changing hands at $2,614. The category’s only gainer is Tron (TRX) . It appreciated by 1.7% to the price of $0.2731. At the same time, the highest decrease is Dogecoin (DOGE)’s 3.5% to $0.1892. Moreover, only five of the top 100 coins have seen their prices increase in this timeframe. Tron is the best performer in this category as well, followed by Tokenize Xchange (TKX) , with a rise of 0.9% to $31.37. On the other hand, Monero (XMR) dropped the most: 8.1% to $318. According to Glassnode , Bitcoin’s increase to the ATH has met growing resistance, as “market data points to exhaustion from earlier buyers and profit-taking by long-standing holders.” Many of the strong accumulation zones from previous cycles have turned into active selling regions. After briefly leaning toward distribution, the largest $BTC holders are now back in accumulation. All wallet cohorts show varying degrees of buying, with the strongest activity in the 10–100 #BTC and $BTC groups, both reaching a score of 1.0 – the highest possible. pic.twitter.com/hndK1F92qk — glassnode (@glassnode) June 5, 2025 “Altogether, the market appears to be at a crossroads, shaped by elevated sell pressure, maturing bullish momentum, and demand that must prove itself resilient,” the report says. “The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a mid-cycle consolidation or the start of a broader top formation.” BTC price is Likely to Remain Capped at $110,000 Nick Forster, Founder of decentralized onchain options platform Derive.xyz , says that market makers are currently short gamma. To maintain their hedge, they need to buy more BTC as the price increases. This creates a positive feedback loop that drives up demand. However, Forster says, there’s a “gamma hole” at $110,000. At this point, market makers will be forced to stop buying, as they become gamma-neutral. “This suggests that even if BTC rallies, the price is likely to remain capped at $110,000 – we won’t see the price exceeding this threshold.” Moreover, there is currently an 11% chance for BTC to surpass $125,000 by the end of September. This is a decrease from 18% last week. The drop reflects both a lower price and lower implied volatility, which has compressed the distribution of potential outcomes. At the same time, the chance of ETH settling above $3,000 by the end of September has increased from 22% to 24%. Source: derive.xyz Meanwhile, long-dated (180-day) BTC volatility has been on a downward trend. It fell from 56% to 46% in two months. “This is likely due to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) raising funds and selling calls into the market, reducing volatility,” Forster argues. Source: derive.xyz Finally, the Founder noted that over 57% of all BTC contracts traded on Derive.xyz were puts. This indicates that traders are bearish on BTC in the short term. “This is reflected in the skew (market sentiment), which has shifted toward a more neutral to slightly bearish outlook,” Forster says. Levels & Events to Watch Next BTC currently trades at $104,737. It again failed to hold the $105,000 level, reaching the intraday high of $105,910, then pulling back. Compared to its all-time high of $111,814, the coin is down 6.1%. It decreased by 2.8% in a week and rose by 10.9% in a month. Ethereum’s intraday high was $2,667. It’s down 4.3% in a week and up 45.2% a month, outperforming BTC on the monthly basis. Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index has dropped deeper within the neutral territory towards a bearish outlook, now standing at 55 today . As a reminder, it previously jumped to the extreme greed of 76, one day after BTC had hit its ATH. The sentiment signals caution in the market, with fear slowly moving in. Whether it will rise to greed or drop to fear will depend on the factors within the market itself and investors’ reaction to them. Meanwhile, on 4 June, US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a net inflow for a second day in a row, following an outflow streak, adding $86.92 million to the total of $44.57 billion. BlackRock saw inflows of $283.96 million, while Fidelity bled out $197.04 million. At the same time, US ETH spot ETFs continue the inflows streak of thirteen consecutive days, gaining another $56.98 million on 4 June. BlackRock leads this list with $73.18 million. The crypto market is still sensitive to news coming out of the US. Recent Automatic Data Processing (ADP) data showed 37,000 created jobs, the slowest private-sector hiring pace in two years. In response, Donald Trump once again called for the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. A drop in interest rates would be beneficial for the crypto market. Lower rates reduce the cost of borrowing, making risky assets more attractive, resulting in new money pouring into crypto. However, lower rated may lead to inflation. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The crypto market saw a wide, albeit minor, decrease over the past 24 hours, while the stock market recorded a mixed picture at closing. The S&P 500 has increased by 0.0074%, the Nasdaq-100 is up 0.27%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. The two do not seem to be moving in tandem currently. Stocks reacted to Donald Trump’s renewed calls for a Federal Reserve rate cut. Lower rates can boost stock prices but can also lead to inflation. Is this dip sustainable? Analysts still argue that the current drop in market cap and prices of major cryptos is a part of a typical post-ATH pullback. However, they also note that the market is at a crossroads.

2025-06-05T10:20:44,"Bitcoin: Massive Drop in Exchange Balances Signals Bullish Future, Says Sygnum Bank","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Massive Drop in Exchange Balances Signals Bullish Future, Says Sygnum Bank The world of cryptocurrency is constantly buzzing with data points, but some signals are louder than others. A recent report from Swiss crypto bank Sygnum Bank has sent a clear message to the market: Bitcoin ( BTC ) is leaving exchanges at a rapid pace. This trend, often interpreted as a strong bullish indicator, suggests a significant shift in investor behavior and supply dynamics. The Great Bitcoin Exodus: Why Exchange Balances are Plummeting According to Sygnum Bank’s June investment outlook, a staggering 1 million Bitcoin have been withdrawn from centralized exchanges over the past 18 months. This represents a substantial 30% decline in the total BTC held on these platforms. Think about that – 1 million coins, a significant portion of the circulating supply, are no longer readily available for immediate trading or selling on exchanges. Why is this happening? Several factors likely contribute: Long-Term Holding (HODLing): Investors are moving their Bitcoin off exchanges into cold storage or personal wallets, indicating a strong intention to hold for the long term rather than trade. Increased Self-Custody Awareness: Users are becoming more aware of the risks associated with keeping funds on exchanges (as the saying goes, “not your keys, not your coin”) and are taking control of their private keys. Institutional Accumulation: Large players and institutions acquiring BTC often prefer to custody their assets securely off-exchange through regulated custodians like Sygnum Bank or manage it themselves. This consistent drain on exchange balances reduces the readily available supply of Bitcoin for sale, which, assuming demand remains constant or increases, typically puts upward pressure on the price. What This Means: Bullish Signals from Declining Exchange Balances The decline in Bitcoin exchange balances is widely considered a bullish signal within the crypto community. Here’s why: Reduced Selling Pressure: Fewer BTC on exchanges means fewer coins are immediately available to be sold into the market. This creates a supply squeeze. Strong Holder Conviction: Moving Bitcoin off exchanges is a deliberate action that signals high conviction among holders. They are not planning to sell in the short or medium term, indicating belief in future price appreciation. Potential Supply Shock: If demand spikes while the readily available supply on exchanges is low, it can lead to rapid price increases as buyers compete for limited coins. Sygnum Bank’s report reinforces this perspective, highlighting the significance of this sustained trend over 1.5 years. It’s not a short-term fluctuation but a consistent pattern of withdrawal. A New Frontier? Central Banks and Bitcoin Adding another layer of bullish potential, Sygnum Bank also noted that several countries are exploring the possibility of holding Bitcoin as part of their central bank reserves . While no specific countries were named in the summary provided, the mere exploration of this idea by sovereign nations is a monumental shift. Central banks traditionally hold reserves in assets like gold, foreign currencies, and government bonds. Including Bitcoin would signify a major endorsement of its legitimacy as a store of value and a reserve asset. This potential development could introduce an entirely new class of massive buyers into the BTC market. Benefits and Challenges of Central Bank Bitcoin Adoption The prospect of central banks adding Bitcoin to their reserves comes with significant potential benefits and challenges: Benefits: Massive Demand Injection: Central banks manage trillions in reserves. Even a small allocation to Bitcoin could represent enormous purchase volumes. Enhanced Legitimacy: Sovereign adoption would provide unprecedented legitimacy to Bitcoin as a global asset, potentially accelerating adoption by other institutions and individuals. Diversification: For central banks, Bitcoin offers a non-sovereign, digitally native asset uncorrelated with traditional reserve assets. Challenges: Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin ‘s price volatility remains a significant hurdle for risk-averse central banks. Regulatory Uncertainty: The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which can be a deterrent for state actors. Custody and Security: Securely holding and managing large amounts of Bitcoin presents technical and security challenges. Political and Economic Hurdles: Adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset involves complex political decisions and potential economic implications. Despite the challenges, the fact that this exploration is happening at all, as reported by Sygnum Bank, is a powerful indicator of Bitcoin ‘s growing importance on the global financial stage. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Market with Sygnum Bank’s Report What does this mean for investors and market observers? Sygnum Bank’s report provides key insights: Focus on Supply Dynamics: The declining trend in exchange balances is a fundamental supply-side factor that supports a bullish outlook for BTC . Pay attention to future reports tracking this metric. Monitor Institutional and State Adoption: Keep an eye on news regarding institutional investments and, crucially, any official announcements from countries exploring or adopting Bitcoin for reserves. This could be a major catalyst. Consider Long-Term Strategy: The trends highlighted by Sygnum Bank suggest a market where long-term holders are strong and new, large-scale demand could emerge. This reinforces the case for a long-term perspective on Bitcoin . Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just see the numbers. Understand *why* declining exchange balances and potential central bank reserves are significant – they speak to scarcity and growing acceptance. Conclusion: A Bullish Confluence of Factors Sygnum Bank’s latest report paints a decidedly bullish picture for Bitcoin . The significant and sustained drop of 1 million BTC from exchange platforms over the last 1.5 years signals strong holder conviction and reduced selling pressure, creating favorable supply dynamics. This fundamental strength is potentially amplified by the groundbreaking prospect of nations considering Bitcoin for their central bank reserves , which could unlock unprecedented levels of demand. While challenges remain, particularly for state-level adoption, the confluence of these factors suggests that Bitcoin ‘s journey towards becoming a mainstream, globally recognized asset is accelerating, potentially providing sustained momentum for the ongoing bull market.
