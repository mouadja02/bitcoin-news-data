2025-07-20T20:46:06,"Ethena (ENA) Rockets 45% in a Week ‚Äî Is This the Top Gainer to Watch?","Ethena's recent surge of 45% within a single week has captured significant attention in the crypto world. As traders search for the next big gainer, questions arise about Ethena's potential. This article will explore key coins on the rise and delve into what might drive future growth in the market. Ethena (ENA) Shows Strong Bullish Momentum Source: tradingview Ethena , currently trading between $0.26 and $0.43, is on a vigorous climb. With a week-on-week leap of 53% and a month-over-month increase of 74%, the cryptocurrency is breaking barriers. However, over the past six months, it still reflects a decline by nearly the same margin. Positioned above its 100-day moving average at $0.40, Ethena approaches the $0.51 resistance zone. Should it surpass this threshold, the coin could target $0.68, marking a potential rise of close to 60% from current highs. Indicative momentum signals like the RSI at 76.34 and Stochastic at 90.09 suggest continued upward traction, enticing for investors watching Ethena's next big move. Conclusion Ethena (ENA) has gained significant attention after its 45% rise in just a week. While the market remains unpredictable, ENA's recent performance places it among notable movers like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polkadot (DOT). It‚Äôs essential to monitor how ENA continues to perform in the coming days. With so much fluctuation in the crypto space, coins like ENA may present interesting opportunities.

2025-07-20T20:40:28,"OPERS increased its Palantir stake to 908,712 shares after the stock jumped 80% in H1 2025","Ohio‚Äôs biggest pension fund is moving deeper into high-volatility tech, while quietly stepping away from ride-hailing. OPERS, short for Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, added major positions in Palantir Technologies and MicroStrategy during the second quarter of 2025, while cutting its stake in Lyft, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of December 31, 2024, OPERS reported $155.6 billion in total assets, ranking it as the 14th largest public pension fund in the United States. OPERS doubles down on Palantir and Strategy, exits Lyft Palantir Technologies led the charge. OPERS bought an extra 171,441 shares of the company during Q2, raising its total to 908,712 shares. This came as Palantir‚Äôs stock rose 80% in the first half of 2025, leaving the broader S&P 500‚Äôs 5.5% gain in the dust. The momentum hasn‚Äôt stopped either‚Äîshares are up 13% so far in the third quarter, compared to a modest 1.5% increase in the S&P. Palantir‚Äôs surge began after it was added to the S&P 500 in September, a move that pushed index-tracking funds to buy shares automatically. The company also continued to deliver strong earnings, and this past Thursday, its stock hit an all-time high of $155.68. MicroStrategy, which now refers to itself as Strategy for the love of Bitcoin, was another big buy. OPERS added 21,499 shares, lifting its position to 101,880 shares by the end of June. Strategy‚Äôs bet is purely on Bitcoin. The firm has become the largest corporate holder of the OG crypto and has sold more than $3 billion in preferred shares to buy even more. Those preferred carry interest rates as high as 11.5%, a figure that raised eyebrows. ‚ÄúInvestors are questioning whether the yield is enough compensation, especially when there‚Äôs no reliable source of cash to pay dividends,‚Äù said Barron‚Äôs, which flagged the concerns in a recent note. Strategy disagrees, pointing out that its Bitcoin holdings are worth far more than what it owes. In the meantime, its stock rose 40% in the first half of 2025, with an additional 4.7% gain in Q3 so far. Meanwhile, OPERS took a step back from Lyft , selling 58,881 shares and dropping its total stake to 166,628 shares, despite a 22% rise in Lyft‚Äôs stock during the first half of the year. But the ride-hailing company has lost ground since July, with shares down 6.3% in Q3. February‚Äôs earnings report was mixed, and though May‚Äôs Q1 update featured a bigger share repurchase plan, it wasn‚Äôt enough to convince OPERS to stay. TD Cowen upgraded the stock in June from Hold to Buy, saying autonomous vehicle competition could help. OPERS clearly wasn‚Äôt sold.

2025-07-20T20:38:13,"Bitcoin Darknet Giant Abacus Vanishes ‚Äì Was It a Massive Exit Scam?","Abacus Market, once the largest Bitcoin-enabled Western DNM, has abruptly disappeared, leaving its vendors and buyers in limbo amid suspicions of a large-scale exit scam. According to blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, Abacus Market went offline in early July 2025, and took down its clearnet mirror and all related infrastructure without warning. Abacus Market‚Äôs Mysterious Disappearance During its four years of operation, Abacus handled nearly $100 million in Bitcoin-based sales. However, the platform was hit by several user complaints in late June about stalled withdrawals. TRM Labs said that this is a classic red flag in the darknet ecosystem, which often precedes an exit scam. The marketplace‚Äôs administrator, known as ‚ÄúVito,‚Äù attributed these withdrawal issues to an influx of new users following Archetyp Market‚Äôs seizure by law enforcement and ongoing DDoS attacks. Despite these assurances on dark web forums, many users remained skeptical. This was reflected in a sharp decline in deposits from an average of $230,000 daily across 1,400 transactions in early June to just $13,000 daily across 100 deposits by early July. Launched in 2021 and initially known as Alphabet Market, Abacus rebranded and steadily rose in prominence. While it catered to a global audience, it particularly focused on the Australian market with tailored moderators and cultural messaging. Unlike competitors, Abacus operated with a centralized deposit wallet and multisignature capabilities while supporting Bitcoin and Monero. Its market share grew rapidly following the closures of other major darknet markets, and climbed from 10% in 2022 to over 70% by 2024. For instance, the closure of Archetyp in June 2025 drove even more traffic to Abacus, with its monthly sales volume spiking to $6.3 million. This surge may have inadvertently sealed its fate. TRM Labs explained that the sudden disappearance of Abacus was likely an intentional exit by its operators, who may have chosen to cash out and vanish rather than risk law enforcement attention as the market‚Äôs size and visibility increased. The timing aligns with a pattern observed in the darknet ecosystem, where markets that reach peak prominence often face a choice between risking seizure and preserving personal safety and profits. While it remains possible that law enforcement seized Abacus covertly, Dread forum administrator Hugbunter, who maintained close contact with the project‚Äôs staff, believes the shutdown was not linked to an official takedown. Historically, darknet administrators who exit at the height of their market‚Äôs popularity, whether through exit scams like Evolution Market or voluntary closures like Agora Market, have largely evaded law enforcement capture. Russian Darknet Markets Rise TRM Labs also noted that despite major darknet platforms shutting down, the ecosystem continues to adapt quickly. After Hydra Market‚Äôs 2022 closure , new Russian-language darknet markets emerged and have managed to capture over 97% of global darknet drug revenues by 2024. While some Western darknet operators have tried rebrands or exit scams post-seizure, complete marketplace rebuilds now appear less frequent.
