2025-07-20T02:30:41,"Litecoin Sharp Pullback: Scalping Opportunities Emerge While LTCBTC Seeks Stability","In a recent post on X, CRYPTOWZRD pointed out that Litecoin ended the day on a bearish note, with LTCBTC giving up its gains in a sharp reversal. He emphasized the need for stronger, more stable price action from the LTCBTC pair before expecting a solid move in Litecoin. For now, his focus remains on the intraday chart, where heâ€™s watching closely for short-term opportunities to scalp quick trades. LTCBTC Spike Fizzles After Bitcoin Dominance Rebounds According to CRYPTOWZRD, Litecoin and its BTC pair (LTCBTC) both ended the day with bearish daily candle closes, signaling potential short-term weakness. Despite showing some upward momentum earlier in the day, the broader market conditions shifted, impacting Litecoinâ€™s price action significantly. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin â€“ Will $96 Resistance Crack? LTCBTC experienced a brief spike, primarily triggered by a drop in Bitcoin dominance. This short-lived move created a temporary window for bullish momentum in Litecoin. However, the gains were not sustained, and much of the spike was quickly retraced as Bitcoin dominance began to rebound. As Bitcoin regained strength, Litecoinâ€™s price action closely mirrored the movements of BTC and LTCBTC. This correlation led Litecoin to test the $112 resistance level once more, but the rejection at that zone caused it to lose ground and slide back toward the $96 support region. CRYPTOWZRD noted that any significant upside for Litecoin will likely depend on LTCBTC turning bullish again, a move that typically coincides with a drop in Bitcoin dominance. Until that shift occurs, the path higher remains uncertain, and traders may need to remain cautious of potential downside pressure. For now, the expertâ€™s focus is shifting to lower timeframes, where he aims to identify short-term formations for scalping opportunities. Volatility Expected To Increase Near Key Levels For Litecoin CRYPTOWZRD concluded his analysis by noting that the intraday chart for Litecoin showed a clear bearish structure throughout the day. Price action lacked strength, and any upward movement was quickly met with resistance. This points to ongoing uncertainty in the short term, with sellers still maintaining some control. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance â€“ Bulls Target $97.10 Level Looking ahead, he emphasized that a clean reversal and reclaim of the $102 resistance zone could shift momentum. If Litecoin manages to hold above that level, it may open the door for a push toward the $112 resistance area. As his final verdict, CRYPTOWZRD warned that if Bitcoin doesnâ€™t provide a strong directional move soon, Litecoin could continue to trade sideways with choppy volatility over the weekend. In the meantime, patience is key â€” traders should wait for a more mature, high-probability setup before entering new positions.

2025-07-20T02:23:31,"Billionaire Ray Dalioâ€™s Bridgewater Sells S&P 500, Amasses $1,020,000,000 in Two Major Assets","Billionaire Ray Dalioâ€™s hedge fund is shedding exposure to the S&P 500 and hedging against the US dollar â€“ while managing to stay on offense. The latest 13F filings show Dalioâ€™s Bridgewater Associates has lowered its stake in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, a benchmark fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500. That fund now makes up about 8.5% of Bridgewaterâ€™s overall portfolio as of the end of March. Simultaneously, the hedge fund has increased its exposure to SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of gold bullion, less its expenses. Bridgewater increased its GLD holdings by about 33%, allocating approximately $340 million in total exposure to the precious metal. The move comes as Dalio repeatedly warns the US dollarâ€™s decline could eventually trigger stagflation â€“ a dreaded economic outcome marked by high inflation, high unemployment and low economic growth. But Bridgewaterâ€™s portfolio is not merely defensive. Alongside GLD, the firm has dramatically boosted its position in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Bridgewater increased its Alibaba holdings by over 3,000%, attaining 5,660,258 shares worth approximately $680 million. That makes it one of the fundâ€™s top holdings. Alibabaâ€™s stock has risen approximately 42% year-to-date, driven by strong growth in its cloud computing segment.

2025-07-20T02:00:48,"100% Coin Access, No Waiting! BlockDAG Drops NO VESTING PASS While Kaspa Eyes 10x & PEPE Target 75% Gain","The crypto market is heating up fast, and three names are pulling ahead. PEPE shows signs of a 75% breakout backed by momentum and an active community. Kaspa (KAS) is lining up a 10x surge, thanks to its speed and tech edge powered by BlockDAG design. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is making the biggest move right now. For 6 days only, itâ€™s offering a NO VESTING PASS that gives 100% coin access at launch. No wait, no delays. This puts BDAG in a strong spot as a top pick for anyone eyeing the best crypto for 2025. Kaspa (KAS) Price Outlook Points to a 10x Climb Kaspa (KAS) stands out in the current cycle with its fast BlockDAG structure and solid security. Its potential is clear, especially if Bitcoin touches $200K. Experts project KAS could climb to $0.85â€“$1.00 in the best case, or stay between $0.25â€“$0.35 in more cautious outlooks. Either way, thatâ€™s more than 10x above todayâ€™s levels. With a deflationary model, scalability, and community support, Kaspa (KAS) price outlook shows strength. Itâ€™s shaping up to be one of the top altcoins ready to run in the next cycle. PEPE Price Forecast Aims for Breakout and 75% Upside The PEPE price forecast suggests itâ€™s one of the most watched meme coins right now. Chart signals show a falling channel with breakout potential, and analysts expect gains of 75%, with a target near $0.000022. PEPE has seen a 26% jump this week and 13% over the last month. Whale action and fresh exchange listings are keeping the buzz alive. With talk of a move to $0.000035 by 2025, PEPE could take the lead in the meme coin race. Claim 100% of BDAG at Launch with No Lockup â€“ Only 6 Days Left The NO VESTING PASS gives traders a rare chance to gain full access to their BlockDAG (BDAG) coins instantly. For just 6 days, every BDAG purchase comes fully unlocked at launch, skipping the usual wait time seen in most presales. No lock-up periods, no delays, just full control right from the start. With Bitcoin hitting new highs and BlockDAG heading toward its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the timing couldnâ€™t be better. Anyone who buys BDAG within this limited window can take advantage of early access and act without restrictions. This one-week offer removes the usual barriers, putting the buyer in charge from the very first moment. Keep in mind, this offer only applies to BDAG bought during this time. Any bonus rewards or promo-related coins will still follow the standard vesting process. But for direct BDAG purchases, the path to instant access is now wide open. This is a rare chance to get ahead before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. The NO VESTING PASS makes it possible to skip the wait and move fast. For anyone aiming to ride BlockDAGâ€™s momentum, thereâ€™s no better moment to step in. The Bottom Line While the PEPE price forecast and Kaspa (KAS) price outlook show exciting growth potential, BlockDAG takes a different route. With the NO VESTING PASS now live, buyers can unlock 100% of their BDAG coins at launch, giving them the power to react right away. This fast-access window, along with the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release, puts BlockDAG in a strong position among the best crypto for 2025 . With only 6 days to grab this edge, the chance to move early and take full control is slipping away fast.
