2025-07-20T10:52:49,"Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Just Hit 180-Day Peak ‚Äì Can This Last?","Ethereum has surged to a dramatic 180-day peak of $3,671, delivering an explosive 152% rally from March lows near $1,392. The latest surge gained momentum through July with ETH posting a record 37% monthly gain , driven by historic institutional demand through spot ETFs that recorded single-day inflows of $720 million. ETH is currently trading well above all major moving averages, and it is approaching the critical $4,000-$4,200 resistance zone. Institutional accumulation behind Ethereum‚Äôs rally has outpaced Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF flows, with BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale funneling billions into Ethereum products. This shifting institutional preference provides fundamental support for technical breakouts, positioning ETH for potential acceleration. Technical analysis reveals that Ethereum is approaching a historic inflection point, where cycle patterns suggest that the most explosive phase may still lie ahead. Ascending Channel Targets $4,100 Breakout Ethereum‚Äôs 4-hour chart reveals methodical progression through a well-defined ascending channel, building momentum since March lows. ETH is currently testing the upper boundary around $3,700-$3,800, and trades well above all exponential moving averages in bullish alignment. Source: TradingView The positioning indicates strong underlying momentum with pullbacks likely finding support at progressively higher levels. RSI readings of 78.54 indicate strong momentum approaching overbought conditions, but institutional ETF flows provide fundamental support for sustained advances. The projection above $4,100 is based on measured moves from a channel breakout, combined with resistance levels aligning with previous cycle highs. ETF inflows exceeding those of Bitcoin indicate a shifting institutional preference toward Ethereum, with multiple public companies expanding their treasuries to cover ETH as well. Cycle Analysis Suggests Explosive Phase Ahead Ethereum approaches major resistance around $4,000-$4,200, which must be cleared to confirm the initiation of a new bull market cycle. A breakout above this ‚ÄúStrong High‚Äù resistance zone would likely trigger what analysts describe as ‚Äúthe most explosive part of the cycle.‚Äù Source: Crypto Caesar Market structure analysis reveals that ETH has successfully reclaimed multiple intermediate levels as it approaches the final major hurdle. Cycle comparison analysis provides an even more compelling long-term outlook. While Bitcoin is 1,949% above its macro base, approaching upper expansion zones where previous cycles saw momentum shifts toward altcoins, Ethereum, at 961%, remains significantly lower in its expansion cycle. $ETH is doing exactly what it did before every major rally. BTC is now trading 56% above its macro base. ETH is at 83%, still below its full expansion zone. This chart isn‚Äôt showing price targets. It‚Äôs showing where we are in the cycle. $BTC reached its upper expansion band,‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/jqyCZmAazt ‚Äî Cas Abb√© (@cas_abbe) July 20, 2025 Historical patterns also suggest that Bitcoin typically consolidates at similar levels, while Ethereum enters periods of aggressive growth. Current positioning suggests that the transition point may be approaching even further, with Bitcoin showing signs of deceleration. At the same time, Ethereum builds momentum for its expansion phase, targeting cycle parity and potentially parabolic advances. BTC Hyper: Final Chance to Join $3M Presale Success As Ethereum moves towards $4,000+ levels, Bitcoin is not left behind. With BTC Hyper , Bitcoin holders can participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. BTC Hyper‚Äôs $HYPER token presale has raised over $3.7 million, with a few hours left before the presale window closes permanently. Early investors are securing positions in the Layer-2 solution that bridges Bitcoin into Ethereum‚Äôs expanding ecosystem. The platform‚Äôs Solana Virtual Machine architecture enables Bitcoin holders to access Ethereum-based DeFi protocols and yield farming opportunities without selling BTC positions. $HYPER token holders benefit from high APY staking rewards, reduced transaction fees, and governance rights in the upcoming DAO launch, scheduled for Q3/Q4 2025, alongside the mainnet deployment. As cycle analysis suggests, Ethereum may be entering its most aggressive growth phase while Bitcoin consolidates, time is running out for investors to participate at presale pricing. The limited allocation remaining and approaching launch timeline create an opportunity for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin scaling infrastructure during Ethereum‚Äôs potential explosive altseason phase.

2025-07-20T10:41:08,"What Lies Ahead for Solana (SOL) Prices? Analysis Company Releases Technical Analysis","In its latest technical assessment of Solana (SOL), cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision stated that the correction structure predicted in their previous analysis has come true and the price has declined further with the bearish (c) wave. The company said that Solana currently appears to be in a recovery phase, but critical resistance levels need to be overcome for this move to turn into a sustained rally. According to the analysis, the overall downward pattern in Solana remains corrective, defined by the blue (A)-(B)-(C) formation. This structure may be completed in the short term. However, whether the recovery will transform into an impulsive, strong, and sustainable upward wave will become clear in the coming days. If the recovery is merely a new corrective wave, the current uptrend may be limited. Technical analysis chart shared by MakroVision. Related News: JUST IN: UK Allegedly Plans to Sell $5 Billion Worth of Bitcoin - Is This the Reason for the Decline? MakroVision notes that the $223 level, in particular, represents a strong resistance area with high liquidity. A break above this level could be the first sign of a sustained upward trend. After $223, the next significant hurdle is $246. A break above this level could trigger a move towards the $270 region for Solana. Meanwhile, support levels to watch in the event of a potential pullback are also being carefully considered. $198 (0.5 Fibonacci) and $193 (0.618 Fibonacci) are seen as short-term support zones, while $188 is considered a strong support level. A break below this level could see Solana re-enter a downtrend and test lower levels. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What Lies Ahead for Solana (SOL) Prices?

2025-07-20T10:39:00,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Top Could Be Between $170,000 and $200,000, Many Altcoins Are Set For 50√ó Gains","Bitcoin price prediction enthusiasts are eyeing a potential retracement toward $111,000‚Äì$114,000 before the next leg to $170,000‚Äì$200,000 unfolds. Meanwhile, Hedera‚Äôs HBAR rally points to explosive altcoin season, with several tokens flirting with 50x upside. Here‚Äôs why a short-term pullback may clear the path for new highs, and which DeFi utility project deserves a spot on every best crypto presale 2025 list. BTC Bears Filling Gaps Before Bull Resumes A classic V‚Äëshaped reversal after Bitcoin‚Äôs all‚Äëtime high near $123,000 signals profit‚Äëtaking and bearish control. Two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) on the 4‚Äëhour chart, first at $119,000 and the next around $111,000, are magnets for price reversion. A CME gap near $114,000‚Äì$116,000 adds credence to an imminent retracement toward that zone before bulls reclaim their footing. Yet on-chain metrics remain supportive: daily volumes have averaged over $100‚ÄØbillion, and the Fear & Greed Index sits firmly in ‚ÄúGreed,‚Äù not yet extreme. Should BTC fill these gaps, the next bitcoin price prediction targets of $170,000 and even $200,000 become plausible as leverage unwinds and fresh buyers step in. Source: Tradingview HBAR‚Äôs Parabolic Charge and Short‚ÄëTerm Warning HBAR has posted a fourth consecutive bullish weekly candle after bouncing at $0.125 support, surging toward the $0.300‚Äì$0.340 resistance cluster. Weekly RSI above 50 and a positive MACD echo October‚ÄØ2023 readings that preceded a multi‚Äëmonth boom, underpinning a bullish Hedera outlook for 2025. Shorter‚Äëterm, however, the six‚Äëhour chart shows HBAR hitting a Fibonacci extension at 1.61√ó wave one, accompanied by bearish divergences in RSI and MACD. A pullback to $0.240 would offer a healthier base for the next leg higher, potentially positioning HBAR for 50√ó gains against select low cap crypto gems once macro tailwinds return.

On-chain data shows that the hacker responsible for looting over $300 million from Coinbase users has gone long on Ethereum (ETH). The wallet reportedly linked to the hacker scooped 649.62 ETH (approx. worth $2.31 million) at an average price of $3,561. This move follows a month-long laundering campaign and signals that the attacker is now taking a directional bet on Ethereum‚Äôs upside. Ether price has jumped by 26% over the last 7 days. Ethereum hits $3,700 as whales flood in Data shared by Lookonchain shows that the same Coinbase hacker wallet has added 4,863 Ethereum (approx. worth $12.55 million) on July 7 at the average price of 2,581. However, two months ago, the exploiter sold 26,762 ETH (approx. worth $69.25 million) when it was trading around $2,588. This isn‚Äôt the only big money moving into ETH, as two newly created institutional-grade wallets purchased a combined 58,268 ETH, worth an estimated $212 million. The accumulation was done via FalconX and Galaxy Digital. The hacker who stole $300M+ from #Coinbase users bought another 649.62 $ETH ($2.31M) at $3,561 9 hours ago. https://t.co/u0exg3Oaao https://t.co/2bLvhTVVhu pic.twitter.com/wyjCXPbQMe ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 20, 2025 On the other side, a known whale wallet (0xd5ff) closed a long ETH position a few hours ago while locking in a $1.7 million profit. Over the past four days, the same address executed six ETH long trades, all of which remained profitable for him. It holds a total profit haul nearing $3 million. The largest altcoin is riding the bullish wave very well and has posted gains of more than 125% in the last 90 days. Ethereum is trading at an average price of $3,705 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume hovers around $30 billion. Source: SoSoBValue The institutional appetite for Ethereum is still accelerating. Ether-linked US ETFs recorded $402.5 million inflow on Friday and outpaced Bitcoin ‚Äôs $363.45 million. BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA fund alone accounted for $394.91 million of that total. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH and Grayscale‚Äôs ETHE recorded modest outflows. Ether ETF trading volumes hit $2.8 billion, while total assets under management for Ether products surged to a record $18.37 billion. Inside Coinbase‚Äôs $300M ETH heist The Coinbase hack itself remains one of the most controversial incidents in 2025. As first reported by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the attacker initially swapped $42.5 million worth of stolen Bitcoin for Ethereum via Thorchain. They later converted nearly 18,000 ETH into over $45 million in DAI stablecoins, further obfuscating the trail. The breach reportedly stemmed from a social engineering scheme. Hackers bribed external contractors and support employees located outside the United States to gain access to sensitive user data, impacting 97,000 Coinbase accounts. Login credentials weren‚Äôt compromised, but names, addresses, and emails were exposed. Coinbase has pledged to reimburse affected users and estimate damages.

In a notice, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) says 103,000 individuals across the United States with accounts on Medicare.gov are impacted by a data breach. CMS says it discovered that user data had been compromised after receiving multiple complaints through its call center. According to the federal agency, hackers may have used information from external sources to collect data such as names, dates of birth, Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers, coverage start dates and ZIP codes to fraudulently create Medicare.gov accounts. Once inside, the thieves gained access to more sensitive data, including provider details, mailing addresses, dates of service, diagnosis codes, services received and plan premiums. ‚ÄúOn May 2, 2025, representatives at our 1-800-MEDICARE call center flagged complaints from people with Medicare who had received a letter through the mail about the creation of a Medicare.gov account. However, these callers hadn‚Äôt created the accounts or asked anyone else to do it for them. Noticing the similarities in the reports, we investigated further and discovered more cases of accounts created between 2023 and 2025 that matched this pattern. We quickly deactivated those accounts, while also launching a larger effort to find the bad actors who created them.‚Äù The CMS is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tasked with overseeing the country‚Äôs healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children‚Äôs Health Insurance Program and Health Insurance Marketplace. The CMS is encouraging affected individuals to get a free credit report from each of the three major nationwide credit reporting companies. The agency also says that it hasn‚Äôt received any reports of identity fraud or improper use of personal information as a result of the incident.

2025-07-20T10:00:19,"UK Government Looks To Offload $7 Billion Seized Bitcoin ‚Äì Details","The UK government is reportedly planning to sell billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in a bid to support public spending. This development comes following Bitcoin‚Äôs latest success in establishing a new all-time high at $123,091. UK Chancellor Turns To Crypto Proceeds To Plug Financial Holes ‚Äì Report According to a report by local media Telegraph, the UK Home Office is presently exploring means to offload at least ¬£5 billion ($6.71 billion) in seized BTC as the Labor-led government reportedly struggles with financing the public budget following recent policy reversals on welfare and winter fuel allowance by Prime Minister Kier Starmer. The Telegraph explains that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, is looking to seal a budget hole of ¬£20 billion amid rising inflation figures, higher borrowing costs, and weak economic growth. While some ministers have proposed a rise in taxes to fill this gap, Reeves is currently exploring other means to alleviate the financial mayhem, including sales of confiscated crypto assets from illicit activities. The exact amount of digital assets seized by the UK government is unknown. However, a specific police operation in 2018 resulted in the impoundment of 61,000 BTC from a Chinese ponzi scheme. These assets, valued just above ¬£300 million ($402.36 million) at the time of seizure, are now worth ¬£5.4 billion ($7.24 million) at the present market rate, representing a resounding 1700% price gain. UK To Launch Crypto Storage System In handling the purported BTC offload, Telegraph further reports that the UK Home Office is looking to develop a crypto storage and realization system that will enable law enforcement agents to effectively preserve and sell seized digital assets. Official documents reveal this project is expected to cost ¬£40 million ($53.65 million), with the service provider set to receive a further commission on each asset sale. Interestingly, it‚Äôs worth noting that the UK government has previously kicked against the idea of a National Bitcoin Reserve following suggestions by Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party. But these recent plans may suggest that government figures may now acknowledge crypto assets as a source of significant revenue. Meanwhile, confiscated crime proceeds are usually split between the UK Treasury and law enforcement agencies. Therefore, it remains unknown what the exact percentage of the reported ¬£5.4 billion BTC sale will be credited to balance the UK government‚Äôs books. At press time, Bitcoin continues to trade at $117,856 following a 0.07% gain in the past day.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/uk-government-to-offload-7-billion-seized-bitcoin/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","UK Crypto News|bitcoin|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Chancellor of Exchequer|UK government|UK Home Office",cryptocompare
