2025-07-20T07:55:09,"Bitcoin minimum transaction fee drops by 90%","The minimum fees required for a Bitcoin transaction have been slashed by 90%. This news comes amid the debates over what the asset is best suited for. Some believe it is better for everyday payments, while others are still adamant that it satisfies the conditions to be a store of value. Over the past few years, there have been several enthusiasts who have felt Bitcoin is no longer a regular digital asset, considering the fact that the asset’s value has been quite stable since it launched. To make it more appealing, users of the biggest crypto network can now pay as low as 0.1 satoshi per virtual byte (sat/vByte) to process their transactions. A satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, with 1 satoshi currently standing at about 0.00000001 BTC. Bitcoin minimum transaction fee drops by 90% According to previous records, miners usually need to pay 1 satoshi/vByte as minimum fees to process their transactions. But because the leading digital assets network has been lacking in activities for a while, miners have decided to cut the minimum rate down by 905 in order to add more blocks to the blockchain. This refers to the weight of a transaction and how fast it will be processed. When the blockchain is busy, it will typically cost more to have miners prioritize your transactions. This latest development shows that demand for block space has dropped drastically. In other words, people are no longer making as many transactions as they used to, pushing miners to consider accepting lower fees. The Bitcoin network is run mainly by miners, which today mostly comprises industrial operations of warehouses full of sophisticated computers that process transactions on the network. Miners earn rewards by processing blocks, which contain transaction data, and adding them to the blockchain. For every block that is processed, miners are open to rewards of up to 3.125 BTC, which is currently worth around $367,000 at the current price, along with transaction fees. But as fewer people carry out transactions like sending funds, Ordinals inscriptions (NFTs), or other actions, transaction fees have been forced to remain low, which means miners earn less for every successful block they win. Prominent BTC proponents bemoan drop in network activity According to a pseudonymous Bitcoin miner Econoalchemist, transactions at the 0.1 sat/vByte fee rate have always been acceptable by most miners in the protocol. However, he noted that some node operators may choose to ignore such low fees. With Mempool and others now pushing the low fees, it means that there is a growing consensus among them towards accepting these kinds of transactions. “Over time, policy rules will trend toward matching consensus rules, lifting most relay restrictions,” he said. Prominent personalities in the payments and crypto space have previously lamented the slow rate of transactions on the blockchain, with former Twitter boss and Square CEO Jack Dorsey being the latest. Dorsey, a big fan of Bitcoin, said that the cryptocurrency would only succeed if people use it for sending and receiving money as it was designed for. “I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it just gets increasingly irrelevant,” Dorsey said during a podcast in April. While Bitcoin has not been used for sending and receiving money like most people believe, it is currently satisfying another use case: individuals and firms are using it as a store of value. This action has propelled the asset to new all-time highs. “I suppose time will tell, but Bitcoin seems to be moving into [a store of value asset] and not being used for any type of transactions,” Scott Norris, CEO of Bitcoin miner Optiminer, said. Even with this new development, the sender of a crypto transaction can still choose the fee. This means that if they are in a hurry to get a payment seen and processed on time by miners, they can just increase the fee, and it will be added to a block quicker. Meanwhile, some users on X have expressed delight at how cheap it was to use the blockchain. “I love seeing sub-1 sat/vbyte transactions in my Mempool,” adding that he wanted to “pay as little as possible,” a user wrote.

In a notice to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, The Alcohol & Drug Testing Service (TADTS) says a cybersecurity incident has exposed the data of 748,763 individuals. According to TADTS, an unauthorized entity gained access to its data systems and stole information provided to the firm during the screening process, which may include names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, government-issued IDs, bank and financial entries, credit and debit card records, usernames and passwords, email accounts and passwords, USCIS or alien registration numbers and biometric datasets. “On July 9, 2024, TADTS became aware of a potential compromise to data maintained in our systems. As soon as we discovered this activity, we immediately took steps to investigate, contain, and remediate the situation, including changing passwords, enhancing our endpoint detection protocols, and engaging experienced privacy and cybersecurity professionals to assist. We also reported this matter to federal law enforcement. Through additional investigation, we confirmed that some of our data had been downloaded by an unauthorized actor.” TADTS is a Texas-based firm that offers a nationwide network of collection sites for workplace and individual drug and alcohol screening. The firm urges impacted individuals to be on the lookout for signs of identity theft and fraud. TADTS also says that victims may get one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. For now, TADTS says that it has not received reports of identity theft and fraud related to the data breach.

2025-07-20T07:00:24,"Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record $50 Billion – Volatility Incoming?","Ethereum is holding firm above the $3,500 level, a key support reclaimed last Friday, signaling renewed strength in the market. After surging over 70% since late June, ETH appears to have entered a new bullish phase driven by rising demand and institutional interest. The momentum has shifted clearly in favor of the bulls, with technical structure and price action aligning to support further upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Sales Surge To Highest Level Since April – Details Adding to the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant data shows that Ethereum open interest has reached an all-time high, pointing to growing trader activity and rising capital in ETH derivatives markets. This surge in open interest often precedes large price movements, suggesting that Ethereum could see heightened volatility and expansion in the coming days. The combination of sustained price levels, strong trend continuation, and increasing participation sets the stage for a potentially explosive move. If bulls can maintain control above $3,500, Ethereum could be gearing up for a fresh leg higher in the short term. As the market awaits confirmation, all eyes are on ETH to see whether this momentum can drive it toward new 2025 highs. The coming week could prove pivotal for Ethereum’s medium-term trend. Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record ATH Ethereum’s market setup continues to strengthen, with open interest in ETH derivatives reaching a new all-time high of $50 billion, according to CryptoQuant data shared by analyst Ted Pillows. “Buckle up and enjoy the Ethereum ride,” Pillows stated, highlighting the elevated volatility ahead as a potential springboard for aggressive price action. This level of open interest is historically significant and often signals that large players are positioning for a major move. Such a dramatic increase in capital committed to ETH futures and options suggests rising investor confidence and heightened anticipation of directional momentum. While high open interest can lead to either a sharp rally or a correction, current on-chain and macro fundamentals indicate that the market may be leaning bullish. Ethereum’s network growth remains steady, with rising active addresses, validator participation, and increased activity on Layer 2s. More importantly, the recent passage of the GENIUS Act in the US provides legal clarity for stablecoins and lays the foundation for broader crypto regulation, benefiting Ethereum directly as the base layer for DeFi and real-world asset tokenization.

The move follows a strong rally from late June lows, with the price now up over 70% in less than a month. Importantly, ETH has broken past all major moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200 SMAs, signaling a shift toward bullish momentum across longer timeframes. Volume has increased significantly during this breakout, reinforcing the strength of the move. The next major resistance lies at $3,742.95, a level that previously acted as a local top earlier in the year. A successful close above this mark could open the door for a retest of the $4,000–$4,200 range.

Holding above this zone is critical to maintain the current bullish structure.
