2025-07-20T20:00:26,"VanEck CEO Predicts Rise of ‘Super Apps’ Like Robinhood, Kraken and X Will Put Pressure on TradFi’s Payments System","The chief executive of exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider VanEck is predicting that “super apps” will challenge traditional finance’s payments system. In a new interview with CNBC Television, VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck says that apps that offer support for stablecoins will soon begin to put pressure on traditional methods of payments. According to Van Eck, since stablecoins skip out on intermediaries such as Visa and Mastercard that charge about 3% in fees for payments, the super apps could serve as viable alternatives. “I definitely think that this will put cost pressure on the payments system because it is cheaper and allows all these competitors to come into the market, whether it’s a Kraken, whether it’s a Robinhood, whether it’s an X, there are going to be a lot of super apps.” On Friday, President Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, which establishes a stringent regulatory framework for firms issuing payment stablecoins. Van Eck goes on to note that while the stablecoin issuer Circle has done well so far this year, new competition is gearing up to enter the space. “It’ll be several quarters before it’ll impact earnings, either to the positive or the negative. But stocks are kind of moving in anticipation of that right now. And you see the incumbents – Ethereum has had a great month; Circle, the one public stablecoin company, has had a great run since its IPO (initial public offering). The market is getting ahead of it, but those are just the incumbents; there are going to be a lot of competitors entering into this space.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-20T19:12:26,"Ethereum tearing up towards $4,000 as ETH displays ‘main character moment’","Ethereum ( ETH ) is once again stealing the cryptocurrency market spotlight, with the asset now targeting the $4,000 level. To this end, according to analysis by charting platform TrendSpider , Ethereum is on the verge of a breakout supported by bullish technical indicators. In a July 8 post on X, TrendSpider noted that after reclaiming $3,800, Ethereum is having its “main character moment.” Ethereum having its main character moment right now. $ETHUSD 🌙 pic.twitter.com/4cj0O4GO9D — TrendSpider (@TrendSpider) July 20, 2025 The outlook shows that after months of accumulation between $2,000 and $3,000, Ethereum finally broke above the key resistance zone around $3,000 and $3,200 in mid-July. This breakout unleashed strong buying momentum, pushing ETH to highs near $3,800. The platform’s analysis identified a well-formed cup-shaped pattern that developed over the past six months, which often precedes significant upside moves. The volume profile indicates significant prior trading activity in the $2,500 to $3,000 zone, suggesting that former resistance has become strong support. Ethereum price levels to watch At the same time, market sentiment remains upbeat. A TrendSpider poll also found that 80.5% of respondents expect Ethereum to reach $4,000 in 2025, with 41% predicting $5,000 and 26.5% targeting $6,000. More bullish projections see ETH climbing to $7,000 (17.5%) or even $8,000 (13.5%). Ethereum’s momentum is also being fueled by institutional inflows and whale activity. For instance, on July 18, Ethereum ETFs recorded $402.5 million in net inflows, surpassing Bitcoin’s $363.4 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA driving 98% of the activity and pushing total ETH ETF assets to $18.37 billion. On-chain data showed a whale purchased 13,462 ETH (about $50 million) at $3,715. In comparison, futures open interest rose 12.79% month-over-month to $786 billion, with leveraged traders such as James Wynn reportedly taking $12.1 million in 25x long positions. Ethereum price analysis At press time, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was trading at $3,745, up more than 5% in the last 24 hours and 25% over the past week. ETH seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At current levels, Ethereum remains in a strong uptrend, trading above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $2,674 and 200-day SMA of $2,357. However, the 14-day RSI at 84 indicates overbought conditions, suggesting a short-term pullback could occur despite the bullish momentum.

2025-07-20T19:11:28,"ETH's ‘Most Hated’ Rally Could Trigger $331M in Liquidations Near $4K, Says Analyst","Ether's summer surge has ignited fierce debate among market analysts, with many pointing to mounting short positions and shifting capital flows as key drivers behind the rally. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is now trading near $3,755, up nearly 5.7% in the past 24 hours and more than 25% over the past week, according to CoinDesk Data. ETH holders have welcomed the rally, and some analysts believe it could accelerate further if a short squeeze forces bearish traders to close their positions. “$ETH is the most hated rally right now,” posted Crypto Banter on X, referring to the unusually high level of bearish positioning in the market. According to the CoinGlass data cited by the analyst, approximately $331 million worth of short positions could be liquidated if ether hits the psychologically significant $4,000 level. That liquidation cascade would likely accelerate price momentum in a classic feedback loop. Others see ether's outperformance as a clear sign of shifting market dynamics. Pentoshi, a well-followed trader on X, pointed to the steepest weekly drop in BTC dominance in four years as evidence of capital rotating into ETH. “Enjoy the next few weeks,” the pseudonymous analyst wrote, adding that ether's current trajectory resembles a “melt up” — a term used to describe rapid price increases driven more by fear of missing out (FOMO) than fundamentals. Pentoshi also noted a new structural tailwind: the emergence of ETH treasury strategy companies, which are aggressively accumulating ether on their balance sheets. “Now we have ETH treasury companies that are only a month old and into buying, competing to get 1% of the supply each,” he said. While not naming names, this likely refers to publicly traded firms like Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, whose large-scale ETH acquisitions have drawn increasing attention. Adding to the chorus, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen highlighted that altcoins continue to underperform relative to ether. “Alt/BTC pairs go up but they are lagging ETH/BTC,” he posted, suggesting that ether is capturing a disproportionate share of market flows. Cowen argued that ETH now carries lower relative risk than other altcoins and is behaving similarly to how Bitcoin did during previous cycles.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/20/eth-s-most-hated-rally-could-trigger-usd331m-in-liquidations-near-usd4k-says-analyst,"ETH|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC","Markets|Ether|ETH|Altcoins|News",cryptocompare
2025-07-20T19:50:46,"This Weekend's Crypto Long vs. Short Positions: What Traders Need to Know","<p>Understanding Crypto Long vs. Short Positions: What Traders Need to Know</p><p>Crypto markets constantly swing between bullish optimism and bearish caution, and one way traders gauge this sentiment is by analyzing long and short positions. Today’s snapshot shows intriguing data:</p><ul><li><p>Long Volume has increased by 3.33%, totaling approximately $19.46 billion.</p></li><li><p>Short Volume, however, is down 5.77% at around $18.61 billion.</p></li></ul><p>At first glance, traders might interpret this as bullish, given that long volume outweighs short volume. But let's dive deeper to understand what this actually means, and what it doesn't.</p><p>Breaking Down the Data:</p><ul><li><p>Long Positions reflect traders betting that the asset price will rise. Today's modest increase in long volume signals cautious optimism for the weekend bulls.</p></li><li><p>Short Positions represent traders expecting prices to fall. The decrease in short volume indicates a slight reduction in bearish sentiment.</p></li></ul><p>Looking specifically at exchanges:</p><ul><li><p>Binance BTC/USDT accounts show a Long/Short ratio of 0.89, which means slightly more accounts are short. Interestingly, though, the ratio improved nearly 10% towards longs.</p></li><li><p>Binance Top Traders present a mixed signal: their account ratio is neutral at 0.99, but the position ratio is strongly bullish at 1.75, despite decreasing slightly today.</p></li><li><p>OKX BTC/USDT and BTC markets indicate that while overall accounts slightly favor shorts, top traders significantly lean bullish (long/short ratio 1.82).</p></li><li><p>Bitfinex margin positions notably lean bearish, with 111.26K BTC short versus 45.67K BTC long.</p></li></ul><p>What Does This Mean?</p><p>This data reflects trader sentiment and positioning, not guaranteed market direction. Traders should consider:</p><ul><li><p>Retail vs. Institutional Traders: Top trader data usually represents institutional or professional traders, whose actions may be more predictive.</p></li><li><p>Contrarian Signals: Sometimes, extreme bullish or bearish sentiment can signal reversals. A market overly leaning one way might be due for a correction. But this is not the case now with this weekend data, and specifically within the last 24 hours. We did not see anything extreme but a gradual shift to slight bullishness on the more influencial, bigger exchanges.</p></li></ul><p>What It Does Not Mean:</p><ul><li><p>Guaranteed Outcomes: Long vs. short ratios offer insights, not certainty. Market sentiment can shift rapidly due to news, regulatory changes, or macroeconomic factors.</p></li><li><p>Uniformity Across Exchanges: Different exchanges may attract different trader profiles, so aggregated data is more reliable.</p></li></ul><p>What Traders Should Watch Next:</p><ul><li><p>Shift in Top Trader Positions: Significant movements from top traders on Binance and OKX can be early signals of a broader market move.</p></li><li><p>Bitfinex Margin Positions: The substantial short position here suggests caution, with a healthy chance that a larger group anticipates a drop, or they're positioned incorrectly, and a short squeeze could emerge.</p></li></ul><p>So, crypto traders, the observed shift toward more bullish positions over the weekend could indicate early signs of a potential short squeeze scenario, particularly when Friday showed initial signs of a sell-off or an early leg down rather than a confirmed bearish reversal (so far). </p><p>It's critical to remember that longs and shorts represent how market participants are currently positioned, but these positions do not guarantee correctness. Still, these weekend shifts provide valuable hints. Put it with your other parts of the puzzle, such as the price charts of bitcoin futures when it opens in a few hours, to get a better picture.
