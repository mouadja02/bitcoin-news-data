2025-07-20T08:30:47,"Altseason: 3 Signals Investors Should Watch For ‚Äì Analyst","Aside from a new all-time high in the Bitcoin market, the last trading week also heralded some altseason shouts as a slight price decline by the premier cryptocurrency coincided with significant price rallies by major altcoins. A popular market analyst with the X username PlanD has weighed in on these recent market developments, highlighting three factors that would confirm the presence of an altseason. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Price Failed To Break $123,000 In The Past Week ‚Äî Analyst Explains A BTC.D Retest At 63% May Mark Crucial Altseason Moment ‚Äì Analyst Over the last week, a bullish rise in the altcoin market cap to $1.45 trillion sparked widespread speculations about the current status of the altseason. Interestingly, in an X post on July 19, PlanD outlines three market events that will signal the altseason‚Äôs commencement, namely a potential pullback in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside a critical technical development in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D). Following Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent beyond $121,000 and Ethereum‚Äôs price rise above $3,400, PlanD says the first two signals to watch for are healthy corrections in these assets‚Äô prices. Specifically, the analyst explains that pullbacks toward the $111,000 and $3,250 regions for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, present an ideal situation that would allow capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, effectively causing a decline in BTC.D. Far from indicating weakness, PlanD says this retracement could actually catalyze the rise broader crypto market. Notably, if Ethereum finds support at $3,250, the ETH/BTC pair could strengthen, creating a favorable setup for altcoin rallies. This is because a stronger ETH/BTC pair is often a precursor to altcoin outperformance, as it signals increased investor appetite beyond Bitcoin. The third and perhaps most pivotal signal is unfolding in Bitcoin dominance. After months of holding above a rising support trendline, Plan D notes BTC.D has broken below it, signaling a potential change in market structure. However, the next test lies at the 63.40% dominance level. Should BTC.D retest this zone and fail to reclaim it, the analyst believes a new downtrend in dominance may begin, i.e., presenting the largest hallmark of altseason. In case of this scenario, PlanD also tells investors to expect strong bullish momentum in tokens linked to sectors such as real-world Assets (RWA), artificial Intelligence (AI), and gaming beyond the large and medium-cap tokens on popular blockchains.

More data from CoinMarketCap shows the Fear & Greed index sits at 69, suggesting a healthy level of risk appetite from investors. Importantly, the altseason index ranks at 42, indicating a rising momentum in the market‚Äôs favor for altcoins.

2025-07-20T08:30:38,"XRP Proponent Gives Bitcoin Holders Honest Advice","PharaohX33, a crypto investor and popular voice in the XRP community, recently challenged Bitcoin maximalists by highlighting XRP‚Äôs performance this cycle. His post on X urged those holding Bitcoin to reconsider their strategy if their goal is to accumulate more BTC over time. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy XRP bro, buy Bitcoin bro. Bitcoin is decentralized bro,‚Äù he wrote, mocking the typical response of Bitcoin supporters. He followed with a sharp counterpoint, stating, ‚ÄúYet XRP has already delivered & will continue to deliver a higher ROI than Bitcoin this cycle. ROI is all that matters.‚Äù ""Don't buy XRP bro, buy Bitcoin bro. Bitcoin is decentralized bro."" Yet XRP has already delivered & will continue to deliver a higher ROI than Bitcoin this cycle. ROI is all that matters. Fuck your Bitcoin. If you really wanted more Bitcoin‚Ä¶ You'll sell your Bitcoin for‚Ä¶ ‚Äî ìÇÄ (@PharaohX33) July 19, 2025 XRP Outpaces Bitcoin in ROI Return on investment (ROI) is the percentage gain or loss on an asset relative to its initial cost. It provides a clear measure of how effectively capital has grown over time. The numbers lend weight to PharaohX33‚Äôs argument, as XRP has performed significantly better. In November 2024, XRP opened at $0.5092 while Bitcoin stood at $70,216.90. XRP has since surged to an all-time high of $3.65 , representing an approximately 616% increase. In comparison, Bitcoin‚Äôs climb to $123,091.61 marks a gain of about 75%. This stark contrast reinforces PharaohX33‚Äôs view that XRP has outperformed BTC so far in this market cycle. Beyond price action, XRP‚Äôs network activity also shows significant momentum. Active XRP addresses have increased by 490% since 2022 , indicating rising adoption and engagement with the ecosystem. Bitcoin‚Äôs active addresses, by contrast, have only seen a 10% increase in the same period. This difference highlights how user activity regarding XRP is accelerating at a far greater pace. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Best Investment Choice He added, ‚ÄúIf you really wanted more Bitcoin, you‚Äôll sell your Bitcoin for XRP‚Ä¶ and sell your XRP for more Bitcoin later on.‚Äù Other experts have also highlighted XRP‚Äôs ability to outperform Bitcoin in terms of ROI, showing how a $2 increase for XRP could mean significantly more than a $20,000 increase for BTC. PharaohX33‚Äôs unapologetic tone reflects a growing frustration among XRP advocates who believe their asset‚Äôs progress is too often overlooked in favor of Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance narrative. With XRP continuing to make strides in both price and network usage, the debate between the two communities is unlikely to subside soon. PharaohX33‚Äôs message cuts through the noise with one clear assertion. For anyone looking to earn from their crypto investments by holding more BTC, the best option is to buy XRP and swap it for BTC later, as XRP offers more growth despite criticism from Bitcoin maximalists .

2025-07-20T08:04:17,"Billion-Dollar Bank Loses $107,635 in One Day As Thieves Allegedly Infect ATMs With Malware: Report","A Michigan-based bank has reportedly lost tens of thousands of dollars in just 24 hours to thieves running an advanced ATM scheme. Authorities are charging Florida residents Robert R. Rosales Rivero and Geniver Antonio Pinuela Testa with conspiracy to commit bank theft and bank theft in violation of federal law for allegedly draining $107,635 from multiple Isabella Bank ATMs, reports MLive. An affidavit by a Homeland Security special agent alleges that the duo executed an ‚ÄúATM jackpotting‚Äù operation in a single day, infecting the hard drives of Isabella Bank ATMs with malware to trick the machines into releasing cash. The agent says the ploy involves one person using a key to open an ATM and applying glue on its sensors before leaving for a short period to wait for the adhesive to take effect. The person would return to either change the ATM‚Äôs hard drive or use a device to corrupt its system. The other half of the duo would subsequently arrive with a mobile phone and a keyboard to control the machine to dispense cash. The alleged thieves were careful not to leave any trace of tampering. Isabella Bank‚Äôs surveillance video footage shows that four ATM locations across Michigan were hit between 1 a.m. and 8:09 p.m. on September 22nd. Using facial recognition software, authorities identified Testa as a potential suspect. He had been cited earlier this year for speeding while driving a 2011 Toyota Yaris. The lead helped police locate the alleged thieves in Minnesota, where they pulled over a Yaris with Testa and Rivero as occupants. Inside the car, authorities found a superglue, ATM keys, a mobile phone, a laptop and an electronic device. The police also searched the duo‚Äôs hotel room, where they found about $8,000 in cash, latex gloves, a flash drive and a hard drive. Testa and Rivero were charged in Minnesota but managed to post bail. Rivero is now in custody following a court appearance, while Testa remains at large. Both are Venezuelan nationals who arrived in the US legally. Isabella Bank has 35 branches across Michigan and $2.1 billion in total assets.
