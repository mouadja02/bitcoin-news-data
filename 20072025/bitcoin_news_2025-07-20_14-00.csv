2025-07-20T11:45:35,"Rare Altcoin Signal Brewing Since 2020 Foreshadowing Parabolic Expansion, According to Crypto Analyst","A crypto analyst known for his charts says that altcoins are flashing a very bullish signal that‚Äôs been five years in the making. In a post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous analyst TechDev shares with his 535,000 followers a TOTAL3 chart, which measures the entire market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. Using three-month candles, TechDev‚Äôs analysis suggests that TOTAL3 is currently breaking out of a massive ascending triangle that started forming in late 2020. ‚ÄúMacro altcoin expansion has triggered. Not seen since late 2020. But this one comes after a 4-year coil‚Ä¶the longest in history.‚Äù Source: TechDev/X The analyst believes that the altcoin market is trading in line with what‚Äôs known as a Livermore Accumulation Cylinder, a pattern identified by trader Jesse Livermore, a pioneer of day trading prominent in the early 1900s. Livermore Cylinders typically see price trade within an ascending megaphone pattern, making increasingly higher highs and higher lows before a final parabolic run well outside the upper resistance line of the range. Says TechDev, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not complicated. The entire alt market is in a Livermore cylinder.‚Äù Source: TechDev/X TechDev is also keeping an eye on stablecoins. He shares a chart showing the inverse of stablecoin dominance, or as he describes it, ‚Äústablecoin deployment.‚Äù The analyst notes that as stablecoins get deployed, it boosts digital asset prices, but that stablecoin deployment has never truly entered an uptrend, only temporary consolidations. ‚ÄúMost still don‚Äôt get it. This is stablecoin deployment. When it rises, crypto rises. But the moves associated with prior bull runs have only been countertrend moves. This will be the first actual breakout. It has no precedent. All prior runs have objectively been test pumps.‚Äù Source: TechDev/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-20T11:30:57,"Republican Lawmaker Warns GENIUS Act Opens Door To Layered CBDCs","On Friday, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, marking a pivotal moment for stablecoin regulation in the United States. After months of debate and two previous rejections, the bill finally passed through Congress, setting a clearer legal framework for payment stablecoins and their role in the broader digital economy. The legislation aims to boost innovation while reinforcing the US dollar‚Äôs position in the digital financial system. However, the bill did not pass without resistance. Among the most vocal opponents was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who represents Georgia‚Äôs 14th District and serves as Chairwoman of the DOGE Committee. Greene reaffirmed her vote against the GENIUS Act, citing concerns that it lays the groundwork for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) without explicitly banning it. Her position echoes a wider debate in Washington over the future of digital currencies, surveillance risks, and financial freedom. Despite the pushback, the GENIUS Act‚Äôs passage reflects a growing bipartisan consensus that regulatory clarity is needed to foster crypto innovation in the US. While not all voices are aligned on its implications, the bill is now law, and its real-world impact on stablecoins and DeFi could be felt in the months ahead. Marjorie Taylor Greene Slams GENIUS Act Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Chairwoman of the DOGE Committee, delivered a strong rebuke of the GENIUS Act following its passage and President Trump‚Äôs signature on Friday. Greene, who voted against the bill, warned that the American public ‚Äúhardly has any idea what it is, what it means, and what passed.‚Äù In her statement, she called the bill a Trojan horse for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) development, stating, ‚ÄúThis bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency.‚Äù Greene has long opposed any legislation that might open the door to CBDCs, arguing that a cashless society controlled by government-issued digital currency could be weaponized against US citizens. ‚ÄúDo you actually trust your government to never do that to you?‚Äù she challenged. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù While Greene opposed the GENIUS Act, she voted yes on the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, a bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. Despite House approval, Greene warned that the Senate lacks the votes to move the bill forward. She also supported the Clarity Act, which passed the House and includes provisions for self-custody and clear regulatory guidelines for digital assets. However, she promised to vote no if self-custody protections are removed in Senate revisions. ‚ÄúThe most important thing that needs to remain is protecting people‚Äôs self-custody of their digital currency.‚Äù Referencing the US exit from the gold standard in 1971, Greene argued the country is again at a crossroads‚Äîthis time moving from tangible cash to a fully digitized currency system. ‚ÄúYour ability to buy and sell will ultimately be held in digital accounts controlled by the banks and the government,‚Äù she warned. Crypto Market Cap Analysis The total crypto market capitalization has broken decisively above the $3.6 trillion level, reaching a new yearly high at $3.81 trillion, as shown in the chart. This breakout comes after several weeks of consolidation and signals renewed bullish strength across the digital asset space. The move was supported by strong green candles and increasing volume, suggesting broad participation across majors and altcoins. Importantly, the breakout confirms a bullish structure, with higher highs and higher lows forming since the June bottom. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) sits around $3.04T, and the 100-day SMA nears $3.01T ‚Äî both significantly below current price levels, reinforcing the strength of the uptrend. The 200-day SMA at $2.55T also confirms the long-term bullish posture. This breakout coincides with a backdrop of legal clarity in the US, particularly after the signing of the GENIUS Act, which boosts confidence in stablecoins and tokenized finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the charge, but altcoins are now gaining momentum as capital rotates across the ecosystem.

2025-07-20T11:03:56,"Law enforcement investigate crypto-linked disappearance of California octogenarian","Sheriffs in California have launched investigations into the disappearance of a 74-year-old man. According to reports, the man, Naipang Hou, disappeared in May after leaving his California home without his phone, and authorities believe the disappearance is linked to his family‚Äôs crypto fortune. According to local law enforcement, they believe that the disappearance is a result of the affluence of his family through digital assets . Hou was said to have left home on a Monday without his mobile phone, and days later, his silver Toyota Yaris was found abandoned near a hiking trail in Rancho Cucamonga. Authorities proceeded to declare him missing on May 4, with sheriff‚Äôs deputies now suspecting that he may have been kidnapped. California sheriffs kickstart investigations into Hou‚Äôs disappearance According to a statement by the San Bernardino County Sheriff‚Äôs Department on July 7, its Specialized Investigations Division had started looking into Hou‚Äôs disappearance, branding it suspicious and finding evidence of extensive fraudulent activities related to his bank accounts. The Sheriff‚Äôs Department mentioned that an unnamed suspect contacted Hou‚Äôs family with his phone to impersonate him. While law enforcement in California has yet to arrest any suspect in the case, investigators have not ruled out foul play. In response to his disappearance, Hou‚Äôs son, Wen Hou, offered a $250,000 reward for anyone with information leading to the safe return of his father. He believes that someone stole his father‚Äôs identity and drained more than $1 million from his accounts. Wen, who made his fortune in crypto, has been serving as the CIO of investment firm and hedge fund Coincident Capital since 2019. Discussing his father‚Äôs disappearance, Wen said he had no reason to disappear. ‚ÄúI miss him a lot,‚Äù he told local media. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs sort of a guide to my life,‚Äù he said in an interview with ABC. He mentioned that his father had been remodelling their home earlier this year after he discovered a massive leak. ‚ÄúHe did not mention anything suspicious; we knew he‚Äôd been getting bids from multiple contractors,‚Äù said Wen. ‚ÄúHe was living actually at an apartment that insurance provided, so he wasn‚Äôt always directly involved with the day-to-day repair.‚Äù Wen noted that the last time he saw his father physically was when they went on a fishing trip. We had a great time,‚Äù Wen said. ‚ÄúHe was mentally well, and he was happy, and there was nothing off about his personality or anything like that.‚Äù Authorities have mentioned that he was likely abducted days after the fishing trip. Wen said he started growing suspicious after he texted his father to visit, and I felt like he was not the one replying. According to commentators, wealthy crypto users often make themselves targets of criminals by flaunting their wealth online, neglecting online privacy or security. They added that poor security habits, along with the misconception that crypto is fully anonymous despite traceable blockchains, also increase vulnerability. Another comment mentioned that users are unknowingly exposed as targets through data leaks, wallet activities, and their social media posts. The trend, known as ‚Äúwrench attacks‚Äù in the crypto industry, has seen an increase in kidnapping , threatening, and holding people hostage to steal their money or seed phrases. Founder of blockchain forensic firm CryptoCare, Nick Harris, mentioned that there have been 22 reported cases globally in the first half of the year. Harris mentioned that police and other authorities are now deploying cybercrime units and blockchain forensic teams to trace transactions for ongoing investigations.
