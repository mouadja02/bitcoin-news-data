2025-07-20T09:50:36,"UK Home Office Plans to Sell $7 Billion in Seized Bitcoin: The Telegraph","The UK government is preparing to offload billions of pounds worth of seized Bitcoin, as pressure mounts on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to plug a widening budget gap. Key Takeaways: The UK government is planning to sell over ¬£5 billion in seized Bitcoin to help ease fiscal pressures. A centralized framework is being developed to manage storage and sales, with the Treasury closely monitoring potential proceeds. Experts warn against a hasty sell-off, drawing parallels to the UK‚Äôs poorly timed gold sale in 1999. Working alongside police forces, the Home Office is designing a centralized framework to store and sell confiscated digital assets, according to a report from The Telegraph . The plan, dubbed the ‚Äúcrypto storage and realisation framework,‚Äù could enable the sale of more than ¬£5 billion ($6.5 billion) in Bitcoin, most of it recovered from historic criminal investigations. A single 2018 raid alone netted 61,000 BTC, now valued at over ¬£5.4 billion, after prices hit $123,000 last week. Treasury Monitors Crypto Seizures as Law Enforcement Leads Sales While law enforcement handles the seizures and sales, the Treasury is reportedly keeping a close eye on the operation. Any proceeds not returned to fraud victims are typically split between the central government and law enforcement programs. Experts believe the Treasury could receive billions from the sales, providing a rare financial boost as Reeves faces the dual challenge of rising debt costs and weak economic growth. ‚ÄúThere is oil under our feet in terms of digital assets,‚Äù said Aidan Larkin, CEO of seizure specialist Asset Reality. ‚ÄúI do think digital assets will lead to a large windfall for government agencies and the public purse over the next five to ten years.‚Äù The Home Office had previously invited bids for the contract to manage the crypto sale system , with terms suggesting up to ¬£40 million in commissions for the chosen provider. While initial bids failed to meet requirements, the project is expected to continue in a revised form. The 2018 seizure of Bitcoin tied to Chinese fraudster Jian Wen is now under review, with victims requesting restitution. If the Treasury were to keep half of that haul, approximately ¬£2.6 billion, it would go a long way toward easing fiscal pressures. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont urged Reeves to ‚Äúspend it right away,‚Äù but others warn against rushing. UK‚Äôs Bitcoin Sell-Off Sparks Fears of ‚ÄúAnother Gold Blunder‚Äù Comparisons have already been drawn to Gordon Brown‚Äôs infamous 1999 gold sale, when the UK sold 401 tonnes of gold at rock-bottom prices, a decision that cost the country tens of billions. ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes‚Ä¶"" The UK Labour Party's @Keir_Starmer @RachelReevesMP are planning to sell $5b worth of seized bitcoin If you proceed, you'll go down in history as a worse laughing stock than when @GordonBrown sold our gold at the bottom pic.twitter.com/kBR8rppHx5 ‚Äî Liam | Defi-Ant Degen (@defi_ant_degen) July 19, 2025 Meanwhile, political voices have weighed in. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called for the UK to establish a Bitcoin reserve, mirroring a move announced by Donald Trump in the U.S. Labour, however, rejected the idea, citing Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility. Despite the risks, the size of the potential windfall makes it difficult to ignore. ‚ÄúWith the delays in court hearings that we‚Äôre getting now, you have to seize it and then maintain it for a long time,‚Äù said Cardiff University professor Michael Levi, an expert in criminal asset seizures.

2025-07-20T09:45:31,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Bitcoin Whale Wallet Moves $9.6 Billion","When an OG Bitcoin whale moved a staggering $9.6 billion worth of BTC and worries rippled through markets over looming stablecoin audit rules, seasoned investors sat up and took notice. This massive shift isn‚Äôt just another portfolio rebalance; it highlights how quickly fortunes can change when on-chain titans make their move. This is huge. üò±The largest Bitcoin whales in history are dumping their holdings quietly this week‚Äîright as the U.S. government moves to enforce audit requirements on stablecoins like Tether.

It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/J5cDS2gveW ‚Äî Jacob King (@JacobKinge) July 18, 2025 As regulatory scrutiny tightens around the GENIUS Act‚Äôs audit mandates for US stablecoins, risk management becomes paramount. Against this backdrop, it‚Äôs time to rethink allocations and pinpoint the best crypto to buy now, blending opportunity with discipline. ""Take Profits"": Crypto Expert's Warning as Whale Wallet Moves $9.6B in BTC A $9.6 billion Bitcoin transfer by an early whale and new stablecoin rules in the GENIUS Act have some market experts warning of a potential price correction. This whale activity, along with the passage of three major U.S. crypto regulation bills in the Senate, has analysts on edge. Financial expert Jacob King (CEO of WhaleWire) suggests the seller might fear the GENIUS Act's stablecoin audit requirements, calling it a potential catalyst. His take? ""That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in the financial history of Bitcoin. It‚Äôs entirely propped up by fake money printed out of thin air,"" he posted Friday. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Innerdevcrypto remains long-term bullish, predicting Bitcoin could soar 10x in 5 to 10 years, potentially rivaling gold's market cap. But here‚Äôs the catch: he strongly warns against endlessly holding without taking profits. The bullshit begins again:¬®nobody was bullish enough¬®¬®the only thing that matters now is alts¬®¬®crime-season¬®¬®if you hold bitcoin now you are an idiot¬®Ignore it allThe louder the insanity becomes on this app, the more you should do your daily inner work session, keep your‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Innerdevcrypto (@Innerdevcrypto) July 18, 2025 ""Take some profits on the way up,"" he urged, advising investors to enjoy gains responsibly. Bull markets, he notes, still experience brutal swings, with Bitcoin capable of plunging 30% and altcoins 50% during normal volatility. In short, don‚Äôt just believe blindly; have an exit strategy. Use crypto wins for real-life priorities like health, family, or experiences, and avoid becoming ""bitter maxis"" who never spend. Remember, even hot assets like Solana, Sui, and NFTs (Pudgy Penguins included) remain a wild ride. On the flip side, technical signals look promising. Analyst Crypto Batman spotted the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio breaking a major pattern and now retesting resistance as support, which is a classic setup hinting at much higher prices. Researcher Alex Wacy adds that Bitcoin‚Äôs chart mirrors gold‚Äôs explosive 1979 breakout ""uncannily,"" suggesting history might repeat with a parabolic surge. Best Crypto To Buy Now With whales moving mountains of Bitcoin and regulators tightening the screws on stablecoins, investors face a crossroads between conviction and caution. These developments highlight the growing demand for strategic plays that balance momentum with risk, making this a moment to watch for the best crypto to buy now. Token 6900 Amid a $9.6 billion whale sell-off, Token6900‚Äôs $5 million capped presale offers a high-risk, high-reward option. It has a supply of 930 million, with dev tokens locked for five years. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) has surged past $630,000 in funding, just two weeks after launching on June 30. This milestone has caught traders‚Äô attention, marking a bold step for a meme coin with no tech, no roadmap, and no apologies. It's a full-throttle internet joke turned token. Like its predecessor SPX6900, which exploded by 69 million percent over two years, TOKEN6900 thrives on raw meme culture and pure market chaos. The project openly calls itself ‚Äúcollective meme-fueled delusion,‚Äù embracing its role as a parody of utility-driven crypto launches. No whitepaper, no team hype, just vibes. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, TOKEN6900 mirrors the same setup that made SPX6900 a cult favorite. It‚Äôs unapologetically designed for meme believers only. A full 80% of its supply is going to the public, with zero private deals or VC allocations. It‚Äôs a free-for-all, first come, first served. Each presale tier lasts only a few days, with prices rising between stages. Early buyers lock in the lowest entry points, creating a FOMO-fueled climb. One standout feature: staking rewards are already live. Early buyers can earn up to 107% annually through the token‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrain Rot Vault.‚Äù Crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins says Token 6900 could bring in some serious gains. With meme coins rallying and Bitcoin hitting record highs, T6900‚Äôs presale is pulling in heavy attention from risk-hungry crypto traders. Bitcoin Hyper In a market shaken by a $9.6 billion whale sell-off and stricter stablecoin audits, Bitcoin Hyper‚Äôs presale introduces the first fast Bitcoin Layer 2, powered by Solana VM rollups, ZK proofs, and on-chain DeFi staking. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has raised over $3.2 million in its ongoing presale, gaining strong momentum just one month after launch. The project is drawing early investor attention fast. $HYPER is priced at $0.012325 during the current presale phase, offering an entry point ahead of the next price hike scheduled within the next 24 hours. Backers are staking in big numbers. Over 192 million $HYPER tokens are already locked, with current rewards offering an estimated APY of 273%. What sets Bitcoin Hyper apart is its mission: bringing Solana-level performance to the Bitcoin network with the first SVM-powered Layer 2 chain. This leap in speed, scalability, and smart contract support positions Bitcoin Hyper as a serious infrastructure upgrade to the world‚Äôs most trusted crypto network. The fixed entry price and staking rewards are attracting investors looking for both growth and yield before the token goes live on public exchanges. As more presale phases pass and the price climbs, early adopters are hoping to ride the upside while the project builds traction in the Layer 2 space. With real utility and growing visibility, Bitcoin Hyper is being labeled by some as the next breakout coin to watch this year. Snorter As major wallets shift positions, Snorter gives traders an edge with fast layer-2 swaps, helping them move quickly and profit from short-term volatility. Snorter is rolling out a Telegram-integrated trading bot that lets users buy and sell crypto quickly, aiming to simplify the process for active Solana traders. Its key draw is cost. Standard fees sit at 1.5%, but holders of SNORT tokens pay just 0.85%, undercutting rivals like Bonk Bot and Banana Gun. The bot is built for speed and precision. Users can preload token addresses or Raydium pool IDs, and the bot auto-executes trades once liquidity appears. Snorter also handles token tax settings on the fly, removing the need for users to manually adjust for slippage or surprise transaction fees. Security features are integrated from the start. A rules engine scans for blacklist, freeze, and mint functions before each trade, flagging risky contracts with 85% accuracy in beta. The team plans to introduce a DAO, giving SNORT holders a voice in future development and upgrades. Governance voting will be tied directly to token ownership. Snorter blends real functionality with meme coin energy, offering a unique take in a sector still dominated by hype over utility. As Solana meme coins continue trending, Snorter‚Äôs mix of low fees, smart tools, and strong community appeal is pushing it into the spotlight. Conclusion The recent $9.6 billion whale transfer and looming GENIUS Act audits show that crypto markets can shift direction as quickly as an on-chain transaction. These major moves, paired with tighter regulation, reflect a maturing space where profit strategies matter as much as strong conviction. By combining assets like Token 6900‚Äôs high-risk presale, Snorter‚Äôs fast execution tools, and Bitcoin Hyper‚Äôs yield features, investors can manage volatility with both confidence and control. In this environment, knowing where to look matters, and one of the options mentioned in this article could be the best crypto to buy now.

2025-07-20T09:35:11,"Bitcoin Forms Golden Cross Again ‚Äî How High Can BTC Climb?","Following an impressive rally to new all-time highs (ATHs), bitcoin has been consolidating below the $120,000 range. However, market analysts have identified a signal that suggests the asset could see more explosive gains in the coming months. This signal is the BTC golden cross. It always forms when its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses the 200-day equivalent. Golden crosses often precede massive price gains, although this does not happen all the time. Golden Cross Appears Again According to the crypto trader Merlijn, the bitcoin golden cross just appeared , increasing the chances of BTC going parabolic in the coming months. The trader mentioned that BTC ballooned 139% when the cross appeared in 2016 and 2,200% when it showed up in 2017. Bitcoin also surged another 1,190% after the golden cross was spotted in 2020. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs flashing again in 2025. Same setup. Same signal. Miss this and you‚Äôll remember it forever. Bitcoin is about to leave orbit,‚Äù Merlijn stated. Notably, not all golden crosses come with massive rallies. In September 2021, the signal flashed again, but BTC climbed only 50%. Another SMA crossover in October 2023 triggered a 45% rise in bitcoin‚Äôs price. These brief surges are often associated with the 50-day SMA failing to remain above its 200-day equivalent for an extended period. Short-lived crosses lead to minimal price spikes, while the long ones can trigger parabolic movements for bitcoin‚Äôs value. Bitcoin Fundamentals Stay Positive It is also worth noting that golden crosses do not always precede BTC price spikes. There have been cases where price crashes have followed the cross, primarily due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. One incident occurred in February 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak, which affected the global financial market, led to a 62% decline in bitcoin‚Äôs price after the golden cross appeared. Such experiences highlight the need to factor in broader technical and macro factors when analyzing the golden cross. Currently, analysts believe bitcoin fundamentals will support a sustainable bullish trend. With diminishing supply and rising demand, the chances of the bears taking control over the next few weeks are low. However, market analyst Rekt Capital says BTC needs a daily close above $120,000 and a post-breakout retest to reach new highs. Currently, the asset is consolidating and facilitating money inflow into altcoins.

The Home Office has announced a tender for the storage and sale of confiscated cryptocurrencies; the contract is valued at $53.7 million. The proceeds from the sale are expected to be transferred to the Treasury. UK authorities plan to sell at least 61,000 BTC (about $7 billion at the time of the announcement). The assets were confiscated after the uncovering of a financial pyramid scheme linked to a Chinese citizen, according to The Telegraph . In early 2024, British police confiscated 61,000 BTC connected to a large-scale investment fraud in China. At the same time, the trial of 42-year-old Jian Wen began; he is accused of involvement in laundering funds worth ¬£5 billion. The proceeds from the sale of the bitcoins are expected to go to the Ministry of Finance, which is facing a budget deficit. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, is closely involved in overseeing the process. Simultaneously, the government announced a tender for the storage and sale of confiscated crypto-assets. The contract is valued at ¬£40 million (about $54 million). However, as The Telegraph notes, no suitable bids have been submitted. Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage called for the UK to create a national bitcoin reserve, but Labour rejected the idea.

In a post on the social media platform X, Scott Bessent says that the greenback will embrace the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies following President Donald Trump‚Äôs signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The law sets strict regulatory standards for banks and qualified stablecoin issuers to ensure the secure and transparent issuance of payment stablecoins. ‚ÄúBlockchain technologies will power the next generation of payments, and the US dollar is coming on-chain. Thanks to President Trump‚Äôs visionary leadership, and Senator Hagerty‚Äôs important work in Congress, the GENIUS Act will help cement the US dollar as the global reserve currency for generations to come.‚Äù Bloomberg reports that during a White House ceremony on Friday, Trump said the bill‚Äôs passage marks a major leap forward for US financial technology. ‚ÄúThe Genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins.
