2025-07-19T21:26:07,"JUST IN: UK Allegedly Plans to Sell $5 Billion Worth of Bitcoin – Is This the Reason for the Decline?","According to the Telegraph, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves plans to sell £5 billion worth of seized Bitcoin assets to close a massive gap in public finances. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, together with the police forces, has begun work to establish an official system to sell this large cryptocurrency stock. The total value of the cryptocurrencies seized by police is unknown, but in 2018 alone, 61,000 Bitcoins belonging to a China-based pyramid scheme were seized. At the time, the assets were worth around £270 million, but with Bitcoin reaching $123,000 (about £92,000) last week, they are now worth more than £5.4 billion. The government plans to develop a “crypto custody and sales framework” to securely store and sell these digital assets. It's not yet clear how much of the proceeds from sales will be transferred to the treasury, but proceeds from crime are typically shared between the central government and law enforcement. When victims remain unidentified, the treasury is known to receive a larger share.

High inflation and interest rates are driving up borrowing costs, while weak economic growth is weighing on revenue. The Treasury is reportedly considering alternative revenue streams, including tax increases. In particular, the positive steps taken by the Donald Trump administration toward cryptocurrencies in the US and the passage of the first national cryptocurrency law, the “Genius Act,” have led to a significant increase in Bitcoin prices. These developments are expected to inspire similar strategies in the UK. In the US, the Trump administration aims to create a national reserve using the $3.4 billion in confiscated Bitcoin. In the UK, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage advocates for the UK to create a national Bitcoin reserve, but the Labour Party has rejected the proposal due to the cryptocurrency's high volatility. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-19T21:15:00,"Bitcoin Next Stop: Can BTC Hit $150K as MAGACOIN FINANCE Poised to Outperform ARB, INJ, and PEPE in the Coming Bull Cycle?","Meanwhile, altcoins like ARB, INJ, and PEPE post modest projections—but MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads as a breakout contender in this bull cycle. If you’re scanning for the best crypto to buy now, this meme-powered, politically-charged altcoin is showing all the signs of something much bigger. Bitcoin ETF Flows Spark Bullish Cycle Predictions With $5.2B in ETF flows this past month alone and increasing institutional adoption, Bitcoin is regaining momentum. Panelists in Finder’s latest survey project BTC could reach $145,000–$150,000 on average, with some targeting $250,000 in a parabolic scenario. This sets the stage for renewed altcoin rotation—pushing traders to hunt for the next crypto to explode in 2025. One name comes up again and again: MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin 24H price chart from CoinGecko ARB, INJ, PEPE: Legacy Momentum or Limited Moves? Here’s where the rest of the field stands: ARB (Arbitrum): Most forecasts hover around $1.13–$1.96, with minimal catalysts INJ (Injective): Predictions range from $14 to $56, heavily reliant on DeFi market activity PEPE: Projections are capped between $0.000014 and $0.000024, with volatility driven by community sentiment These coins may remain relevant, but they’re unlikely to deliver the returns serious investors want in the next phase. For those evaluating the top cryptocurrencies to invest in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly moving up the shortlist. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Tops New Crypto Watchlists MAGACOIN FINANCE has evolved from a meme-style project into what many are calling one of the best crypto presales of the cycle. Its positioning ahead of major exchange listings, combined with political timing around the U.S. election narrative, gives it momentum few others can match. Here’s what makes it different: Eight funding rounds complete Hard-capped 170B token supply — no stealth inflation No VC control, 100% community-first allocation DAO and revenue share model launching in September CEX listing announcements confirmed for Q3–Q4 Each major listing typically triggers a 35%+ price jump within 48 hours, based on similar past presales. That makes MAGACOIN one of the best altcoins to buy now for risk-adjusted upside. Looking for the best meme coins to buy now? MAGACOIN offers a much deeper narrative hook—and a forward-facing roadmap that traditional meme tokens lack. The Best Crypto to Buy in 2025? MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just trending—it’s climbing every major list of new cryptocurrencies to watch. Analysts highlight its investor momentum, fast-growing community, and strategic presale structure as signals that early buyers may be witnessing the next big thing. With listings ahead, political tailwinds in motion, and a fixed supply model, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the best crypto to buy in 2025 if you’re targeting high-multiple returns in the next cycle. This is also why it now ranks among the top altcoins to buy now and continues appearing in analyst rundowns of low market cap crypto gems. Final Word: A Strategic Entry Before Listings Hit MAGACOIN FINANCE combines grassroots energy, real token utility, and a bullish macro backdrop. The presale is surging, listings are near, and analyst coverage is building fast. In a cycle that’s likely to be defined by ETF momentum and identity-based narratives, MAGACOIN FINANCE is already standing out. If you’re narrowing down to one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in 2025, this is your signal. The entry window remains open—but not for long.

2025-07-19T21:11:12,"Cryptocurrency markets cash in as Astronomer CEO resigns","Andy Byron has resigned as CEO of Astronomer following a wave of speculation fueled by a viral video from a Coldplay concert, with the move triggering a wave of profits for cryptocurrency traders. The clip, which showed Byron in a compromising moment with Chief People Officer Kristin Cabot on the event’s “kiss cam,” quickly sparked backlash online. Byron, who became CEO of the New York-based company in July 2023, officially stepped down on Saturday, July 18. Notably, Astronomer confirmed his resignation via a post on X, naming cofounder Pete DeJoy as interim CEO. “Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO,” the company said. It is worth noting that the firm had placed him on leave a day earlier and launched a formal investigation. Crypto markets cash in Speculation around Byron’s exit had already been priced into prediction markets. On Polymarket, a blockchain-based betting platform, activity spiked sharply in the hours leading up to the announcement.

2025-07-19T21:00:00,"Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?","Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction below $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.44 Price Change 24h -2% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.44 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis PI price is trading $0.4412, showing market indecision as sellers dominate short-term momentum. Support is at $0.4412, acting as an important zone after repeated rejections of lower lows this week. Resistance stands near $0.4700, capping upward movement amid weakening bullish sentiment and declining trading volume. As of July 19th 2025 PIUSDT price fell by around 2% to $0.4412. This drop marks a loss from the previous close and signals short-term bearish sentiment in the Pi Network market, where sellers currently outweigh buyers. Despite growing interest in decentralized finance and real world utility through the Pi browser, the token remains under pressure. Pi 1-day price chart faces bearish pressure as key support nears breakdown On the 24-hour chart, the Pi Network price is trading at $0.4408, reflecting a day drop, highlighting weak short-term sentiment. The MACD shows bearish momentum, with the MACD line trending below the signal line and red histogram bars widening. The RSI remains neutral near the mid-50s at 36.17, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions, though downside risk remains if momentum persists. The price of Pi faces strong resistance near $0.47, while immediate support is forming around $0.42, based on historical candle structure. A daily close below current support may increase selling pressure, while a bounce could trigger renewed interest from traders watching the crypto market closely. PIUSDT Price Chart: TradingView Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network is currently trading at $0.4417, just below a key support zone as selling pressure builds. The MACD line 0.0024 remains below the signal line 0.0028, indicating continued bearish momentum on the 4-hour timeframe. The RSI stands at 42.82, showing weakening buying strength. If Pi coin price fails to hold the current support, the next dip could trigger stronger selling pressure in the Pi Network market. However, a push above $0.45 may revive short-term bullish sentiment in the crypto market, particularly if paired with rising trading volume. PIUSDT Price Chart: TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is down today due to rising selling pressure from ongoing token unlocks and a lack of major exchange listings. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to reach $10 by 2033. Recent Pi News/Opinions PiScan data shows that 19.2 million PI tokens are set to be unlocked on July 4, marking the largest unlock of the month. Typically, token unlocks boost the available supply in the market, increasing the risk of a potential sell-off in the days after the event. Pi Network has announced two major features during the Pi2Day 2025 celebration: AI-powered Pi App Studio and a new Ecosystem Directory Staking system. The App Studio allows users to build Pi apps using natural language without coding, while the staking feature helps boost app visibility on the main net, marking a big step in expanding Pi’s real-world utility. Creating apps through Pi App Studio means anyone, regardless of technical knowledge, is able to own and run an online product and business built around their expertise and ideas. https://t.co/Vv88Jsqv8v This is made possible through the use of AI and supported by the blockchain… — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) July 3, 2025 PI has recently announced that over 2.6 million users joined Pi Network’s Pi2Day 2025 Ecosystem Challenge, with more than 761,000 completing all steps to unlock exclusive rewards and test new tools.

Investors are keenly watching the Pi Network market to discern potential movements in its future price trends and analyse shifts in Pi Network’s price. In 2025, Pi Network (PI) is anticipated to change hands in a trading channel between $0.44 and $1.42, leading to an average annualised price of $1.30. Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds. As start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faces high volatility as massive token unlocks trigger strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.48–$0.52, range.
