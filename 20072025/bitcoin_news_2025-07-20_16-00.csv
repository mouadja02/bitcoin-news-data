2025-07-20T13:56:43,"XRP price prediction after monster $40 billion inflow in a week","XRP is experiencing unprecedented buying pressure, with the token now targeting a new all-time high of $4 amid a resurgent cryptocurrency bull market. In the past week, XRP‚Äôs market capitalization has surged by $40.54 billion, rising from $165.82 billion to $206.36 billion. This massive inflow drove the token‚Äôs price to $3.49, representing a 24.65% increase on the weekly timeframe. XRP one-week market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP price prediction With XRP seemingly gearing up for a breakout, Finbold consulted OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT for insight into where the asset could be headed by year-end. According to the model, if current buying momentum holds, XRP could trade between $5 and $7 by December. ChatGPT noted that the surge will likely be fueled by sustained investor demand, which is reinforcing market momentum. At the same time, the anticipated decline in Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance is likely to redirect capital into altcoins, signaling the start of an altseason, during which XRP, as a top-tier token, is poised to gain significantly. Adding to market optimism is growing regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S. After years of legal uncertainty, more explicit rules are helping to reduce risk for both institutional and retail investors. Notably, this comes as the U.S enacted the Genesis Act, which provides a legal framework for stablecoin, amid the final push towards ending the legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Why XRP is breaking out It‚Äôs worth noting that, beyond tracking the broader crypto market , XRP‚Äôs rally is being driven by several key developments. Notably, momentum picked up following the approval of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 19, sparking renewed interest from institutions. The move mirrors Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF-fueled surge earlier this year. Meanwhile, 11 spot XRP ETF applications are awaiting review, with traders estimating an 88% chance of approval by year-end. Finally, on-chain activity also spiked, with 1.7 billion XRP moved on July 18, marking the highest daily volume in a year and indicating potential whale accumulation, a traditionally bullish signal.

2025-07-20T13:54:10,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Price Action Muted As BTC Consolidates Above $118,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has had a quiet weekend, with the price tethered around $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp drop on Friday, falling to $117,877, and registered another marginal decline on Saturday. The price has stayed above $118,000, indicating strong support at this level. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $118,035. Macro Drivers Could Dampen Bitcoin Halving Cycle Tim Draper, investor and founding partner of Draper Associates, believes macroeconomic drivers such as the decline of the US Dollar could dampen the impact of Bitcoin halving cycles. Halving cycles have been a major source of the flagship cryptocurrency‚Äôs volatility and bull cycles. Draper stated, ‚ÄúBetween 10-20 years from now, the dollar will be extinct. The world is changing, and we are watching it happen. We are right in the center of an anthropological leap forward.‚Äù Draper believes investors are increasingly treating Bitcoin as an escape valve against fiat currency inflation, geopolitical tensions, poor governance, and a lack of trust in banking institutions. According to Draper, these factors are driving the global adoption of the asset. ‚ÄúThe halvings may have less of an effect if Bitcoin runs against the dollar the way it has, because it will probably go for a prolonged period. It will still be affected in some way by that four-year cycle, but I think the effect will dampen. I think there will be a macro driver that pushes Bitcoin along, and I think the macro driver will be a bigger deal than the halvings.‚Äù Robert Kiyosaki Discusses Next Bitcoin Purchase Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has revealed the price point at which he plans to purchase more Bitcoin and the level at which he plans to stop. Kiyosaki‚Äôs ‚ÄúRich Dad Poor Dad‚Äù has become a top financial guide, having been translated into dozens of languages and helping millions. Kiyosaki stated, ‚ÄúBitcoin is over $117K a coin. Going to buy one more bitcoin asap. It‚Äôs never been easier to become rich‚Ä¶ even a millionaire. Please study, learn, and find out if Bitcoin is your path to becoming a millionaire.‚Äù BTC surged past $120,000 at the beginning of the week, on its way to a new all-time high of $123,091. However, Kiyosaki stated that he would pause further purchases. He explained the decision behind it, stating, ‚ÄúBitcoin over $120K ‚Ä¶ I am buying one more coin‚Ä¶ I will not buy any more‚Ä¶ until I know where the economy is going. As tempting as bitcoin going to $200K to $1 million is‚Ä¶ I do not want to be a hog and get slaughtered.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a consolidation phase after surging to a new all-time high on Monday. The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $120,000 on Monday, reaching $123,091 before declining. Despite the pause in upward momentum, analysts point out that bulls remain in control, with several positive factors acting as bullish catalysts.

Bitcoin‚Äôs growth rate indicator, measured by comparing its Market Cap to its Realized Cap, continues to indicate a bullish setup.

2025-07-20T13:00:43,"Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Falls Victim To $44 Million Hack ‚Äì Details","Indian exchange CoinDCX has suffered a cybersecurity attack, resulting in the loss of $44 million. This incident comes exactly one year after Indian exchange WazirX suffered a $235 million hack. CoinDCX Server Breach: User Funds Secure In an X post on July 19, CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta said that the crypto exchange suffered a server breach to one of its internal operational accounts. Gupta said that the affected wallet address is only used for liquidity supply on a partner exchange. Therefore, all assets in user wallets are safe and accounted for, with INR withdrawals fully functional. Furthermore, the CoinDEX CEO states the hack has been contained by isolating the affected operational account. Meanwhile, the value of the total lost assets would be offset by the exchange‚Äôs reserve as they commence efforts to track down the parties behind this hack. Gupta explains that these efforts involve various legs, ranging from an ongoing internal security review to the planned launch of a bug bounty program. The CoinDCX CEO said: Our internal security and operations teams have been working through the day along with leading cybersecurity partners to investigate the matter, patch any vulnerabilities and trace the movement of funds. We are collaborating with the exchange partner to block and recover assets, including coming out with a bug bounty program soon. Meanwhile, on-chain investigator ZachXBT has criticized CoinDCX for revealing the hack incident 17 hours after its occurrence, despite claiming to operate in transparency. Meanwhile, the renowned investigator also shared some updates on the hackers‚Äô action in a telegram message: The attacker address was funded with 1 ETH from Tornado Cash and later bridged a portion of the stolen funds from Solana to Ethereum. Sumit Gupta has described the security breach as a learning moment, as the crypto industry continues to take major steps in battling cybersecurity threats. Crypto Service Losses Reach $2.17 Billion Notably, the attack on CoinDCX marks the latest major hack in the crypto industry, underscoring the ongoing need for robust and evolving security measures. Meanwhile, data by Chainanalysis shows bad actors made away with a total stolen funds of $2.17 billion from crypto services in 2025 H1 alone. This revelation is highly discouraging as the reported loot is already greater than the total value lost in 2024, which was nearly $2 billion. Chainanalysis warns that if the current rate of successful malicious events continues to occur, the cryptocurrency business may end up losing a projected $4.3 billion to hacks.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-coindcx-falls-to-44-million-hack/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","Crypto News|CoinDCX|Ethereum|Sumit Gupta|Tornado Cash|Wazir|ZachXBT",cryptocompare
2025-07-20T13:00:08,"Bitcoin Re-Enters Profit Zone As Greed Rises, But Rally To $200,000 Still Possible","Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $122,838 on July 14, but has since slipped into a phase of consolidation around the $118,000 level. The recent pause in upward momentum hasn‚Äôt dampened market sentiment, which remains firmly bullish. According to Coinmarketcap‚Äôs Fear & Greed Index, Bitcoin is still currently sitting at a greed level of 68. This sentiment, combined with technical analysis of the Logarithmic Growth Curve (LGC), shows that Bitcoin is still on track for powerful upward moves. Related Reading: $57 Billion Mistake? Ex‚ÄëRipple Engineer Reveals XRP Investment Blunder Greed Returns To The Market, But Not Yet Overheated Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has spent the majority of the past 48 hours holding above $118,000 after a wave of profit-taking took place just after it peaked at $122,838. However, on-chain data shows an interesting overview of Bitcoin investors. Particularly, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. shared data from CryptoQuant showing that the 30-day moving average of the Fear and Greed Index has climbed back into the optimism zone, now sitting at 66.2%. Although sentiment surrounding the leading cryptocurrency is currently in greedy territory, this level is well below the 75% to 80% range, which coincided with new price highs in March 2024 and December 2025 The current 66% reading, while in the green level, suggests there‚Äôs still room for bullish sentiment to grow before the market enters a euphoric blow-off phase. In essence, this metric shows that if Bitcoin continues to consolidate and push higher without the sentiment entering into extreme greed levels between 75% and 80%, it will continue on a sustainable push to new heights. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Bitcoin Re-Enters Resistance Zone On Growth Curve As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin‚Äôs break above the $120,000 price level and its subsequent peak were followed by a wave of profit-taking. The trend saw Bitcoin‚Äôs price correct to $116,000 very briefly before stabilizing around $118,000. Interestingly, technical analysis of the weekly candlestick timeframe shows that Bitcoin re-entered the first band of the Logarithmic Growth Curve (LGC) resistance zone as it reached this price peak. This band, which is identified as the light pink region in the chart below, has always served as the profit-taking area in each of Bitcoin‚Äôs past bull markets. Interestingly, Bitcoin briefly tapped this area in December 2024 and January 2025 before being rejected, in a pattern similar to that of January 2021‚Äôs first top in the previous bull cycle. Image From TradingView: TradingShot Basically, this indicator implies that Bitcoin is now at the start of a final build-up phase. According to crypto analyst TradingShot, who posted the analysis on the TradingView platform, the ultimate top for this cycle is going to be between October and November 2025. Depending on the timing and strength of factors like anticipated US rate cuts in September, Bitcoin‚Äôs peak could land anywhere between $140,000 and $200,000. Related Reading: Whales?
