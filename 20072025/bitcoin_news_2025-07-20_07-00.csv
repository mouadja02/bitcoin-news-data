2025-07-20T04:00:22,"Pump.fun Ex‚ÄëDeveloper Behind $2M Crypto Theft Jailed For Bail Breach","Pump.fun former employee Jarett Dunn has been remanded to a London prison after breaching the terms of a bail agreement. The Canadian and popular crypto figure is currently undergoing trial after stealing $2 million from the Solana meme coin factory. Dunn Settles For Prison, Hints At Accepting Guilty Plea In May 2024, Jarett Dunn, a developer at Pump.fun, drained the platform of almost $2 million in SOL, which was diverted to multiple addresses. Thereafter, Dunn started distributing this stolen wealth to several wallets holding Solana memecoins or NFTs, allowing the Canadian to gain some following in the crypto community. Notably, Jarett Dunn took responsibility for the exploits within minutes of the operation, citing reasons such as a hostile work environment and inappropriate mentality towards user funds. Dunn accused Pump.fun of several crimes, including operating as an unregistered securities exchange and casino, alongside suggestions of child abuse intentions. The former Pump.fun employee was immediately arrested but soon released on bail. In October 2024, Jarett Dunn pleaded guilty to the crypto theft but soon requested to withdraw this plea while awaiting sentencing. This action resulted in Dunn losing his legal team while under a strict bail condition that involved movement restriction. However, in June 2025, Jarett Dunn breached this bail agreement in a sudden, unauthorized move from London to Liverpool while also tampering with his ankle monitor. The ex-Pump.fun developer was soon apprehended and now sits in a London prison awaiting a hearing. According to recent posts on Dunn‚Äôs X account under the alias @STACCoverflow, the Canadian appears to have made peace with staying in prison, hinting at accepting the guilty plea again and terminating his withdrawal request. @STACCoverflow is reportedly managed by Dunn‚Äôs friend Mark Kelly, who has reportedly been communicating with the developer since his recent incarceration. Dunn Stares At 10-Year Sentence While Pump.fun Celebrates ICO In the UK, fraud by abuse of position where the value exceeds ¬£500,000 ($640,000) can result in a maximum sentence of 10 years. While a bail breach attracts remand in prison until hearing or an additional 12 months‚Äô jail time if prosecuted as a separate offence. However, such factors as an early guilty plea and purported health issues may help mitigate sentences in the case of Jarett Dunn. Meanwhile, Pump.fun just recently concluded its initial coin offering (ICO) process, raising about $600 million in the process. The Solana memecoin factory is now valued at over $6 billion following resounding success, such as Moo Deng (MOODENG), Fart Coin (FARTCOIN), Peanut The Squirrel (PNUT), etc. Featured image from Pexels, chart from Tradingview",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/pump-fun-ex%e2%80%91developer-2m-theft-jailed-bail-breach/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","memecoins|Crypto theft|Jarett Dunn|Pump Fun|solana|Solana memecoins",cryptocompare

2025-07-20T03:15:00,"Bitcoin Climbs to $123K‚Äî3 Altcoins Hover Within 7% of ATH Plus a Penny Token That May 10x This Week","Bitcoin has surged beyond a key price threshold, hitting unprecedented levels. Meanwhile, three alternative cryptocurrencies are edging close to their record highs, within a small margin of their peak prices. Additionally, there‚Äôs excitement about a budget-friendly token that might see a tenfold increase in value this week. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse‚Äôs potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project‚Äôs estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 ‚Äì $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 ‚Äì $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings ‚Äì If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth ‚Äì Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions ‚Äì If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges TRON: Empowering Creators in a Decentralized Digital World TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform aiming to transform how digital content is shared and rewarded. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it started on Ethereum but moved to its own network in 2018. TRON gives content creators full ownership rights and more rewards for their work. By cutting out intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook, it lets consumers reward creators directly. This means artists get a fair share of the income from their content. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, with a public ledger where everyone can see what‚Äôs happening. In today‚Äôs market, TRX may appeal to those interested in platforms that empower creators. Compared to Ethereum, TRON offers developers a way to build dApps without worrying about high fees. As trends shift toward decentralization, TRON‚Äôs focus on fair rewards and easy content sharing makes it stand out in the crypto world. XRP: The Digital Currency Redefining Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. Designed as a fast, low-cost digital currency, it‚Äôs open, borderless, and resists censorship. Transactions are processed quickly without a central authority, making them irreversible and secure. You don‚Äôt need a bank account to use XRP. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it was launched with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple for development. Ripple, formerly OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to boost network liquidity. They placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply. The name XRP comes from ‚Äúripple credits,‚Äù reflecting its goal to make payments seamless across currencies. XRP‚Äôs technology could transform global payments. Its speed and low cost set it apart from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, whose transactions can be slow and expensive. XRP transactions settle in seconds, making it ideal for remittances and cross-border payments. In the current market, XRP looks promising. Its clear use case and strong backing give it an edge. With rising interest in digital currencies, XRP could become a key player. Though market trends are unpredictable, many are watching to see if XRP can overcome challenges and achieve wider adoption. Conclusion While TRX, XRP, and other altcoins near their highs, XYZVerse emerges as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans across various sports in a unique crypto ecosystem.
