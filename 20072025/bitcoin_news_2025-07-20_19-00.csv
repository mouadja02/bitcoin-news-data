2025-07-20T16:58:07,"Analysis Company Issues Current Warning for Altcoins, Caution Advised","Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal made remarkable assessments regarding the altcoin market in its latest report. The report stated that altcoins have performed better than Bitcoin in recent days, and investors have achieved higher returns by taking positions in altcoins instead of BTC, according to daily signals. However, one chart highlighted by Alphractal is a warning for the market: the Correlation Heatmap. This map shows that the average correlation between altcoins and Bitcoin is rapidly declining, even turning negative in some cases. This means that altcoins are no longer tracking Bitcoin's price movements. According to Alphactal analysis, this is a warning signal that has been frequently observed in the past: low correlation is often preceded by high volatility and mass liquidations (of long or short positions). Related News: Following the Big Update News from China, This Altcoin Experienced a Sudden Increase in Price Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson, in his assessment, highlighted Bitcoin's correlation with classic market indicators. According to Wedson, the correlation between Bitcoin and the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) could also be a key indicator. ‚ÄúBitcoin is currently showing a low, even negative, correlation with the VIX. This means that BTC has weakened its bond with the S&P 500 and is inclined to move more independently. Historically, this coincides with periods of increased volatility and often price rallies in the following year,‚Äù he said. Wedson also issued the following warning to investors: If the VIX is low, don't spend too much time on the correlation between BTC and the S&P 500. This could mean that Bitcoin is in for an explosive move. However, if the VIX is high, it makes more sense to watch stocks, as fear in the markets could also impact BTC. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-20T16:55:49,"Stablecoin Bill Passage Signals Start of New Financial Revolution in America, According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong","Coinbase chief executive Brian Armstrong believes that the signing of a stablecoin bill into law marks the beginning of a new financial era in the US. On July 18th, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law with the aim of strengthening the US dollar‚Äôs reserve currency status and making America the ‚Äúundisputed leader‚Äù in digital assets. The law establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar, requiring each token to be fully backed by liquid assets such as cash or short-term US Treasuries. In a new CNBC interview, Armstrong says the law has put the US in a position to move money efficiently across the globe. ‚ÄúThis stablecoin bill passing into law is really a financial revolution for America. It means crypto can finally start updating the financial system, especially for our payments, which are running on these creaky old systems that are decades old. Now, every payment in our economy can be fast, cheap and global ‚Äì under one second, one cent, anywhere in the world.‚Äù According to Armstrong, he now expects blue-chip companies to start using stablecoin payments to reduce transaction costs. ‚ÄúNow that we have clear legislation, we‚Äôre going to see the Fortune 500 really start to adopt stablecoins. We‚Äôve started to see this a little bit already even with the news that this was going to pass in the near future. Coinbase just launched an integration with Shopify, for instance, and we‚Äôve seen announcements from Walmart and Amazon. Almost every Fortune 500 company is now coming in and starting to look at stablecoin payments. This is a big opportunity for us. It‚Äôs a TAM (total addressable market) expansion for our business. And we think that we can provide these wallets and payment APIs for the whole financial system and every company, eventually.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-20T15:45:17,"Fed Governor Christopher Waller Says Central Bank Should Cut Rates by Next Meeting Amid Slowdown in GDP","A member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors says the central bank should slash interest rates by the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is scheduled for July 29th. In a recent speech given at New York University, Fed Governor Christopher Waller provided three main reasons that the Fed Funds Rate should be reduced by 25 basis points (bps) immediately, rather than remain paused at 4.25% to 4.50%. The economist addresses tariffs, labor markets and a ‚Äúhost of data‚Äù that suggests that GDP will continue to be low. On tariffs, Waller said they are not as inflationary as most believe, and will likely only lead to a ‚Äúone-off‚Äù surge in prices rather than a sustained climb in inflationary pressures. Waller says a rate cut now rather than months down the road, as most FOMC members are aiming for, would front-run an otherwise cooling economic climate in the US. ‚ÄúI also believe ‚Äì and I hope the case I have made is convincing ‚Äì that the risks to the economy are weighted toward cutting sooner rather than later. If the slowing of economic and employment growth were to accelerate and warrant moving toward a more neutral setting more quickly, then waiting until September or even later in the year would risk us falling behind the curve of appropriate policy. However, if we cut our target range in July and subsequent employment and inflation data point toward fewer cuts, we would have the option of holding policy steady for one or more meetings. For this reason, I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC‚Äôs policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now.‚Äù Waller also says he‚Äôs not expecting a rebound in GDP in the second half of 2025, and based on current forecasts, he‚Äôs more so looking for an annual GDP growth of around 1%, which would be down from 2024‚Äôs 2.4%. ‚ÄúGiven the ups and downs of monthly indicators of GDP this year, we can best get a view of the performance of the economy by combining the first and second-quarter numbers. With the data in hand, estimates suggest that real GDP increased at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 2.8 percent in the second half of 2024. That comparison is important not only for the extent of the slowdown, which is considerable, but also because it is well below most estimates of the potential growth rate of the economy. Based on forward-looking indicators, I don‚Äôt expect a rebound in the second half ‚Äì in fact, most forecasts suggest that real GDP growth will remain around 1 percent at an annual rate.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.
