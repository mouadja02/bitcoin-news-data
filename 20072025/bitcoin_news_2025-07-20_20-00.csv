This is a notable drop from previous estimates, which suggested that the country held nearly 200,000 BTC. Concerns Over Missing Government Reserves The declaration followed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted on March 24 by independent journalist L0la L33tz. A letter dated July 15 from the Office of General Counsel confirmed that the released records originated from the Asset Forfeiture Division. While most of the report was made public, some portions were redacted for legal and security reasons. These included information on specific storage procedures, wallet addresses, and security systems. The documents revealed that the U.S. Marshals Service currently holds 28,988 BTC, valued at approximately $3.45 billion based on current market rates. Further, individual wallet balances range from $4,464.48 to $100.95 million and $43.70 million. In criminal investigations involving digital assets, seized cryptocurrencies must undergo a formal court-ordered forfeiture process before they can become government property. The USMS is responsible for managing, safeguarding, and liquidating such assets¬†on behalf of federal agencies. The figure disclosed got attention because it accounts for only 15% of what many believed to be the total U.S. government Bitcoin reserves, previously estimated at nearly 200,000 BTC. This raised concerns that it may have quietly sold about 85% of its holdings. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has long advocated for the creation of a national strategic BTC reserve, partly using forfeited cryptocurrency, expressed similar concern on X: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves‚Äîleaving just ~29,000 coins.‚Äù Did The Government Sell Off Its BTC? L0la L33tz¬†later clarified the situation by explaining the difference between seized and forfeited assets. She noted that confiscated cryptocurrencies are not considered government property until a court officially transfers their ownership to the state. Only then can the U.S. Marshals Service legally manage or sell them. As such, the reported figure of 28,988 BTC refers only to surrendered assets. The remaining 170,000 BTC that many believed had been sold are still held as impounded property and have not yet been processed through the legal system. Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows that the U.S. government controls approximately 198,000 BTC, currently valued at more than $23 billion. L33tz pointed out that tracking platforms often overstate holdings by including seized assets that have not yet been legally transferred. She cited the 94,000 BTC linked to the Bitfinex hack as an example. Although these funds are under government control, they have not yet been legally processed and cannot yet be sold.

2025-07-20T17:30:27,"How Bitcoin Is Reacting To The Falling S&P 500 Volatility Index: Expert","It‚Äôs barely weeks into the second half of 2025, and it is fair to say that the Bitcoin and global financial markets have almost seen it all this year. From global trade wars to actual disputes between nations (involving serious military action), the markets have been subject to different forms of external pressure throughout the year. As a result, the world has seen a sheer amount of correlation and direct relationship between the traditional financial markets and the crypto market. While the US equities market and Bitcoin have not particularly moved in tandem in recent months, there is no denying the existence of a relationship between the asset classes. What Does The Falling Traditional Volatility Mean For BTC? In a new post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson delved into the relationship between Bitcoin and the US equities market (through the S&P 500 index). According to the crypto expert, the premier cryptocurrency is exhibiting low correlation with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which tracks the market‚Äôs expectations for the volatility of the S&P 500 Index. For context, volatility refers to how quickly prices change within a short period and is often seen as a way to gauge market sentiment. Wedson mentioned that the VIX Index, also known as the fear index, is widely used as a risk thermometer among participants in the traditional financial markets. According to Wedson, the price of Bitcoin historically tends to move more independently and significantly in the following year whenever it is negatively correlated with the S&P 500 Index, especially during periods of low VIX. This increased volatility has often translated into significant price rallies in the past, according to the analyst. Wedson said: In other words: don‚Äôt waste hours analyzing BTC vs. S&P 500 when BTC‚Äôs correlation with the VIX is low or negative ‚Äî that‚Äôs usually when BTC has a higher chance of entering an explosive phase. The on-chain analyst said that on the flip side, when the VIX is high, it is worth looking at the relationship between Bitcoin and US equities markets, as fear in the latter can influence the behavior of the former. However, Wedson noted that the VIX is currently declining, and as such, the S&P 500 Index might not offer much help in analyzing Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Wedson concluded that the more BTC dissociates from traditional volatility (VIX), the stronger it is as an independent asset. Ultimately, this could be a positive sign for the Bitcoin price and present fresh opportunities for investors looking to get into the market. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, BTC is valued at around $117,888, reflecting no significant price movement in the past 24 hours.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reacts-to-the-falling-500-volatility-index/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc price|BTCUSDT|S&P 500|VIX",cryptocompare
2025-07-20T17:30:17,"Bitcoin Won‚Äôt Save You‚ÄîPeter Schiff Says Gold Will Win As Trump Wrecks The Dollar","Gold proponent Peter Schiff hit out at US President Donald Trump‚Äôs support for cryptocurrency, calling Bitcoin a ‚Äúdecentralized Ponzi scheme‚Äù wrapped in the American flag. He warned that pushing digital assets at home could erode trust in the dollar. Schiff said that, while some may cheer weaker paper money, it will be gold that wins when Bitcoin finally stumbles. Related Reading: Whales? No, Newbies: Surge In New BTC Holders Fuels Market Rally‚ÄîStudy Dollar Confidence In Question According To Schiff, encouraging domestic investment in Bitcoin and crypto ‚Äúundermines the US economy and speeds up the dollar‚Äôs collapse.‚Äù He argued that millions of Americans buying digital tokens won‚Äôt prop up the world‚Äôs main reserve currency. Schiff believes real damage comes when retail investors swap dollars for speculative coins, tipping the scales against greenbacks in global markets. By promoting domestic investment in Bitcoin and crypto, Trump is helping undermine the U.S. economy and speed up the dollar‚Äôs collapse. Bitcoiners may cheer, as most bought Bitcoin to profit from a dollar crash. But ironically, gold will be the winner as Bitcoin will crash too. ‚Äî Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Ponzi Scheme Allegations Schiff described recent cryptocurrency bills as little more than a way to ‚Äúcloak Bitcoin‚Äînothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme‚Äîin the trappings of legitimacy.‚Äù He claimed insiders use new laws to drive prices up, then get out at higher levels. ‚ÄúThe industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It‚Äôs a legislative low point,‚Äù he wrote on X. Stablecoins Under Scrutiny Based on reports, Schiff sees stablecoin plans as a false promise for dollar dominance. He pointed out that a stablecoin backed by any fiat currency offers no real edge. That stability, he warned, will soon give way. He also pointed out tht dollar‚Äëbacked coins are only as stable as the underlying money. The main purpose of the ‚Äúlandmark‚Äù crypto bills is to cloak Bitcoin‚Äînothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme‚Äîin the trappings of legitimacy. The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It‚Äôs a legislative low point. ‚Äî Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Echoes Of Tulip Mania Invoking Charles Mackay‚Äôs 1630s tale, Schiff compared the digital token craze to the Dutch tulip bubble. He quoted Mackay: ‚ÄúThey go mad in herds, and only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.‚Äù In that era, bulb prices soared before crashing overnight. Schiff said swapping tulips for Bitcoin makes the same point. Related Reading: $57 Billion Mistake?

2025-07-20T16:59:03,"UK to Sell Billions of Seized Bitcoin to Tackle Budget Deficit","The UK government is preparing to sell a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC), valued at several billion pounds. These digital assets were taken over the years during police investigations into crimes. This decision comes as UK leaders are seeking new sources of funding amid rising national debt and economic uncertainty. Seized Bitcoin Could Provide Billions in Revenue Over the years, UK authorities have seized large amounts of digital assets linked to criminal activity . In many cases, these assets are stored securely until legal proceedings are complete. Once the courts approve, the government can sell the digital assets. While police agencies carry out the seizures and sales, the Treasury closely monitors the process. These funds would typically be shared between the government and law enforcement. However, any money owed to fraud victims would be paid out first. Analysts estimate that the Treasury could earn billions from these upcoming sales. One of the most significant Bitcoin seizures happened in 2018, tied to Chinese fraudster Jian Wen. That case is still under review, with the victims requesting restitution. If the government were to keep half of the remaining haul, it could be worth as much as ¬£2.6 billion. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont has publicly suggested that the money should be spent quickly. Others, however, warned against rushing, reminding people of the 1999 gold sale that cost the UK billions after prices later soared. Experts Say Seized Digital Assets Are a Hidden Resource A growing number of experts believe that seized digital assets, such as Bitcoin, could become a significant source of revenue for governments. This idea is gaining traction globally, as more governments explore ways to convert confiscated cryptocurrency into financial gains rather than letting it sit unused. To prepare for these large-scale crypto asset sales, the UK Home Office has initiated the necessary process. The agency has hired a private firm that will oversee the secure storage, handling, and liquidation of digital assets. The original request for bids offered up to ¬£40 million in commission to the chosen provider. However, the first round of bids failed to meet the government‚Äôs strict requirements. Despite this delay, the Home Office plans to relaunch the process in a revised form. Political Debate Over Bitcoin‚Äôs Role As the government prepares to sell the seized crypto, political voices have been divided. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has proposed that Britain establish a national Bitcoin reserve , a plan similar to one backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Labour Party has rejected this idea, citing Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility as a significant risk. Still, the financial appeal is clear. Cardiff University professor Michael Levi, a leading expert in asset seizures, warns that the process is not quick. Once digital assets are seized, authorities often need to hold them securely for extended periods until all legal challenges are resolved.
