Firms that specialize in merger arbitrage are looking at billions of dollars in windfall after a 20-month court arbitration finally concluded on Friday, Bloomberg reports . Merger arbitrage is a trading strategy that involves betting on the outcome of a merger or acquisition, typically by taking long and/or short positions in the stocks of the companies involved. According to a Morgan Stanley calculation, shares of Hess were the most widely held position for merger arbitrages in the US, collectively amounting to $10 billion worth of positions. Notably among those betting on the acquisition were Ken Griffin‚Äôs Citadel Advisors, Adage Capital and HBK Investments. Roy Behren, co-chief investment officer at Westchester Capital, says the firm held roughly $350 million in Hess shares in anticipation of the acquisition ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting forever for this to happen. It took a year and a half, but I think the right outcome was achieved‚Ä¶ The Hess stake was the largest position we have had in the past 15 years. The arbitration panel ruled the way our consultants and analysts expected.‚Äù Citadel and HBK each had the equivalent of $1 billion in shares, according to the firms‚Äô latest filings, says Bloomberg.

2025-07-20T18:24:20,"Cardano price prediction 2025-2031: Will ADA recover to $3 soon?","Key takeaways : Cardano‚Äôs price is expected to surpass $0.7827 in 2025. By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros‚Äîa unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano‚Äôs two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform‚Äôs future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you‚Äôre wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano‚Äôs ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let‚Äôs uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8519 Market Cap $30.19 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.22Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.8593 24-hour Low $0.8125 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 14.21% 50-day SMA $‚ÄØ0.64928 14-Day RSI 76.95 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 18/30 (60%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano‚Äôs daily chart shows a strong uptrend as price rides the upper Bollinger Band above the 20-day SMA, with RSI deep into overbought territory around 81 signaling stretched momentum. MACD remains bullish but shows signs of waning histogram strength. A sustained close above $0.88 would clear short-term resistance and likely accelerate gains toward $0.95. Conversely, profit-taking could trigger a pullback toward the middle band near $0.68, where daily SMA support resides. Watch for a contraction of Bollinger width and an RSI decline below 70 as early signs of consolidation before the next directional move. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView On the four-hour chart, ADA has climbed from roughly $0.60 last month into a congestion zone just below the upper Bollinger Band near $0.86. The 20-period simple moving average around $0.83 has provided dynamic support during this advance. MACD lines sit in positive territory but are converging, signaling that upward momentum may be pausing. Balance of Power remains slightly bullish, suggesting accumulative pressure ahead of a decisive move. A sustained break above $0.86 could open the path toward $0.90 or higher, while failure to clear this cap may trigger a retracement to the mid‚Äêband or the $0.80 level. ADA technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value ($) Action SMA 3 $‚ÄØ0.75832 BUY SMA 5 $‚ÄØ0.787944 BUY SMA 10 $‚ÄØ0.760094 BUY SMA 21 $‚ÄØ0.674412 BUY SMA 50 $‚ÄØ0.64928 BUY SMA 100 $‚ÄØ0.683858 BUY SMA 200 $‚ÄØ0.606092 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value ($) Action EMA 3 $‚ÄØ0.678852 BUY EMA 5 $‚ÄØ0.667534 BUY EMA 10 $‚ÄØ0.665538 BUY EMA 21 $‚ÄØ0.673027 BUY EMA 50 $‚ÄØ0.709261 BUY EMA 100 $‚ÄØ0.746017 BUY EMA 200 $‚ÄØ0.722176 BUY What to expect from the Cardano price analysis next Cardano‚Äôs daily chart shows a robust rally from $0.50 to $0.85, with price hugging the upper Bollinger Band and an RSI above 80, suggesting overbought conditions. The 20-day SMA near $0.68 has provided solid support throughout the rally. On the four-hour timeframe, momentum is slowing as MACD histograms shrink and price tests resistance at $0.88 while remaining above the 20-period EMA around $0.83. In the near term, expect a corrective pullback toward the Bollinger mid-band or $0.80 support before another leg up. A decisive break above $0.88 opens the path to $0.95, while failure risks a drop to $0.75. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano‚Äôs future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030? In 2030, ADA‚Äôs average forecast price could be $5.82. Its minimum and maximum trading price is expected to be $5.63 and $6.75, respectively. What is the Cardano forecast for 2040? Predicting Cardano‚Äôs (ADA) price in 2040 is highly speculative as it depends on multiple factors, including adoption, regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. However, if Cardano continues its development in smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and blockchain efficiency, it could see widespread adoption, driving its price higher. Some optimistic projections suggest that ADA could reach double-digit prices, possibly ranging from¬†$10 to $50¬†or more, if the cryptocurrency market continues to expand and Cardano establishes itself as a leader in blockchain technology. However, in a bearish scenario, where regulatory hurdles and competition slow its progress, ADA could struggle to maintain high valuations. What will be the future price of Cardano in 2050? Predicting Cardano‚Äôs (ADA) price in 2050 is highly speculative, but if blockchain adoption continues to grow and Cardano successfully scales its smart contract ecosystem, its price could see significant appreciation. In a bullish scenario, ADA could reach¬†$50 to $100¬†or even higher if it becomes a dominant blockchain platform with real-world utility in finance, governance, and enterprise solutions. However, in a bearish scenario where adoption stagnates or regulations hinder growth, ADA could remain below¬†$10. The price will depend on¬†mass adoption, technological advancements, global regulations, and overall cryptocurrency market trends¬†over the coming decades. Will Cardano recover? Cardano‚Äôs recovery potential depends on market sentiment and adoption. Despite past challenges, its projected price increase in 2025, potentially reaching $1, has significantly bolstered confidence in the coin‚Äôs future. Will Cardano reach $5? Based on our analysis, Cardano will reach $5 by 2030, with a forecasted range of around $5.97. This projection is driven by Cardano‚Äôs continued technological advancements, growing adoption, strategic partnerships, and increasing market confidence, indicating a positive long-term growth trajectory for the cryptocurrency market. Will Cardano reach $10? ADA is predicted to reach $7.33 by 2031. By this time, the coin is expected to attain a maximum price of $8.61. Will Cardano reach $50? Cardano is trading around $0.5823, with an all-time high of $2.80 in early 2021. While not impossible, reaching $50 in the next few years is highly uncertain. Does Cardano have a good long-term future? Cardano (ADA) has the potential for a positive long-term future, primarily driven by its technological advancements and growing ecosystem. Predictions indicate that by 2030, Cardano could see significant growth, with estimates suggesting a rise to around $6.75. The platform‚Äôs unique features, such as its focus on scalability and partnerships with various institutions, position it well for future adoption. However, its success will depend on overcoming regulatory scrutiny and developer engagement challenges.
