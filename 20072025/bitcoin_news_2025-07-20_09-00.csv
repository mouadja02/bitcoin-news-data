2025-07-20T06:28:30,"Litecoin Skyrockets by Double-Digits, Bitcoin Price Stalls at $118K: Weekend Watch","Bitcoin‚Äôs relatively dull price actions in the past few days continued during the weekend by standing at around $118,000. Several altcoins have performed significantly better since yesterday, with LTC jumping by 13% to over $115. BTC Calms at $118K The primary cryptocurrency started its impressive ascent in the previous business week when it finally broke above the $110,000 resistance and jumped to a new all-time high at the time of $112,000. The gains continued by the end of the week, and BTC neared $119,000 for another peak. The culmination, though, took place on Monday, July 14, when the bulls took the asset to its latest ATH of over $123,000. Thus, it had added more than $15,000 in the span of just five days. A correction seemed inevitable, and bitcoin slipped to under $116,000 in the next couple of days. Nevertheless, it defended that level and recovered some ground by the end of the week. It even challenged $120,000 and $121,000, but to no avail , and now sits around $118,000 after a calm Saturday. Its market capitalization has declined to $2.344 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has been further reduced to 59.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView LTC on the Rise Most altcoins have also calmed over the past day. Ethereum has jumped by nearly 2% and now trades above $3,600. BNB and ADA are up by around 1%, while TRX and XRP have declined by similar percentages. SUI and LINK have jumped the most from the biggest altcoins, by up to 3%. Litecoin is the top performer from the largest 50 alts. It has added more than 13% over the past 24 hours and now trades above $115. ENA and XDC have also added double digits, while BGB and SKY have slipped by around 3%. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has remained at essentially the same spot as yesterday, at just under $3.950 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

2025-07-20T05:40:56,"Thumzup Backs XRP as It Hits ATH in $250M Crypto Shift","TL;DR Thumzup shifts from Bitcoin-only to a $250M diversified crypto portfolio with altcoins and stablecoins. Trump Jr.‚Äôs $4M investment and new U.S. crypto laws add momentum to Thumzup‚Äôs expansion strategy. XRP hits $3.65 as Thumzup shares rise 267% since January, fueling investor interest in digital assets. Thumzup Expands Crypto Holdings Beyond Bitcoin Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed firm, has approved a $250 million investment plan to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. The board of the company approved the strategy, and it will incorporate the digital assets, including XRP, USDC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and LTC. The company previously held only Bitcoin, with 19 BTC valued at around $2.3 million. The new strategy will be based on creating a more diversified portfolio. Meanwhile, the strategy implies the transition of a single-asset exposure to a wider variety of tokens. The company will allocate depending on market conditions and internal risk rules. CEO Points to U.S. Policy Shifts and Market Access Chief Executive Robert Steele said the decision comes as the U.S. moves closer to regulatory clarity for digital assets. ‚ÄúAs the U.S. federal government moves toward more crypto-friendly policies and greater regulatory clarity, Thumzup is committed to remaining at the forefront of this transformative technology,‚Äù he said . Steele also commented on the company‚Äôs long-term outlook. ‚ÄúBy diversifying our portfolio of cryptocurrencies to gain wider exposure to the market as a whole, we believe Thumzup is optimally positioned to create value for TZUP shareholders,‚Äù he said. The timing follows the introduction of two recent crypto bills, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act. Trump Jr. Investment and Trading Activity Drive Momentum The move follows an earlier announcement that Donald Trump Jr. acquired 350,000 shares in Thumzup Media, valued at around $4 million. He and his brother Eric are listed as advisors to Dominari Securities, which recently arranged a $6 million private placement in the company. Thumzup shares are now trading at $12.59, based on Google Finance data. The stock has gained 84% over the past month and is up 267% since January. The $250 million crypto strategy has drawn attention from both investors and analysts. Source: Google Finance Thumzup runs a platform that allows users to earn money by sharing sponsored posts on social media. Activity is tracked through its in-house dashboard. Payouts have typically been made through PayPal, but the company plans to offer crypto-based options. XRP recently reached a new all-time high of $3.65. At press time, it was trading at $3.42, marking a 26% increase over the past 7 days, based on CoinMarketCap data.
