2025-07-20T14:40:11,"Ethereum enters final wave of multi-year bull run","Ether has broken above $3,800 for the first time since December 2024, according to data from CoinGecko. The surge puts Ethereum‚Äôs market cap over $450 billion, officially locking in its strongest price level in seven months. This surge comes as momentum builds across altcoins, with the Altcoin Season Index climbing to 47, up from 29 just last week. The combined altcoin market cap now stands at $1.55 trillion. Over the last seven days, Ethereum has climbed steadily, pushing up to $3,600 before finally pushing past the $3.8K line. That puts the month-on-month gain at 45.48%, a massive push for the second-largest crypto. Gert Van Lagen, a Dutch analyst who specializes in wave-based market structures, said Ethereum is closing in on the final stage of a long-term bull cycle. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre entering the fifth wave,‚Äù Gert posted on X on Sunday, ‚Äúand based on the structure, this wave can carry us to $10,000.‚Äù Source: Gert Van Lagen Ethereum enters final wave of multi-year bull run Gert‚Äôs breakdown leans on Elliott wave theory, which maps out five-wave price cycles shaped by crowd behavior. Based on his bi-weekly chart analysis, Ethereum began this current cycle in 2022 and is now moving through the last of the five waves. The early part of the cycle included a strong rally (wave one), a correction between 2022 and 2023 (wave two), followed by an extended rise (wave three), and then a slow flat stretch (wave four). Right now, Ethereum is inside wave five, which typically comes with one last aggressive price run before the entire cycle resets. According to Gert, Ethereum‚Äôs latest climb forms ‚Äúsubwave a‚Äù of wave five. He expects a minor dip next to retest the breakout level‚Äîthat would form ‚Äúsubwave b.‚Äù After that, the blow-off ‚Äúsubwave c‚Äù could push prices well beyond current levels. He sees $10,000 as a realistic endpoint for this entire wave sequence, stretching from 2019 through 2025. Ether is still the second-largest crypto on earth, sitting only behind Bitcoin, and it currently holds an 11.1% market share. Its market cap now stands at $441.14 billion, just slightly under the $450B peak but still well above its mid-June level.

On July 15, miners sent a hefty 16,000 Bitcoin to exchanges‚Äîthe most in a single day since April‚Äîraising questions about how long the rally can keep climbing. Related Reading: Whales?

Miner Sales Hit Yearly High Based on reports from CryptoQuant, the jump to 16K‚ÄØBTC occurred as miners sensed a chance to lock in profits after Bitcoin‚Äôs latest spike. Bitcoin miner sales surged. Outflows hit 16K BTC, the highest since April, and nearly all of it went to exchanges as BTC hit a new all-time high.

Now, with prices pressing past $120K, they‚Äôre back at it. Miners often sell when their hardware costs are covered and they stand to pocket hefty gains, but when they all sell at once, it can tip the market into choppy waters. Mid-Range Holders Offload 3K‚ÄØBTC Big miners aren‚Äôt the only ones stepping to the exits. Wallets holding between 100 and 1,000‚ÄØBTC cut their balances from 68K‚ÄØBTC to 65K‚ÄØBTC since mid‚ÄëJune‚Äîabout 3K‚ÄØBTC shed in just a few weeks. During the April rally, that same group sold close to 5K‚ÄØBTC before shifting back into buy mode when prices settled into a range.

In a new CNBC interview, the Indianapolis-based Sanctuary Wealth says conditions are conspiring to push risk assets such as the stock market to new record-high levels by the end of the year. Mary Ann Bartels, the firm‚Äôs chief investment strategist, says investors are not prepared for a huge upside burst for the S&P 500. ‚ÄúWe need growth and AI (artificial intelligence), and I think it‚Äôs coming. I think it‚Äôs going to significantly impact corporate earnings, productivity, and it‚Äôs going to show up in the equity markets. It‚Äôs not just a bull market here. It‚Äôs a bull market globally. You‚Äôre seeing European markets break out. I think you‚Äôre going to get the Japanese market to break out. It‚Äôs a global secular bull market driven by all this new innovation from AI, to blockchain, to crypto, to Web3. And I don‚Äôt think all of this is yet priced in to the market, and you can see, we‚Äôre already in a summer melt-up. The market is not positioned for this yet.‚Äù Bartels says she agrees with the sentiment that technological advancements in AI and Web3 will usher in a disinflationary trend, forcing the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy. ‚ÄúI do think rates are trending down, and can go much lower than people expect. Right now, we‚Äôre in heightened fear that tariffs are going to bring inflation, and I think over time, especially trending into next year, we can get rates down. And that‚Äôs going to be another stimulus for risk assets, for the equity market, for the crypto market.‚Äù As for her price targets for the S&P 500, Bartels says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm comfortable getting to year-end at 7,000, and I think in the first quarter of next year, we might even be at 7,200.‚Äù Sanctuary Wealth is an independent wealth management platform that works with 495 licensed professionals and 120 partner firms across 30 states.

Key Takeaways: California police are investigating the suspicious disappearance of 74-year-old Naiping Hou. The incident is possibly linked to his family‚Äôs crypto wealth. Authorities uncovered fraudulent activity in Hou‚Äôs bank accounts and believe someone impersonated him. Hou left his home without his phone on a Monday and never returned. Days later, his silver Toyota Yaris was discovered abandoned near a hiking trail in Rancho Cucamonga. On May 4, he was officially declared missing . Police Probe Fraud in Missing Crypto Investor Case By July 7, the San Bernardino County Sheriff‚Äôs Department confirmed its Specialized Investigations Division was treating the case as suspicious, citing evidence of ‚Äúextensive fraudulent activity‚Äù involving Hou‚Äôs bank accounts. Investigators revealed that an unknown individual used Hou‚Äôs phone and impersonated him to communicate with his family, raising concerns that Hou may have been kidnapped. No suspects have been named, but authorities have not ruled out foul play. Hou‚Äôs son, Wen Hou, has offered a $250,000 reward for information that could lead to his father‚Äôs safe return. Wen, who has worked as Chief Investment Officer of hedge fund Coincident Capital since 2019, built his fortune in crypto and believes the motive behind his father‚Äôs disappearance may be financial. ‚ÄúHe had no reason to disappear,‚Äù Wen said in an interview with KABC. ‚ÄúI miss him a lot. He‚Äôs sort of a guide to my life.‚Äù Experts suggest the case fits a growing trend of physical attacks targeting individuals linked to digital wealth. Local and federal agencies now use blockchain forensics to follow the money in these cases. Crypto-Linked Violence Hits Record Levels in 2025 Violent physical attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders, known as ‚Äúwrench attacks,‚Äù are sharply rising in 2025, with 35 cases already reported by July, according to Chainalysis. The Asia-Pacific region has seen some of the worst violence , with countries like Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines reporting a surge in kidnappings and extortion linked to crypto ownership. Driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs recent surge past $122,000, criminals are increasingly shifting from online hacks to real-world violence. Making my @CNN debut this morning: $5 wrench attacks, crypto user privacy, problems of KYC, Bitcoin users vs. bank secrecy laws, and the Trump Admin's policies on bitcoin and its crypto-offspring @btcpolicyorg @ConsumerChoiceC pic.twitter.com/Q2KvZEVjoE ‚Äî Ya√´l (@YaelOss) May 29, 2025 So far this year, over $2.17 billion in crypto has been stolen globally, surpassing 2024‚Äôs total. Attacks on personal wallets now account for nearly 25% of stolen funds. Chainalysis found that retail wallet holders are now the main targets. Users in the U.S., Germany, and Japan report the most cases, while India, Chile, and the UAE see the highest average losses. Improved security at exchanges has pushed attackers toward less protected individuals with high-value wallets. The trend is also being fueled by advanced tactics. Chainalysis and CertiK report growing use of AI tools to identify and manipulate victims, often through phishing and impersonation schemes. CertiK estimates crypto users lost $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 alone, with wallet breaches making up $1.7 billion. ‚ÄúThe rise of wrench attacks is a stark reminder that digital assets are only as safe as the people who hold them,‚Äù Chainalysis said.

2025-07-20T14:14:24,"Japan‚Äôs Aplus card now lets users turn points into XRP, BTC, and ETH","Aplus cardholders in Japan just got a new way to use their points: by swapping them for crypto. Starting this week, Aplus customers can now convert their reward points into XRP, Bitcoin, or Ether, according to information from the company‚Äôs updated loyalty program. That makes Aplus the first major rewards system in the country to offer direct crypto redemptions instead of just the usual cash, merchandise, or airline miles. The new option lets users trade in 2,100 points for over 2,000 yen worth of crypto, roughly $13‚Äì$15 USD, depending on the exchange rate. Basically, the program connects daily spending directly to crypto ownership, without requiring people to invest out of pocket. Users don‚Äôt need any technical background either, just points and an account with SBI VC Trade or access to the Aplus portal. It‚Äôs a small amount, but it turns everyday transactions into a route to XRP, BTC, or ETH, with zero cash upfront. Aplus users earn points from spending and get bonuses for higher usage Every time someone spends 200 yen using an Aplus credit card, they earn one point. Anyone who spends 50,000 yen or more in a single month gets a bonus rate, an extra 0.5% in points. Those points stay active for two years after they‚Äôre earned, meaning customers don‚Äôt have to rush to redeem them. The crypto integration doesn‚Äôt change any of that. It adds one more choice to what people can do with their points. While it might not sound like much, this opens the door for users who‚Äôve never touched crypto before. It doesn‚Äôt require them to study blockchain, open a special wallet, or buy crypto directly. They just spend as usual, earn points, and redeem when they‚Äôre ready. People can redeem points for XRP, Bitcoin, or Ether by logging in to either the Aplus portal or their account on SBI VC Trade. And even though the crypto is earned through points instead of cash, that doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs no oversight, as users are still bound by the country‚Äôs crypto rules, including tax liabilities. So, let‚Äôs say someone redeems their points for Bitcoin, and it goes up in value before they sell it, they will still owe taxes because that‚Äôs just how it works under Japanese law . That means users must either keep the assets in SBI VC Trade or manually transfer them to a private wallet. It‚Äôs completely on them to handle custody and ensure their crypto is safe. But it‚Äôs still uncertain whether people can redeem crypto every month or if there are limits, which will affect how much people use the system over time. There‚Äôs also the issue of size. Getting 2,000 yen worth of crypto might not move the needle for big investors, who say the amount is too small to attract serious users. But for people who are new to crypto or just curious, this setup could be the easiest way to start holding XRP, Bitcoin, or Ether without a lot of headaches. Makoto Kobayashi, a senior manager at SBI VC Trade, explained that the goal is to offer a safe and simple entry point for people who‚Äôve never owned crypto before. ‚ÄúUsing reward points makes that possible, without asking them to risk cash or deal with exchanges.‚Äù Still, clear communication is going to be key if this program‚Äôs going to grow. Aplus hasn‚Äôt released full guidelines yet, and that‚Äôs causing questions to pile up. Users want to know if they can redeem every month, if there‚Äôs a minimum balance, or if anything changes based on which crypto they pick. Until those answers come out, some customers might hold off.

IMF Claims the Country Is Not Buying Bitcoin Every Day","According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s first program review report published on July 15, the government of El Salvador has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February 2025. This information was revealed in an official letter signed by the country's Central Bank President, Douglas Pablo Rodr√≠guez Fuentes, and Finance Minister, Jerson Rogelio Posada Molina, and submitted to the IMF. The letter states that El Salvador's public sector Bitcoin holdings ‚Äúhave not changed.‚Äù Attached documents note that the country's hot and cold wallet addresses have been handed over to the IMF for auditing and monitoring purposes. This statement clearly contradicts previous statements by President Nayib Bukele and El Salvador's Bitcoin Office, which claimed that 1 BTC has been purchased daily since November 2022. The Bukele administration claims that the country's BTC reserves have reached approximately 6,242 BTC, worth around $737 million. Blockchain analysis firm Arkham also provided on-chain data confirming daily transfers of 1 BTC from wallets labeled Binance and Bitfinex. However, the IMF report suggests that these transfers are not new purchases, but rather a consolidation of existing Bitcoin holdings in government wallets. A footnote in the report states, ‚ÄúIncreases in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund are due to the consolidation of Bitcoins held in different government wallets.‚Äù Related News: What Lies Ahead for Solana (SOL) Prices? Analysis Company Releases Technical Analysis President Bukele has repeatedly stated that they will continue to buy Bitcoin, despite reaching a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. In a post on social media platform X, he said, ‚ÄúEven when the world ostracized us and many abandoned us, these purchases didn't stop; they won't stop now, and they won't stop in the future.‚Äù Stacy Herbert, director of the Bitcoin Office, argued in a March post on X that El Salvador continued to buy Bitcoin despite the IMF agreement.

It positions itself as the next Layer‚ÄØ2 solution for Bitcoin, offering speed and smart contracts. But it‚Äôs all a promise, no product yet. In contrast, BlockDAG (BDAG) has already raised $343‚ÄØmillion, proving more traction than hype. It‚Äôs not just about selling coins, it‚Äôs building a real ecosystem with tools and partners, not just a concept. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Gains Early Buzz Bitcoin Hyper taps into the Layer‚ÄØ2 trend. The idea is to enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs core layer with faster transactions and smart contracts. It has gathered $2.5‚ÄØmillion so far. The low supply draws early buyers hoping it‚Äôs the next big breakout. Predictions around Bitcoin Hyper price are fueling that buzz. However, it‚Äôs all based on future promises. There‚Äôs no live product yet. That means backers are betting on the roadmap, not real results, making it high risk and high reward. BlockDAG Drives Real Progress With Users And Funding BlockDAG is already showing results in the real world. With $343‚ÄØmillion raised and 24‚ÄØbillion coins sold, it stands out in a crowded field. It just reached Batch 29 with its GLOBAL‚ÄØLAUNCH release. GLOBAL LAUNCH release lets users buy at the special price of $0.0016 until August‚ÄØ11. After that, the price returns to the Batch‚ÄØ29 level of $0.0276. Early buyers who bought in batch 1 have seen 2,660% ROI to batch‚ÄØ29. If someone buy now at $0.0016, one could see a 3,025‚ÄØ% return compared to that original $0.05 listing. There‚Äôs also a NO VESTING PASS offer, only six days left to grab this simple, locked-up-free deal. The heart of its ecosystem is the X1 miner app. It‚Äôs live now, with more than 2‚ÄØmillion users interacting with the platform firsthand. The app lowers barriers to use, bringing real access to BlockDAG‚Äôs features and mining rewards. Technical layers include support for smart contracts and low-code developer tools. That means builders of all types can start making apps and services. Plus, real-world branding shows up in sports partnerships. Deals with Seattle-based teams like the Orcas and Seawolves add visibility and credibility outside of the crypto bubble. In short, BlockDAG already has working products, a growing user base, strategic partners, and major funding, not just a white paper. Hype Vs Delivery: Bitcoin Hyper Vision Versus BlockDAG Progress Bitcoin Hyper has generated excitement by positioning itself as a future Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. With $2.5 million already raised, the buzz around its price prediction has drawn in attention from those hoping to catch the next big opportunity. It promises faster transactions and smart contract support on Bitcoin‚Äôs network, which is a strong narrative. However, the reality is that Bitcoin Hyper is still in development. There‚Äôs no live product, no working ecosystem, and no user experience to show yet. It‚Äôs all about what could happen, not what has happened. In comparison, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just imagining a future, it‚Äôs actively building it. The difference is clear: while Bitcoin Hyper is gathering interest through marketing and future promises, BlockDAG is already gaining users, revenue, and credibility with real results. Final Verdict Bitcoin Hyper has the potential to grow, but it still needs to prove its technology and deliver a working product. The big ideas are there, and some early supporters believe it could be a major Layer 2 breakthrough. Still, it remains a speculative play, as everything hinges on future development. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is showing what real traction looks like. With a $343 million raise, 24 billion coins sold, a live X1 miner app used by over 2 million people, and strategic partnerships in place, it‚Äôs already well on its way. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release and current $0.0016 pricing , along with the NO VESTING PASS offer, make it even more appealing right now. While Bitcoin Hyper builds its roadmap, BlockDAG is already delivering on it. One is chasing headlines, the other is creating impact.

2025-07-20T14:00:00,"Block: Crypto Miss","Summary Block's bitcoin trading generates high revenue but negligible profit, limiting its impact on overall business performance and valuation. The company has limited innovation, with Cash App and Square no longer driving significant growth; recent product tweaks haven't moved the needle. Block's surprise S&P 500 inclusion caused a stock price jump, but fundamentals remain unchanged and growth catalysts are lacking. The stock will likely trade at ~21x 2026 EPS target after the S&P 500 bump, reducing any interest in buying the stock. Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) was one of the first public fintechs to incorporate bitcoin trading into the business, yet years later the business doesn't generate any material profits off cryptocurrency as the U.S. government starts approving cryptocurrency legislation. The stock is jumping on the surprise entry into S&P 500, leading to limited value in owning Block. My investment thesis is now Neutral on the stock, especially above $80, where Block likely trades when the market opens on Monday. Source: Finviz Limited Crypto Catalysts Years ago, Block would trade wildly based on revenues from bitcoin trading. Just in Q1'25, the fintech generated $2.30 billion in bitcoin trading revenues, but the company incurred a nearly equal $2.24 billion in transaction costs. Source: Block Q1'25 shareholder letter Block has offered bitcoin trading since 2018 , but the company has never moved beyond simple trading of the major crypto coin. Coinbase ( COIN ) has now developed a complete platform with trading in multiple coins and offering stablecoins to reach a market cap of over $100 billion, more than double Block. President Trump just approved the Genius Act to regulate stablecoins. The market is dominated by Coinbase and a few other players, while Block is nowhere to be found. The irony is that co-founder Jack Dorsey was one of the original proponents of bitcoin. Block owns over $1 billion worth of bitcoin based on owning 8,584 coins at the current price of $118K with a cost basis of only $261 million. Unfortunately, Block has remained stuck in focusing on the once innovative Cash App and moving into BNPL services. Neither, really offering the growth dynamics anymore offered by crypto. The company is starting to rollout bitcoin payments on Square in the 2H, with most sellers eligible in 2026. In addition, the company is developing bitcoin mining chips and systems under Proto with a business launch in the 2H, but the fintech isn't moving far beyond the natural crypto trading opportunity. For Q1, Block gross profits only grew 9% to $2.29 billion. Again, the fintech has substantial transaction costs so that gross profits work out to more of a net revenue figure. Either way, the stock can't really be valued based on total revenues due to the excessive bitcoin revenues without any profit benefit from the pass-through costs. The problem facing Block is that both Square and Cash App were innovative fintech products in the beginning, but the company no longer sees innovation outside of product tweaks. The Q1'25 shareholder letter focused on product innovation with up to 100 product enhancements to Square, but the new features to the technology platform aren't moving the growth needle. The biggest product appears to be Cash App Afterpay, a product designed for small amounts of borrowing within Cash App. S&P 500 Surprise After the close on Friday, Block was announced as the new entry into the S&P 500 before the opening of trading on July 23. The stock will enter the key index with trillions attached to the product after Hess (HES) was purchased by Chevron ( CVX ) and removed from the index. The stock soared 8.5% in after-market trading due to the surprise move. Block only had a market cap of $45 billion, with Robinhood ( HOOD ), the far more discussed fintech, set to enter the S&P 500 with the market cap soaring to $100 billion. Barron's even speculated on the next 4 stocks to be added to the index, and Block wasn't included. Source: Seeking Alpha Block traded at ~19x EPS targets for 2026. The stock currently trades at about 4.5x gross profit targets in the range of $10 billion for the year. The S&P 500 entry is likely to boost the stock in the 10% range, moving the forward P/E multiple to 21x. For a company with 9% gross profit growth targets, the stock trades at about fair value. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Block doesn't have the growth catalysts to chase the stock after this surprise S&P 500 entry bump when trading opens up Monday. The company has missed the crypto craze, and the current projects don't appear to move the needle. Investors can hold the stock next week, but one shouldn't chase Block on the entry into the S&P 500.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802499-block-crypto-miss?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|EXCHANGE","XYZ",cryptocompare
2025-07-20T14:00:00,"Chart of the Week: Wall Street's 'Infinite Money Glitch' Moves From Bitcoin to Altcoins","Wall Street has long mastered the creative art of turning complexity into a money-printing machine. How do they do it? Financial engineering ‚Äî an art of structuring debt, equity, and derivatives to squeeze out returns in ways that often defy convention. It‚Äôs a playbook that made fortunes ‚Äî and nearly broke the system in 2008. Now, this complex engineering of money has entered the crypto market. With Wall Street's takeover of crypto, financial engineering is fast becoming a pillar of the crypto market. It is now at the center of the latest iteration of one of the hottest trends in the space: the crypto treasury strategy. This trend is championed by Michael Saylor, whose company ‚Äî MicroStrategy (MSTR), now rebranded simply as Strategy ‚Äî began acquiring bitcoin as both a corporate reserve asset and a market signal. But the real innovation wasn‚Äôt just buying BTC and holding it. It was how the firm financed those purchases: issuing convertible notes and equity to raise capital, then cycling that capital into buying more bitcoin. Each announcement triggered a surge in Strategy‚Äôs share price, which in turn made new capital raises easier and more lucrative. Others took note. What began as a bitcoin bet turned into a blueprint for a new kind of treasury management: announce crypto treasury strategy, stock pumps, raise funds, buy tokens, watch the share price pop more, repeat. This is the new ""Infinite Money Glitch,"" according to Animoca Brands Research. ""This financial engineering approach of utilizing debt and equity issuances, such as convertible notes and stock offerings, specifically to raise funds for continuous crypto asset acquisitions creates a ‚Äúflywheel"" effect,"" the firm said in a research note . Obviously, this money printing machine didn't stop with bitcoin. Smaller firms started to apply this to other popular altcoins, including XRP, ETH and SOL. But why altcoins? After all, the bitcoin market has matured, the cycle has been well defined, and the likes of Michael Saylor have shown that the returns serve the shareholders well while enabling firms to continue to raise funds. It's the early-stage advantage, according to Animoca's research. ""Applying this 'flywheel' model to altcoins might offer a more extended runway for growth and profitability compared to bitcoin. While bitcoin's market is more mature and its price discovery has undergone several major cycles, the vast and diverse altcoin market is still, in many respects, in its nascent stages,"" the research noted. A quick look at the return charts shows that in the short term, this altcoin treasury strategy has paid off for the firms and their shareholders. ""On the day of the [altcoin treasury] announcement, share prices saw an average increase of 161%. This upward trend persisted, with average gains of 150% one day after, 185% after seven days, and 226% after 30 days,"" the note said. ""This immediate market response also underscores the market's willingness to invest in publicly traded 'wrappers' for altcoin exposure."" Interestingly, launching these treasury strategies didn't impact the actual prices of the underlying tokens, Animoca's data shows. This perhaps makes a compelling case for investors to flock to these equity ""wrappers"" rather than to the actual tokens. Also, the lack of altcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) means that Wall Street has limited options but to buy into these strategy companies to capture the upside. For investors, these massive short-term gains are hard to ignore, and as long as there is an appetite for such financial engineering, capital will continue to flow into them. The only question is: Is this sustainable? ""Should market sentiment shift or altcoin prices experience a prolonged decline, the leveraged nature of some of these strategies that could be employed carries substantial inherent risks,"" Animoca Brands research analysts said. ""Nevertheless, the trend highlights a significant addressable market for structured products that bridge traditional finance with crypto,"" the report added. So for now, the ""Infinite Money Glitch"" is here for the win. Read more: Altcoin Season Returns?
