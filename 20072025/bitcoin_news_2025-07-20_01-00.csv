2025-07-19T22:00:39,"Bitcoin Whale Exchange Transfers Spike As Capital Rotation Begins â€” Latest Altseason Signal?","Over the past week, the Bitcoin (BTC) market recorded a new all-time high at $123,091 on July 14. However, the premier cryptocurrency has experienced a slight price retracement since reaching this milestone. Interestingly, this fall in Bitcoin market prices has collided with a widespread gain in the altcoin market, with specific large-cap tokens notching up remarkable gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside 7-Day SMA Bitcoin Whale Exchange Transfers Near 12,000 BTC â€“ Glassnode In an X post of July 18, prominent blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shares a profound on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market, stating that the volume of whale transfers to exchanges is presently on the rise. Notably, this development comes as Bitcoin experiences a moderate price correction after reaching a new ATH earlier last week, as previously stated. Glassnode explains that the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of BTC transferred from whale wallets to exchanges is approaching 12,000 BTC, one of the highest weekly volumes recorded in 2025. Interestingly, this surge in transfer mirrors levels last seen in early November 2024, a period that preceded a popular crypto bull run. When large holders move their BTC to centralized exchanges, it typically suggests they are preparing to liquidate some or all of their positions, either to take profits or to rotate capital into other opportunities. However, the latter scenario seems likely, especially considering recent trends in the altcoin market. Amidst Bitcoinâ€™s price correction, several altcoins have recorded significant price gains, prompting ideas that the altseason may have begun. For context, data from CoinMarketCap shows that the premier cryptocurrency experienced a mere 0.27% gain over the past week, while altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP, and Solana registered price surges of 19.98%, 25.98%, and 8.86%, respectively. Historically, this development mirrors a characteristic altseason, when other cryptocurrencies generally outperform Bitcoin, leading to a decline in Bitcoinâ€™s market dominance. Altseasons are triggered when investors begin reallocating profits from BTC into higher-beta assets, seeking larger returns due to the lower market caps of these tokens. However, more data from CoinMarketCap shows the altseason index is at 36/100, indicating that while altcoins are beginning to gain momentum, the market has not yet fully transitioned into a confirmed altseason. An index value below 50 suggests that Bitcoin is still outperforming a majority of altcoins over 90 days. Investors should stay alert for a cross above 75 which would suggest a full-fledged altseason to be declared.

2025-07-19T22:00:29,"Signal That Sparked 630% XRP Price Rally In 2024 Just Got Triggered Again","The XRP price action could be setting up for a major rally as a key bullish signal has just reappeared on the charts. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this historical indicator previously preceded a massive 630% surge in XRPâ€™s price back in 2024 . Now, with the same signal flashing again, the analyst points to the potential of another strong move to the upside. XRP Price Flashes Historically Bullish Signal A potentially explosive historical signal has just resurfaced on the XRP price chart , fueling optimism for a potential breakout ahead. In his latest XRP analysis report on X social media, Martinez reveals that the cryptocurrencyâ€™s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has flashed a Golden Crossâ€”a pattern generally associated with powerful bullish momentum. Martinez highlighted that the last time his MVRV ratio crossover appeared, in 2024, XRP skyrocketed by over 630%, marking one of its most dramatic price moves in recent years. Now, the same bullish pattern has been triggered again, fueling speculation of a potential history repeat . The analystâ€™s chart shows the MVRV ratio, in orange, spiking above its 200-day Moving Average (MA) , in red, with XRPâ€™s price already beginning to respond positively. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.43, displaying healthy momentum compared to past months, during which its price was stuck in a consolidation range above $2. Although the cryptocurrency surged significantly above $3.5 earlier this week, it has since retraced by approximately 3.8% to its current price, according to CoinMarketCap. If history is any guide, the reemergence of the MVRV ratio Golden Cross could open the door to further upside, potentially positioning XRP for a new multi-month rally. Members of the crypto community who have taken note of this historically bullish signal are already forecasting a potential surge to $22, representing a whopping 541% climb from XRPâ€™s current levels. Analyst Sets XRP Price Target Above $20 The XRP price could see a historic rally to new all-time highs before the end of this cycle, as an X crypto market expert, Shawn Mark, points to past chart patterns that suggest a potential surge above $20 is imminent. According to the analysis, XRP has just broken out of a multi-year consolidation phase within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern , similar to the one it formed before its explosive surge in the 2017 bull cycle. Back then, XRP skyrocketed from under $0.01 to nearly $3.50 in a parabolic move, representing a more than 60x increase. Now, current chart formations suggest that the latest triangle breakout mirrors the same historic pattern almost identically. If this fractal plays out again with similar bullish momentum, XRPâ€™s projected target this time could land in the $20 range, with a precise peak prediction at $20.25.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-rally-triggered-again/,"ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK","XRP|Ali Martinez|golden cross|MA|Market Value to Realized Value|moving average|MVRV|Shawn Mark|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT",cryptocompare
2025-07-19T22:00:00,"As Bitcoin (BTC) Eyes $150K, This Altcoin Presale Nears 80% Sell-Outâ€”Is MUTM the Best Crypto to Buy Now?","Bitcoinâ€™s climb is setting the tone for the rest of the market, with analysts now predicting a push toward $150,000 in the coming months. This projection isnâ€™t just boosting BTCâ€™s appealâ€”itâ€™s igniting interest across the altcoin space, especially among presale tokens with strong utility and growth potential. One name thatâ€™s starting to stand out is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized finance project gaining attention as it approaches a major milestone: over 80% of its presale Phase 5 is now sold out, and a 20% price increase is just around the corner. Bitcoinâ€™s Momentum Is Fueling Altcoin Opportunities With fresh capital flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs and global sentiment improving, Bitcoinâ€™s push toward six figures is more than just speculationâ€”itâ€™s becoming a broader signal of renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency market. The narrative is shifting back to fundamentals, and that momentum is lifting not only BTC, but also altcoins that bring real value and clear use cases to the table. While many are watching Bitcoin for long-term gains, others are looking at what $1,000 invested today might become in tokens that havenâ€™t hit the open market yet. Thatâ€™s exactly why attention is turning toward Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is building a lending and borrowing protocol that operates without centralized control. Everything runs on smart contracts, which means users keep control of their assets while interacting with fully transparent and automated lending markets. The process is straightforward. Lenders deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins into Mutuumâ€™s liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent their share of the pool and automatically increase in value over time as interest accrues. When itâ€™s time to withdraw, users can exchange their mtTokens back for the underlying asset along with the interest thatâ€™s accumulated. No need to wait for a match or counterparty. The smart contract handles everything in real time. Borrowers, on the other hand, can tap into liquidity by posting overcollateralized assets. This means that to borrow $1,000, a user would typically need to secure the loan with around $1,500 in digital assets as collateral. This structure ensures stability and keeps the protocol solvent, while still giving users access to capital without selling their holdings. And because borrowers can choose between stable or variable interest rates, the system works for both short-term flexibility and longer-term strategies. What makes Mutuum different is that these mechanics are not theoretical. The protocol is already under development, and its beta version is expected to go live alongside the token launchâ€”a clear sign that this isnâ€™t just a whitepaper project. A Stablecoin That Makes Sense In addition to its lending platform, Mutuum is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin that will be fully backed by assets supplied within the ecosystem. This stablecoin will maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar through on-chain mechanismsâ€”not through external custodians or unverifiable reserves. To generate the stablecoin, users must deposit collateral exceeding the value of the tokens they mint. Once the borrowed amount is repaid, those stablecoins are permanently removed from circulation. This system prevents inflation while preserving full transparency. Unlike many existing stablecoins that rely on trust in third parties, Mutuumâ€™s model is algorithmic, decentralized, and designed to maintain long-term reliability. Itâ€™s another layer of utility that gives the MUTM token real-world function within the protocol. Interest generated from stablecoin borrowing goes directly to the treasury, reinforcing the ecosystemâ€™s value over time. Nearly Sold Out Before Phase 6 The presale has already passed some major milestones. Over $12.6 million has been raised, with more than 13,600 holders joining so far. With more than 80% of Phase 5 already completed, the $0.03 price point is approaching its final stretch. As the presale moves into Phase 6, the token price is set to rise to $0.035, marking a 20% increase for incoming participants. That price will continue to climb across the remaining phases until launch, where MUTM is expected to list at $0.06. Those entering now are looking at a potential 2x gain before the token even hits exchanges. Adding to the momentum is the completion of a full audit by CertiK, which gave Mutuum a score of 95, confirming the security and readiness of its smart contracts. To encourage continued transparency and safety, the team also launched a $50,000 bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway for early contributorsâ€”both of which have helped strengthen engagement from new and existing investors. Mutuum Finance is gaining attention at the right time. As Bitcoin pushes toward $150K and overall sentiment shifts back to growth, early-stage projects with clear fundamentals are in the spotlight. Mutuum checks all the right boxes: functional design, audited smart contracts, passive income potential, and additional utility through its upcoming stablecoin. The presale wonâ€™t stay open forever, and with a 20% price increase confirmed for Phase 6, those considering an entry point may not have much time left. As market momentum builds, the opportunity to secure a position at $0.03 might soon be gone. For investors asking what cryptocurrency to invest in now, especially with a long-term outlook, MUTM looks like more than just a promising altcoinâ€”itâ€™s shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments heading into 2026.
