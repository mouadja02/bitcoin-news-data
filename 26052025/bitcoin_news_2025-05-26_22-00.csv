2025-05-26T19:55:41.000Z,"Vitalik Buterin Calls for Ethereum To Be More Private and Resilient Amid Rise of ‚ÄòCashless Society‚Äô","Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum says that ETH should work towards being more ready to play the role of cash. In a new post on the social media platform X, Buterin comments on a report published by The Guardian about Sweden‚Äôs migration toward becoming a cashless society. The report discusses how plans for Sweden to become completely cashless by 2025 have been partially successful. However, due to geopolitical uncertainties and the war in Eastern Europe, the Swedish government is now encouraging citizens to keep more cash ‚Äì krona ‚Äì on them. Sweden launched a pilot program for an ‚Äúe-krona‚Äù in 2017, but then ended it in 2023. The Riksbank ‚Äì Sweden‚Äôs central bank ‚Äì stated in March that it determined there was little need to issue a digital krona, but that it would re-evaluate the plans if the European Central Bank (ECB) issued a digital euro. Said the Riksbank, ‚ÄúThe Payments Inquiry‚Äôs assessment in 2023 was that there was insufficient social need for the Riksbank to issue an e-krona. At the same time, the inquiry considered that the Riksbank should continue to evaluate the conditions for issuing an e-krona so that it is possible to introduce an e-krona within a reasonable time if the Riksdag takes such a decision.‚Äù Says Buterin on the Guardian story, ‚ÄúNordics are walking back the cashless society initiative because their centralized implementation of the concept is too fragile. Cash turns out necessary as a backup. Ethereum needs to be resilient enough, and private enough, to be able to credibly play this kind of role.‚Äù Earlier this month, Buterin made headlines by calling Ethereum ‚Äúneedlessly complex.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Analyst Predicts Monster Move Based On The Charts","A well-known crypto analyst, going by the name Egrag Crypto, has laid out some eye-popping targets for XRP. According to his charts, the token could climb as high as $45, a 2,700% jump from its current price. A more modest scenario would still send it to $19, up a little over 1,000%. He points to past cycles where similar moves took shape over roughly 770 days. Yet not everyone is on board with his bullish outlook. Related Reading: Investors Pour $2.75 Billion Into Bitcoin ETFs As Price Skyrockets Historical Moves And Cycle Timing Based on reports, Egrag Crypto stresses that XRP‚Äôs rallies in 2017 and 2021 followed almost identical paths. The token hit $3.25 in 2017 after surging 2,770%. Then in 2021 it jumped 1,052% to about $1.80. Each rally was marked by a bearish crossover on the 21 EMA and the 33 MA, followed by sideway trading for around 777 days after the 2018 peak and 770 days after the 2021 high. He believes the same setup started late in 2024, when XRP climbed nearly sixfold from its previous low. #XRP ‚Äì Targeting $19 or $45? üü£Charts Men lie, women lie, but charts don‚Äôt! üìä I‚Äôm not improvising here; I‚Äôm relying on historical data to present future predictions. Will it rhyme exactly?

A less aggressive run would still see it reach $19. Egrag Crypto even points to an intermediate target of about $27 as a likely milestone. Those numbers assume a straight path up, but markets rarely move in straight lines. Big jumps often end with sharp pullbacks. Traders chasing 2,700% gains could face long wait times and steep drops. Bearish Views Gain Ground Other voices warn against getting swept up in the hype. Market watcher Koroush says now is a time for shorts. He pegs a possible decline to $1.30. Others favor a short bias, pointing to weakening demand and faltering momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $125K By End Of Q2?

Looking Ahead The debate around XRP‚Äôs next phase is far from over. Historical charts show one side of the story. On-chain trends, legal battles, and macro factors tell another. If charts really don‚Äôt lie, as Egrag Crypto quips, XRP might be gearing up for a fireworks show.

2025-05-26T18:55:19.000Z,"Quite the opposite, criminals are embracing blockchain more as a feature than a bug","Ari Redbord, the Global Head of Policy at TRM Labs, has shed light on the mind of the crypto criminals saying that they are not intimidated by blockchain‚Äôs transparency. According to him, North Korea hackers understand they can be tracked and traced but they perceive it as the cost of doing business. Initially, the crypto industry was sure their system would not have criminals as a vulnerability because transactions are open to everyone. However, over time, all manner of illicit activities have multiplied. Redbord says that criminals see the transparent nature of blockchain more as a feature than a bug. Blockchain being transparent is not enough Recently, the crypto industry has recorded kidnappings as a result of blockchain transparency. A crypto investor, John Woeltz, did the most recent kidnapping, among many others , this month. He allegedly beat and hanged the victim off a ledge when he refused to provide his Bitcoin password. Ari Redbord said, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs the paradox of crypto‚Ä¶we say bad guys should never use crypto because we see every transaction, and that‚Äôs true, but the reality is that they can also move funds faster and in larger amounts, and that‚Äôs why we just have to get better and better at what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù The thing about crypto is that funds can be moved in minutes, if not seconds. This is very friendly to criminals. According to Michael Pearl, vice president of strategy at a blockchain security firm, security methods such as multi-factor authentication could help make forced transfers harder to execute without alerting others. On the other hand, transparency has helped blockchain technology compete with traditional assets such as Gold. Crypto users have convinced the US government that BTC is better than Gold. They reasoned it takes about 44k man-hours, 20 people and 18 months to audit the Gold Reserves in Fort Knox. But it takes about 1 second and a push of a button to audit Bitcoin.

Usually, attackers send transactions with no value from a wallet address that looks like a real one the victim uses or interacts with. The person who was scammed first sent $843,000 in USDT to the con artist. Not even three hours later, they mistakenly sent an extra $1.7 million in USDT to the same fake address. The event shows how complicated crypto-related scams are getting. This year has been difficult for crypto investors. For instance, in April alone, over 18 big attacks were reported. The most severe one involved a fake Bitcoin (BTC) transaction, which resulted in a loss of $330.7 million. In February, hackers used malware to trick the Dubai-based exchange Bybit into approving deals that weren‚Äôt supposed to happen. The exchange lost $1.46 billion. This theft beat the previous record of $611 million stolen from Poly Network in 2021. Meanwhile, Ripple sent a message to its users telling them to be careful of scams, which tend to become more common when the crypto market goes up. The blockchain company wrote in a blog post about the rise of scams using AI-made content, such as deepfake videos of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse giving away XRP. ‚ÄúThese posts include branding and profile pictures that look exactly like what the companies, individuals or government authorities use It‚Äôs important to spot which accounts are fake, and which posts are cryptocurrency giveaway scams.‚Äù Ripple wrote.

2025-05-26T18:52:32.000Z,"Price predictions 5/26: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, XRP, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA, HYPE","Key points: Bitcoin ETPs continue to witness solid buying, signaling that the bulls expect the uptrend to continue. Several major altcoins witnessed a pullback, but lower levels continue to attract buyers. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is attempting to sustain above $109,588, indicating buying on every minor dip. Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks , and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following 6 and 12 month time period. Institutional investors sense a long-term opportunity and, hence, have continued to pump money into Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). CoinShares reported on May 26 that Bitcoin ETPs witnessed $2.9 billion in inflows last week, which is a quarter of the total inflows for 2024. Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 Although most analysts remain bullish over the long term, some are warning of a possible short-term pullback in Bitcoin. CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in a QuickTake blog post that the data shows buyer exhaustion and increasing volatility, which could start a short-term correction toward $105,000 . Could buyers catapult Bitcoin to a new all-time high, pulling altcoins higher? Let‚Äôs analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. S&P 500 Index price prediction The S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from 5,968 and reached the 20-day exponential moving average (5,759). SPX daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the index could gradually climb toward the overhead resistance of 6,000. Sellers are expected to pose a strong challenge in the 6,000 to 6,147 zone. The short-term advantage will favor the bears on a break and close below the 20-day EMA. The index could then plummet to the 50-day simple moving average (5,584), which is likely to attract buyers. US Dollar Index price prediction The bulls tried to push the US Dollar Index (DXY) above the 20-day EMA (100.15) on May 22, but the bears held their ground. DXY daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Sellers are trying to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the 99 support. If they manage to do that, the index could continue its slide to the solid support at 97.92. Buyers are expected to defend the 97.92 level with all their might because a break below it may sink the index to 95.67. Buyers will have to drive and maintain the price above the 50-day SMA (101.26) to indicate that the corrective phase may be over. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin bulls are trying to push and sustain the price above $109,588, indicating that every minor dip is being purchased. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near the overbought territory signal that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers shove the price above $111,980, the BTC/USDT pair could skyrocket to $130,000. The 20-day EMA ($104,886) is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below the 20-day EMA could tempt short-term buyers to book profits. That could sink the pair to the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, where buyers are expected to mount a strong defense. Ether price prediction Ether ( ETH ) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2,425) on May 25, indicating solid demand at lower levels. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to drive the price above the $2,738 obstacle again. If they succeed, the ETH/USDT pair could soar to $3,000. The bears will try to halt the up move at $2,850, but the bulls are likely to prevail. If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are losing their grip. The pair could dip to $2,323 and then to $2,111. XRP price prediction XRP ( XRP ) has been oscillating between $2.65 and $2, signaling equilibrium between buyers and sellers. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The flattish 20-day EMA ($2.34) and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price turns up and breaks above $2.48, the bulls will have another go at the $2.65 resistance. If they clear the overhead hurdle, the XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3. On the other hand, a break and close below the 50-day SMA could sink the pair to the solid support at $2. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $2 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $1.61. BNB price prediction BNB ( BNB ) has started to move toward the overhead resistance of $693 after taking support at the 20-day EMA ($652). BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate an advantage to buyers. If bulls kick the price above $693, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to the $732 to $761 overhead zone. Contrarily, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bears are trying to seize control. The pair could slump to $633 and subsequently to the 50-day SMA ($617). Solana price prediction Solana ( SOL ) took support at the 20-day EMA ($169) on May 25, indicating that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on minor dips. SOL/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will again attempt to drive the price above the $188 overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the SOL/USDT pair could surge to $210 and eventually to $220. Sellers will have to pull the price below the 20-day EMA to prevent the upside. The pair could then plunge to the 50-day SMA ($151), which is likely to act as solid support. A bounce off the 50-day SMA could signal a few days of range-bound action between $153 and $188. Related: Solana following Bitcoin? Network activity, chart pattern point to $300 SOL price Dogecoin price prediction Dogecoin ( DOGE ) has been trading between $0.26 and $0.21, signaling buying near the support and selling close to the resistance. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The price has bounced off the 20-day EMA, opening the gates for a rally to the overhead resistance of $0.26. Buyers will have to pierce the $0.26 level to start the next leg of the uptrend to $0.30 and then to $0.35. Alternatively, a break and close below the $0.21 support suggests the bears are back in the game. The DOGE/USDT pair could then swing inside a large range between $0.26 and $0.14 for some time. Cardano price prediction Buyers are trying to keep Cardano ( ADA ) above the neckline of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern but have failed to start a strong rebound. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 20-day EMA ($0.75) is flattening out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, indicating a balance between supply and demand. Buyers will have to propel the price above $0.86 to tilt the advantage in their favor. If they manage to do that, the ADA/USDT pair could rally to $1.01. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the neckline, it suggests that the bulls have given up. The pair could then drop to the $0.60 support, which is likely to attract buyers. Hyperliquid price prediction Hyperliquid (HYPE) has been in a strong uptrend for the past several days. Buyers asserted their supremacy by pushing the price above the $35.73 resistance on May 25. HYPE/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The bulls will try to maintain the momentum and push the price to $42.25, where the bears are expected to step in. If buyers do not give up much ground from $42.25, the uptrend could extend to $50. The immediate support on the downside is $35.73. If the HYPE/USDT pair rebounds off $35.73, it increases the likelihood of a rally above $42.25. Sellers will gain the upper hand on a break below $32.

Woeltz is being held without bail, after prosecutors said he was a flight risk due to owning a private jet and a helicopter. Woeltz‚Äôs attorney, Wayne Gosnell, declined to comment. The victim, whose name has not been released, recently arrived in New York City from Italy. It is not clear how the victim knew the alleged kidnapper. The abduction is thought to have occurred on May 6th. It appears others were involved in the scheme, including an unnamed unapprehended male. The victim was allegedly bound by the wrists and tortured for weeks inside the apartment, including being drugged, shocked with electricity, hit in the head with a firearm and dangled over a flight of stairs ‚Äì all to get him to reveal his Bitcoin wallet passphrase so the suspect could steal his digital assets. The victim was reportedly able to flee when the suspect turned his back to retrieve the man‚Äôs laptop in another room after he said he would give up the password when he thought the suspect was going to shoot him. When authorities searched the apartment, they said they found cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armor and night vision goggles, ammunition and Polaroid photos of the victim with a gun pointed to his head. Woeltz is due back in Manhattan criminal court next week.

2025-05-26T18:30:00.000Z,"4 Altcoins to Buy Now as Bitcoin (BTC) Hits a New All-Time High","Investors are turning their attention to altcoins poised to follow the surge, with Bitcoin (BTC) recently smashing through its all-time high and trading above $110,000. Cardano (ADA), is gaining traction thanks to its efficient proof-of-stake model and growing ecosystem of DeFi projects. Ripple (XRP) remains a top coin as it benefits from increased clarity in U.S. regulation. Solana (SOL) is back in the spotlight due to its lightning-fast transactions and growing meme coins and DeFi presence. But the real buzz is around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a low-price DeFi altcoin with analysts predicting exponential gains in 2025. The project is currently in Presale Phase 5 already raking in over $9.3 million with over 11,500 investors participating. With a public launch price of $0.06 after upcoming stages, phase 5 investors at the current price of $0.025 are in line for potential gains of 100% by the time the token hits exchanges. As BTC leads the charge, these four altcoins are generating massive investor interest. Altcoins Poised for Growth in 2025 Currently, Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.82, reflecting a modest uptick. Analysts anticipate ADA could reach $1.88 by year-end, contingent on continued development and market momentum. Ripple (XRP) is currently priced around $2.45, with projections suggesting a potential rise to $5.50 by the end of 2025, driven by factors such as ETF approvals and broader adoption. Solana (SOL) is trading near $186.35, with analysts forecasting a possible surge to $336.25 in 2025, supported by its growing ecosystem and investor interest. While these established altcoins show promise, emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also capturing investor attention for their potential in the crypto market. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Different from the legacy tokens, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance is being third-party audited, and their open-source smart contracts are secure in design while creating trust among users. The platform is also set to be compatible with non-EVM and EVM blockchains, and the gates swing wider with more liquidity in other ecosystems. Presale Momentum At today‚Äôs $0.03, the MUTM token is of huge interest to early investors. A 16.67% price jump will give the token a boost to $0.035 in the next phase. With a listing price of $0.06 and some analysts predicting post-launch prices of up to $3, there‚Äôs plenty of room for early investors to make a profit. This has made Mutuum Finance one of the most-watched low-market-price DeFi plays. With Bitcoin smashing through $110,000, focus shifts to breakout altcoins, and leading the pack is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With over $9.3 million raised from 11,500+ investors, the $0.03 presale price now translates to a projected 100% profit at the $0.06 launch. In contrast to most tokens, MUTM‚Äôs innovative dual lending model (P2C + P2P), cross-chain capability, and live smart contract audit offer concrete DeFi utility. As ADA, XRP, and SOL prepare for 2025 profits, Mutuum is the low-cap secret gem with tremendous upside.

The platform seeks to stretch its offerings in line with its anticipated roadmap to onboard Bitcoin and improve wallet connectivity. Solana‚Äôs price spiked 6% in hourly trading below, cooling above 3% gains as bulls sight a new price target. Solana: A Significant Milestone In MetaMask Roadmap According to MetaMask executives, the company is set to introduce Solana to users in May. This will ramp up interoperability between multiple networks, marking a significant shift beyond Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible networks. The integration is also tipped to increase the wallet‚Äôs user base. In February, MetaMask disclosed plans to add support for Solana and Bitcoin. This was part of the long-term strategy, including gas swaps to allow users to pay with the tokens they hold. The company noted that it intends to eliminate gas in almost all transactions. ‚ÄúComing sooner in May, we‚Äôre adding native Solana Support to MetaMask, the first non-EVM chain supported out of the box. All MetaMask users will be able to buy, sell, swap, and interact with dapps across the entire Solana ecosystem. Existing Solana users will get access to the same security, reliability, and rich features of MetaMask.‚Äù Other features included support for Secret Recovery Phrases (SRPs) and Profile Sync for users. Amid incoming developments, expansion to Solana caught the bull‚Äôs attention after traders set a higher price range for the asset this year. Solana is popular as an institutional favorite asset with a growing user base due to expanding DeFi integrations. The community-dubbed ETH killer tapped key milestones in terms of projects. Notably, the network‚Äôs growing meme coin ecosystem has spiked activity and volume. These assets led the wider meme coin frenzy in Q1 2024. SOL Price Rally Ahead? Solana bulls are gearing up for a rally following trader resilience against the $172 level in the last seven days. MetaMask integration could ignite upward sentiments for stronger institutional adoption as headwinds cool off. Furthermore, institutional investors are accumulating SOL tokens coupled with whale offloads from centralized exchanges. Analysts opine recent movements are in preparation for a potential spot SOL ETF this year. A Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approval will be a game-changer for altcoins.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report says TMTG plans to raise $2 billion through fresh equity and another $1 billion via a convertible bond. Proceeds from the raise are expected to fund new crypto investments, including allocations to Bitcoin ( BTC ). Sources have told Financial Times that an announcement to this effect could come as soon as this week, with a likely venue of the blockbuster news set to be Las Vegas at the Bitcoin Conference. Notably, the event has lined up U.S. vice president JD Vance, White House crypto tsar David Sacks and Trump‚Äôs sons Eric and Donald Jr. as top speakers. While TMTG has reportedly downplayed the FT report, the rumored move highlights the Trump family‚Äôs growing presence in the crypto space.

WLF recently unveiled its stablecoin USD1. On the other hand, TMTG recently revealed its plans for crypto exchange-traded fund, a move that echoes the spot ETFs frenzy engulfing the market. If realized, Trump Media‚Äôs $3 billion raise would align with a growing trend among publicly traded companies using debt and equity offerings to build Bitcoin treasuries. The most prominent example is Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), led by Michael Saylor. With its latest BTC purchase, Strategy has amassed a staggering $40.6 billion in Bitcoin, totaling 580,250 BTC.

Legal experts are assessing how existing ethics and disclosure statutes apply to assets held in revocable trusts controlled by relatives of sitting presidents. Financial market analysts say the scale of the raise could affect liquidity in major digital assets if deployed aggressively. Trump Media & Technology Group is preparing to raise $3 billion to purchase digital assets, including Bitcoin, according to a Financial Times report published on May 27. The company, which operates Truth Social and is controlled by President Donald Trump‚Äôs family, is planning a $2 billion equity offering alongside a $1 billion convertible bond. The deal structure remains subject to change, though sources told the FT that interest in the offering has grown in recent weeks. Trump Media Eyes Crypto Market Expansion According to people familiar with the matter, the fundraising initiative may be formally announced during a crypto industry event in Las Vegas this week. Scheduled speakers include Vice President JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and crypto policy advisor David Sacks. If completed, the capital raise would be one of the largest direct investments in cryptocurrency by a media entity. It would also expand the Trump family‚Äôs business activity in the sector, which includes two meme coins, an NFT trading card venture, and a stake in a stablecoin platform. The company‚Äôs public response to the FT report was dismissive. ‚ÄúApparently, the Financial Times has dumb writers listening to even dumber sources,‚Äù it said in a statement. Trump transferred his majority stake in the company, valued at approximately $3 billion, to a revocable trust managed by Donald Trump Jr. after he re-entered office. TMTG‚Äôs approach resembles that of other firms that have acquired large amounts of Bitcoin through debt and equity markets, such as MicroStrategy.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 22, 2025 President‚Äôs Activity Sparks Ethics Concerns Trump has publicly supported the expansion of crypto access and has pledged to make the United States a leading center for digital assets. Last week, he hosted a private dinner for investors in his personal meme coin project at his golf club. The planned capital raise places Trump Media in a position to act not just as a participant in crypto markets but as a large holder of digital assets under the direction of the president‚Äôs family. That development adds pressure on lawmakers to clarify the boundaries between officeholders and private financial exposure. It also raises new concerns about how policy decisions may be shaped when those in power hold material interests in the industries they oversee. The current ethics and disclosure rules may not fully account for the structure or opacity of digital asset holdings. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Could a sitting president‚Äôs family trust legally hold large digital asset positions? Current law does not prohibit family-managed trusts from holding such assets, but ethics experts warn that this creates a gray area when the officeholder may benefit indirectly. How does this differ from previous presidential financial entanglements? Unlike prior examples centered on real estate or hospitality, this case involves volatile, lightly regulated assets with price sensitivity to policy decisions. What additional oversight mechanisms exist for revocable trusts? Revocable trusts are often exempt from public disclosure unless income is transferred directly. This limits what the public or Congress can review in real time.

Crypto Victim Beaten, Dangled Over Staircase According to a Saturday report by the Associated Press , John Woeltz, 37, was arraigned on multiple charges after he held a 28-year-old Italian man captive for three weeks in a ritzy Manhattan townhouse, authorities say. The Italian man arrived in New York in early May and was lured to a five-story rental in the NoLiTa neighborhood on May 6, where prosecutors say Woeltz and unidentified accomplices started abusing him to get access to his Bitcoin. According to authorities, the man was bound, beaten, drugged, shocked with electric wires, and threatened at gunpoint as part of a prolonged attempt to force him to give up his password. At one point, he was held over the ledge of a flight of stairs and told he would be killed if he didn‚Äôt give his attackers his crypto wallet credentials. The suspects also allegedly threatened to kill the victim‚Äôs family if he did not provide access to the Bitcoin. The victim eventually managed to escape on Friday after feigning capitulation and telling his captors that he‚Äôd give up his Bitcoin password. When Woeltz went to retrieve the man‚Äôs laptop from another room, he fled down the stairs and flagged down police officers on the streets. Police arrested Woeltz at the scene and discovered cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, night vision goggles, and Polaroids of the victim with a gun to his head.

Prosecutors said Woeltz was not acting alone. Beatrice Folchi was also arrested, while a third suspect remains at large.

Aside from the crypto's impact on the market, the imminent expiry of BTC options has fueledspeculations. In particular, almost $14 billion in options are set to expire in the new week, an event that might spark immense volatility in the market and affect Bitcoin price prediction. This event also strengthened the market-wide belief that Bitcoin‚Äôs price at $107,000 would be a resistance level. Hence, there's been a massive exodus of traders from the Bitcoinecosystem and an influx into Mantix , a newbie setting the pace in the DeFi market. With its presale just kicking off its first stage, optimism is high for a sky-high 100x ROI. Bitcoin price prediction amid largest options expiry of 2025 Bitcoin price drifted across the $108,000 range on May 24 as markets prepare for the biggest monthly options expiry of 2025.

This suggests the community is actively exploring and discussing a range of altcoins, likely driven by potential price movements, new project developments, or specific market narratives (e.g., meme coins like TRUMP, or specific sector tokens). Search vs. Mention Dynamics: While XRP had exceptionally high search volume, Bitcoin led in mentions. This might imply a large number of individuals were independently looking up XRP , perhaps reacting to specific news or price action, while Bitcoin served as a more general, overarching topic for community-wide discussion and sentiment sharing. Emerging Tokens: The presence of less commonly cited tokens like NXPC, ONDO, OM, and MOVE in the top searches and mentions highlights the community‚Äôs focus on identifying potential opportunities beyond the mainstream. Understanding the narratives around these specific tokens would provide deeper context into the week‚Äôs activities. This data from Bitcoin World provides a snapshot of the Top Crypto Keywords that were front of mind for the Korean Crypto Community . It underscores the market‚Äôs engagement with both established assets and a dynamic set of altcoins. Why Does Understanding These Keywords Matter? For investors, analysts, and projects, monitoring community sentiment and search/mention data in key markets like South Korea is incredibly valuable. It can: Identify Emerging Trends: Spotting tokens like NXPC or OM rising in searches/mentions early can signal growing interest before it becomes widely apparent. Gauge Market Sentiment: High search volume for a token might indicate FOMO or FUD depending on the context, while discussion volume shows the intensity of community engagement. Inform Strategy: Projects can understand if their token is gaining traction, and exchanges or platforms can tailor their offerings and content to align with what the community is focused on. The insights derived from analyzing the Top Crypto Keywords used by the Korean Crypto Community offer a powerful lens into one of the world‚Äôs most active crypto markets. By tracking these trends, participants can gain a competitive edge in understanding market dynamics. Conclusion: A Glimpse into South Korea‚Äôs Crypto Pulse The data from May 16-22 provides a compelling look at the tokens capturing the attention of the Korean Crypto Community . From the consistent dominance of majors like Bitcoin , Ethereum, and XRP to the significant interest in a diverse range of altcoins, the market remains vibrant and actively engaged.

2025-05-26T18:05:45.000Z,"BlackRock Issues Bitcoin Warning, Says BTC Source Code Could Be Rendered ‚ÄòFlawed or Ineffective‚Äô by Quantum Computing","The biggest asset manager in the world has acknowledged the potential of a critical threat that could weigh on Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the future. In its updated prospectus for its iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), BlackRock mentions quantum computing under its ‚Äúrisk factors‚Äù section. Quantum computers are considered by many to be a potential threat to Bitcoin due to their theoretical ability to, in the future, override the cryptographic schemes that secure blockchains. While quantum computers have not yet demonstrated an ability to come anywhere close to threatening Bitcoin, BlackRock says it, along with other technological advances, could render the flagship cryptocurrency ‚Äúflawed and ineffective.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶In the past, flaws in the source code for digital assets have been exposed and exploited, including flaws that disabled some functionality for users, exposed users‚Äô personal information and/or resulted in the theft of users‚Äô digital assets. The cryptography underlying Bitcoin could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. In any of these circumstances, a malicious actor may be able to compromise the security of the Bitcoin network or take the Trust‚Äôs Bitcoin, which would adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, the functionality of the Bitcoin network may be negatively affected such that it is no longer attractive to users, thereby dampening demand for Bitcoin. Even if another digital asset other than bitcoin were affected by similar circumstances, any reduction in confidence in the source code or cryptography underlying digital assets generally could negatively affect the demand for digital assets and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, because digital assets, including bitcoin, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this prospectus.‚Äù BlacRock‚Äôs IBIT ‚Äì which is believed to be the most successful ETF of all time, currently has $70.1 billion worth of Bitcoin backing it.

2025-05-26T18:00:16.000Z,"Korean Crypto Investors: Shocking Survey Reveals Bearish FTX Payouts View","BitcoinWorld Korean Crypto Investors: Shocking Survey Reveals Bearish FTX Payouts View Are you wondering what‚Äôs driving the cryptocurrency market right now? A recent crypto survey of Korean crypto investors provides some fascinating insights, suggesting a notable shift in sentiment, particularly concerning FTX payouts and future Bitcoin price prediction . What‚Äôs the Latest on Crypto Market Sentiment Among Koreans? According to a survey conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between May 20 and 23, involving 2,000 individuals, the overall mood among Korean crypto investors appears to be cooling slightly from previous bullishness. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the breakdown of overall sentiment: Optimistic or Extremely Optimistic: 27.5% Neutral: 43.2% Fear or Extreme Fear: 29.3% While a large portion remains neutral, the nearly 30% expressing fear indicates underlying caution in the market. How Has the Bitcoin Price Prediction Changed? The survey specifically tracked weekly trends for Bitcoin price prediction . The results show a clear shift away from strong bullish expectations compared to the previous week. Here‚Äôs a comparison: Expectation This Week (May 20-23) Last Week Increase or Significantly Jump 37.6% 49.4% Stable Market 35.8% 27.3% Decline or Sharp Drop 26.7% 23.5% The percentage of investors expecting an increase dropped significantly, while those predicting a stable or declining market rose. This suggests a more cautious short-term outlook on Bitcoin price prediction among this group. Are FTX Payouts Bullish or Bearish? Korean Investors Weigh In A major point of discussion in the market has been the impact of the second phase of repayments to FTX creditors , scheduled for May 30 and expected to return over $5 billion. The survey asked respondents how this event might influence the market. The responses were mixed, but a significant majority leaned towards a neutral or negative impact: Bullish (Liquidity Boost): 26.9% Bearish (Catalyst Faded): 41.7% No Impact (Macro Factors Key): 31.4% Interestingly, the largest group (41.7%) viewed the FTX payouts as bearish. Their reasoning? They believe the positive effect of the news or the anticipation has already worn off, suggesting the market may have already priced it in or simply moved on to other concerns. Another substantial group (31.4%) felt the payouts would have no real impact, emphasizing that broader macroeconomic factors are the primary drivers of the market right now. What Can We Learn from This Crypto Survey ? This crypto survey highlights a few key takeaways from the perspective of Korean crypto investors : Cooling Bullishness: Short-term expectations for Bitcoin price increases have diminished compared to the previous week. Cautious Sentiment: While neutrality is common, a notable percentage of investors feel fear. FTX Payouts Are Not Seen as a Positive Catalyst: A large segment views the repayments as bearish because the market reaction is perceived to have already happened, or they simply see other factors as more important. Understanding the sentiment of groups like Korean crypto investors is crucial as they represent a significant part of the global market. Their views on events like FTX payouts and their collective Bitcoin price prediction can offer valuable insights into potential market movements and overall crypto market sentiment . Conclusion: A Shifting Tide? The latest crypto survey from Bitcoin World and Cratos suggests a nuanced picture among Korean crypto investors . While not overwhelmingly bearish across the board, there‚Äôs a clear reduction in short-term bullish expectations for Bitcoin and a dominant view that the much-discussed FTX payouts will not serve as a positive market catalyst, with many believing the impact has faded or that macro factors are more influential. This snapshot of sentiment provides a valuable perspective on the current state of the crypto market sentiment in a key region.

2025-05-26T17:34:35.000Z,"Interesting Ethereum (ETH) Price Predictions as of Late","TL;DR Numerous analysts foresee ETH gearing up for a significant move, setting price targets above $3,000. Spot ETH ETFs have attracted steady inflows, indicating strong investor sentiment. At the same time, increasing exchange netflows hint at possible short-term selling pressure. What‚Äôs Next? The price of Ethereum has risen over 40% in the past month, currently trading just north of $2,550. However, numerous market observers believe this is only the beginning of a major rally that may last in the near future . Michael van de Poppe assumed that the sub $2,400 levels observed a few weeks ago resembled ‚Äú an incredibly good buying opportunity.‚Äù He thinks ETH will start ‚Äúattacking the highs‚Äù in the short term, claiming that a breakout above $3,000 could mark the beginning of a new bull run. The X users, Sensei and Lucky, also gave their two cents. The former noted that the price has recently consolidated between $2,400 and $2,700, envisioning a move to the upside and a pump beyond $3,200. Lucky, a popular analyst with more than 2.2 million followers, revealed that ETH has been ‚Äúheavily outperforming‚Äù BTC in the current quarter. The analyst sees this momentum continuing and expects further price growth for the second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum is heavily outperforming $BTC in this quarter. This shows more money flowing into $ETH , and in my opinion, this momentum will continue, and we will see more highs in ETH, especially the low and mid caps. pic.twitter.com/DQaJ6T42kG ‚Äî Lucky (@LLuciano_BTC) May 26, 2025 For his part, Merlijn The Trader shared a chart showing that ETH inflows into accumulation wallets have surged in the past few days. ‚ÄúSomething big is coming. You don‚Äôt stack like this unless you know what‚Äôs next. And what‚Äôs next isn‚Äôt normal, it‚Äôs historic,‚Äù the analyst predicted. Known for their steady inflows and minimal outgoing transactions, accumulation wallets are closely watched by analysts and traders for signs of investor confidence and long-term positioning. Keep an Eye on These Important Factors The recent inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs suggest that ETH could indeed be on the verge of a further price upswing. SoSoValue data indicates that in the past few days, these funds have attracted more capital than they‚Äôve lost, reflecting a boost in investor confidence. In fact, the last date when netflows were negative was May 15. On the contrary, exchange netflows have been predominantly positive in the past week. This suggests that some investors have shifted from self-custody towards centralized exchanges, which increases the immediate selling pressure.

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at $2,545 on Monday, hovering around this level for the past few days. This price is about 7% below its monthly high. There are signs that large investors expect Ethereum to rebound in the coming months. On-chain data shows that the supply of ETH held by whales has been rising steadily. These addresses now hold 103.5 million ETH, up from 102 million on March 1, an increase of nearly 1.5%, a bullish leading indicator.

Solana ( SOL ) has a TVL of $22.48 billion, while BSC has $9.3 billion. Ethereum ETFs are also seeing inflows. SoSoValue data show that they have had inflows in the last six days, bringing the cumulative inflows to $2.76 billion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Ethereum has rallied from April‚Äôs low of $1,382 to its current price of $2,547. It has formed a bullish flag pattern, consisting of a strong vertical rally followed by a period of consolidation. ETH is currently trading between the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels. A golden cross, a bullish signal, appears imminent as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages approach a crossover. Additionally, ETH is holding just above the key support/resistance pivot level of the Murrey Math Lines tool, reinforcing the bullish structure. If Ethereum breaks above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,730, it would confirm the bullish breakout. In that scenario, the next major target would be the psychological resistance at $3,000, an 18% gain from current levels.

While BTC captures headlines, another asset is quickly gaining ground, Mantix (MTX) . With a presale price of just $0.02 and whispers of a 100x return in 2025, Mantix is stealing the spotlight among early investors. As markets react to political shocks, BTC leads the charge, but MTX could be the breakout no one sees coming. Bitcoin hits $111K before pulling back to $107K amid tariff news Bitcoin (BTC) is once again dominating headlines after hitting an all-time high of $111,970 on May 22. This incredible milestone reflects its continued strength in this market cycle. Although a sharp dip followed, briefly pulling BTC down to $107,000, the king of crypto still holds a commanding lead over altcoins, many of which remain nearly 30% below their 2021 highs. Despite volatility, Bitcoin‚Äôs position remains solid as the market digests external geopolitical signals. Source: x.com One of the key drivers behind BTC‚Äôs recent surge, and its subsequent dip, has been President Trump‚Äôs bold trade move . His announcement on TruthSocial about implementing a 50% tariff on European Union imports sparked fresh fears of a looming trade war. While such statements have shaken traditional markets and triggered some short-term instability in crypto, they‚Äôve also reinforced Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a macro hedge in times of global economic uncertainty. Similar tariff threats earlier this year sent BTC below $76,000, but each recovery since has shown the market‚Äôs growing resilience. Now sitting near $110,000 again, Bitcoin is proving it's thriving. Traders join Mantix for passive income through revenue sharing While Bitcoin dominates headlines with its $110K milestone in the wake of Trump‚Äôs bold tariff stance, savvy investors are quietly locking in their positions on what could be the next major crypto explosion, Mantix (MTX) . This AI-powered, fully decentralized trading platform is still in presale at just $0.02, yet it's already making waves as the most exciting DeFi entry of 2025. And with the way things are shaping up, Mantix isn‚Äôt just riding market momentum, it‚Äôs building its own. At the core of Mantix is a next-gen trading engine powered by AI algorithms that do more than just follow trends; they anticipate them. These intelligent systems analyze massive datasets in real time, identifying high-probability moves and executing them through flawless smart contracts. The platform‚Äôs hybrid infrastructure bridges multiple chains effortlessly, giving traders deep liquidity, lightning-fast execution and full control without the need for intermediaries. What‚Äôs pulling investors in even further is Mantix‚Äôs token model. $MTX isn‚Äôt just a utility token. It‚Äôs a revenue-sharing asset. Holders earn a cut of the platform‚Äôs fees based on their holdings, offering a passive income stream in addition to capital appreciation. That‚Äôs a powerful incentive given the evolving demands of the crypto market. With community-driven governance, enterprise-level security and a product already turning heads, Mantix is more than a promising altcoin. It‚Äôs a serious contender for the next 100x breakout. While Bitcoin continues to lead the macro charge, Mantix is quickly becoming the altcoin most likely to steal the spotlight.

Musk has been getting money transfer licenses in states across the country since he bought Twitter and changed its name to X. X to become the US WeChat Industry leaders have been adding financial services to social media platforms for a long time. Nearly ten years ago, Meta made Facebook Marketplace, a place where people could buy and sell things. While TikTok has a Shop, it also has a Creator Rewards program that lets artists make money. However, the new thing about X Money is that it lets you make quick payments from the app. TikTok says that payments made through PayPal are usually handled in 72 hours. Musk has said in the past that he wants people to do all of their banking on his platform and that one day, ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt need a bank account.‚Äù Visa said earlier this year that it would be the first company to work with X Money. Through the agreement, users would be able to safely send money to X from their checking account or debit card. Not to say that there are no competitors. There are a lot of players in the market for mobile payment apps. Millions of people use them regularly. However, X Money is the most tightly linked mix of money and social media the US market will see. This is a popular pairing in other parts of the world; Tencent‚Äôs WeChat is a good example of the service. X Money LLC is now registered with money transmitter licenses in 40 states plus the District of Columbia. It is also registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Joanne Kumire, lead banking and payments analyst at GlobalData, said in emailed comments, ‚ÄúAcquiring money transmitter licenses, leveraging Visa‚Äôs support, and tapping into X‚Äôs existing user base create a strong foundation However, the challenge lies in turning potential into action. To succeed, X will need to address trust concerns, offer compelling reasons for users to switch, and deliver a seamless, innovative payment experience.‚Äù The odds that Musk will allow crypto transitions While working with DOGE, Musk said that he wanted to put the US Treasury on a blockchain. This is the technology that Bitcoin and other crypto coins are based on. Musk is a huge fan of c rypto and especially the Doge memecoin. Also, earlier this year, Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, said that payments would be coming to the social media platform in 2025. This led to a lot of wild speculation that the platform might use or support bitcoin, crypto, or dollar-pegged stablecoins that use crypto technology to make transactions faster and cheaper. In the meantime, the crypto market is doing extremely well, with the biggest coin (BTC) managing to maintain above $100k. On the other hand, the dollar has been affected by the uncertainties that have come with Trump‚Äôs administration. This has led to the US states approving of the strategic Bitcoin reserve.

The capital raise, which is said to combine an equity raise and convertible bond offering, could be announced at this week's Bitcoin 2025 event held in Las Vegas, according to the report. The news comes as a growing roster of public firms are adding cryptocurrencies, predominantly bitcoin BTC, to their balance sheets, taking a page from Michael Saylor-helmed Strategy's (MSTR) increasingly popular playbook. The software firm has become the world's largest corporate holder of the leading crypto asset, accumulating over $62 billion in BTC in its treasury by financing the purchases via a combination of equity and debt issuances. Trump Media shared plans earlier this year to launch a financial services platform focusing on crypto and customized exchange-traded funds.

2025-05-26T17:00:16.000Z,"Massive US Spot BTC ETF Inflows Hit $2.75B, Signaling Strong Demand","BitcoinWorld Massive US Spot BTC ETF Inflows Hit $2.75B, Signaling Strong Demand Are you tracking the latest moves in the crypto market? If so, you won‚Äôt want to miss this. US spot BTC ETFs just had a week that turned heads, attracting a substantial $2.75 billion in combined net inflows. This isn‚Äôt just a casual uptick; according to data compiled by SoSoValue, this figure marks the third-largest weekly inflow recorded since these investment vehicles launched. It‚Äôs a clear indicator of robust interest, particularly from institutional players looking for regulated exposure to the leading digital asset. What‚Äôs Behind the Surge in Bitcoin ETF Inflows ? The $2.75 billion figure for US spot BTC ETFs is significant for several reasons. Firstly, its sheer size demonstrates a high level of capital allocation into the Bitcoin space through these regulated products. This level of inflow suggests sustained demand, potentially driven by: Increasing Institutional Confidence: Traditional finance institutions, wealth managers, and hedge funds are becoming more comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin via familiar ETF structures. Macroeconomic Factors: Uncertainties in traditional markets, inflation concerns, and the search for uncorrelated assets can drive interest in Bitcoin. Market Momentum: Positive price action often attracts further investment, creating a virtuous cycle of inflows and price appreciation. Ease of Access: Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a simple and regulated way for a broad range of investors to gain exposure to BTC price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This inflow volume, ranking as the third-largest weekly total, underscores the growing maturity and acceptance of Bitcoin as an investable asset class within the traditional financial system. It highlights that the initial wave of post-launch excitement hasn‚Äôt entirely subsided and that significant capital continues to flow into these products during favorable market conditions. A Look at Ethereum ETF Inflows While Bitcoin dominates the headlines, other digital assets are also seeing interest through similar regulated products. During the same period, US spot Ethereum (ETH) ETFs also recorded positive net inflows, totaling $248.31 million. Although this figure is considerably smaller than the Bitcoin ETF inflows, it is noteworthy, especially considering the relative market cap difference between ETH and BTC and the newer status of spot ETH ETFs compared to their BTC counterparts. The positive inflows into Ethereum ETF inflows suggest: Diversification within Crypto: Investors are not solely focused on Bitcoin but are also exploring other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum through regulated channels. Growing Interest in the Ethereum Ecosystem: Ethereum‚Äôs role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts makes it an attractive asset for those betting on the broader Web3 ecosystem. Anticipation of Future Developments: Positive sentiment surrounding potential future upgrades or increased utility for the Ethereum network could be driving investment. Comparing the two, the scale of Bitcoin ETF inflows clearly dwarfs that of Ethereum ETFs for the week. This reflects Bitcoin‚Äôs status as the primary gateway asset for institutional crypto investment and its longer history and larger market presence. However, the positive inflows for ETH ETFs indicate a broadening appetite for regulated crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin. Decoding the Latest Crypto ETF Trends Observing the consistent, and at times massive, inflows into US spot BTC ETFs and the emerging inflows into ETH ETFs provides valuable insights into current market dynamics. These flows are often seen as a proxy for institutional and traditional investor sentiment towards the crypto asset class. Key trends highlighted by this data include: Institutional Accumulation: The significant volumes suggest that institutional players are actively accumulating Bitcoin and, to a lesser extent, Ethereum through these accessible products. This is a stark contrast to earlier cycles where retail investors primarily drove price action. Market Liquidity and Depth: ETF inflows contribute to increased liquidity and depth in the underlying spot markets as issuers purchase BTC and ETH to back the ETF shares. Validation of the Asset Class: The willingness of large investment firms and their clients to invest through regulated ETFs provides further validation for Bitcoin and Ethereum as legitimate asset classes. Impact on Price Discovery: While not the sole driver, consistent large inflows can exert upward pressure on prices due to the constant buying demand created by ETF issuers. What Does This Mean for Institutional Crypto Investment ? The sustained interest, exemplified by the $2.75 billion week for US spot BTC ETFs , solidifies the narrative that institutional crypto investment is not a fleeting trend but a growing component of modern portfolio allocation. These ETFs act as a bridge, allowing institutions bound by mandates or regulatory hurdles that prevent direct crypto holdings to gain exposure. The implications for institutional crypto investment are profound: Increased Market Stability: As more institutional capital enters the market, it can potentially lead to greater stability compared to purely retail-driven cycles. Further Product Development: The success of BTC and ETH ETFs may pave the way for similar products tracking other digital assets, expanding the regulated investment landscape. Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: The operation of these ETFs requires significant regulatory oversight, potentially leading to clearer guidelines for the broader crypto market over time. While the picture is overwhelmingly positive regarding inflows, it‚Äôs important to remember that markets are dynamic. Outflows can occur due to profit-taking, changes in sentiment, or broader economic shifts. However, the current trend suggests a strong underlying demand from sophisticated investors. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite the impressive inflows, the market for US spot BTC ETFs and ETH ETFs is not without its challenges. Volatility remains a characteristic of the crypto market, meaning the value of these ETFs can fluctuate significantly. Regulatory landscapes can also shift, potentially impacting the products or the underlying assets. Competition among ETF providers is also high, leading to fee pressures. Looking ahead, the sustainability of these inflow levels will depend on various factors, including global economic conditions, further regulatory developments, and the continued performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the strong start and significant capital attracted so far paint a bullish picture for the integration of crypto assets into traditional investment portfolios. Summary: A Watershed Moment for Crypto ETFs The past week‚Äôs performance of US spot BTC ETFs , pulling in $2.75 billion and marking the third-largest weekly inflow ever, is a powerful testament to the growing acceptance and demand for Bitcoin among traditional investors. Coupled with positive inflows into US spot Ethereum ETFs, these figures highlight robust Crypto ETF trends and underscore the increasing importance of Institutional crypto investment in shaping the market. While challenges remain, the trajectory suggests a continued path towards mainstream adoption through regulated investment vehicles.

2025-05-26T16:55:35.000Z,"Public Companies Could Hoard As Much as $259,395,600,000 in Bitcoin by End of 2026, According to Bitwise","Crypto asset manager Bitwise says publicly traded companies are increasingly investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ) as the flagship cryptocurrency transitions from a speculative investment to a more strategic corporate asset. In a new report, Bitwise says c orporate Bitcoin holders grew their collective holdings from 394,131 to 786,857 BTC over a six-month period from November 15th, 2024 to May 15th, 2025. The increase amounts to 392,726 BTC, which is equivalent to 196,363 BTC acquired per quarter. Using the data, Bitwise projected the amount of Bitcoin that public companies will likely accumulate over the next six quarters through the end of 2026. The model suggests that corporate investors will likely buy 98,181 BTC per quarter if Bitcoin adoption slows by half. Companies will purchase 196,363 BTC per quarter if the pace remains the same and 392,726 BTC per quarter if the adoption rate doubles, as per the model. In the bull case scenario, public companies can hoard as much as 2.356 million BTC, which represents 11.22% of the total Bitcoin supply, or $259.395 billion based on Bitcoin‚Äôs current price of $110,100. The anticipated inflows in the bear and base case scenarios are 589,000 BTC and 1.178 million BTC, respectively. Say Bitwise analysts, ‚ÄúCollectively, these developments signal a new era of Bitcoin adoption in which public companies not only hold Bitcoin but design business models around it. Pioneered by Michael Saylor, the ‚ÄòBitcoin Standard‚Äô corporate playbook of reorienting excess cash into Bitcoin purchases and using a company‚Äôs capital structure to fund additional Bitcoin acquisition is becoming a repeatable model. As more companies adopt the Bitcoin Standard, it reinforces Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a corporate treasury asset and educates equity investors on its utility ‚Äì driving broader institutional acceptance.‚Äù Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In an X post on May 26, the firm said the project is building financial infrastructure around BTC-collateralized lending, stablecoin USDa, savings products, and credit services, showing there is interest in Bitcoin-powered DeFi. https://twitter.com/yzilabs/status/1927000818680541674?s=61 USDa: Powering a Bitcoin-Backed Financial Ecosystem At the core of Avalon‚Äôs ecosystem is USDa, a Bitcoin-backed stablecoin that allows users to borrow, earn yield, and transact without selling their BTC. The firm has over $500 million in total value locked (TVL). USDa is the second-largest collateralized debt position (CDP) project tracked by DeFiLlama. The platform goes beyond stablecoins to include BTC-backed lending, yield-bearing savings accounts, and a Bitcoin-collateralized credit card, managing more than 20,000 BTC. Scaling Toward Regulation and Institutional Growth Avalon‚Äôs journey began in Season 8 of the Most Valuable Builder (MVB) accelerator‚Äîrun in partnership with BNB Chain, CoinMarketCap, and YZi Labs.

2025-05-26T16:50:47.000Z,"Bitcoin 2025: Trump Sons‚Äô Attendance Signals Political Shift","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin 2025: Trump Sons‚Äô Attendance Signals Political Shift The intersection of politics and cryptocurrency continues to heat up, and a recent announcement from the organizers of the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas is making waves. It‚Äôs been revealed that none other than Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., sons of former President Donald Trump, are slated to attend the highly anticipated event. This news underscores the growing mainstream and political interest in digital assets, particularly Bitcoin. For many in the crypto community, seeing prominent political figures like the Trump Sons engaging directly with the space is a significant development, signaling potential shifts in how cryptocurrency is perceived and potentially regulated in the future. What is the Bitcoin 2025 Conference? The Bitcoin Conference series is widely regarded as one of the premier gatherings for the Bitcoin community globally. It brings together enthusiasts, developers, investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers to discuss the latest trends, innovations, and challenges facing the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. Held annually, the conference serves as a major platform for: Networking and forging connections within the industry. Learning about new technologies and projects built on Bitcoin. Hearing from influential figures and thought leaders. Debating the future direction of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem. Showcasing new products and services. Hosting the event in Las Vegas Conference venues adds a layer of excitement and accessibility, attracting a diverse crowd from various backgrounds interested in the potential of decentralized finance and digital scarcity. Why Are the Trump Sons Attending? The attendance of Eric and Donald Trump Jr. is particularly noteworthy given their father‚Äôs evolving stance on cryptocurrency. While initially skeptical, former President Trump has recently shown increased openness, even launching NFT collections and accepting crypto donations for his campaign. Their presence at a major Crypto Conference like Bitcoin 2025 can be interpreted in several ways: Political Outreach: It provides an opportunity to connect directly with the passionate and increasingly influential crypto voter base. Signaling Interest: It sends a clear message that the Trump family, and potentially a future administration, is paying attention to the crypto space. Exploring Opportunities: They may be looking to understand the technology and market dynamics better, potentially for personal or business interests. Following the Trend: As crypto becomes more mainstream, engaging with it is becoming a standard part of political and business discourse. Their participation elevates the political profile of the event and highlights how deeply intertwined Bitcoin Politics is becoming with national discourse. Beyond the Trumps: A Diverse Crypto Conference Lineup While the Trump sons‚Äô attendance has captured headlines, the reported speaker lineup for Bitcoin 2025 is diverse and includes figures from various corners of the political and crypto worlds, as noted by Bitcoin Magazine on X. This includes: U.S. Vice President JD Vance: Represents current high-level political engagement with tech and economic issues. Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht: A controversial figure from Bitcoin‚Äôs early history, his inclusion sparks debate and highlights discussions around freedom and regulation. Strategy founder Michael Saylor: A prominent corporate Bitcoin advocate and investor. Senator Cynthia Lummis: A well-known pro-Bitcoin voice in the U.S. Senate, active in legislative efforts. This mix of speakers suggests the conference will cover a wide range of topics, from mainstream adoption and investment to regulatory challenges and the philosophical underpinnings of Bitcoin. Navigating Bitcoin Politics : What It Means The presence of political figures at events like Bitcoin 2025 is a clear indicator that Bitcoin Politics is no longer a fringe topic. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, so does its potential impact on the economy, finance, and individual liberties. This necessitates engagement from policymakers. The benefits of political engagement for the crypto community include: Increased awareness and education among lawmakers. Potential for clearer and more favorable regulatory frameworks. Legitimization of the industry in the eyes of the public. However, challenges also exist: Risk of unfavorable regulation driven by misunderstanding or special interests. Potential for political polarization to impact policy. Navigating complex and sometimes conflicting government perspectives. The discussions at the Las Vegas Conference will likely touch upon these critical issues, offering attendees insight into the potential future landscape. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts For those interested in Bitcoin and the broader crypto space, the news about the Bitcoin 2025 conference and its high-profile attendees offers several takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow news related to the conference and the speakers. Understand the different perspectives being discussed. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in conversations online and in your community about the importance of sound crypto policy. Understand the Political Landscape: Learn about where candidates and policymakers stand on crypto issues. Advocate for Clarity: Support efforts to create clear, sensible regulations that foster innovation while protecting consumers. The attendance of figures like the Trump Sons highlights that now is a crucial time for the crypto community to be informed and engaged. Summary: A New Era for the Crypto Conference Scene The announcement that Eric and Donald Trump Jr. will attend Bitcoin 2025 in Las Vegas is more than just a celebrity appearance; it‚Äôs a powerful symbol of cryptocurrency‚Äôs increasing relevance in mainstream politics and society. Alongside a diverse lineup of speakers from finance, technology, and government, their presence signals a critical juncture where the future of Bitcoin and crypto may be shaped not just by technological innovation, but by political will and policy decisions. The upcoming Las Vegas Conference promises to be a focal point for these discussions, offering valuable insights into the evolving relationship between digital assets and the corridors of power.

As Bitcoin ( BTC ) quietly slips further into the grip of institutions, one asset manager has gone from newcomer to near-mythical status, now chasing only Bitcoin‚Äôs anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto . BlackRock ‚Äòs iShares Bitcoin Trust (or simply known by its ticker IBIT) debuted in January 2024 and has rapidly established itself as a dominant institutional vehicle for BTC exposure since then. As of May 26, the trust holds over 621,000 BTC, valued at around $64.5 billion, representing roughly 2.96% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total capped supply of 21 million coins, according to data from BitBo. Bitcoin holdings by BlackRock and others | Source: BitBo However, when factoring in estimates that suggest up to 20% of all Bitcoin may be lost or inaccessible due to forgotten keys or lost wallets, BlackRock‚Äôs stake could represent well over 3.5% of the effective circulating supply, bringing it closer to Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs legendary 1.1 million BTC trove. For comparison, Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy holds 580,250 BTC, while crypto exchange Binance has 534,471 BTC, per Coinglass. You might also like: Abu Dhabi wealth fund Mubadala invests $408.5M in Bitcoin via BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT ETF This pace of accumulation is not merely a statistical footnote, it signals a deeper structural shift in the role of Bitcoin in global portfolios. BlackRock now holds more BTC than longstanding corporate holders such as Strategy or Binance. The trend is evidence that Bitcoin is no longer just a speculative asset or a hedge against fiat, it is increasingly a core allocation in institutional investment strategies. Asymmetric upside In a commentary to crypto.news, MEXC chief operating officer Tracy Jin said the sharp pivot by many corporations integrating BTC into their long-term investment strategies ‚Äúis fundamentally reshaping Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúwhat was once a retail-driven market and highly cyclical asset has become a cornerstone in institutional finance.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis investor behaviour dynamics highlights that most institutions are less focused on short-term market volatility and have eyes on Bitcoin‚Äôs potential asymmetric upside and long-term value proposition.‚Äù Tracy Jin The data supports this shift: U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $2.75 billion in inflows last week as Bitcoin broke past its January all-time high of $109,000. That figure marks more than a 4-fold increase from the $608 million recorded the previous week. With sovereign debt burdens flashing red in economies like the U.S. and Japan, and bond yields climbing to multi-decade highs, traditional safe-haven assets are losing their appeal. As Jin explained, the change ‚Äúis not a flight from risk ‚Äî it‚Äôs a flight from the old model of risk.‚Äù ‚ÄúBond yields in the U.S. and Japan are surging, sovereign debt burdens are flashing red, and even the last remaining AAA credit badge is gone. For decades, Treasurys were the safe haven during turbulent times. Today, capital is running from them.‚Äù Tracy Jin $140,000 by the end of summer The rise of regulated Bitcoin products appears to be encouraging capital allocators, who may be beginning to view BTC less as a speculative fringe asset and more as a potentially neutral, transparent, and increasingly liquid store of value. Unlike previous bull markets, often fueled by retail hype and meme-driven enthusiasm, the current rally seems to be supported by longer-term positioning and more measured institutional inflows. ‚ÄúInstitutional momentum tends to be very self-reinforcing, and as more corporations announce Bitcoin allocations, others are incentivized to follow suit to remain competitive. With Bitcoin ETFs recording a $25 billion weekly trading volume and $2.75 billion inflows last week, institutional momentum remains resilient despite the macroeconomic headwinds.‚Äù Tracy Jin This institutional wave is not without volatility, however. Analysts caution that while the bullish structure remains intact, Bitcoin must defend key support zones. Jin sees the $94,000 level as a critical downside threshold, while a break above $112,000 could push BTC towards $140,000 by the end of summer. In her view, dips are now seen as ‚Äústrategic entry points rather than capitulation signs,‚Äù a huge contrast to previous cycles. As Bitcoin‚Äôs narrative shifts from rebellion to resilience, BlackRock‚Äôs growing presence in the market serves as a clear signal that the line between traditional finance and crypto is blurring fast. While Nakamoto‚Äôs holdings remain untouched and symbolic, BlackRock‚Äôs wallet is very real and getting heavier.

Bitcoin has risen for seven consecutive weeks, and if buyers can extend the streak to eight weeks, it clears the path for further upside. Crypto analyst and trader Carpe Noctom said in a post on X that Bitcoin has only seen three instances of eight consecutive weekly positive closes, and every time, Bitcoin has been higher in the following 6 and 12 month time period.Institutional investors sense a long-term opportunity and, hence, have continued to pump money into Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). CoinShares reported on May 26 that Bitcoin ETPs witnessed $2.9 billion in inflows last week, which is a quarter of the total inflows for 2024.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Although most analysts remain bullish over the long term, some are warning of a possible short-term pullback in Bitcoin. CryptoQuant contributor Crazzyblockk wrote in a QuickTake blog post that the data shows buyer exhaustion and increasing volatility, which could start a short-term correction toward $105,000.¬†Could buyers catapult Bitcoin to a new all-time high, pulling altcoins higher? Let‚Äôs analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.S&P 500 Index price predictionThe S&P 500 Index (SPX) turned down from 5,968 and reached the 20-day exponential moving average (5,759).SPX daily chart.

A break and close below the 20-day EMA could tempt short-term buyers to book profits. That could sink the pair to the psychologically crucial $100,000 level, where buyers are expected to mount a strong defense.Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned up from the 20-day EMA ($2,425) on May 25, indicating solid demand at lower levels.¬†ETH/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-26T15:15:00.000Z,"BlackRock issues rare warning: Is Bitcoin‚Äôs future at risk from quantum tech?","BlackRock Bitcoin warning              In a rare move, BlackRock has quietly added a new line to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) filing ‚Äî and it is turning heads. The update, submitted in early May 2025, flags quantum computing as a potential risk to Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term security.The filing specifically warns that if quantum tech advances far enough, it could break the cryptographic systems that secure Bitcoin.¬†In their words, it could ‚Äúundermine the viability‚Äù of the cryptographic algorithms used not just in digital assets but across the global tech stack.It‚Äôs the first time you‚Äôve seen the world‚Äôs largest asset manager call out this threat so directly in a Bitcoin-related disclosure, and it says a lot about how seriously institutional players are starting to take future-proofing crypto.Yes, exchange-traded fund (ETF) risk disclosures tend to be exhaustive by nature. But the fact that quantum computing made the cut (alongside more common concerns like volatility and regulatory shifts) suggests it‚Äôs no longer just a hypothetical issue in the eyes of big finance.For investors, this signals two things: first, that Bitcoin isn‚Äôt immune to emerging tech threats, and second, that institutional players like BlackRock are actively weighing those risks as they build long-term strategies in crypto.¬†The message is clear: If the industry wants to stay ahead, preparing for a post-quantum world can‚Äôt wait.Did you know? As of early 2025, BlackRock manages over $11.6 trillion in assets, making it the largest asset manager globally. To put that in perspective, BlackRock‚Äôs assets under management exceed the combined GDP of Germany and France.                  Bitcoin quantum risk: Is it real?              Quantum computers work differently from the laptops and servers we use today. Instead of crunching numbers one at a time, they can process huge numbers of possibilities at once. That makes them incredibly powerful ‚Äî especially when it comes to cracking codes.Bitcoin‚Äôs security relies on two major cryptographic systems: SHA-256 and ECDSA. In plain terms, these are the tools that secure your Bitcoin address and make sure only you can authorize transactions. They‚Äôve worked flawlessly for years, but quantum computers could change that.Here‚Äôs the worry: A powerful enough quantum computer might be able to reverse-engineer your private key from your public address, especially during that short window after you‚Äôve broadcast a transaction but before it‚Äôs confirmed on the blockchain. If that ever became possible, someone could hijack your transaction and steal your coins.That sounds dramatic, but it‚Äôs not an immediate threat. Most researchers agree they‚Äôre still at least 10-20 years away from quantum machines that could actually pull this off. The tech just isn‚Äôt there yet ‚Äî not at the scale or stability needed to break Bitcoin‚Äôs cryptography.Still, the warning signs are flashing. Roughly a quarter of existing Bitcoin (BTC) sits in older wallet formats that could be more vulnerable if quantum leaps happen faster than expected. And even if the timeline is long, the crypto community knows it has to act early. Work is already underway on post-quantum cryptography, which is a security system that could stand up to the next generation of computing.Did you know? Quantum computers can, in theory, solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. For instance, Google‚Äôs Sycamore processor completed a specific task in 200 seconds, whereas it would take even the most advanced classical supercomputers approximately 10,000 years to finish.                  Is Bitcoin safe from quantum computing?              While quantum computing still feels like a future problem, the crypto industry is already gearing up for it, and the efforts underway are more serious than most people realize.What Bitcoin‚Äôs doing (and not doing yet)Changing the protocol behind a blockchain is never simple; you need broad consensus, careful testing and a long lead time. But that hasn‚Äôt stopped developers from floating ideas regarding Bitcoin.One of the most talked-about proposals is something called QRAMP, the Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol. The idea is to push users to move their coins from older, potentially vulnerable wallet formats into addresses protected by newer, quantum-safe algorithms. It would require a hard fork, so it‚Äôs no small lift, but it‚Äôs a serious plan to future-proof the network before a so-called ‚ÄúQ-Day‚Äù sneaks up.Who‚Äôs already ahead?Some blockchains aren‚Äôt waiting around. Algorand, for example, has already integrated Falcon, a post-quantum digital signature algorithm that‚Äôs been officially vetted by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That means transactions on Algorand are already being backed by encryption that could hold up even if quantum machines go live tomorrow.The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is another big one. It was built from day one with this threat in mind, using XMSS (a hash-based signature scheme) instead of traditional cryptography. It‚Äôs not a major player in market cap terms, but it‚Äôs one of the most advanced projects in terms of pure security design.Why it‚Äôs not easyOf course, none of this is simple to implement. Quantum-safe cryptography often comes with trade-offs. Algorithms like Falcon are compact and efficient, but they still require more computing resources than traditional ones.¬†Moreover, switching everyone ‚Äî miners, exchanges, wallet apps and individual users ‚Äî to a new cryptographic standard could be a logistical nightmare unless it‚Äôs planned years in advance.Plus, there‚Äôs a delicate balance to strike. Move too soon, and you risk breaking things or relying on tech that isn‚Äôt battle-tested. Wait too long, and you‚Äôre exposed.¬†That‚Äôs why many in the space are eyeing a 10-to-20-year window as a rough estimate for when quantum computing becomes a real threat. But even then, nobody wants to be the last to prepare.                  Bitcoin‚Äôs future and quantum computing              If there‚Äôs one lesson from quantum conversation so far, it‚Äôs this: Being early matters. When it comes to tech that could one day rewrite the rules of digital security, waiting around just isn‚Äôt an option.So, what does preparation look like?For developers, it starts with testing and integrating quantum-resistant algorithms into existing systems. Some are already experimenting with ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù approaches, using both traditional and post-quantum cryptography side by side, so networks aren‚Äôt caught off guard if (or when) Q-Day arrives.For crypto businesses ‚Äî exchanges, custodians and wallet providers ‚Äî the job is twofold: Make sure your infrastructure is future-proof, and make sure your users know what‚Äôs coming. Education and UX will play a huge role here. Migrating keys and updating protocols isn‚Äôt something the average holder can or should do alone.And then there‚Äôs the regulatory side ‚Äî maybe not the most exciting part of crypto, but an absolutely critical one in this context.You are already seeing movement: The NIST finalized several post-quantum cryptographic standards in 2024.

2025-05-26T15:00:00.000Z,"AI needs better human data, not bigger models","Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at SapienAI is a paper tiger without human expertise in data management and training practices. Despite massive growth projections, AI innovations won‚Äôt be relevant if they continue training models based on poor-quality data.¬†Besides improving data standards, AI models need human intervention for contextual understanding and critical thinking to ensure ethical AI development and correct output generation.AI has a ‚Äúbad data‚Äù problemHumans have nuanced awareness. They draw on their experiences to make inferences and logical decisions. AI models are, however, only as good as their training data.An AI model‚Äôs accuracy doesn‚Äôt entirely depend on the underlying algorithms‚Äô technical sophistication or the amount of data processed. Instead, accurate AI performance depends on trustworthy, high-quality data during training and analytical performance tests.Bad data has multifold ramifications for training AI models: It generates prejudiced output and hallucinations from faulty logic, leading to lost time in retraining AI models to unlearn bad habits, thereby increasing company costs.Biased and statistically underrepresented data disproportionately amplifies flaws and skewed outcomes in AI systems, especially in healthcare and security surveillance.For example, an Innocence Project report lists multiple cases of misidentification, with a former Detroit police chief admitting that relying solely on AI-based facial recognition would lead to 96% misidentifications. Moreover, according to a Harvard Medical School report, an AI model used across US health systems prioritized healthier white patients over sicker black patients.¬†AI models follow the ‚ÄúGarbage In, Garbage Out‚Äù (GIGO) concept, as flawed and biased data inputs, or ‚Äúgarbage,‚Äù generate poor-quality outputs. Bad input data creates operational inefficiencies as project teams face delays and higher costs in cleaning data sets before resuming model training.Beyond their operational effect, AI models trained on low-quality data erode the trust and confidence of companies in deploying them, causing irreparable reputational damage. According to a research paper, hallucination rates for GPT-3.5 were at 39.6%, stressing the need for additional validation by researchers.Such reputational damages have far-reaching consequences because it becomes difficult to get investments and affects the model‚Äôs market positioning. In a CIO Network Summit, 21% of America‚Äôs top IT leaders expressed a lack of reliability as the most pressing concern for not using AI.Poor data for training AI models devalues projects and causes enormous economic losses to companies. On average, incomplete and low-quality AI training data results in misinformed decision-making that costs companies 6% of their annual revenue.Recent: Cheaper, faster, riskier ‚Äî The rise of DeepSeek and its security concernsPoor-quality training data affects AI innovation and model training, so searching for alternative solutions is essential.The bad data problem has forced AI companies to redirect scientists toward preparing data. Almost 67% of data scientists spend their time preparing correct data sets to prevent misinformation delivery from AI models.AI/ML models may struggle to keep up with relevant output unless specialists ‚Äî real humans with proper credentials ‚Äî work to refine them. This demonstrates the need for human experts to guide AI‚Äôs development by ensuring high-quality curated data for training AI¬†models.Human frontier data is keyElon Musk recently said, ‚ÄúThe cumulative sum of human knowledge has been exhausted in AI training.‚Äù Nothing could be farther from the truth since human frontier data is the key to driving stronger, more reliable and unbiased AI models.Musk‚Äôs dismissal of human knowledge is a call to use artificially produced synthetic data for fine-tuning AI model training. Unlike humans, however, synthetic data lacks real-world experiences and has historically failed to make ethical judgments.Human expertise ensures meticulous data review and validation to maintain an AI model‚Äôs consistency, accuracy and reliability. Humans evaluate, assess and interpret a model‚Äôs output to identify biases or mistakes and ensure they align with societal values and ethical standards.Moreover, human intelligence offers unique perspectives during data preparation by bringing contextual reference, common sense and logical reasoning to data interpretation. This helps to resolve ambiguous results, understand nuances, and solve problems for high-complexity AI model training.The symbiotic relationship between artificial and human intelligence is crucial to harnessing AI‚Äôs potential as a transformative technology without causing societal harm. A collaborative approach between man and machine helps unlock human intuition and creativity to build new AI algorithms and architectures for the public good.Decentralized networks could be the missing piece to finally solidify this relationship at a global scale.Companies lose time and resources when they have weak AI models that require constant refinement from staff data scientists and engineers. Using decentralized human intervention, companies can reduce costs and increase efficiency by distributing the evaluation process across a global network of data trainers and contributors.Decentralized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) makes AI model training a collaborative venture. Everyday users and domain specialists can contribute to training and receive financial incentives for accurate annotation, labeling, category segmentation and classification.A blockchain-based decentralized mechanism automates compensation as contributors receive rewards based on quantifiable AI model improvements rather than rigid quotas or benchmarks. Further, decentralized RLHF democratizes data and model training by involving people from diverse backgrounds, reducing structural bias, and enhancing general intelligence.According to a Gartner survey, companies will abandon over 60% of AI projects by 2026 due to the unavailability of AI-ready data. Therefore, human aptitude and competence are crucial for preparing AI training data if the industry wants to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.Data infrastructure for AI model training requires continuous improvement based on new and emerging data and use cases. Humans can ensure organizations maintain an AI-ready database through constant metadata management, observability and governance.Without human supervision, enterprises will fumble with the massive volume of data siloed across cloud and offshore data storage. Companies must adopt a ‚Äúhuman-in-the-loop‚Äù approach to fine-tune data sets for building high-quality, performant and relevant AI models.Opinion by: Rowan Stone, CEO at Sapien.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

These include the legalization of spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the easing of banking rules that currently restrict fiat-to-crypto trading to just five platforms.The June 3 vote is slated to come around two years early, triggered by the impeachment of former president Yoon Suk-yeol after his controversial declaration of martial law in late 2024. Though quickly overturned by lawmakers, the abrupt power grab led to a political crisis and his eventual removal from office.Yoon‚Äôs 2022 campaign leaned heavily on promises to reform crypto regulations ‚Äî largely aimed at younger voters. This time, the political focus on digital assets has only intensified, as older generations begin to pour significant wealth into digital assets.Three leading presidential candidates have promised pro-crypto policies.Presidential election debate clash on stablecoinsThis election has three leading candidates, and all of them have promised to advance the local crypto economy.Lee Jae-myung of the opposing Democratic Party lost to Yoon in the last election and returns with a second crypto-friendly campaign.Kim Moon-soo is running under the current ruling party, the People Power Party (PPP). Former president Yoon has distanced himself from the PPP ahead of the election, leaving Kim to define a new direction for the fractured conservative base.Lee Jun-seok was once the youngest-ever leader of the PPP. He is now leading his own newly formed Reform Party, a minor party he founded in January 2024 after splitting with the ruling bloc.‚ÄúThe political sphere has actively embraced [cryptocurrencies] as a key campaign agenda,‚Äù Park Sung-jun, head of the Blockchain Research Center at Dongguk University, told Cointelegraph.‚ÄúDriven by the transition to a digital economy, the push for transparency in political funding, the spread of blockchain-based political participation technologies and growing demands for investor protection, [crypto] has emerged as a significant economic, social and political issue in South Korea.‚ÄùLee Jae-myung and Kim have both pledged to ease strict banking rules that require crypto exchanges to partner with licensed banks to offer fiat services ‚Äî a system that has created a near-monopoly of just five approved platforms. The structure in place excludes corporate participation, as it requires users to open accounts at partner banks using their legal identities.Lee has also proposed launching a stablecoin pegged to the won to reduce reliance on tokens issued abroad.Related: South Korean crypto emerges from failed coup into crackdown seasonLee Jun-seok pushed back, noting that South Korea once had a won-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, TerraKRW (KRT), part of the Terra ecosystem that suffered a multibillion-dollar collapse.‚ÄúLee Jae-myung proposes launching another stablecoin without presenting any safeguards. What assets will back it? How will market risks be handled? How will we avoid repeating past failures? There are no answers,‚Äù Lee Jun-seok said in a Facebook post, criticizing his opponent for turning stablecoins into a ‚Äúslogan.‚ÄùThe two candidates clashed again on stablecoins during a live debate, where Lee Jae-myung argued for the safety of centralized and fiat-backed stablecoins.Presidential candidates quiz each other on the difference between USDT and USDC. Source: National Election Broadcasting Debate CommissionLee Jae-myung was Yoon‚Äôs opponent in the 2022 election when he also championed crypto-friendly policies. However, he was less aggressive than Yoon, who made several pro-crypto pledges. Some of them, like lifting bans on play-to-earn (P2E) gaming and initial coin offerings, were never implemented.Lee Jun-seok reportedly called gaming South Korea‚Äôs ‚Äúsecond semiconductor industry,‚Äù which made up more than a fifth of the country‚Äôs total exports in 2024. He pledged to target 10% of the global gaming market through regulatory support in taxation, exports and talent development. He added that regulations that dismiss blockchain-based P2E games accelerate the exodus of creative industries.P2E games remain banned under local regulations, but interest has recently surged among investors following the launch of a new title by Nexon, one of South Korea‚Äôs biggest game developers, along with a new cryptocurrency tied to its in-game economy.Nexon shares have soared since the company launched its own crypto.

2025-05-26T13:59:11.000Z,"10 red flags that scream ‚Äòfake airdrop,‚Äô and how to avoid them","Key takeawaysIn 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams targeting Hamster Kombat, Wall Street Pepe and others led to millions in user losses, contributing to over $9.9 billion in global crypto scam damages.Fake airdrops impersonate legitimate projects, tricking users into revealing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying upfront fees that lead to irreversible crypto theft.Warning signs include no official announcement, suspicious URLs, requests for private keys, grammar errors and unrealistic reward promises.Future airdrops are shifting toward activity-based, retroactive and AI-monitored models that reward genuine user engagement while reducing exploitation.While cryptocurrency airdrops are a legitimate way for projects to gain publicity and users, scammers exploit this hype, draining wallets through fake campaigns. In 2024 and 2025, fake airdrop scams around projects like Hamster Kombat and Wall Street Peepe cost victims millions. According to Chainalysis, the global estimated losses in 2024 from cryptocurrency scams and fraud, which included fake airdrops, amounted to at least $9.9 billion.¬†Spotting red flags is crucial to staying safe from fake airdrops. This article explores key warning signs and practical tips to protect your funds.¬†What are fake airdrops?Airdrops are a common practice of distributing free tokens in the crypto world as part of marketing campaigns, user acquisition efforts, or community-building exercises. Legitimate airdrops reward early takers, increase token visibility, or promote network activity. Getting airdrops requires minimal effort, like signing up, joining a community or holding a specific token.However, the popularity of airdrops has also drawn scammers. They exploit user greed and curiosity by promising free tokens (fake airdrops) in exchange for sensitive actions such as sharing private keys, signing malicious contracts or paying gas fees. Fraudsters may impersonate real projects using spoofed domains or fake social media accounts.These scams often look convincing, and even experienced users can fall victim. This is the reason consistent vigilance is required when you are getting airdrops.¬†Did you know? In 2023, Inferno Drainer helped scammers steal over $80 million through airdrop phishing campaigns. Operating as a ‚Äúdrainer-as-a-service,‚Äù it lets affiliates use prebuilt kits to run scam airdrop sites, targeting wallets across several blockchains.Key red flags that expose ‚Äòfake airdrops‚ÄôBefore you connect for an airdrop, learn to spot the warning signs. These red flags are your first line of defense against losing your crypto or sensitive information to scammers:1. No official announcement from verified channelsWhat to watch for: A major warning sign of a fake airdrop is the lack of any announcement on the project‚Äôs official communication channels. Scammers often use unsolicited direct messages, unofficial Telegram groups or poorly crafted websites mimicking legitimate ones to promote fake airdrops.How to avoid: Always verify the legitimacy of an airdrop by checking the project‚Äôs official website, verified X account or official Discord/Telegram channels before clicking any links. If the airdrop isn‚Äôt mentioned there, keep away from it.2. Request for private key or seed phraseWhat to watch for: A critical red flag of a fake airdrop is a request to ‚Äúverify‚Äù your wallet by providing your private key or seed phrase. These scams deceive users into surrendering complete control of their crypto wallets by posing as eligibility checks. Once shared, scammers can immediately steal all assets.How to avoid: Genuine airdrops never ask for your private key or recovery phrase, which should always remain confidential. If anyone or any website requests these, it is a clear scam. Exit the page immediately.3. Upfront gas fees or crypto paymentsWhat to watch for: A significant warning sign of a fake airdrop is that it requires upfront gas fees or cryptocurrency payments to ‚Äúunlock‚Äù tokens. Scammers often insist you send Ether (ETH) or other coins to claim rewards, but after the payment, the promised tokens never materialize, and your funds are lost.How to avoid: Legitimate airdrops are free, typically involving only simple tasks like connecting a wallet or completing minor actions. If an airdrop demands any payment, it is likely to be a scam. Never send funds to unfamiliar addresses.4. Suspicious URLs or clone sitesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops frequently employ phishing websites resembling legitimate crypto platforms. These sites aim to deceive users into connecting wallets and signing fraudulent transactions.How to avoid: You need to carefully check a project‚Äôs URL before executing any transaction on it. There will likely be subtle differences, such as misspellings, extra characters or alternate domain extensions.Did you know? Some airdrops use retroactive criteria, rewarding users based on past activity. This encourages organic participation before the airdrop announcement, so simply using DApps naturally could make you eligible for future free tokens.5. Poor grammar and urgent languageWhat to watch for: Many fake airdrops feature poor grammar, spelling errors or aggressive phrases like ‚ÄúClaim Now Or Lose Out!‚Äù or ‚ÄúFinal Chance For Free Tokens!‚Äù These tactics aim to create panic, rushing users into clicking malicious links without careful thought. Sloppy writing and intense urgency are clear signs of a scam.How to avoid: Legitimate crypto projects communicate professionally and clearly. If an airdrop announcement contains errors or uses high-pressure, time-sensitive language, steer clear.¬†6. Fake social proof or bot commentsWhat to watch for: Scammers frequently use fake airdrop posts filled with fabricated social proof, such as comments like ‚ÄúI just got 500 $XYZ!‚Äù or ‚ÄúTotally legit!‚Äù These are often posted by bots or fake accounts to create a false sense of trust and encourage participation. They might also use fake or hacked celebrity accounts to disseminate false information regarding airdrops.How to avoid: Avoid trusting social media comments alone to determine an airdrop‚Äôs legitimacy. Research the token thoroughly, confirm its presence on reputable platforms, and seek authentic user feedback on forums like Reddit or trusted crypto Discord groups. Genuine projects maintain transparent communities, not just artificial hype.7. Unknown or nonexistent token projectsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops promote tokens tied to obscure or nonexistent projects, which might lack a white paper, roadmap, official website or verifiable team. Scammers use these fabricated tokens to trick users into connecting wallets or approving transactions that result in stolen funds.How to avoid: Always research a token extensively before participating in an airdrop. Check for a white paper, official website, team credentials and active community presence. If the project lacks basic details or appears suspiciously new with no credible background, it is likely fraudulent.8. Token approval trapsWhat to watch for: Certain fake airdrops entice users to connect their wallets and grant token spending permissions. These seemingly harmless ‚Äúapproval‚Äù requests can allow scammers to freely transfer or drain your tokens without further interaction, exploiting the granted permissions.How to avoid: Exercise caution when approving token transactions, particularly from unfamiliar sources. Avoid authorizing smart contract interactions on untrusted websites. Regularly use tools like revoke cash to check and cancel unnecessary token approvals.9. Redirects to malicious wallet drainersWhat to watch for: Some fake airdrop links redirect users to malicious DApps known as wallet drainers. These sites are designed to resemble legitimate claim pages but execute malicious smart contracts once a wallet is connected. By clicking ‚Äúclaim airdrop,‚Äù users unknowingly sign transactions that give scammers full access to their funds.How to avoid: Always review transaction pop-ups carefully before signing. Use browser wallets like MetaMask with built-in phishing protection and stay updated on known scam domains. If a site looks unfamiliar or triggers unexpected approvals, disconnect immediately.¬†10. Unrealistic reward promisesWhat to watch for: Fake airdrops often attract users with unrealistic promises, such as ‚ÄúInstantly claim $2,000 in free tokens!‚Äù with no effort required. These offers exploit greed and curiosity, luring users into connecting wallets or signing transactions without proper scrutiny.How to avoid: Be suspicious of extravagant claims. Genuine airdrops usually provide modest rewards and have certain eligibility criteria. If an offer appears too good to be true, it is likely to be fraudulent.Did you know? In 2021, the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) gave governance tokens via an airdrop to anyone who had registered a .eth name. Many ENS holders received thousands of dollars just for owning a crypto domain name.Examples of fake airdropsHere are some examples of well-known fake airdrops to help you understand how these fraudulent actions scam unsuspecting victims:Hamster KombatHamster Kombat is a Telegram-based tap-to-earn game where players manage a virtual crypto exchange as a hamster CEO. By tapping, completing daily tasks and upgrading, players earn HMSTR coins, which are convertible to tradable tokens. Launched in March 2024, it attracted over 250 million users, but scams targeting players have raised concerns.Malicious actors targeted Hamster Kombat to profit from the tap-to-earn game‚Äôs viral popularity. Kaspersky warned users about fake Hamster Kombat airdrops, meant to steal victims‚Äô crypto wallet credentials.Wall Street PepeWall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is an Ethereum-based memecoin that combines meme culture with practical trading utilities. Inspired by the Pepe meme and Wall Street trading, $WEPE provides small traders with unique market insights, strategic analysis and a supportive community.The $WEPE airdrop scam mimicked the legitimate token's website. It lured users with promises of an airdrop and prompted them to connect their digital wallets, inadvertently signing malicious contracts that drained their assets.HEXHEX is a token built on Ethereum to help users capitalize on cryptocurrency market growth through a system that supports coin locking and staking for fixed durations.¬†The fraudulent webpage replicated the official HEX site. The airdrop on this counterfeit site was fake and unrelated to the genuine HEX project or other initiatives. When a crypto wallet was linked to the deceptive site, it activated a malicious contract that enabled the cryptocurrency drainer to steal funds.SuiSui (SUI) is a layer-1 blockchain and smart-contract platform engineered for speed, privacy and accessibility, featuring a distinctive object-centric data model.When users checked airdrop eligibility on the fraudulent webpage posted by the scammers, they were prompted to link their digital wallets. This action unwittingly signed a malicious contract, enabling the cryptocurrency drainer. Consequently, their funds were automatically transferred to wallets controlled by scammers through seamless, unauthorized transactions.LayerZeroThe LayerZero airdrop implemented a novel \""proof-of-donation\"" claiming system. Instead of distributing $ZRO tokens for free, as typical airdrops do, LayerZero required users to donate $0.10 per token to the Protocol Guild, which supports Ethereum‚Äôs core developers.In July 2023, security firm CertiK cautioned users to be careful about fake airdrops being promoted on X by accounts impersonating Layer Zero. When users clicked on the links, they were sent to a website that resembled the official LayerZero website.How crypto airdrops are evolving from freebies to secure community rewardsCrypto airdrops are advancing beyond basic token giveaways, adopting more advanced and secure approaches to engage users. Projects increasingly implement activity-based airdrops, rewarding users for contributions like staking, testing apps or engaging in governance. This shift seeks to promote authentic community involvement and prevent exploitative tactics.¬†Novel distribution models such as snapshot-based allocations and retroactive rewards are gaining traction. These approaches enhance transparency and ensure tokens reach active community contributors. Integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning improves fraud detection and strengthens airdrop security by helping detect bots, fake wallets and fraudulent behavior, making airdrops more secure and resistant to exploitation.This transformation reflects the evolution of responsible, effective token distribution practices that align with decentralization and community empowerment goals.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

They are an essential tool to quickly assess price movements and market trends in the short term.¬†They represent Bitcoin‚Äôs price trends on a chart over a specific period, such as one hour, four hours or one day, to help traders make better decisions.Why use candlesticks?¬†They help traders visualize price movements over time.They help identify bullish, bearish or consolidation sentiment.They help spot patterns like reversals or continuations to predict future price movements.A candlestick represents four key price points:The opening price at the start of the periodThe closing price at the end of the periodThe highest price reached during the periodThe lowest price reached during the period.A candlestick is formed of a body, the bulky part between the open and close prices.¬†It is green when the price goes up in a bullish move, and the closing price is higher than the opening price. It is red when the closing price is lower than the opening price, so the price is in a bearish movement as it goes down.The body size shows strong buying and selling pressure when it‚Äôs long. It indicates uncertainty when it‚Äôs short.¬†A candlestick also has wicks, or shadows. They are thin lines above and below the body that indicate the highest or lowest prices the asset hit during the relevant trading frame.Here‚Äôs a useful example that may help you understand it better. Suppose you‚Äôre analyzing the four-hour chart using candlesticks, and Bitcoin‚Äôs opening price is $90,000. The closing price is $93,500, with a high of $95,000 and a low of $88,700.¬†In this instance, the candlestick will appear as a green body from $90,000 to $93,500. An upper wick hitting $95,000 and a lower wick dipping to $88,700.Advantages of Bitcoin candlestick chart¬†Bitcoin candlestick charts offer several advantages, including:Candlestick charts offer you a quick view of market sentiment and price movement. They show if the market is positive or negative and how strong that feeling is.¬†You can pick different timeframes based on your trading style, whether you‚Äôre a day trader, swing trader or long-term investor.For example, the one-minute chart works well for scalping, while the daily chart is better for long-term investors.¬†As crypto markets are open 24 hours a day, the open and close prices reflect the start and end of the chosen timeframe.Introduction to advanced crypto charting techniques to trade BTCCandlesticks are a great way to start trading Bitcoin. They give you a quick look at market trends and help predict price movements. Once you know the basic charts and skills, you can explore advanced techniques. For example, using moving averages can help you make better investing decisions.Here are some of the best tools Bitcoin traders use to leverage technical analysis, volume and market psychology. These strategies give traders an edge in the ever-changing crypto market.1. Fibonacci retracement¬†Fibonacci retracement is a technical analysis tool used to spot potential support and resistance levels, as well as price targets.¬†To use this method, draw lines connecting a major high and low on the chart. Then, calculate retracement levels using Fibonacci ratios like 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%. You can use the Fibonacci retracement for confirmation when paired with trendlines or moving averages.¬†2. Volume profileVolume profile is another tool for technical analysis. It shows trading volume for price instead of time. Knowing where trading happens most helps traders spot key price levels. These levels often create strong support and resistance zones.¬†3. Elliot Wave TheoryThe Elliott Wave theory is a prediction model of price movements based on market psychology and wave patterns. According to the theory, the market moves in trends of five waves, followed by three waves of correction, with each wave reflecting trader sentiment.4. Other indicatorsThe relative strength index (RSI) is one of the most common charting indicators. It measures the strength of Bitcoin‚Äôs upward and downward price movements over time.The simple moving average (SMA) indicates the average price of an asset over time, which can help you understand Bitcoin‚Äôs overall price movement.¬†The exponential moving average (EMA) is a better alternative to the SMA for identifying short-term trends. Like the SMA, the EMA shows you the average price of an asset over time, but the EMA focuses more on recent days.Caution! Reading Bitcoin candlesticks or any other charts is a great first step toward understanding market behavior, but remember charts don‚Äôt guarantee outcomes. Always combine technical insights with risk management, and never trade more than you can afford to lose.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break ‚Äî Here‚Äôs why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury‚Äôs traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin‚Äôs price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply ‚Äî a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government‚Äôs last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% ‚Äî its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%.¬†US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a ‚Äúhigher for longer‚Äù rate environment.¬†Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren‚Äôt done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks ‚Äî a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999.¬†On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country‚Äôs parliament that his debt-strapped government‚Äôs position was ‚Äúworse than Greece‚Äù ‚Äî a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn‚Äôt matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan ‚Äúnormalizes‚Äù interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on.¬†What‚Äôs more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold‚Äôs $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin‚Äôs once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what‚Äôs to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn‚Äôt the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein‚Äôs contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization‚Äôs transformative potential.Real estate represents the world‚Äôs largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn‚Äôt suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that ‚Äúgood systems‚Äù already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today‚Äôs real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren‚Äôt minor flaws. They‚Äôre systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts‚Äô ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says ‚Äúthe onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,‚Äù he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it‚Äôs meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not ‚Äútranslate well‚Äù to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain‚Äôs revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not ‚Äútranslate well‚Äù isn‚Äôt the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow‚Äôs infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn‚Äôt an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn‚Äôt just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We‚Äôre witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn‚Äôt center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what‚Äôs being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today‚Äôs skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto‚Äôs next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it‚Äôs not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent‚Äôs behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents‚Äô security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it‚Äôs pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model‚Äôs internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents ‚Äî which are systems built on top of models ‚Äî that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto‚ÄúAI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,‚Äù co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist ‚ÄúMonster Z‚Äù told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIn contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model‚Äôs interaction phase.‚Äù¬†‚ÄúPersonally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,‚Äù he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users.¬†However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks ‚Äî a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it‚Äôs an urgent issue.

This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and ‚Äî worst of all ‚Äî silent data leaks,‚Äù he added.¬†Securing the AI layer before it‚Äôs too lateBuild fast, break things ‚Äî then get hacked. That‚Äôs the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto‚Äôs high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That‚Äôs according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.‚ÄúWhen you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it‚Äôs in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,‚Äù she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot difficult‚Äù to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just ‚Äútedious and time consuming‚Äù ‚Äî a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated.¬†The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World‚Äôs biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman‚Äôs World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project‚Äôs biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.‚ÄúDecentralization isn‚Äôt just a technical architecture,‚Äù Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World‚Äôs biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.‚ÄùEl Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World‚Äôs reliance on custom hardware ‚Äî the Orb ‚Äî and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.‚ÄúThis is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,‚Äù he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. ‚ÄúWorld does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,‚Äù they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the ‚Äúiris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.‚Äù The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so ‚Äúno personal data is stored.‚ÄùWorld‚Äôs disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co‚Äìfounder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World‚Äôs biometric model is not ‚Äúinherently incompatible‚Äù with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman‚Äôs World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI‚Äôs large-scale scraping of ‚Äúunconsented user data‚Äù and World‚Äôs collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.‚ÄúThe irony here is hard to miss,‚Äù El Damaty claimed. ‚ÄúOpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.‚ÄùIn 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World‚Äôs user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. ‚ÄúPeople in developing nations, who World‚Ä¶ has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don‚Äôt understand the risks involved with ‚Äòselling‚Äô this personal data,‚Äù El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on¬†World‚Äôs operations since its¬†launch in July 2023, with governments like¬†Germany, Kenya and¬†Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users‚Äô biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company¬†faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‚ÄòHumans can tell when it‚Äôs a human‚Äô ‚Äî Community mocks Worldcoin‚Äôs Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World‚Äôs gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.‚ÄúWhen biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,‚Äù said El Damaty. ‚ÄúThose willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access‚Ä¶ while those who refuse‚Ä¶ are excluded.‚ÄùWorld maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. ‚ÄúYou can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,‚Äù it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool ‚Äî especially in authoritarian regimes ‚Äî by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is ‚Äúopen source, permissionless,‚Äù and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user‚Äôs activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization ‚Äî highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper ‚Äî critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.‚ÄúWe need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,‚Äù said El Damaty. ‚ÄúThis means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.‚ÄùRelated: Sam Altman‚Äôs eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn‚Äôt without merit.

She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats‚Äîfrom misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.‚ÄúThis is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,‚Äù McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‚Äòfixer‚Äô rumors: Hodler‚Äôs Digest, May 18 ‚Äì 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion).

US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise‚Äôs forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value.

This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences.

It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion ‚Äî 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community ‚Äî analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined ‚Äî and misused ‚Äî those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as ‚Äúsuspicious.‚Äù That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay ‚Äî but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it‚Äîor risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world‚Äôs most elite stock indexes ‚Äî a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival.¬†But this attainment is not about one company alone.¬†‚ÄúThis is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it‚Äôs a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,‚Äù said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn‚Äôt just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. ‚ÄúIt cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,‚Äù she told Cointelegraph.¬†Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of ‚Äúthe most iconic benchmark index‚Äù in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, ‚Äúbecause whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.‚Äù Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500.¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,‚Äù Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC.¬†‚ÄúThis normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets‚Äù and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University‚Äôs Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIt does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.‚Äù¬†Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a ‚Äúcompromise of passwords or private keys‚Äù that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that ‚Äúindex funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,‚Äù Habibi told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúThis means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.‚Äù¬†$10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase‚Äôs way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting ‚Äî a share that Habibi thinks reasonable ‚Äî it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase‚Äôs inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms ‚Äî e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks ‚Äî to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. ‚ÄúCrypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,‚Äù Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúI think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.‚ÄùA convergence of economies?Others disagree. ‚ÄúWe have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,‚Äù Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIt is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not quite at full convergence, but we‚Äôre definitely past the separation phase,‚Äù opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital‚Äôs listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase‚Äôs role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. ‚ÄúRegulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,‚Äù said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers‚Äô Sosnick. ‚ÄúConvergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.‚Äù¬†Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan‚Äôs Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq‚Äôs digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal‚Äôs launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.‚ÄúThese examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,‚Äù Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not.¬†A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. ‚ÄúGalaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,‚Äù said Kennard. ‚ÄúMarathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.‚Äù¬†Lau didn‚Äôt expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, ‚ÄúI would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry ‚Äî in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.‚ÄùStrategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it‚Äôs struggling to meet the index‚Äôs earnings requirements. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see MSTR making the cut,‚Äù said Kim.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure who would be next ‚Äî even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,‚Äù Kim continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we‚Äôll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm ‚Äî i.e., one that started as a crypto firm ‚Äî enter the index.‚ÄùTime will tell, but for now, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,‚Äù concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

The 60-40 portfolio hasn‚Äôt delivered consistent returns in a long time.‚ÄùHe attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership.
