Lewis says BTC Inc. will demonstrate Bitcoin‚Äôs real-world utility at the event BTC Inc. CFO Didier Lewis said Bitcoin 2025 will be an opportunity for his company and the community to demonstrate Bitcoin‚Äôs real-world functionality as a medium of exchange.

The store will offer a wide selection of Bitcoin-related merchandise, including hardware wallets, books, apparel, and limited-edition art. All items will be available at a 21% discount when paid for using Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. BTC Inc.

2025-05-26T07:40:08.000Z,"Why Are There Still People Who Don‚Äôt Believe in Bitcoin Despite Its Growth?","While Bitcoin was once seen as a mysterious technology preferred only by those looking to purchase illegal goods on the dark web, today it has entered the radar of many institutional investors, from Wall Street giants to the US government. Despite all these developments, skepticism towards BTC has not completely disappeared. Heavyweights of traditional finance such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and investment legend Warren Buffett continue to criticize Bitcoin. Adam Back, one of the pioneers of the cryptocurrency world and Blockstream CEO, evaluated this situation in an interview and stated that the ongoing skepticism towards Bitcoin is not only specific to the financial community, and that even some names in the technology world have difficulty understanding Bitcoin. Let's also remind you that there are some claims that Adam Back is the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Back categorically denies these claims. Back is the founder of the proof of work concept on which Bitcoin is based. Related News: Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken Chooses This Altcoin for Tokenized US Stocks, a First of Its Kind ‚ÄúEven people who know things like encryption, peer-to-peer networks, privacy, and public-key cryptography can still be indifferent. It's really surprising,‚Äù Back said, describing the indifference of some of the early cypherpunk community to Bitcoin as ‚Äúcrazy.‚Äù According to Back, the fact that Bitcoin is not a physical asset may cause some people to be distrustful. However, Back believes that these criticisms are misplaced, as Bitcoin is based on physical resources such as energy and mining equipment. With only 21 million units to be produced in total, Bitcoin's limited supply makes it a real inflation hedge, according to many advocates. Even Bitcoin's code structure can sometimes be a subject of questioning. In a statement he made in 2023, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon raised the question, ‚ÄúEveryone says it's limited to 21 million, but how can that be guaranteed?‚Äù Dimon also described Bitcoin as a ‚Äúhyped scam.‚Äù However, it is also known that JPMorgan actively uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin. Reminding that Bitcoin was born after the 2008 global financial crisis and that its first block included a newspaper headline about the bank rescue operations of the period, Back stated that those who were happy with the system had difficulty understanding Bitcoin. ‚ÄúIf you have a well-paying job, are climbing the career ladder, life doesn't seem expensive to you and you can pay the mortgage; the promises of Bitcoin probably won't mean anything to you,‚Äù Back said, adding that Bitcoin offers an alternative to the current order by its nature. *This is not investment advice.

At this point, Trump, who made a customs tax announcement against the EU last Friday, caused a decline in Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins. Related News: What Caused the Sudden Drop in Bitcoin? Will the Trump Effect Continue in the Market? Trump stated that the ongoing customs duty negotiations with the European Union were not progressing as desired and proposed a 50% customs duty on all EU imports starting from June 1, 2025. There was a new development in EU customs duties after the weekend, and Trump announced that after his meeting with European Commission President Von Der Leyen, he agreed to extend the implementation date of the 50% customs duty on EU goods from June 1 to July 9, 2025. Von der Leyen stated that tax negotiations with the US would begin immediately. ‚ÄúToday I received a call from the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, requesting an extension of the 1 June deadline for the 50% Tariff on Trade and the European Union.

Risky trader James Wynn also joined the game with a 10X leveraged long position. PEPE, one of the first influential meme tokens, is making a return. In the past week, the asset almost behaved as legacy blue chip assets. PEPE recovered to $0.000014, near its higher range for the past month. For the last 24 hours, PEPE was even more volatile, moving by a few percents for the past day. PEPE gained over 9% net in the past week, with signs of a larger rally. Short squeeze drives PEPE traders to take risk PEPE shows an accumulation of high-leverage short positions, with Binance one of the key markets. More than 23% of PEPE activity is concentrated on Binance, with high-leverage short liquidity up to $0.000016. PEPE may see a short squeeze, as exchanges have accumulated high-leverage short positions. | Source: Coinank PEPE, like other meme tokens, has often rallied following a short squeeze. In the short term, those events are heavily traded, as PEPE volumes increased by over 42% and open interest expanded by 15% to $610M. Meme tokens also correlate highly with the BTC performance. As the leading coin recovered above $109,000, the entire meme market also turned to the green. Almost all meme assets posted gains, with the exception of Official Trump (TRUMP). TRUMP slid on ‚Äòselling the news‚Äô, after the promised crypto dinner under-delivered on expectations. However, older cult tokens and less active memes compensated the loss, with older communities showing they were still around. Risky trader James Wynn joins with long position After trading BTC with a $1B long position, trader James Wynn announced he would allocate any remaining funds in his Hyperliquid account to longing PEPE. Ok so left a milly in my perps account. Put it all on $pepe 10x leverage. Up $200k in just a few hours.

The long position is starting to get copied by the crypto community, potentially unleashing more volatility for PEPE. The risky long arrived after Wynn locked in over $25.2M from longing BTC, so he used some of the remaining funds to boost the PEPE rally. Wynn‚Äôs risky move may cause counter-trading, or further inflate PEPE in another round of exuberance. James Wynn‚Äôs long position on PEPE was in the green as the meme token recovered. | Source: Hyperliquid During the May 26 rally, at one point, Wynn‚Äôs position held $386K in unrealized gains. The potential of the position may change, as PEPE remains a highly risky token. This is not the first time Wynn has taken a risky position on Pepe. At the end of March, Wynn had another 10X position at a time when PEPE was correcting. He held onto unrealized losses of $3.36M, depositing extra collateral and partially closing the position. Other traders on Hyperliquid are also taking high-value long positions , making use of the latest market exuberance. The crypto market fluctuates between greed and extreme greed sentiment, leading to a proliferation of long positions and confidence in an ongoing rally. Meme tokens also show more resilience during a market downturn, due to their relatively low volumes and enthusiasm for recovery from recent lows.

The initiative is expected to attract billions in foreign investment and generate high-skilled jobs. A new regulatory authority and global partnerships aim to position Pakistan as a leader in crypto and AI innovation. Pakistan has committed 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to fuel Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence centers, marking a bold step in its digital transformation agenda. The initiative, driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council and supported by the Ministry of Finance, aims to attract foreign investment while positioning the country as a serious player in the tech economy. In the first phase, the government will direct excess power to infrastructure supporting crypto mining and AI development, according to a May 25 report by local news outlet 24NewsHD TV Channel. Pakistan Eyes Billions in Investment from Bitcoin and AI Push Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the project is expected to bring billions in capital inflows and create high-skilled jobs nationwide. He also confirmed that foreign companies have already begun exploring partnership opportunities, with several delegations visiting in recent months. To support adoption, the Ministry of Finance has introduced tax incentives for AI firms and waived import duties for Bitcoin mining hardware. These benefits are part of a wider strategy to build confidence among investors and signal regulatory readiness. Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, called the move a ‚Äúturning point‚Äù for the nation‚Äôs digital economy. Saqib had earlier proposed the idea of utilizing untapped energy reserves for crypto mining during the Council‚Äôs March 21 meeting, attended by key regulators and government officials. He said that with proper oversight, Pakistan could emerge as a regional hub for blockchain innovation and AI development. The second phase of the plan involves integrating renewable energy into these operations, aligning with broader sustainability goals. Officials noted that this approach seeks to balance technological growth with environmental concerns. As part of the broader overhaul, the government recently endorsed the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA) . This regulatory body will oversee licensing, tokenization of national assets, and the development of decentralized finance applications. It will also play a central role in managing the monetization of excess electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining. Pakistan currently ranks ninth globally in crypto adoption, according to Chainalysis, driven largely by retail usage. Trump-Backed WLFI Signs LOI with Pakistan Crypto Council Last month, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project endorsed by the Trump family, signed a Letter of Intent (LOI) with the Pakistan Crypto Council to promote blockchain adoption and DeFi growth across Pakistan. The agreement was formalized on April 26 during a high-level meeting between WLFI co-founders Zak Folkman, Zach Witkoff, and Chase Herro, alongside Pakistan‚Äôs Prime Minister and senior government officials. The partnership aims to accelerate blockchain innovation by establishing regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain-based financial solutions. Pakistan‚Äôs Finance Ministry is taking steps toward formal cryptocurrency regulation , which could significantly change the country‚Äôs historically cautious stance on digital assets. The delegation included notable figures such as Gentry Beach Jr., a key investor who has pledged $1 billion in funding to Pakistan, along with tech entrepreneur Nikita Goldsmith, blockchain consultant Alex Malkov, and Cosmic Wire CEO Jerad Finck.

According to Polymarket , the odds of approval have climbed to 83% , up from 73% earlier this month. With Ripple‚Äôs CEO Brad Garlinghouse strongly backing ETF developments, and major financial players like Grayscale and Franklin Templeton entering the race, the crypto market is buzzing with optimism. Let‚Äôs dive into what‚Äôs happening and why it matters. XRP Spot ETF Approval Odds Surge by 10% At the start of this month, Polymarket pegged the chances of an XRP spot ETF getting approved at 73% . As of now, the odds have jumped to 83% , reflecting growing confidence from the crypto community and investors alike. This rise in probability is being driven by market momentum and rising institutional interest in XRP-backed financial products. SEC Delays XRP ETF Decisions ‚Äì Final Ruling in October? Despite the enthusiasm, the U.S. SEC has yet to approve any XRP Spot ETF application. Top firms like Bitwise , CoinShares , Grayscale , and Franklin Templeton have already filed interest. Experts say the delays are not unusual and point to October as the likely month for a decision. Given the SEC‚Äôs recent moves with Bitcoin ETFs, many expect XRP could be next in line. Brad Garlinghouse: XRP ETFs Could Unlock Institutional Capital In a recent episode of Ripple‚Äôs ‚ÄúCrypto in One Minute‚Äù podcast , CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that ETFs are a gateway for traditional investors to enter the crypto space without dealing with private keys or exchanges. He emphasized that XRP ETFs could be a safer, regulated entry point for those hesitant to engage with crypto directly. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Set the Benchmark Garlinghouse highlighted the success of Bitcoin Spot ETFs , which became one of the fastest-growing ETF classes in history. Total market cap : $130.77 Billion 24-hour trading volume : $4.7 Billion BlackRock‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF AUM : $71.42 Billion Major players in this space include BlackRock , Fidelity , ARK/21Shares , Valkyrie , and others. The success of Bitcoin ETFs suggests a similar bullish trajectory could await XRP . XRP Futures and Leveraged ETFs Show Rising Demand Beyond spot ETFs, XRP-based products are already making waves: Volatility Shares launched the first XRP Futures ETF . CME Group followed with its own XRP futures ETF this month . Tectrium rolled out a 2x Long Daily XRP ETF , catering to leveraged traders.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), says that his agency is doing its part to keep the US financially afloat as the country‚Äôs national debt continues to grow. Musk suggests that cutting costs through DOGE is not a permanent solution to the government‚Äôs excessive spending. According to the billionaire, exponential GDP growth is the only way to offset the nation‚Äôs rapidly expanding debt burden. ‚ÄúI have come to the perhaps obvious conclusion that accelerating GDP growth is essential. DOGE has and will do great work to postpone the day of bankruptcy of America, but the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.‚Äù Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appears to echo Musk‚Äôs sentiment. In a recent Fox News interview, Bessent highlights the importance of growing the US economy faster than the debt. ‚ÄúWe can both grow the economy and control the debt‚Ä¶ If we change the growth trajectory of the country, of the economy, then we will stabilize our finances and grow our way out of this.‚Äù The latest data from the Treasury Department shows that the US federal government‚Äôs debt has ballooned to $36.215 trillion, equivalent to 122% of the country‚Äôs GDP.

2025-05-26T07:00:48.000Z,"XRP Price Consolidates In Tight Bullish Compression Pattern, Why $5 Is Possible","XRP price has entered into another consolidation pattern following its break below $2.4 over the weekend. Now, this is nothing new for XRP, which has previously gone on years-long consolidations before now. Just like before, the current consolidations seems to be preceding something bigger and this move could send the altcoin soaring toward new all-time highs. XRP Price Still Holding Above Key Support In an analysis, ‚ÄúDennishhrndz‚Äù showed where the XRP price is currently sitting and the factors that are surrounding the altcoin right now. Firstly, he explains that the cryptocurrency is still trading above a long-term rising trend line. Furthermore, there is tight consolidation in a bullish compression patter, which he likened to a classic ‚Äúcoiled spring.‚Äù Related Reading: Ethereum Nears $2,800 Break-Even Zone: Why This Is Important For Rally To $3,000 Not only this, but over the last six months, the XRP price has also been putting in higher lows, a development that is bullish for the price of any cryptocurrency. Since XRP is maintaining this trend, it suggests that there is still bullish firepower despite the price decline. Add in the fact that it is still trading above a very important trendline support, XRP is showing that its uptrend is far from over. The trendline support here is sitting at $2, and with the XRP price still skirting around $2.3, it is still more than 10% away before testing this support level. Inversely, the major resistance outlined by the crypto analyst is one at the $2.7 level. This suggests a run-up before the XRP price encounters any major pushback. Other important developments to note is the fact that the RSI is now sitting in a neutral position. At a 50.88 RSI, give or take, it means that the RSI is resetting. This gives it a fresh start and a bounce board that could help it take off toward the next major level. The MACD is also seeing a bullish crossover as the momentum has been rising slowly during this time. This also follows the decline in the trading volume. Now, low trading volumes often signal bearish control but they also serve as a signal leading up to breakout patterns. When To Get In Given the developments outlined by the crypto analyst, he gives two major buy levels. The first one here is the $2 to $2.2 zone. This is where support for the XRP price lies and serves as a buy zone. Meanwhile, the second level to get in is after the break above $2.7 with strong volume, which would signal continuation. Related Reading: Technical Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Blow Off Top To $325,000 ‚Äì The Timeline Will Shock You Such a break above $2.7 would allow the XRP price to rally towards its true targets.

2025-05-26T07:00:46.000Z,"Crypto Eyes MAGACOIN FINANCE After Explosive Accumulation From New Investors","As the crypto market pivots toward its next growth phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE is seizing the spotlight with a wave of new investor accumulation. While Bitcoin, Kaspa, and Ethereum continue to anchor portfolios, the most dynamic capital is rotating into early-stage projects with higher upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE, still in presale and trading below $0.007, is now drawing unprecedented attention as analysts and traders position for what could be the next major breakout of 2025. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY ‚Äì ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum, Whale Activity, and Breakout Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE has surpassed $8 million in funding as Stage 8 nears completion , with demand accelerating rapidly. The project‚Äôs capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling intense buying interest. Notably, a recent 72.95 ETH whale buy‚Äîover $133,000‚Äîmarks the largest early-stage investment of the year, signaling strong conviction from major players. Analysts now forecast 15,000%‚Äì18,500% upside from current levels, with early buyers still able to claim a 50% bonus using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code before the $0.007 listing. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting new support zones and establishing itself as the breakout opportunity of the cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): Market Stability, Moderate Upside Bitcoin remains steady above $110,000, providing a reliable foundation for the market. While BTC‚Äôs resilience is noteworthy, its near-term growth is more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs presale surge. Kaspa (KAS): Unique Protocol, MAGA Momentum Kaspa trades around $0.089, with forecasts ranging from $0.059 to $0.119 for May. Despite its innovative GHOSTDAG protocol, Kaspa‚Äôs upside is modest next to MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs rapid accumulation and presale excitement. Ethereum (ETH): Institutional Strength, MAGA Outpaces Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, with bullish technicals but a steadier growth profile. As institutional capital flows in, ETH remains a core asset, yet its momentum is eclipsed by the velocity of MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE ‚Äì ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING Conclusion Bitcoin‚Äôs stability and Ethereum‚Äôs institutional appeal are solid, but the sharpest growth potential is now unfolding in MAGACOIN FINANCE. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 18,500% ROI, MAGA is the breakout contender for 2025.

After the tariff announcement, a temporary easing in trade tensions contributed to a recovery in digital assets. Trump extended the deadline for the proposed 50% tariffs on European imports to July 9, with U.S. and European index futures moving higher ahead of the weekly open. Cardano‚Äôs ADA and Dogecoin rose as much as 3% in the past 24 hours, leading gains among the top ten tokens. The bounce reflects broader relief across global risk assets: U.S. and European equity futures gained over 1%, the dollar weakened to multi-month lows, and demand for safe havens like gold and Treasuries dipped slightly. Over the weekend, bitcoin had plunged from above $111,000 to as low as $108,600 in response to Trump's threats of steep levies on EU goods and Apple iPhones manufactured abroad. The resulting risk-off sentiment erased over $500 million in long liquidations across the crypto market, with futures tied to bitcoin, ether ETH, Cardano's ADA, Solana's SOL, and Dogecoin {[DOGE}} all taking heavy losses. But the tone shifted early Monday. ‚ÄúOn one hand, this past weekend‚Äôs dip showed us how quickly crypto can fall from macro shocks,‚Äù said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, said in a Telegram message. ‚ÄúOn the other, the speedy extension of tariff deadlines reinforces the belief that the worst is over. Traders are cautiously accumulating again,‚Äù Mei added. Options flows suggest that optimism is creeping back in.

John Woeltz, originally from Kentucky, was arrested Friday morning after the 28-year-old victim, a visitor from Italy, managed to escape and flag down a traffic officer in the NoLIta neighborhood. According to prosecutors, Woeltz and at least one accomplice held the man captive in an eight-bedroom townhouse that Woeltz had been renting for $30,000 a month. The victim had flown to New York on May 6. What he believed would be a routine meeting quickly turned into a prolonged ordeal of violence and intimidation.

Then, they demanded the password to his Bitcoin wallet. When the man refused, the attackers bound him and beat him. They also shocked him with wires and threatened him with a gun. In one instance the men allegedly suspended the victim over a stairwell. They warned him that he would be killed if he didn‚Äôt comply. Later, they escalated the threats further by saying they would harm his family. On Friday, the man, fearing for his life, agreed to retrieve his password. He told the attackers it was stored on a laptop in another room. Then, as Woeltz turned his back, the victim seized the opportunity and fled. He ran toward a nearby traffic agent, who immediately called for help. Shortly after, officers from the Fifth Precinct arrived and took Woeltz into custody. The victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital and is reported to be in stable condition. Police Find Torture Evidence in Manhattan Townhouse A search of the townhouse uncovered disturbing evidence. Officers found Polaroid photos showing the man bound and assaulted. In addition, they recovered a firearm, cocaine, and various items including chicken wire, a saw, body armor, ammunition and night vision goggles. Meanwhile, two butlers working at the residence agreed to speak with the police. Another person, Beatrice Folchi, was also arrested and charged with kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment. The Manhattan District Attorney‚Äôs Office, however, declined to prosecute her at this time, citing the need for further investigation. Woeltz was arraigned on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court. He was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment and criminal possession of a weapon. Additionally, the judge ordered him held without bail and required him to surrender his passport. Prosecutors also noted that he has access to a private jet and a helicopter, which raised concerns about his flight risk. The incident reflects a growing wave of violent attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders and industry executives, whose digital wallets, often secured by a single password, present an attractive target. Earlier this month, armed men in central Paris attempted to abduct the daughter of a prominent crypto executive and her two-year-old child in broad daylight. As the value of Bitcoin and other digital assets has soared in recent years, so too has the incentive for criminals to sidestep sophisticated cyber defenses and instead use physical force to gain access.

2025-05-26T06:28:08.000Z,"Which is the Safe Haven Against the Weakening Dollar: Gold or Bitcoin? Goldman Sachs Reveals","Goldman Sachs has predicted that gold prices could reach $4,000 per ounce, arguing that the safest haven against a weakening dollar is gold. According to the institution, gold will overtake both Bitcoin and silver in the process. Recalling that investors have sold gold and turned to Treasury bonds when US interest rates rose for many years, Goldman Sachs commodity strategist Lina Thomas states that this relationship deteriorated after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The freezing of the assets of the Central Bank of Russia by Western financial authorities shook the belief in the dollar and euro, which were seen as safe havens. According to Thomas, this development was a warning, especially for central banks: ‚ÄúIf your assets can be frozen by foreign politicians, those assets are no longer truly risk-free.‚Äù According to Goldman Sachs‚Äô analysis, this environment of uncertainty has led central banks around the world to increase their gold purchases. Purchases, which averaged 17 tons per month before 2022, reached 22 tons after the Ukraine war and 94 tons by 2025. Major producers, especially China and Russia, have turned to gold; China aims to convert 20% of its reserves into gold. Related News: Surprise Altcoin Developers Publish List of All Assets in Their Possession: Announce Final Date for Continuing Operations Goldman Sachs says that this rapid increase in demand could push gold prices up nearly 30% to $4,000 an ounce. Gold‚Äôs low volatility and low correlation to stocks make it attractive to investors. ‚ÄúBitcoin and gold also offer inflation protection due to limited supply, but gold is a more robust choice because it is less volatile and less correlated with tech stocks,‚Äù said Daan Struyven, co-head of commodities research at the institution. Bitcoin‚Äôs link to tech stocks and its high volatility make it riskier in economic downturns, which explains why central banks are hoarding gold, not Bitcoin or silver, Struyven said. As for silver, Thomas points to three main reasons: Silver oxidizes and loses value over time, it is much bulkier and harder to transport than gold, and it is not considered a reserve asset by the IMF. ‚ÄúSilver is outside the purview of central banks; it is more of an industrial metal.‚Äù According to Goldman Sachs, the gold market is only 0.5% of the stock market, so even a small gold allocation in portfolios can create big price movements. Thomas's final message: ‚ÄúGold is no longer just a historical relic. Gold is renewing confidence in the face of the dollar, which has lost the confidence of macro investors.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

The resilience comes as traditional markets struggle with uncertainty from escalating trade disputes between major economies. While Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies experience price fluctuations, TRX's consistent performance suggests growing institutional interest in blockchain networks with practical utility and strong transaction volumes. Technical Analysis Highlights TRX established a 1.25% trading range ($0.269-$0.273) over the 24-hour period, showing notable resilience with strong buying at key support levels. Significant volume spike (120M+ units) during 09:00-11:00 hours coincided with price rallying from $0.270 to $0.273, forming a high-volume support zone. ‚Ä¢ The 23:00 hour showed renewed momentum on above-average volume, suggesting accumulation near the $0.272 resistance level. Mini-capitulation event occurred at 01:24, with TRX dropping sharply from $0.2728 to $0.2721 on high volume (2.58M units). Strong support emerged at $0.2719-$0.2720 level, with substantial buying volume (2.76M units) during 01:57-01:58 period propelling prices back toward $0.2724.

Bitcoin is holding above important levels, while altcoins are trading flat. While most investors are clueless about what‚Äôs coming, analysts see an opportunity ahead. Experts have listed some high-utility crypto projects before the next wave up. Utility Coins With Real-World Value Are Leading the Pack The focus here is on utility coins with strong fundamentals, real-world use cases, and long-term growth potential. One top pick is Artblock (ART), a project aiming to revolutionize Web3 browsing with built-in AI. It has a market cap under $100 million, and with a price under $1, it could go 20x to $20 this cycle. A possible Binance listing might also be on the cards, which would be a major catalyst. Next up is Aerodrome (AERO), the leading DEX on Coinbase‚Äôs Base chain, which is gaining serious traction. With a market cap of around $57 million, AERO can 10x or even reach two figures this cycle. ONDO: RWA Leader Working With XRP and Solana The list also includes ONDO, a real-world asset tokenization leader with growing demand in traditional finance. They‚Äôre working with XRP and are integrated with Solana as well. Ondo is a midcap with huge potential, and anything below $1 is a great entry. Analysts believe it could surge 7x and reach $6 to $10 this cycle. Other altcoins include Sei, a super-fast Layer 1 blockchain built for trading. It is currently trading at around $0.15, and can reach $1.15 or even $3 to $5 this cycle. Goldfinch (GFI), which offers loans to businesses in emerging markets using crypto in the RWA space, has a very promising chart and strong utility. PolySwarm (NCT), a cybersecurity-focused token, has great tokenomics and could surge 50x from the current price and reach $1. Pangolin (PNG), a multichain DEX that has been steadily building without much hype, is also a good investment. It could hit $3-$5 this cycle. RNDR & HBAR: Powering AI and Partnerships Lastly, Render (RNDR), which provides decentralized GPU power for 3D rendering and AI, is also in the list. The analyst expects it could reach $50 to $100 this cycle. Hedera (HBAR) is known for speed, security, and partnerships with big companies like Google and IBM. HBAR can reach $1 to $1.50 this cycle for a 5x to 7x gain. Cardano is also a solid pick and could reach $4 this cycle. Currently, Bitcoin dominance is above 54%, which means that funds are moving back into Bitcoin while altcoins lag.

2025-05-26T06:19:25.000Z,"Swedish health tech firm H100 secures $2.2m via convertible loans to buy Bitcoin","Swedish health technology company H100 Group AB has secured $2.2 million in funding led by Blockstream CEO Adam Back to expand its Bitcoin treasury holdings. According to a May 25 announcement , the Stockholm-headquartered firm raised 21 million Swedish krona (approximately $2.2 million) through 0% interest convertible loans. The funds will be used to purchase Bitcoin as part of H100‚Äôs broader pivot toward holding the asset on its balance sheet. Investment firms, including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners, contributed a combined $800,000 to the round. The largest share came from Back, a British cryptographer and known Bitcoin advocate, who invested $1.4 million. The loans are set to mature on June 15, 2028, and can be converted into equity at a rate of 1.3 SEK (about 11 US cents) per share. Under the loan terms, H100 may mandate conversion to equity if its share price maintains a volume-weighted average of 33% above the conversion rate for 60 trading days. Full conversion would issue roughly 16.15 million new shares, resulting in a 12% dilution. The latest capital raise will allow the company to purchase approximately 20.18 Bitcoin at current market rates, adding to the 4.39 Bitcoin it acquired on May 22. You might also like: Bitcoin reclaims $109K as Trump extends EU tariffs deadline to allow for talks That earlier purchase, valued at around $490,000, marked H100‚Äôs initial foray into Bitcoin and cemented its name as the first publicly listed company in Sweden to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset and one of the first in Europe. H100 shares rallied 39% after the news broke, pushing H100‚Äôs market value over $14 million. At the time, H100 said the move is part of a long-term Bitcoin treasury strategy, which aims to diversify its reserves without deviating from its core focus on health technology. Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a corporate treasury asset continues to gain momentum, with several public healthcare companies making significant acquisitions this month. On May 16, Singapore-based Basel Medical Group announced a strategic purchase agreement to acquire up to 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1 billion, by issuing ordinary shares. In the United States, KindlyMD, a provider of integrated healthcare services, secured shareholder approval for its proposed merger with Nakamoto Holdings Inc., a Bitcoin-native holding company. Meanwhile, Canadian healthcare provider SRx Health Solutions has announced plans to diversify its financial assets by purchasing Bitcoin, following a previous investment of $1.5 million in Solana tokens.

With bullish forces, it came right back above the high volume profile level, and made higher-highs and higher-lows, and it is above the 20-day EMA band and the 50-day EMA band. As of now, the hurdle is $0.85, which is its previous swing high resistance that also aligns with the falling channel‚Äôs upper border resistance. Once it clears that hurdle, then it might retest the supply level at $1.10 by May or June 2025. Also, the Cardano liquidation map over 7 days shows the strength of bullish positions increasing. The cumulative long leverage positions (marked with red color) are indicative of bulls‚Äô tremendous interest in pushing the ADA price higher in the short term. In addition, A positive 30-day MVRV indicates that, on average, DOGE holders who acquired their tokens within the last 30 days are currently in profit. Also, the 30-day active addresses had good engagement with the crypto, too. ADA Price Prediction 2025 Source: coincarp Cardano has always prioritized decentralization, and the recent Plomin hard fork has taken it a step further. Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp‚Äôs rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet‚Äôs circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. To push ADA‚Äôs price beyond the $1.10 to $1.20 range, strong retail participation will be necessary. A potential catalyst for this could be the approval of an ADA ETF , which experts believe could launch by the end of this year and attract billions in inflows.If ADA manages to sustain levels above its Q1 2025 high , there‚Äôs a solid chance it could retest the $2.05 mark by year-end.

2025-05-26T06:03:10.000Z,"TRON PRICE ANALYSIS & PREDICTION (May 26) ‚Äì TRX is Stalled Due to Latest Market Drops, Can It Breakthrough $0.28?","Amid the latest market tumoil, TRX has continued to remain calm with roughly 1% gain in the last 24 hours. However, it looks slightly bullish on the daily chart but the price seems stuck over the past two weeks. Following a slow and steady recovery in the last two months, TRX tapped the $0.28 level last week and remained stuck under this level due to a rejection. It reattempted the level this week, but failed due to the last 48 hours meltdown across the crypto space, triggered by Bitcoin‚Äôs drop. Despite that, the price remained calm while altcoins are seriously bleeding out. Looking at the price actions, the crypto appears to be gathering momentum, accumulating for a massive explosion, just like what we saw in late 2024. A breakout of this calm phase should set the market up for a serious price movement on the daily chart. In the opposite direction, it may roll over if the overall crypto market continues to bleed on the daily scale. Right now, there‚Äôs little-to-no movement in the market. But from a technical standpoint, TRX is much more likely to advance bullishly even if the price breaks down from the ongoing calm phase. It is expected to see more growth in the future. TRX‚Äôs Key Level to Watch Source: Tradingview The main barrier for the bulls right now is the $0.28 level, which now acts as resistance. A flip through it should rally us to a close resistance of $0.31 before tapping $0.35 and perhaps $0.4 and $0.45 in the future. If the $0.26 level fails to provide support, the price may roll back to $0.24. The support level to watch below it is $0.21 in case of more dips. Key Resistance Levels: $0.28, $0.31, $0.35 Key Support Levels: $0.26, $0.24, $0.21 Spot Price: $0.27 Trend: Neutral-Bullish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, if momentum fades, a pullback toward $2.00‚Äîaligned with the 200-day EMA‚Äîis likely, with $1.63 acting as the final support zone. XRP Price Prediction 2025 If XRP successfully breaks its all-time high of $3.40 in May 2025‚Äîa major supply zone on the chart‚Äîit could realistically target $5 by year-end, fueled by growing optimism from banks , institutions, and potential ETF support. Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD , is now integrated into its cross-border payments system, Ripple Payments, further strengthening its position in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is evident, with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of the circulating supply, positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap at $138 billion.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view.

The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100‚Äîor even higher‚Äîin the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The New York-listed DDC Enterprise, also known as DayDayCook, said on May 23 that it bought 21 Bitcoin ( BTC ) in exchange for 254,333 shares in a deal valued at $2.28 million. The company added it plans on buying another 79 BTC across two purchases in ‚Äúthe coming days‚Äù to bring its total Bitcoin stack to 100 BTC. The buys are part of DDC‚Äôs plan announced on May 15 to acquire 5,000 BTC over the next three years, with the goal of buying 500 BTC before the end of 2025. DDC‚Äôs planned 5,000 BTC stack, if it held that much today, would land it just outside the top 10 public companies with the largest Bitcoin holdings, putting it just behind Japanese investment firm Metaplanet, which holds 7,800 BTC, according to data from Bitbo. DDC Enterprise (DDC) shares closed the May 23 trading session down by 14.5% but rose 2.43% after the bell to $3.79, according to Google Finance. DDC is down over 27% so far this year. Shares of DDC Enterprise fell more than 14% on May 23, however, the stock recovered after the bell.

2025-05-26T05:45:33.000Z,"Early Degens Could 12X: The Best Crypto to Buy Now Includes BTFD (Presale Ends Tomorrow), Toshi, and Dogwifhat","Meme coins are more than a market movement‚Äîthey‚Äôre a mindset. A rebellion against the beige and boring of traditional finance. This article dives into three electrifying contenders currently charging the space: BTFD Coin, Dogwifhat, and Toshi. If you‚Äôre wondering what the best crypto to buy now is before the rocket launches, these three are stealing the spotlight. But make no mistake: time is running out, and for one of them, the window shuts tomorrow. Yes, BTFD Coin‚Äôs presale wraps up on May 26th, and the launch fireworks start on May 27th. Oh, and the 300% token bonus with the code LAUNCH300? It‚Äôs a degen delight. The hype is real: BTFD Coin has already raised a whopping $7.14 million, with over 12,400 coin holders and 75 billion $BTFD coins sold. It‚Äôs not just a meme coin presale‚Äîit‚Äôs a phenomenon. But below, there‚Äôs something equally spicy: the referral rewards that could change the game for smart, social investors looking to hustle their way into a 12X boom. BTFD Coin ‚Äî Referral Riches + Degenerate Dreams BTFD Coin isn‚Äôt here to play nice. It‚Äôs a meme coin presale designed for the bold‚Äîthose who buy the dip, flex the gains, and build their tribe. And now, thanks to their referral program, that tribe can make you bank. Say you connect your wallet, grab your referral code, and hustle it out. Every time someone drops $50 or more using your code, they get an extra 10% $BTFD, and if you hit the top 20 leaderboard, you rake in 10% of the coin value in BTFD tokens at month‚Äôs end. That‚Äôs passive degen income. Imagine this: you drop your code into a Discord chat or tweet it out. A friend FOMOs in with $500. They get $550 worth of $BTFD. You? You score $50 in tokens. Multiply that by a few dozen times, and you‚Äôre stacking $BTFD like a meme lord on a mission. And it gets juicier. The presale price right now is just $0.0002, but the listing is predicted at $0.0006 on May 27th. Analysts are already speculating on a breakout to $0.006 in the post-launch hype cycle. That‚Äôs a potential 2900% ROI if you slide in today. Here‚Äôs a wild-but-possible scenario: You invest $700 at the current $0.0002 rate. That bags you 3.5 million $BTFD coins. On launch day, if the token hits $0.0006, that becomes $2,100. But if it climbs to $0.006? You‚Äôre looking at $21,000. And with code LAUNCH300, you score a 300% bonus, turning your 3.5 million into 14 million tokens. That same moonshot becomes a spicy $84,000. BTFD Coin also brings the heat with a 90% APY staking system, a four-level play-to-earn game, and its iconic Bulls Squad characters leading the charge. Dogwifhat ‚Äî Whimsical Branding With Community Roots Dogwifhat, shortened to $WIF, burst onto the scene with a simple but instantly viral visual: a Shiba Inu in a knitted hat. But behind the meme is a highly mobilized Solana-based community that moves like a crypto wolfpack. The charm of Dogwifhat is in its grassroots appeal. Built with no centralized dev team pulling strings, $WIF embodies the idea of community ownership. It‚Äôs a meme coin powered by vibes and driven by relentless online energy, which is exactly what makes it the best crypto to buy now for those looking to join a self-sustaining movement. $WIF lives on Solana, making it lightning fast and cheap to transact‚Äîa bonus for those planning to HODL or swing. Toshi ‚Äî Tech Vibes With Memetic Energy Toshi brings something different to the meme coin table. While it rides the meme wave, it‚Äôs also injecting a surprising amount of technical prowess. Named after Bitcoin‚Äôs legendary creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, Toshi straddles the line between tongue-in-cheek branding and serious DeFi ambitions. With built-in community tools, clever governance systems, and unique tokenomics, Toshi‚Äôs goal isn‚Äôt just to entertain‚Äîit‚Äôs to enable. That blend of humor and utility is exactly why many believe it‚Äôs the best crypto to buy now. Toshi stands as a beacon for those who love memes but crave function. It rewards engagement, celebrates decentralization, and keeps things entertaining. For degens who want substance without sacrificing fun, Toshi‚Äôs appeal is undeniable. Conclusion: Your Shot at BTFD Glory Ends Tomorrow‚ÄîBest Crypto to Buy Now There you have it. Three meme coins. Three totally different vibes.

2025-05-26T05:45:07.000Z,"XRP Ledger Chosen By Dubai To Power Real Estate Tokenization","Dubai‚Äôs Land Department (DLD) has switched on the Middle East‚Äôs first government-backed tokenization of property title deeds, selecting the open-source XRP Ledger (XRPL) as the settlement layer for a pilot expected to reshape how domestic real-estate assets are bought, sold and financed. The live launch, developed under the DLD‚Äôs Real Estate Evolution Space Initiative (REES) and executed with tokenization specialist Ctrl Alt, synchronizes on-chain deed tokens with Dubai‚Äôs conventional land registry, creating a legally compliant bridge between the XRP Ledger and the emirate‚Äôs long-standing property system. Dubai Turns To XRP Ledger Ripple‚Äôs developer arm welcomed the choice. In a post on X, RippleX called the programme ‚Äúa massive milestone for Dubai‚Äôs real estate market,‚Äù adding that the XRPL was picked ‚Äúthanks to its decade-long reliability and stability in tokenizing and exchanging digital and real-world assets .‚Äù Ctrl Alt‚Äôs infrastructure mints fractional title tokens, each representing a direct economic interest in a registered property. The company has integrated its stack directly with DLD databases so that any on-chain transfer instantly updates the government ledger, preserving legal finality while dispensing with paper conveyancing. Matt Ong, founder and chief executive of Ctrl Alt, said the team had ‚Äúbeen working closely with the DLD ‚Ä¶ to bring real estate investment to a wider audience,‚Äù describing Dubai‚Äôs embrace of next-generation finance as ‚Äútruly world-class.‚Äù During the pilot phase, eligible UAE-ID holders can subscribe through PRYPCO Mint with a minimum ticket of AED 2,000 (about US$545). Transactions are settled in dirhams, not crypto, but ownership is recorded as bearer tokens on XRPL. The project targets cumulative fractional-deed issuance of roughly AED 60 billion ($16 billion) by 2033, equivalent to seven per cent of all property transactions forecast for that year, according to DLD projections. For policymakers, the initiative advances two headline agendas: the Real Estate Sector Strategy 2033 and the broader Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), each of which mandates digital-first reforms to attract capital and sharpen regulatory competitiveness. Oversight is distributed: DLD governs the underlying physical asset, while the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) licenses Ctrl Alt as broker-dealer and issuer, ensuring that deed tokens meet the same provenance tests as the plots they represent. XRPL‚Äôs selection gives the ledger its highest-profile government integration to date. Launched in 2012, the chain processes close to two million transactions per day, with finality in seconds and negligible network fees‚Äîfeatures DLD cited as critical for scaling fractional real-estate markets without compromising retail-grade user experience. Ctrl Alt arrives with a track record: as of 1 May 2025 the London- and Dubai-based firm had tokenized $295 million in alternative assets ranging from private credit to litigation finance. The real-estate deployment, however, places its infrastructure at the heart of an emirate whose property sector cleared more than $218 billion in deals last year, according to official statistics. While authorities bill the sandbox as a gateway to broader participation, risk warnings accompany the launch. Ctrl Alt reminds prospective investors that ‚Äúvirtual assets may lose their value in full or in part, and are subject to extreme volatility,‚Äù and that fractional deed holders do not benefit from conventional investor-protection schemes. If the pilot scales as planned, Dubai would become the world‚Äôs first jurisdiction to maintain mirror records of every property transfer on a public blockchain in real time‚Äîan architectural leap that could compress settlement cycles from weeks to minutes, widen access beyond high-net-worth buyers and generate transparent, machine-readable data streams for regulators and developers alike. For now, the ball is with early adopters: the PRYPCO Mint portal is live, the first apartments are tokenized, and every transaction settles irrevocably on XRPL‚Äôs consensus ledger‚Äîone more signal that the emirate intends to put real estate on-chain and on the map. At press time, XRP traded at $2.34.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-dubai-real-estate-tokenization/,"AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS","XRP|Dubai|ripple|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T05:44:02.000Z,"Adam Back Injects $1.4 Million into Swedish Firm Turning to BTC","The funding follows H100‚Äôs announcement to integrate Bitcoin into its corporate treasury, which made it Sweden‚Äôs first public company to do so. The capital, secured through convertible loans, will enable H100 to purchase about 20.18 Bitcoin. Meanwhile, Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor teased another Bitcoin purchase after the firm‚Äôs recent acquisition of 7,390 BTC. Additionally, Cardone Capital launched its fourth hybrid real estate and Bitcoin fund, aiming to redefine asset diversification by blending commercial property cash flow with BTC accumulation. H100 Buys Bitcoin and Secures $2.2 Million Swedish health tech company H100 Group AB secured 21 million Swedish krona (or approximately $2.2 million) in a new funding round led by Blockstream CEO and renowned Bitcoin advocate Adam Back. The funding was announced just days after H100 revealed its pivot toward adopting Bitcoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy. Adam Back personally contributed around $1.4 million to the round, with the remaining $800,000 coming from investment firms including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners. The funds were raised through interest-free convertible loans that mature in June of 2028, with investors given the option to convert their loans into equity at a rate of 1.3 Swedish krona (approximately 11 cents) per share. If H100‚Äôs stock price trades at least 33% above that conversion price for a cumulative total of 60 trading days, the company may mandate conversion, which could result in the issuance of over 16 million new shares and a potential 12% dilution. At current prices, the new capital will enable H100 to purchase about 20.18 Bitcoin, adding to the 4.39 Bitcoin it acquired on May 22. This would bring its total holdings to approximately 24.57 Bitcoin, making it the first public company in Sweden to adopt a Bitcoin treasury policy and one of the earliest adopters in Europe. The decision already impacted the market, with H100‚Äôs shares rising 37% on the day of the announcement and a further 5.33% the next day, climbing to 1.29 SEK (14 cents), according to Bloomberg data . H100‚Äôs CEO, Sander Andersen , stated that the company's mission to provide proactive health tools outside of the traditional healthcare system resonates with the values of individual sovereignty found in the Bitcoin community. The company plans to appeal to customers seeking more control over their health decisions, which is similar to the ethos that drives Bitcoin adoption. H100 now joins a growing list of companies integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET shows that 112 public firms globally hold Bitcoin, with only ten of those based in Europe. Saylor Hints at More Bitcoin Buys Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy, also recently hinted at another Bitcoin purchase by the company after the asset‚Äôs pullback from its record high of $112,000 on May 22. In a post to his followers on X, Saylor reaffirmed his conviction in Bitcoin by stating, ‚ÄùI only buy Bitcoin with money I can't afford to lose.‚Äù The statement was made shortly after Strategy‚Äôs latest acquisition of 7,390 BTC on May 19, which was valued at nearly $765 million. This brought the firm‚Äôs total holdings to 576,230 BTC. Should another buy occur on May 26, it will be Strategy‚Äôs seventh consecutive week of Bitcoin accumulation. Strategy firmly established itself as the corporate face of Bitcoin adoption, with its relentless accumulation of BTC for treasury purposes influencing an institutional trend. This sustained demand from major entities like Strategy is widely seen as a key factor supporting Bitcoin‚Äôs current valuation levels and long-term bullish outlook. Some market analysts believe Strategy‚Äôs approach could ultimately propel it into uncharted corporate territory. Jeff Walton, a financial analyst, predicted that Strategy could eventually become a $10 trillion enterprise, and could surpass all other publicly traded companies in value. Walton argued that no other firm holds as much ‚Äùpristine collateral‚Äù as Strategy does, and believes that while most companies struggle to raise capital, Strategy managed to secure billions in under two months. Instead of using that capital for traditional operational expenditures, Strategy channels it into Bitcoin, which positioned it as a high-conviction outlier in corporate finance. Saylor consistently described Bitcoin as the world‚Äôs best long-term store of value, and projected that its price could reach millions of dollars per coin over the next few decades. He sees Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply as a fundamental advantage over fiat currencies, which are subject to inflationary pressure and policy manipulation. Nonetheless, Bitcoin still faced some difficulty climbing past the $150,000 mark. Saylor attributed this stagnation to short-term profit-taking and a lack of long-term conviction among some investors. Hybrid Fund Offers Real Estate and Bitcoin Exposure Cardone Capital , a real estate investment firm managing more than $5 billion in assets, launched the 10X Miami River Bitcoin Fund. This is an innovative dual-asset fund combining a 346-unit multifamily commercial property on the Miami River in Miami, Florida, with $15 million worth of Bitcoin. It is the firm‚Äôs fourth hybrid investment vehicle blending income-generating real estate with BTC, and its goal is to redefine how investors gain exposure to both asset classes. Grant Cardone , founder and CEO of Cardone Capital, revealed that the idea for the fund was sparked by a suggestion from his brother, who asked him to consider the historical impact of converting real estate cash flow into Bitcoin over the past 12 years. After discovering that such a strategy could have turned $160 million into approximately $3 billion, Cardone was inspired to create a fund that buys real estate, adds Bitcoin to the mix, and uses the real estate‚Äôs monthly cash flows to purchase more BTC over time. (Source: Cardone Capital ) Cardone‚Äôs long-term vision is for the firm to buy $1 billion in real estate and $200 million in Bitcoin as treasury assets across its hybrid fund offerings. By merging income-producing hard assets with Bitcoin‚Äôs deflationary properties as a store of value, the firm is positioning itself as a disruptive force in the real estate investment landscape, and could potentially challenge the appeal of traditional REITs and other commercial real estate funds. Grant Cardone A core mission of these blended funds is to make Bitcoin more accessible to investors who may shy away from the asset because of its technical complexities. Cardone explained that the fund allows investors to participate in real estate‚Äîa familiar and trusted vehicle‚Äîwhile also seamlessly gaining exposure to Bitcoin, which the firm manages on their behalf. To promote adoption, Cardone Capital is exploring innovative initiatives like rewarding tenants with Satoshis for good rental behavior, which could help introduce them to Bitcoin without the need for technical knowledge. Cardone also mentioned ongoing collaborations with financial firms to develop a hybrid Bitcoin mortgage product, which could allow clients to borrow against both their Bitcoin holdings and real estate equity.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9257/adam-back-injects-1-4-million-into-swedish-firm-turning-to-btc,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T05:32:55.000Z,"Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Bull Run Window Closing Fast Grab 0.01 BTC Now","The post Robert Kiyosaki Says Bitcoin Bull Run Window Closing Fast Grab 0.01 BTC Now appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is up 1.3% in the past 24 hours, now trading above $109,000 despite global market uncertainties. Rising bond yields and political tensions have pushed institutional investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. Technically, BTC sits at a key decision point, facing resistance near $110,000 and support around $107,500. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows short-term holders beginning to exit, hinting that the current bull run may be approaching its peak. Looking at the market scenario, in a recent X post, Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki declared that Bitcoin is making it ‚Äúso easy‚Äù to get rich, yet most people still don‚Äôt see it. He pointed out that even owning just 0.01 BTC could be ‚Äúpriceless‚Äù in the next two years. Having said that, Kiyosaki is confident that Bitcoin‚Äôs window of opportunity is closing fast, and sitting on the sidelines could be the costliest mistake. I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich‚Ä¶so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years‚Ä¶. and maybe make you very rich. Sure Bitcoin goes up and down‚Ä¶.but so does real life.‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 26, 2025 Bitcoin Scarcity is Real Kiyosaki has been a longtime believer in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential . He sees it as a secure hedge against government manipulation and inflation, thanks to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. According to Kiyosaki, there are only 1 to 2 million Bitcoins left to be mined. Once those are gone, the fixed supply of 21 million will cap forever. This built-in scarcity is a key factor behind his bullish outlook. Recently, he predicted that Bitcoin could reach $250,000 this year . Referencing macro investor Raoul Pal‚Äôs theory of the ‚ÄúBanana Zone,‚Äù he believes BTC could soon enter a parabolic phase of growth fueled by tight supply and growing demand. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ETH, XRP, BNB & SOL: Which Altcoin Could Outperform in 2025? , Don‚Äôt Be a ‚ÄúYellow Banana‚Äù Several prominent analysts echo Kiyosaki‚Äôs views. Raoul Pal sees macroeconomic conditions aligning perfectly for Bitcoin‚Äôs next surge. Michael Saylor continues to push the digital gold narrative, with MicroStrategy regularly adding BTC to its balance sheet. Anthony Pompliano also predicts a long-term uptrend driven by increasing institutional involvement and limited supply. In typical Kiyosaki style, he warns against being a ‚Äúyellow banana‚Äù, his metaphor for those too afraid or unaware to act. He urges early investors to listen to experts like Raoul Pal and follow educational sources like Bitcoin Zella. As Kiyosaki puts it, this may be ‚Äúthe easiest time in history‚Äù to achieve financial freedom. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T05:04:39.000Z,"Ethereum selling pressure may rise near $2.8K level: Glassnode","Ethereum has seen a significant surge in recent weeks, rising more than 40% in the last month and reclaiming the $2,500 mark after a drop toward $1,800. But despite the bullish momentum, there are signs that the rally may be hitting a wall. The $2,800 level is emerging as a critical zone of resistance, and a closer look at on-chain and technical data suggests that selling pressure could rise as Ethereum ( ETH ) inches closer to it. According to a May 24 post by Glassnode, there‚Äôs a notable cluster of investor cost basis levels around $2,800. This means that many holders who previously bought at that level, and have been underwater for months, may now see a chance to exit at break-even. As ETH approaches this zone, those investors could add significant sell-side pressure to the market. https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1926171433639489555?s=46&t=nznXkss3debX8JIhNzHmzw Adding to the caution, sentiment in the futures market appears to be shifting. In a May 25 post , Santiment contributor ShayanMarkets noted a sharp drop in Ethereum‚Äôs Taker Buy-Sell Ratio, a metric that tracks whether aggressive market participants are leaning more toward buying or selling. The 14-day moving average for the ratio is falling, indicating that the derivatives market is being taken over by sellers. This could point to a more substantial correction if the trend continues.

The token is still trading above all significant short- and mid-term moving averages on the daily chart, an overall bullish sign. Since ETH is also trading above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, the longer-term trend appears to be healthy as well. ETH price analysis. Credit: crypto.news But there are indications that the rally is cooling.¬†Following a strong expansion earlier this month, the Bollinger Bands have begun to tighten, indicating that volatility may be easing. Ethereum is currently trading near the midline of the Bollinger Band, indicating that the market is undecided. At roughly 63.9, the relative strength index is holding steady in bullish territory, but it is no longer overbought. However, the moving average convergence divergence has begun to flatten out and just displayed a bearish crossover, which may be an early warning sign of the waning momentum. From here, two scenarios could possible play out. If the $2,800 resistance breaks convincingly, especially with the SEC‚Äôs decision on staking of Ethereum ETFs due by June 1, ETH could make a quick move toward $3,000 and beyond. Institutional demand through yield-bearing ETFs would be a powerful tailwind. However, if selling pressure builds up around $2,800, particularly from aggressive futures traders and break-even sellers, Ethereum might undergo a healthy correction and perhaps bounce back to the $2,200 support before any new leg higher. Ethereum‚Äôs upward trend is still in place for the time being, but caution is advised.

2025-05-26T05:03:39.000Z,"Bitcoin reclaims $109K as Trump extends EU tariffs deadline to allow for talks","Bitcoin rose 1.4% in the past day to trade at $109,637 on May 26 early Asian hours, as easing trade tensions between the U.S. and European Union lifted market sentiment. The modest recovery comes after a volatile week in which Bitcoin ( BTC ) briefly reached an all-time high of $111,814 on May 22 before falling to about $107,500. The asset is still up by 15% in the last 30 days. Derivatives of Bitcoin also saw an increase in market activity. Data Coinglass shows that 24-hour open interest increased 2.59% to $76.66 billion, while trading volume increased 10.85% to $89.91 billion. Rising derivatives volume and open interest usually indicate renewed trader confidence and a build -up of positions, frequently in anticipation of volatility or upward price movement. The rebound came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday, May 25, that he had agreed to extend a June 1 deadline for imposing 50% tariffs on EU goods. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had requested more time for trade talks and a new deadline has been set for July 9. ‚ÄúI received a call today from Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, requesting an extension on the June 1st deadline on the 50% Tariff with respect to Trade and the European Union. I agreed to the extension ‚Äî July 9, 2025 ‚Äî It was my privilege to do so.‚Äù ‚Äî U.S. President Donald Trump You might also like: Bitcoin bottleneck: Demand outmints supply, who‚Äôs to blame? The announcement followed a brief period of tension. Global markets were alarmed when Trump threatened to implement the 50% tariffs on May 23 if negotiations failed. For the time being, the abrupt reversal has provided some reprieve. Financial markets responded positively to the decision, with U.S. equity futures edging higher. S&P 500 futures gained 0.9%, Dow futures rose 0.8%, and Nasdaq-100 futures were up 1% in early Monday trading. Gold, meanwhile, dipped 0.3% to $3,346.59 an ounce. As risk appetite improves, the decline in gold prices points to a move away from conventional safe-havens. This change in sentiment has helped Bitcoin, which is frequently seen as a speculative risk asset. In the meantime, traders have been able to temporarily reset expectations thanks to the de-escalation, although Trump‚Äôs trade policies are still causing uncertainty in international markets. Both the cryptocurrency and traditional markets will be keeping an eye on any new developments in the U.S.-EU negotiations now that the July deadline has been set.

Institutional inflows and technical support continue to underpin BTC‚Äôs dominance, but the most dynamic capital is now rotating into early-stage projects with outsized upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly emerging as the standout in this cycle, drawing increasing attention from analysts and traders who see it as the next major breakout. Ethereum, Solana, and Toncoin remain in the conversation, but MAGA‚Äôs momentum is capturing the spotlight in smart money circles. CLICK HERE ‚Äì FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE: Early-Stage Momentum and 11,000%+ Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is setting a new standard for early-stage altcoins, with Stage 8 nearly full and over $8 million raised as demand continues to accelerate. The project‚Äôs capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are fueling a surge in both retail and institutional participation. Analysts are now projecting 35x‚Äì50x returns as a conservative baseline, with some models targeting up to 11,000%‚Äì18,500% upside if the current trajectory holds. Early buyers can still leverage the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code for a 50% bonus before the $0.007 listing, making MAGA the go-to allocation for those seeking exponential gains. As each stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is solidifying its reputation as the breakout early-stage opportunity of 2025. Ethereum (ETH): Steady Growth, MAGA Accelerates Ethereum is consolidating between $2,400 and $2,900, supported by bullish technicals and robust institutional adoption. While ETH‚Äôs long-term prospects remain strong, its near-term growth is now more measured compared to the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Solana (SOL): Bullish Structure, MAGA Outshines Solana is trading around $170, with analysts watching for a breakout above $175 to retest $183 and potentially higher.

2025-05-26T04:56:40.000Z,"Bitcoin Tops $109K as Trump Extends EU Tariff Deadline","Bitcoin rose above $109,600 on Monday, rising 1.4% after US President Donald Trump unexpectedly extended a deadline to impose steep tariffs on EU goods, easing market concerns and supporting risk assets. The surge followed Trump‚Äôs decision late Sunday to push back the potential introduction of 50% tariffs on EU imports to July 9. Just two days earlier, the president had threatened to enact the tariffs by June 1 due to slow progress in trade negotiations with the EU. Trump Tariff Delay Signals Possible Thaw in US-EU Trade Tensions The delay followed a productive call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who sought additional time to secure a favorable agreement. This de-escalation reduced fears of an imminent trade war, which had previously weighed on global markets. Last month, Trump announced an initial 20% tariff on EU goods, but soon revised it to 10% with a grace period until early July. The shifting timeline reflects the administration‚Äôs unpredictable trade strategy, which has continued to rattle global markets. However, investors welcomed the latest reprieve, viewing it as a sign of possible resolution and improved dialogue between Washington and Brussels. Market sentiment had already begun to stabilize after a volatile stretch in April, when growth fears and aggressive trade posturing prompted a broad sell-off across asset classes. Analysts say the pause in tariff escalation has helped lift appetite for risk, leading traders to rotate into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Hit ATH Above $111K on ETF Momentum and Risk-On Sentiment The move in Bitcoin is also tied to broader structural demand. Last week, the asset briefly touched a record high of $111,814 , buoyed by continued inflows from exchange-traded funds and corporate investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net weekly inflows of $2.75b between May 19 and May 23, according to data provider SoSoValue . Ethereum ETFs posted $248m in inflows during the same period, with no outflows across the board. Over the past 18 months, Bitcoin has outpaced the S&P 500 by more than 100 percentage points, cementing its role as a high-beta asset that draws capital during risk-on cycles. Investors have increasingly followed the lead of corporate buyers like MicroStrategy‚Äôs Michael Saylor, who helped normalize large-scale Bitcoin accumulation among institutions. Monday‚Äôs rally serves as a reminder of how sensitive Bitcoin remains to macroeconomic developments, particularly shifts in US trade policy. While the de-escalation offered immediate relief, market participants remain cautious, mindful of how quickly sentiment can reverse in response to the next political move.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break ‚Äî Here‚Äôs why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury‚Äôs traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin‚Äôs price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply ‚Äî a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government‚Äôs last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% ‚Äî its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%.¬†US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a ‚Äúhigher for longer‚Äù rate environment.¬†Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren‚Äôt done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks ‚Äî a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999.¬†On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country‚Äôs parliament that his debt-strapped government‚Äôs position was ‚Äúworse than Greece‚Äù ‚Äî a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn‚Äôt matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan ‚Äúnormalizes‚Äù interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on.¬†What‚Äôs more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold‚Äôs $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin‚Äôs once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what‚Äôs to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn‚Äôt the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein‚Äôs contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization‚Äôs transformative potential.Real estate represents the world‚Äôs largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn‚Äôt suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that ‚Äúgood systems‚Äù already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today‚Äôs real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren‚Äôt minor flaws. They‚Äôre systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts‚Äô ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says ‚Äúthe onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,‚Äù he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it‚Äôs meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not ‚Äútranslate well‚Äù to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain‚Äôs revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not ‚Äútranslate well‚Äù isn‚Äôt the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow‚Äôs infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn‚Äôt an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn‚Äôt just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We‚Äôre witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn‚Äôt center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what‚Äôs being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today‚Äôs skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto‚Äôs next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it‚Äôs not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent‚Äôs behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents‚Äô security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it‚Äôs pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model‚Äôs internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents ‚Äî which are systems built on top of models ‚Äî that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto‚ÄúAI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,‚Äù co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist ‚ÄúMonster Z‚Äù told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIn contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model‚Äôs interaction phase.‚Äù¬†‚ÄúPersonally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,‚Äù he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users.¬†However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks ‚Äî a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it‚Äôs an urgent issue.

This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and ‚Äî worst of all ‚Äî silent data leaks,‚Äù he added.¬†Securing the AI layer before it‚Äôs too lateBuild fast, break things ‚Äî then get hacked. That‚Äôs the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto‚Äôs high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That‚Äôs according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.‚ÄúWhen you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it‚Äôs in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,‚Äù she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot difficult‚Äù to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just ‚Äútedious and time consuming‚Äù ‚Äî a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated.¬†The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World‚Äôs biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman‚Äôs World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project‚Äôs biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.‚ÄúDecentralization isn‚Äôt just a technical architecture,‚Äù Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World‚Äôs biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.‚ÄùEl Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World‚Äôs reliance on custom hardware ‚Äî the Orb ‚Äî and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.‚ÄúThis is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,‚Äù he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. ‚ÄúWorld does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,‚Äù they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the ‚Äúiris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.‚Äù The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so ‚Äúno personal data is stored.‚ÄùWorld‚Äôs disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co‚Äìfounder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World‚Äôs biometric model is not ‚Äúinherently incompatible‚Äù with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman‚Äôs World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI‚Äôs large-scale scraping of ‚Äúunconsented user data‚Äù and World‚Äôs collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.‚ÄúThe irony here is hard to miss,‚Äù El Damaty claimed. ‚ÄúOpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.‚ÄùIn 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World‚Äôs user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. ‚ÄúPeople in developing nations, who World‚Ä¶ has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don‚Äôt understand the risks involved with ‚Äòselling‚Äô this personal data,‚Äù El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on¬†World‚Äôs operations since its¬†launch in July 2023, with governments like¬†Germany, Kenya and¬†Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users‚Äô biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company¬†faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‚ÄòHumans can tell when it‚Äôs a human‚Äô ‚Äî Community mocks Worldcoin‚Äôs Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World‚Äôs gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.‚ÄúWhen biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,‚Äù said El Damaty. ‚ÄúThose willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access‚Ä¶ while those who refuse‚Ä¶ are excluded.‚ÄùWorld maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. ‚ÄúYou can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,‚Äù it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool ‚Äî especially in authoritarian regimes ‚Äî by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is ‚Äúopen source, permissionless,‚Äù and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user‚Äôs activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization ‚Äî highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper ‚Äî critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.‚ÄúWe need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,‚Äù said El Damaty. ‚ÄúThis means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.‚ÄùRelated: Sam Altman‚Äôs eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn‚Äôt without merit.

She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats‚Äîfrom misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.‚ÄúThis is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,‚Äù McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‚Äòfixer‚Äô rumors: Hodler‚Äôs Digest, May 18 ‚Äì 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion).

US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise‚Äôs forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin‚Äôs supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power ‚Äî it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail ‚Äî one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion ‚Äî 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community ‚Äî analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined ‚Äî and misused ‚Äî those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as ‚Äúsuspicious.‚Äù That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay ‚Äî but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it‚Äîor risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn‚Äôt just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. ‚ÄúIt cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,‚Äù she told Cointelegraph.¬†Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of ‚Äúthe most iconic benchmark index‚Äù in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, ‚Äúbecause whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.‚Äù Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500.¬†‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,‚Äù Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC.¬†‚ÄúThis normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets‚Äù and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University‚Äôs Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIt does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.‚Äù¬†Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a ‚Äúcompromise of passwords or private keys‚Äù that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that ‚Äúindex funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,‚Äù Habibi told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúThis means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.‚Äù¬†$10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase‚Äôs way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting ‚Äî a share that Habibi thinks reasonable ‚Äî it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase‚Äôs inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms ‚Äî e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks ‚Äî to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. ‚ÄúCrypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,‚Äù Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúI think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.‚ÄùA convergence of economies?Others disagree. ‚ÄúWe have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,‚Äù Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. ‚ÄúIt is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not quite at full convergence, but we‚Äôre definitely past the separation phase,‚Äù opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital‚Äôs listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase‚Äôs role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. ‚ÄúRegulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,‚Äù said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers‚Äô Sosnick. ‚ÄúConvergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.‚Äù¬†Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan‚Äôs Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq‚Äôs digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal‚Äôs launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.‚ÄúThese examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,‚Äù Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not.¬†A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. ‚ÄúGalaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,‚Äù said Kennard. ‚ÄúMarathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.‚Äù¬†Lau didn‚Äôt expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, ‚ÄúI would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry ‚Äî in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.‚ÄùStrategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it‚Äôs struggling to meet the index‚Äôs earnings requirements. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see MSTR making the cut,‚Äù said Kim.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure who would be next ‚Äî even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,‚Äù Kim continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we‚Äôll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm ‚Äî i.e., one that started as a crypto firm ‚Äî enter the index.‚ÄùTime will tell, but for now, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,‚Äù concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

The bulls will again try to thrust the price above $693. If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‚ÄòIn ‚Äò93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized‚Äô ‚Äî Ben Goertzel","It‚Äôs been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.‚ÄùHis project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world‚Äôs largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are ‚Äúprobably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,‚Äù Goertzel said.¬†For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries.¬†Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization‚ÄúIn ‚Äô93, ‚Äô94, ‚Äô95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,‚Äù Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.‚ÄúWhat I didn‚Äôt foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,‚Äù he said.The internet‚Äôs subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. ‚ÄúLater on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent ‚Äî you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,‚Äù he said.¬†However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.‚ÄúThe way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,‚Äù he said, adding:‚ÄúWe are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.‚ÄùGoertzel‚Äôs ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to ‚Äúmake anarchism real in cyberspace,‚Äù Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive ‚Äî perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity ‚Äî so Goertzel‚Äôs early skepticism wasn‚Äôt entirely misplaced.¬†He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply ‚Äúweren‚Äôt good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.‚Äù¬†He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‚Äòself-aware‚Äô ‚Äî ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity‚Äôs senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin‚Äôs network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024‚Äì2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple‚Äîan indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin‚Äôs price‚Äîhas stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Ro»ôu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options.¬†The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction.¬†Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the ‚Äúevolve or die‚Äù mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative.¬†Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point.¬†Opinion by: Grigore Ro»ôu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance‚Äôs website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the ‚Äú.fi‚Äù domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance‚Äôs infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn‚Äôt breached the protocol‚Äôs smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, ‚Äúiwantmyname,‚Äù at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code.¬†Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user‚Äôs device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally.¬†Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices.¬†Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly.¬†Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user‚Äôs knowledge.¬†There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user‚Äôs device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar ‚Äúiwantmyname‚Äù and altered the DNS delegation of the ‚Äúcurve.fi‚Äù domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server.¬†A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.¬†                  How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the ‚Äú.fi‚Äù domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued.¬†To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at ‚Äúcurve.finance,‚Äù now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken:¬†Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve‚Äôs front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for ‚Äú.eth‚Äù domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve‚Äôs backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi.¬†While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds.¬†The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach.¬†Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks.¬†Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes.¬†Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking.¬†Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates.¬†Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU‚Äôs new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That‚Äôs the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It‚Äôs not cheap and it‚Äôs not quick.¬†2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù stablecoin ‚Äî and Tether‚Äôs USDT certainly qualifies ‚Äî at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe.¬†3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn‚Äôt comply, it won‚Äôt be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can‚Äôt be offered to the public or listed on official venues.¬†In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company‚Äôs leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA‚Äôs most talked-about rules says that ‚Äúsignificant‚Äù stablecoins ‚Äî like Tether‚Äôs USDt (USDT) ‚Äî must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He‚Äôs warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile.¬†After all, if there‚Äôs a wave of redemptions and those banks don‚Äôt have enough liquidity to keep up, we‚Äôd witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don‚Äôt trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy.¬†He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn‚Äôt convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether‚Äôs users aren‚Äôt in Brussels. They‚Äôre in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars.¬†These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That‚Äôs something the company says it‚Äôs not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn‚Äôt comply with MiCA              Tether‚Äôs decision to skip MiCA didn‚Äôt exactly fly under the radar. It‚Äôs already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn‚Äôt wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they‚Äôve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you‚Äôre in Europe and holding USDT, you‚Äôre not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won‚Äôt be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That‚Äôs already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it‚Äôs far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether‚Äôs picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It‚Äôs a surprising move, but it fits Tether‚Äôs bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it‚Äôs thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether‚Äôs MiCA exit highlights crypto‚Äôs global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn‚Äôt Tether‚Äôs first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they‚Äôve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there.¬†Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that‚Äôs all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold.¬†Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it‚Äôs a mess. You can‚Äôt build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether‚Äôs resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape.¬†It‚Äôs making a bet that crypto‚Äôs future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
