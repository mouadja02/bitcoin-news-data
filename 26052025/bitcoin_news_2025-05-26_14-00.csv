2025-05-26T11:51:33.000Z,"Crypto Investor Arrested in Manhattan for Kidnapping and Torture Over Bitcoin","The post Crypto Investor Arrested in Manhattan for Kidnapping and Torture Over Bitcoin appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A shocking kidnapping case took place in Manhattan, where a man was held hostage. As reported by Associated Press , in an attempt to get access to his Bitcoin wallet, the victim was beaten and forced to hand over the password. The victim was abducted on May 6, but his name has not been made public. The 28-year-old Italian national was tricked into coming to the home with the promise of recovering Bitcoin he was forced to send to Woeltz. The kidnapper was 37-year-old John Woeltz, a crypto investor. He was arrested after the victim escaped from the eight-bedroom townhouse and got help from a passing traffic officer. He was taken to Bellevue Hospital in stable condition. John Woeltz Faces Multiple Charges Woeltz was presented on Saturday in Manhattan criminal court after his arrest on Friday. He was charged with kidnapping, assault, unlawful imprisonment, and illegal possession of a gun. He rented the Soho apartment for $30,000 a month, where the victim was held. Woeltz reportedly owns a 150-acre property in Kentucky and is said to be worth $100 million, though it’s not clear how he made his fortune. Sources say he worked in blockchain security and may have been involved in a crypto-focused hedge fund. The court decided that he will stay in custody without bail. It’s not clear whether the kidnapper and victim knew each other. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SlowMist Breaks Down How a Tiny Code Flaw Led to Cetus’ $230M Collapse , Victim Drugged, Tortured For Weeks The kidnapping was part of a larger plan involving others, including a man who has not been caught yet. The victim was tied up, tortured, drugged, shocked with electric wires, and even hit in the head with a gun. At one point, the kidnappers threatened to kill him by hanging him over a stairwell if he didn’t give up his password. The police found evidence of cocaine, a saw, chicken wire, body armor, night vision goggles, ammunition, and Polaroid photos showing the victim with a gun to his head in the townhouse. Woeltz was asked to hand over his passport since he could escape. He is set to appear in court again next week. Violent Assaults On Rise In another case, New York prosecutors charged two guys, Michael Lauchlan and Gary Zaydman, for running a scam with their crypto recovery business, Coin Dispute Network. They were accused of stealing from customers by using fake ads and using actors to pose as happy clients. These kinds of incidents reveal the growing trend of violent assaults, where victims are forced to hand over their passwords. Security experts say that crypto-related attacks are on the rise in 2025. Over 26 cases were traced this year, from kidnappings to home invasions. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T11:45:12.000Z,"Secretive Hedge Fund Run by Ex-JPMorgan Chase Trader Bringing In 51% Average Returns: Report","An ex-JPMorgan analyst has reportedly set up a mysterious hedge fund in Taiwan that has so far recorded massive return rates. Former JPM Asset Management analyst Andre Liu has quietly created a proprietary trading firm powerhouse in Taipei that has far outshone the rest of the industry, reports Bloomberg . According to the firm’s internal documents seen by Bloomberg, UC Capital has recorded an internal rate of return of 51% since it was launched in 2021. A report from research and insights firm PivotalPath found that in 2024, hedge funds scored an average return of 10.7%. Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters reported that hedge fund giant Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund saw a 15.1% return that year while Millennium Management saw 15%. Bridgewater Associates, which is widely regarded as the largest hedge fund in the world, posted 11% in gains for its flagship Pure Alpha 18% volatility fund. Bloomberg’s data also shows that UC Capital has routinely beaten the local market in Taiwan (TAIEX), even recording significant gains in 2022 despite the Taiwan stock market index ending the year in the negative. Source: Bloomberg UC Capital turned heads in Q4 of last year when it successfully purchased the ball that baseball star Shohei Ohtani hit his 50th home run on the same season he also stole 50 bases – a legendary feat in the MLB. According to Bloomberg, Liu started UC with a colleague in 2013, and by 2021, the firm’s assets exploded 27,000% before the trader decided to start his own company. Says Liu, “Ever since I was a kid, I believed that the heart of trading lies in the changes in moods and sentiment.” Consequently, UC’s engineers have built a model to measure public discourse by scraping and analyzing social media, online forums, news articles and comment sections, in what the firm describes as “sentiment thermometers” to track certain trending topics and behavior. Leveraging its sentiment-driven approach, UC capitalized on a decline in TSMC’s share price earlier this year after its models detected a surge in public discourse involving President Trump and the company’s future. At the time, the chipmaker announced a $100 billion investment in its US plants. UC also reportedly bought an earthquake detector on the eastern coast of Taiwan so that the firm would know about earthquakes before anyone else could in order to short markets in case of uncertainty. The trading firm currently has about $497 million in liquid assets before leverage.

2025-05-26T11:43:09.000Z,"Huge $3 Billion Purchase in Bitcoin and Ethereum, Surprise Sale Came from This Altcoin! \""Major Sale Happened After 80 Weeks!\""","Bitcoin (BTC) broke new records last week, rising above $111,000. While the new ATH in BTC also brought a rise to Ethereum (ETH) and altcoins, Coinshares released its weekly cryptocurrency report and said that there was an inflow of $3.3 billion last week. “Inflows into cryptocurrency investment products reached $3.3 billion last week. Since the beginning of this year, inflows have reached a record $10.8 billion.” Bitcoin (BTC) Takes the Lead! When looking at individual crypto funds, it was seen that the majority of inflows were in Bitcoin. While BTC experienced an inflow of $2.97 billion, the positive sentiment continued in Ethereum, with an inflow of $326.2 million. When we look at other altcoins, SUI experienced an inflow of $2.9 million, Solana (SOL) experienced an inflow of $4.3 million, while XRP experienced an outflow of $37.2 million. “Bitcoin took the lead with inflows of $2.9 billion, accounting for a quarter of total inflows in 2024. Ethereum saw inflows of $326 million, the most in 15 weeks, and gained for the fifth week in a row as sentiment continued to improve. XRP’s remarkable 80-week run of inflows has ended with the largest outflow on record, worth $37.2 million.” When looking at regional fund inflows and outflows, the USA ranked first with an inflow of 3.22 billion dollars. After the USA, Germany had an inflow of $41.5 million and Hong Kong had an inflow of $33.3 million. Against these inflows, Switzerland experienced an outflow of $16.6 million and Sweden $12.1 million. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-26T11:42:18.000Z,"Demand for Bitcoin Outstrips Supply and the Bonds Market Crumbles. Altcoins Like BTC Bull Token to Rally?","As demand for Bitcoin outstrips supply, and confidence in bonds is in steep decline, Bitcoin and related coins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) go from strength to strength. According to the US Debt Clock , the US is looking at a national burden of over $36.8T, which translates to $107,745 per citizen in 2025. This, while US consumer confidence is at a 13-year low, falling by 7.9 points in April 2025, based on a report by The Conference Board. According to Stephanie Guichard, Senior Economist at The Conference Board: ‘High financial market volatility in April pushed consumers’ views about the stock market deeper into negative territory, with 48.5% expecting stock prices to decline over the next 12 months.’ Making matters worse, overseas investors have started to flee the chaotic US markets and seek refuge in Japan’s equities and long-term bonds. The migration translated to over $56.6B changing markets in April alone. . The result? Stock market low, bond yields high, Bitcoin price even higher. Why an Apocalyptic Bond Landscape is Good News for Bitcoin Bitcoin is pushing to $110K at the time of writing, marking a clear shift in the financial paradigm. Rising US bond yields, stalling global growth, and concerns about financial instability and inflation are leading many investors to pivot to crypto and Bitcoin as a hedge. Indeed, Bitcoin is known to thrive in rough financial waters, and today, this is buoyed by institutional investors racing to stack $BTC at an unprecedented rate. Based on the latest data , global companies and ETFs now control more than 15% of the total supply of Bitcoin, or 3.23M tokens. Of these, Michael Saylor’s Strategy dominates the news with its frequent Bitcoin buys. Today, Strategy owns 576,230 $BTC, worth roughly $63B at the current price. But it’s not alone. A quick peek at CoinGecko’s chart shows a growing leaderboard with 34 major public companies all engaged in a FOMO-driven Bitcoin race. Strategy Creates a Supply Problem The situation is so surreal that Strategy’s Bitcoin stacking alone supersedes the total global mining output by a rate of almost 4:1. In other words, Saylor’s demand of 2,000 bitcoins per day is outstripping the 450 bitcoins per day supply coming from BTC miners. SYZ Capital’s Managing Partner, Richard Byworth, called this the ‘ Bitcoin supply problem ,’ suggesting that Bitcoin is essentially facing a bottleneck, with the demand outpacing the supply by a great margin. In the long term, this could cause Bitcoin to be sold out of circulation, creating a climate where it would be very easy to sell Bitcoin but very difficult to buy. UXTO’s Guillaume Girard reiterates this problem in his ‘Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,’ stating that: ‘We’re entering a new era of Bitcoin adoption—one that is not driven by hype cycles, but by balance sheet fundamentals, sovereign strategy, and long-term fiduciary mandates. More than $400 billion in institutional capital will flow into Bitcoin by the end of 2026.’ As Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a safe haven or strategic asset, some of the best altcoins will surely follow closely. One contender is BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL), a top new meme coin that’s strapping itself to Bitcoin for the long haul. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Investors Get Free $BTC Airdrops BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) attracts investors with free $BTC airdrops and $BTCBULL rewards as Bitcoin reaches key price points ($150K, $200K, $250K) for the first time. It’s earned a reputation as one of the best presales today thanks to its FOMO-driven ecosystem, promise of generous rewards, and close association with Bitcoin. The project is based on the idea that Bitcoin is unstoppable and will reach and even surpass the $1M price evaluation. Based on that, the team is using Bitcoin’s reputation and potential as a launching pad for $BTCBULL, hoping to rally both Bitcoin maximalists and meme coin mavens around the project. $BTCBULL is an unapologetic meme coin that’s managed to accumulate over $6,3M in its presale since its start on February 10, 2025. The token price currently stands at $0.00253, a low presale price that looks set to see exponential growth post-launch. Our analysts predict $BTCBULL to reach $0.0497 by the end of 2030, an ROI of 1,864% if you invest now. The token looks just as juicy short-term, with a projected ROI of 155% by the end of 2025 if the price hits the expected $0.006467. If you’re curious to learn more, check out our ‘how to buy $BTCBULL’ guide for more details and to simplify the purchasing process. Just note that you need to hold your $BTCBULL in Best Wallet to qualify for the upcoming $BTC airdrops. Is Bitcoin’s Real Bull Run Just Starting? When considering the state of the traditional markets, it’s no wonder investors are migrating to Bitcoin and crypto in general. Bitcoin’s biggest bull run lies ahead, while a meme coin like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) can multiply your BTC gains and help you ride the next run all the way to the bank.

2025-05-26T11:40:52.000Z,"Florida to Eliminate Capital Gains Tax on Bitcoin, XRP, and Stocks","The post Florida to Eliminate Capital Gains Tax on Bitcoin, XRP, and Stocks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Florida has introduced a groundbreaking bill that could change how Bitcoin, XRP, and stocks are taxed—at least at the state level. If passed, this legislation would exempt state capital gains tax on crypto and traditional stock profits, setting a powerful precedent in the U.S. and potentially driving crypto adoption nationwide. Just in: Florida unveils bill to scrap capital gains taxes on #Bitcoin . #CoinPedia #CryptoNews #Blockchain #CryptoMarket — Coinpedia (@CoinpediaNews) May 26, 2025 What’s in Florida’s New Crypto Tax Proposal The bill, championed by Florida’s Republican leadership under Governor Ron DeSantis, aims to eliminate capital gains tax on Bitcoin, XRP, and stocks at the state level. This would allow investors to retain more of their profits, giving Florida a major competitive edge in the crypto space. However, federal capital gains tax still applies—only Congress can change that. Bitcoin and XRP React Positively In the past 24 hours: Bitcoin price surged 2.4% , now trading around $109,835 XRP rose by 2.2% and currently stands at $2.34 Short-term trends show: Asset 30-Day Growth 3-Month Growth BTC +16.55% +19.6% XRP +5.42% +2.71% Some analysts believe this proposal could help push Bitcoin to $135,000 in the next 3 months. Aligns With Trump’s National Crypto Vision This Florida initiative appears to align with President Donald Trump’s broader push for crypto-friendly regulation .

2025-05-26T11:31:28.000Z,"Crypto Market Is Outperforms Tech Stocks in 2025","The post Crypto Market Is Outperforms Tech Stocks in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has recovered from a weekend drop, holding near $110K. This strength is backed by 30 straight days of net inflows into spot ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT. According to QCP , this shows strong institutional interest and growing confidence in crypto as a long-term asset. On the other hand, tech stocks, especially leveraged plays like the TQQQ, are seeing major outflows. Since April, they’ve been hit by fading hopes of Fed rate cuts and concerns over rising inflation. Investors are turning more cautious. As traders brace for this Friday’s critical Core PCE inflation data, QCP outlines the key forces driving a growing divergence between crypto and tech markets. Why Crypto Is Gaining the Edge QCP says some investors are shifting away from pricey tech stocks and rotating into crypto. The maturity of the crypto market is also playing a role. With more sophisticated hedging options and less reliance on leverage, crypto is better equipped to handle macro shocks than in previous cycles. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Prediction this Week , Plus, political events like Trump’s sudden EU tariff threats are adding stress to equity markets. Crypto, being less tied to government policy and physical supply chains, is staying out of that storm. What to Watch: PCE Print and Shipping Costs This Friday’s Core PCE data could be a game-changer. If inflation is higher than expected, it could delay any Fed easing and hurt tech even more. Meanwhile, shipping delays in Europe are pushing up costs globally. That could squeeze tech firms further, while crypto, being digital and decentralized, remains unaffected. QCP believes that if inflation sticks around, crypto may even gain as a hedge. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T11:22:06.000Z,"BTCI: Effective Strategy Reflected In Total Return","Summary BTCI offers a high 27.8% yield using a covered call strategy on Bitcoin, appealing to income-focused investors. The fund’s approach limits the upside during Bitcoin rallies, but this trade-off is typical for covered call ETFs and accepted by yield-seeking investors. My focus is always total return, and despite a bad start in November, BTCI has delivered impressive results. The NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF (BTCI) is a relatively new addition to the growing number of funds employing covered call strategies and offering high dividend yields. BTCI currently yields an impressive 27.8%. The trade-off is that the strategy slightly limits capital gains during rallies in the underlying security (Bitcoin), but that is a feature of all funds of the same type, and it seems this is not an issue for income investors. Assets under management have steadily grown in BTCI, and other similar funds are showing equally impressive inflows. Data by YCharts The rise in the popularity of these funds has surprised me. The concept is not new, and the Invesco S&P 500 BuyWrite ETF ( PBP ) was launched in 2007. Another similar fund, the Global X S&P 500 Covered Call ETF ( XYLD ) was launched in 2013. Neither ETF garnered that much attention, and you can see why. Data by YCharts XYLD has an attractive 13% yield and monthly payouts, but it significantly underperforms the S&P 500 ( SPY ) on a total return basis. Newer income funds such as BTCI have taken a similar strategy but improved on it. While XYLD and PBP were passively managed and tracked CBOE S&P 500 BuyWrite Index (a hypothetical \""buy-write\"" strategy on the S&P 500), BTCI actively manages its own options overlay strategy. But is it effective? The Strategy The first part of BTCI's strategy is simple - gain exposure to Bitcoin. However, BTCI has no direct holdings in Bitcoin for tax reasons. A full explanation can be found on page 53 of this link . It therefore employs two alternative methods . (i) investing in exchange-traded spot Bitcoin ETPs (the “Spot Bitcoin ETPs”) primarily through a controlled foreign corporation and in some cases by directly investing in Bitcoin ETPs (ii) obtaining indirect Bitcoin exposure through ETFs that invest principally in Bitcoin futures contracts (each, a “Bitcoin Futures ETF”), which is obtained by employing an options strategy that consists of selling (writing) put options and buying call options at the same strike price on one or more Bitcoin Futures ETFs The positions are highlighted in the holdings table below. NEOS The large position in US Treasury Bills is used for collateral (cash alternative) on its options trades. This will provide a small but welcome yield. The second part of BTCI's strategy is the options overlay, designed to provide income. This involves selling options and collecting the premium. We can see from the holdings listed above that BTCI has sold two options on MBTX (the CBOE mini Bitcoin US ETF index), both with an expiry of 06/20/25 and strikes of 245 and 250. As Neos explains: If the price of the reference asset is greater than the strike price at the expiration date, the counterparty will exercise their option. This obligates the writer to sell the reference asset to the counterparty (buyer) at the pre-specified price, which will be at a price below the market price, resulting in a loss for the writer and an equivalent profit for the holder. At the current price of $257, the buyer is in profit and BTCI will lose money. TradingView Since Bitcoin tends to trend higher, this process must happen quite regularly. BTCI will still win on its Bitcoin exposure, but as the prospectus explains, the options overlay caps the gains. ...the Fund will lose money on those written call positions, and the losses will, in turn, limit the upside return of the synthetic long exposure and Spot Bitcoin ETPs. Is it Effective? The options overlay does collect premium to distribute in the monthly dividend, but not very much. While the distribution rate of BTCI is a juicy 27.82%, the 30-day SEC Yield is 2.09%. This is the yield from income such as premiums (and from holdings in USTs). NEOS The rest of the yield is just a return of capital (ROC). May's 19a-1 notice states that 97% of the monthly distribution came from return of capital. NEOS ROC allows the monthly distributions to be large and fairly consistent. Seeking Alpha Of course, the price of BTCI will drop on every distribution, and the fund's price is below the 2024 high when spot Bitcoin has broken out to new all-time highs. TradingView Most holders know this and are happy to trade capital gains for a steady, high yield. However, the more important question is whether BTCI's strategy is effective in creating yield and capturing capital gains. The evidence provided by the total return so far is inconclusive. Since its inception, BTCI's total return is lagging the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) by 14%, which is worrying since this has happened in around 7 months. Data by YCharts However, much of the IBIT outperformance in the chart above comes from the strong rally in November and may also be due to some issues around the time of BTCI's launch. Remember, the options are actively managed. The Adviser utilizes a proprietary, rules-based, systematic model to manage the Fund’s options positions. The Adviser may actively manage the written and purchased call options prior to expiration to potentially capture gains and minimize losses due to the movement of the Bitcoin Futures ETFs. The data YTD has been much better as BTCI's strategy should work best in sideways markets like we have experienced in 2025. Data by YCharts A 0.7% difference is insignificant given the volatility in the underlying asset. Furthermore, the chart above shows that BTCI outperformed during the drop (as it should). Data by YCharts It therefore appears that the strategy is effective and delivers what is expected. I would monitor its performance carefully given the limited evidence, but besides the blip in November just after BTCI's launch, the data looks promising. Conclusions BTCI is a relatively new fund that seeks to provide regular, high income while maintaining exposure to Bitcoin. The income it generates from options is relatively low and return of capital makes up the majority of the distributions, but I don't see this as a major problem. BTCI delivers on its promises and, importantly, its total return this year has kept pace with IBIT and even outperformed during the downturn.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789825-btci-effective-strategy-reflected-in-total-return?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BTCI",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T11:18:26.000Z,"Best Crypto to Buy Now as Bitcoin Erodes the Dollar’s Iron Grip","Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff, in his new book Our Dollar, Your Problem , argues that the U.S. dollar’s unrivaled position is under threat from a trio of forces: China’s rising influence, escalating geopolitical strains, and the surging use of cryptocurrencies in global transactions. This warning matters because the dollar’s reserve status underpins everything from interest rates to international trade. As Rogoff highlights crypto’s growing footprint—especially in shadow economies—the stage is set for a profound shift in currency dynamics. For investors watching these tectonic movements, the best crypto to buy now has become a central focus, and for good reason. Kenneth Rogoff: Crypto Is Undermining the Greenback’s Global Power Kenneth Rogoff’s career spans the highest echelons of global finance—from advising the International Monetary Fund to charting policy at the Federal Reserve. In Our Dollar, Your Problem, he paints a vivid picture of the dollar’s historic ascent following World War II and explains why it has long outstripped every other currency in dominance. But according to Rogoff, that era is waning. He points to three converging trends: Beijing’s quiet push to internationalize the renminbi, Europe’s gradual expansion of the euro’s footprint, and the rapid rise of digital currencies. Rogoff places particular emphasis on cryptocurrency’s growing role in the global underground economy—a realm where dollars once reigned supreme. In these unregulated markets, from tax evasion to illicit trade, crypto offers a level of anonymity and flexibility that fiat cannot match. While digital coins haven’t yet made deep inroads into mainstream commerce, they are increasingly favored for bypassing sanctions and evading financial oversight. Rogoff’s research, supported by World Bank studies, estimates this shadow economy at roughly 20% of global GDP, making it a multi-trillion-dollar arena. He argues that diminished demand for dollars in these markets could nudge U.S. interest rates higher, impacting everything from mortgages to auto loans. Moreover, as crypto further obscures transaction trails, American authorities may find it harder to monitor flows critical to national security. Far from a fleeting fad, Rogoff insists, digital currencies have secured a foothold that will only deepen—particularly among those seeking alternatives to the dollar’s far-reaching control. In a nutshell, the greenback’s “exorbitant privilege” is fraying, and crypto is exploiting every crack. Best Crypto To Buy Now Rogoff’s insights underscore a pivotal moment: cryptocurrencies are no longer confined to fringe use cases but are actively reshaping global currency demand. For savvy investors, this shift signals an opportunity to reassess portfolios and consider the best crypto to buy now—those positioned to benefit most from the decline in dollar dominance.

BTC Bull As the original crypto juggernaut, BTC Bull Token captures the market’s speculative fervor, offering leveraged exposure that investors may crave when trust in fiat currencies wanes. BTC BULL is a meme coin inspired by the Bitcoin theme, standing out from competitors that rely on frogs, dogs, or cats—symbols that can appear weak compared to its strong, muscular, and confident bull mascot. It offers a way to capitalize on Bitcoin’s upcoming rally without needing to invest an exorbitant amount, especially as Bitcoin recently surpassed the $110K mark. What truly sets BTC BULL apart is that it’s not just another hype-driven meme coin prone to pump-and-dump cycles. Instead, it brings real utility and value. According to well-known crypto YouTuber ClayBro , investors should get ready for Bitcoin airdrops as Bitcoin reaches a new all-time high. BTC BULL combines Bitcoin-based rewards, staking opportunities, and token burns—making it a compelling choice for investors seeking both fun and long-term potential. Solaxy Riding the wave of geopolitical uncertainty, Solaxy’s L2 solution aims to simplify Solana's current ecosystem by providing it with increased accessibility, and enhance its scalability. As Solana's first Layer 2, Solaxy does lead to certain questions to emerge - why does Solana even need it? The answer lies in recent history. Solana has become known for its meme coin ecosystem, which was overwhelmed by the launch of coins like Trump and Melania. This surge in activity led to network congestion, slowing down transactions and exposing scalability issues. Solaxy takes Solana to the next level by offering faster and cheaper transactions, making it well-suited for dApps, DeFi projects, and token launches. The project team has also partnered with Hyperlane to launch a testnet bridge, which could eventually connect Solana to Ethereum—simplifying cross-chain asset transfers. Conclusion Rogoff’s analysis shines a spotlight on an inflection point: the dollar’s unchallenged reign is slipping, and digital currencies are stepping into the breach. This trend not only reshapes interest-rate dynamics but also tests the limits of financial oversight and sanctions enforcement. As global actors diversify away from the greenback, demand for resilient, scalable cryptocurrencies is set to intensify. For investors seeking strategic exposure in this shifting landscape, focusing on the best crypto to buy now—those with real transactional use cases—is essential.

Per analysts, the rally is the result of institutional adoption, growing regulatory clarity, and favourable macroeconomic factors. At the same time, the cryptocurrency market capitalization is unchanged over the past day, currently standing at $3.58 trillion. The total crypto trading volume is at $95 billion – the lowest it’s been in days. TLDR: BTC hits intraday high, decreases by 1.6% from ATH; Analysts discuss whether crypto is decoupling from stocks; Bitcoin continues defying major macro shockwaves; BTC is on its way to hit $150,000, ETH is set for a comeback; US Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded one of the largest inflows on Friday; Crypto market rally remains sustainable. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all the top 10 coins per market capitalization have appreciated over the past day. Bitcoin (BTC) is up 2.3%, now trading at $110,080. The coin hit its all-time high of $111,814 on 22 May, falling 1.6% since. Its current level is its intraday high. Ethereum (ETH) appreciated 3.6%, now changing hands at $2,581. Its daily high is $2,585. The category’s best performer, for the sixth day in a row, is Cardano (ADA) . It’s up 5.1% to $0.7736. Cardano’s Ouroboros Leios upgrade is currently in development, with the launch expected next year. It should significantly boost the chain’s scalability and allow the network to handle tens of thousands of transactions per second. Meanwhile, Cardano supporters are working on expanding the ecosystem. Im honoured to be able to represent our vibrant community, and being able to to bring more exposure to the Cardano ecosystem within the region as we expand further. Let's build together! More exciting updates to follow. — Kavinda Kariyapperuma (@OfficialKavinda) May 23, 2025 Of the top 100 coins, only one is red today. Tokenize Xchange (TKX) has decreased by 2.2% to the current price of $32.77. At the same time, Hyperliquid (HYPE) is this category’s highest gainer. It’s up 11.7% to $38.88. However, the crypto market is evidently still highly influenced by the macroeconomic developments. It’s particularly, even worryingly so, sensitive to US policy shifts. On Sunday, US President Donald Trump decided to delay the introduction of 50% tariffs on EU imports until 9 July. This has eased the general market concerns around a potential trade war. At the same time, the capital is migrating into risk assets. A set date is a good sign. If they seal a deal by July 9, companies get clear rules on tariffs and tech trade, which helps unlock fresh investment on both sides of the Atlantic. — ForceField (@ForceFieldX) May 26, 2025 Bitcoin is on the Path to $150,000 According to Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at YouHodler , “Bitcoin already possesses sufficient internal catalysts” to reach the $150,000 level. Factors that provide strong structural support include post-halving supply constraints, continued institutional adoption, and the expansion of Bitcoin ETF inflows. “Given these fundamentals, even a stable and moderately positive macroeconomic environment over the medium term could propel Bitcoin toward the $150K mark.” Furthermore, Lienkha noted that most of BTC’s free float is in retail wallets. Therefore, retail investors remain dominant in market dynamics. However, “it’s increasingly common to see Bitcoin allocated as a small but strategic component in diversified investment portfolios.” This shows that its adoption among institutions is still in the early stages, but there is growing recognition of the coin as a legitimate asset class and a potential long-term store of value. Last Friday, US Spot #Bitcoin ETFs just recorded one of the largest net positive flows YTD – 7,869 $BTC – marking the biggest daily inflow since April 29. The 7-day SMA is also trending higher, signaling a sustained uptick in institutional demand: https://t.co/DVHnnJp9lu pic.twitter.com/bOlKyjBx1e — glassnode (@glassnode) May 26, 2025 He commented that the sustainability of Bitcoin’s bullish momentum “largely hinges on the broader sentiment across financial markets, particularly the performance of US equities.” As long as the US stock market remains stable, Bitcoin will likely maintain its upward trajectory, he argued. But he noted emerging risks in the bond market. A broader sell-off in the bond market could spill over into crypto. However, Alice Liu, the Head of Research at CoinMarketCap , argued that crypto is decupling and moving independently from traditional markets. Despite major macro shockwaves, including the US credit downgrade, the weakest Treasury demand in 20 years, and S&P dropping 2% in a day, Bitcoin still hit an all-time high. This shows “crypto’s increasing role as an alternative store of value during sovereign debt concerns.” That said, Lienkha added that Bitcoin is “indeed maturing and gradually gaining recognition as a distinct asset class,” but that it still “has a considerable journey before it can be fully classified as a hedge.” Reduced volatility and growing institutional interest are encouraging signs, but the current stability may be a temporary pause and not a permanent shift. “Actual safe-haven status requires consistent performance across multiple market cycles and crises, which Bitcoin has yet to fully demonstrate,” Lienkha said. Levels & Events to Watch Next After hitting the all-time high of $111,814 last Thursday, BTC saw a relatively minor pullback to $110,594. Notably, it’s up from the daily low of $106,815. Overall, it has increased by some 6.6% over the past week. Key resistance levels remain at $112,000, followed by $115,000, and then the critical $120,000 level. Support levels to keep an eye on are $107,000 and $100,000. Should it follow further, it may hit $92,000. Furthermore, ETH “appears to be gearing up for a comeback,” Liu says. The recent Pectra upgrade raised validator caps 64-fold, reduced layer-2 settlement costs, and improved usability. Overall, the coin is up 42.3% in a month. Notably, the Fear and Greed Index has decreased from 76 to 69, suggesting growing bullishness. Investors are buying, expecting the prices to rally further.

Min Byoung Dug, a lawmaker for the Democratic Party and the chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, said that “South Korea is an internet powerhouse. We need to take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins before US dollar-based stablecoins become firmly established. That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony.” Additionally, candidate Lee claimed he would boost the stock market and economic recovery.

These incidents, they allege, pushed the company’s stock price down. The developments surrounding recent lawsuits aimed at Coinbase may affect the crypto market as well. Quick FAQ Why did crypto move against stocks today? The stock market is down yet again today, while crypto continues climbing. The S&P 500 is down 0.67%, the Nasdaq-100 decreased by 0.93%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.61%. Trump’s Friday tariff threats have put the markets on edge again, says Kate Leaman, chief market analyst at AvaTrade . This fuels investors’ worries about rising global trade tensions. However, Trump has changed his mind yet again on Sunday, so this is likely to reflect on the stocks today. Leaman argues that whether the tariffs become reality or not, “the market is already pricing in the risk.” Is this rally sustainable? The current developments affecting the market continue to be favorable, in addition to the overall positive sentiment. Currently, the rally seems sustainable. However, profit-taking often comes after a period of fast gains, which may lead to short-term pullbacks.

2025-05-26T11:14:18.000Z,"Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin Reclaims $110K, ADA and DOGE Lead Recovery","The post Crypto Price Today: Bitcoin Reclaims $110K, ADA and DOGE Lead Recovery appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin rebounded to nearly $110,000 after a weekend slump triggered by U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise tariff threats on European goods . The threat had briefly dragged BTC down to $108,600 and triggered over $500 million in long liquidations across major cryptocurrencies. However, Trump’s decision to push the tariff deadline to July 9 helped calm nerves, sending U.S. and European index futures higher and reviving risk appetite. ADA and DOGE Lead Crypto Bounce Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) led the crypto majors in recovery, each climbing around 3% in the last 24 hours. The broader crypto market followed suit, buoyed by gains in global equities and a dip in demand for traditional safe havens like gold and U.S. Treasuries. The weekend drop revealed how sensitive crypto remains to macro headlines, but also highlighted the resilience of trader sentiment. BTSE COO Jeff Mei noted that the quick rebound suggests traders believe “the worst is over” and are beginning to accumulate again. QCP Capital says markets are closely watching this Friday’s PCE data, which could shape the Fed’s next move. While oil prices are down, growing port congestion in Europe is spreading to Asia and the U.S., risking higher shipping costs and renewed inflation. Meanwhile, crypto sentiment is showing strength, unlike tech stocks, which remain cautious. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Key Economic Events to Watch This Week as Crypto Markets Aim to Rebound , Options Activity Signals Renewed Optimism According to Singapore-based QCP Capital, the options market is flashing signs of a bullish turn. The firm reported that 1,000 contracts for the September $130K BTC call were picked up, signaling a growing appetite for topside exposure. QCP pointed to several factors behind this mid-term rally. He highlighted consistent ETF inflows, improving regulatory clarity in the U.S., and fresh institutional demand . One standout is Strategy’s recent $2.1 billion fundraise aimed at more Bitcoin accumulation. While the crypto market remains vulnerable to global policy shocks, Bitcoin’s sharp recovery suggests underlying strength. With traders re-entering and institutions doubling down, the weekend wobble may just be a setup for the next leg higher. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T11:07:16.000Z,"‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ Author Explains Why Getting Rich With Bitcoin Is Unbelievably Easy","Robert Kiyosaki has suggested it is “so easy” to get rich through Bitcoin (BTC), and says he can’t understand why more people aren’t buying in. The author of the best-selling book Rich Dad Poor Dad is convinced that even a tiny BTC investment could potentially make you rich, describing the asset as the “easiest” path to wealth. How Even 0.01 BTC Could Make You Rich In Two Years According to financial educator Robert Kiyosaki, it is now easier to become rich by simply buying and holding Bitcoin rather than investing in other assets. The rationale behind his uber-bullish case stems from the fact that Bitcoin has historically yielded massive returns for investors who buy and hold the apex cryptocurrency compared to other assets. Given Bitcoin’s growth potential, Kiyosaki seemed bewildered that many have yet to invest in it. He suggested that people do not need to own a whole Bitcoin, which costs around $109,893 as of publication time, as even a 0.01 BTC investment could make someone rich in the next two years. “Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me,” Robert Kiyosaki wrote in a Sunday post on X. “Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years… and maybe make you very rich.” His latest remarks come as Bitcoin rebounded to just under $110,000, after a turbulent weekend market correction sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s abrupt tariff threats on the European Union (EU). In particular, Bitcoin had plummeted from $111,000 all-time highs to as low as $107,217 in response to Trump’s threats of steep levies on EU imports and Apple iPhones manufactured abroad. Trump, however, extended the deadline for the proposed tariffs to July 9 on Sunday, giving global risk assets a reprieve. Kiyosaki described Bitcoin as a wealth vehicle for the long term, comparing its volatility to “real life” and encouraging his 2.7 million followers on the X social media site not to “miss the easiest time in history to become rich and financially free.” The businessman also referred readers to follow prominent Bitcoin proponents like Raoul Pal, Michael Saylor, and Anthony Pompliano, noting, “Open your eyes and your mind… look into the future of money.” Kiyosaki’s post is the latest in a slew of pro-Bitcoin remarks he’s made in recent years. As reported by ZyCrypto , the popular author previously forecasted that the price of Bitcoin could rocket to $350,000 as early as this year. Last month, Kiyosaki expressed concerns about an impending “greater depression” in the US while predicting that the price of the world’s oldest and largest crypto could hit $1 million by 2035 .",zycrypto,https://zycrypto.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-explains-why-getting-rich-with-bitcoin-is-unbelievably-easy/,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING","Bitcoin|Featured|News|Bitcoin News|Robert Kiyosaki",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T11:04:38.000Z,"Key Economic Events to Watch This Week as Crypto Markets Aim to Rebound","The post Key Economic Events to Watch This Week as Crypto Markets Aim to Rebound appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News May was a sensational month for the U.S. stock market , with indices gaining strong momentum. So far, the market has surged by at least 3.19% . However, last week saw a sharp pullback, with the S&P 500 plunging over 2.68% before slightly recovering with a 0.37% rebound on Friday. Now, with U.S. markets closed on Monday, May 26 , in observance of Memorial Day , all eyes are on the key economic events lined up for the week as markets reopen. What Is Memorial Day? Memorial Day , observed on the last Monday of May, is a federal holiday in the U.S. honoring military personnel who died while serving in the Armed Forces. While it’s a day of remembrance, it also marks the unofficial start of summer and a pause in trading activities. Current Market Snapshot (As of May 26, 2025) S&P 500 Index : 5,802.83 Nasdaq 100 : 20,915.65 Nasdaq Composite : 18,737.2 US Dollar Index (DXY) : 98.96 Key Economic Events to Watch This Week 1. CB Consumer Confidence Index — May 27, Tuesday The Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index gauges how optimistic consumers feel about the economy and job market. Previous : 86 Expected : 87.2 A higher confidence reading generally signals economic strength and may attract capital toward traditional assets. However, some studies suggest a negative correlation between consumer confidence and crypto performance. 2. US Q1 GDP 2nd Estimate — May 29, Thursday The U.S. economy unexpectedly contracted in Q1 2025: Previous Growth : +2.4% Latest Estimate : -0.3% A key factor was a 41.3% surge in imports , triggered by Trump’s proposed tariffs , prompting businesses to stockpile goods. A slowing GDP typically results in a risk-off environment, often bearish for cryptocurrencies. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Adam Back Leads $2.2M Bitcoin Treasury Round for Swedish Firm H100 Group , 3. Core PCE Price Index & Michigan Consumer Sentiment — May 30, Friday Core PCE (Excludes food and energy) : Previous : 0% Expected : 0.1% Michigan Consumer Sentiment : Previous : 50.8 Expected : 51 Easing inflation reflected in lower PCE could open the door for rate cuts, which typically favor risk assets like crypto. However, weak consumer sentiment might offset this optimism, keeping investors cautious. What This Means for Crypto Investors With major key economic events scheduled this week, the crypto market could see heightened volatility: A weak GDP report may lead to a broader risk-off sentiment, triggering a pullback in crypto. Lower inflation expectations may support digital assets if the Fed leans dovish. Shifts in consumer sentiment will offer clues about broader market risk appetite.

2025-05-26T11:04:08.000Z,"Why Strategy’s Stock Price Didn’t Increase While Bitcoin (BTC) Reached All-Time Highs? Here Are the Details","While Bitcoin (BTC) is reaching new all-time highs, the share price of Strategy (STR), which has invested heavily in the cryptocurrency, has failed to catch up. Strategy Stocks Fall Become Tempting to Bet on: 10x Research Draws Attention to Disagreement with Bitcoin A new report by 10x Research has revealed that this price divergence presents an opportunity for investors in bearish strategies. In a note to investors on Friday, 10x Research Founder Markus Thielen recommended an options strategy called a “bear put spread” for STR shares traded on the Nasdaq. The strategy involves buying a $370 put option with a maturity of June 27 and selling a $300 put option with the same maturity. This strategy provides maximum profit if the STR price falls to $300 or below. STR stock fell 7% to $369 last Friday. Thielen’s proposed strategy cost $13.89. This means that the investor’s maximum loss is limited. The strategy can be used both for profit and to protect against Bitcoin investments. Strategy has the largest Bitcoin portfolio among public companies, holding 576,230 BTC through borrowed purchases since August 2020. But while the BTC price has surpassed $110,000 in recent weeks, STR shares have stagnated at $440, well below their November 2021 peak of $543. The divergence suggests that while Bitcoin continues to gain momentum, interest from traditional finance (TradFi) investors is waning, Thielen said. “This transaction captures the growing mismatch between Bitcoin’s strength and Strategy’s weak momentum,” he said. Recalling that a similar price divergence occurred in November 2021, Thielen pointed out that BTC peaked at that time. However, he also emphasized that past data does not guarantee future performance. “Bitcoin may be breaking records, but Strategy is lagging behind, and that difference is significant,” Thielen said, adding that bearish options trading can be useful not only for profit purposes but also for risk management against Bitcoin. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-26T11:04:02.000Z,"Best crypto to buy with limited capital as expert forecasts a BTC rally to $134K","Bitcoin is already flirting with the $110,000 level, but Katie Stockton, the founder of Fairlead Securities, sees the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap pushing further up in the weeks ahead. According to Stockton, Bitcoin has already surpassed a key resistance at $108,000, and a confirmed breakout over the next few days could see it soaring further to $134,000. BTC has been in a sharp uptrend lately, partially because of a 90-day trade truce between the US and China. Investors should note, however, that a Bitcoin rally is usually not a standalone event. More often than not, it tends to spill into other crypto coins as well. In 2025, these may include the likes of Dogecoin and Bitcoin Pepe . Why is Katie Stockton bullish on Bitcoin? Stockton’s bullish view on BTC is based primarily on technicals, but fundamental developments do signal further upside ahead as well. For example, institutional names like BlackRock and JPMorgan are now investing in the crypto asset and are offering it to their clients as well, which is leading to significantly increased market confidence. Additionally, the expected regulatory clarity under Trump 2.0 and continued commitment of the US President to this space are driving more capital to the digital assets this year as well. Stockton recommends buying Bitcoin following a confirmed breakout as a rally to $134,000 signals a healthy return of more than 20%.

2025-05-26T10:58:00.000Z,"MSTY: The Market Environment Is Better For This Fund Now","Summary I am upgrading MSTY from sell to hold due to a more favorable regulatory and political environment for cryptocurrencies under President Trump. MSTY offers high income potential and strong recent returns, but it consistently underperforms MSTR and carries significant downside risk due to volatility. The fund's options strategy is improving, with more consistent monthly payouts, but its structure limits upside capture and exposes investors to sharp drawdowns. MSTY suits aggressive income investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin's volatility, but is not ideal for conservative investors seeking stable, consistent income. Sometimes politics and financial factors converge to create a unique market environment that is positive or negative for an investment. While some tobacco companies performed badly in the 1990s, and many financials struggled for several after 2008 because, in part due to regulatory issues, more favorable government policies can also be a tailwind for equities. The Biden administration's subsidies for renewables as part of the Inflation Reduction Act and Trump's tax cut in 2017 that helped the market reach record highs are 2 examples of more favorable federal policies for companies benefitting the market. The regulatory environment for Cryptocurrencies has improved dramatically since President Trump was elected in 2024. The 47th President has not only talked repeatedly about making cryptocurrencies part of the US reserve, but he's also appointed a Treasury Secretary in Scott Bessent who has discussed the strong support of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as being part of the American financial system. A company that is heavily leveraged to Bitcoin is MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ). MSTR is a software company that issues debt to buy Bitcoin. The tech business enables this company to borrow at cheaper rates to level up and buy the cryptocurrency. MSTR has nearly a 65 percent correlation with the price of bitcoin, and the fund usually both outperforms and underperforms most of this cryptocurrency because of the software company's leverage. A Chart Showing the Correlation between MSTR and Bitcoin (Coindesk) One fund that seeks to take advantage of the volatility levels in MSTR as well as this company's strong recent performance because of the software operator's crypto holdings is the Yieldmax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ). MSTY's inception date was in February 2024. Data by YCharts MSTY has offered investors total returns of 272.4 percent since the fund's inception last year, while the S&P 500 ( SPY ) has offered investors total returns of 15.92 percent during this time period. Data by YCharts Still, MSTY has often underperformed the underlying price of MSTR, and that continues to be the case. Data by YCharts MSTR has offered investors total returns of nearly 418.1 percent since February 2024 when MSTY came to market. MSTY has offered investors total returns of 272.4 percent during this same time period . Today, I am upgrading my rating of MSTY from a sell to a hold. Trump has been able to reach tentative agreements with many countries on tariffs, and there are signs he will soon reach an accord with China, the risk of a significant sell-off in Bitcoin is lower. The current regulatory and financial environment is also likely to remain very favorable for this cryptocurrency, with some catalysts coming up as well . While some construction flaws remain with this ETF, this fund is better positioned now in the current financial and market environment to offer solid income and total returns. MSTY's expense ratio is .99 percent, the fund's trailing yield is 140.55 percent, and ETF has $3.76 billion in assets under management. This investment holds US treasuries that have a 6-month to 2-year duration as collateral for the synthetic call spreads and option strategies the fund uses . This investment does not own the underlying MicroStrategy Incorporated stock and MSTY has an 80 percent rule, the fund keeps at least 80 percent of the assets allocated. MSTY's Holdings (Seeking Alpha) MSTY buys call options that give investors exposure to 100 percent of the move up in MSTR. These options have a 1-6 month time frame. The fund then sells 0-15 percent out-of-the-money calls that have a 1-month or less time frame. MSTY also sells put options. The fund primarily uses synthetic call spreads to take a long position in MSTR and generate monthly income. MSTY's income is a return on capital that is taxed at ordinary income levels. President Trump has been very outspoken on the need to incorporate bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into the US financial system , and Trump has put a Treasury Secretary and SEC Chairman in place who are bullish on bitcoin and other digital currencies. When Fed chairman Powell's term is up in 2026, the President will also likely choose a new person to lead the central bank who is more aligned with him on policy, including with cryptocurrencies. The economic outlook also appears to be stabilizing more , with Trump reaching trade agreements with countries such as England, and US-Chinese trade talks showing signs of progress. While bitcoin is very volatile, sell-offs are likely to remain more muted for the time being with the current more favorable conditions. Trump's family is involved legally in cryptocurrencies, his son Eric is the chief strategy officer of American Bitcoin, and the President has made clear this family is a significant part of the team advising him. The long-term case for crypto remains strong as well , with the economy becoming more digital, inflation, and authoritarian governments in countries such as China and Russia. Demand for cryptocurrencies should remain solid. MSTY's monthly payouts have also been at more consistent levels over the last 5 months. MSTY's Distribution History (Stockanalysis.com) While this fund's range of distributions is still slightly more volatile than most covered-call investments, as expected, these payouts have been within a much tighter range since the beginning of this year, from $1.33 to $2.38 a share. This change over the last 5 months also indicates the fund's managers are likely improving the options strategy used to make the regular income MSTY offers more standardized. All investments theses have risks, and MSTY will perform well when MSTR is rising or range bound , but because the ETF is selling off much of the amount of the upside in the underlying equity while retaining significant downside risks, this investment is a higher-risk fund because of how volatile bitcoin is. The cryptocurrency has both risen and fallen 40 percent in less than a month at times during the past 3 years. MSTR's standard deviation from February to May of this year is 49.93. While MSTY has risen and paid out significant income since the fund's inception last year, bitcoin has performed very well during this time period This ETF's inability to track most of the upside of MSTR still shows the construction of this investment shows the fund would likely struggle more during sell-offs than most covered call funds. MSTY has underperformed MSTR by nearly 146 percent since the fund's inception in February 2024. The leverage used by the software company adds an additional layer of volatility to this investment since MSTR issues debt to buy Bitcoin. MSTY is designed for more aggressive income investors, this is not an ETF that will likely make sense for the average individual seeking consistent income, but despite the ETF's risks, markets have normalized, and the regulatory environment has become and is likely to remain more favorable for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While Trump being in office is not a put option on cryptocurrencies, the President's words and actions should provide support to the market when these digital assets face significant pressure.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789821-msty-market-environment-fund-now?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY","MSTY",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T10:57:23.000Z,"$2.5M Gone in Hours — Victim Hit Twice in Sophisticated Stablecoin Phishing Scam","A crypto investor lost a staggering $2.6 million USDT on May 26, 2025, after falling victim twice within three hours to a sophisticated phishing scam that manipulated Ethereum’s transaction history through zero-value transfers. Could this devastating double-hit expose a critical blind spot in how even experienced traders verify wallet addresses? The attack, which first siphoned off $843,000 and another $1.75 million, has raised serious concerns about how even seasoned traders verify wallet addresses in on-chain transactions. The Mechanics: Zero-Value Transfers and Onchain Phishing ALERT Our system has detected~2.6M $USDT loss from a targeted address poisoning scam involving zero-value transfers. A single victim was repeatedly scammed by the same attacker address. First, the victim lost 843K $USDT . About 3 hours later, the same victim sent 1.75M… pic.twitter.com/WWVlrZvavK — Cyvers Alerts (@CyversAlerts) May 26, 2025 According to a report by crypto compliance firm Cyvers, the scammers used Ethereum’s transferFrom function to create transactions from the victim’s wallet to spoofed addresses without needing any private key signature or user authorization. Since the transactions involved no real value, they were automatically added to the blockchain without triggering typical security alerts. This attack works by placing the scammer’s wallet address in the victim’s transaction history. Users who see the address logged as an outbound transaction are more likely to trust it, mistaking it for a previously interacted or known address. In follow-up transactions, they may copy and paste the spoofed address, unknowingly sending tangible assets directly to the attacker. Zero-value transfers are considered an advanced evolution of the older address poisoning scam. In traditional address poisoning, scammers send tiny amounts of cryptocurrency from addresses closely resembling the victim’s legitimate contacts, often with the same starting and ending characters. Users who rely on pattern recognition or partial address verification are more likely to fall into the trap. Zero-value transfers take this one step further by adding the fake transaction to the user’s visible history, reinforcing false legitimacy. Blockchain security firm Elliptic reported in 2023 that roughly 150 scammers had initiated over 176,000 of these Ethereum and BNB Chain transactions since November 2022. While these are zero-value transactions, executing them requires considerable gas fees.

MSTR’s stock behaves like a call option on Bitcoin due to its recursive strategy of issuing equity and debt to acquire more BTC as its price rises. Strategy’s convertibles and preferreds (especially STRK and STRF) offer different levels of yield and BTC exposure, but come with complexity, downside asymmetry, and sensitivity to volatility. We analyze Strategy ( MSTR ) as a structurally leveraged Bitcoin vehicle, examining its NAV premium, regulatory positioning, and capital structure optionality driving both opportunity and risk. Please note that VanEck has positions in Bitcoin, MSTR, STRK, and STRF. Four key takeaways MSTR Stock is a Leveraged Bitcoin ((BTC)) Proxy: MSTR’s stock behaves like a call option on Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) due to its recursive strategy of issuing equity and debt to acquire more BTC as its price rises. This structure provides asymmetric upside and high sensitivity to BTC movements, making MSTR a popular alternative to holding Bitcoin directly. MSTR Trades at a Significant Premium to Net Asset Value (NAV): We calculate a +112% premium to the combined fair value of MSTR’s BTC and core software business, driven by expectations of future BTC accumulation, regulatory advantages, and speculative positioning. MSTR’s Premium is a meta-stable “ Crypto Reactor” the powers MSTR: The Premium fuels its MSTR’s equity value through a recursive loop where volatility and Bitcoin exposure attract investor capital, enabling further BTC accumulation that amplifies the Premium. Convertible Securities Add Optionality but Heighten Risk: Strategy’s convertibles and preferreds (especially [[STRK]] and [[STRF]]) offer different levels of yield and BTC exposure, but come with complexity, downside asymmetry, and sensitivity to volatility. The 3/15/2030 convert has the most MSTR exposure, but even these instruments are heavily tied to BTC and the persistence of the Premium. Strategy accounts for nearly one-third of the pure-play equity-to- crypto market capitalization and represents 10% of the Market Vector Global Digital Assets Equity Index (MVDAPP) Index. As a result, the decision to include it in a portfolio is a key consideration for investment managers aiming to convert the digital asset transformation into alpha. There is ongoing debate around the merits of exposure to MSTR versus Bitcoin or even leveraged BTC, driven by the complexities of Strategy’s capital structure. This calculus is further complicated by Strategy’s issuance of convertible bonds and equity instruments, including high-yielding convertible preferred shares ('STRK) and even higher-yielding non-convertible preferred shares ('STRF). In this note, we assess the structure and evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of taking positions within Strategy’s equity or debt stack. We find MSTR common stock to be the superior investment decision compared to the other options offered by Strategy. We assert this view based on the following reasons: Greatest exposure to BTC Simplicity of investment strategy Strongest risk/return profile What is Strategy? Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is a provider of enterprise analytics software that pioneered the concept of a corporate “Bitcoin Treasury.” In August 2020, Strategy calculated that the significant cash reserves on its balance sheet were vulnerable to inflation in the then-low- interest rate environment. Strategy’s opening move of its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy was to employ $250M of its balance sheet’s cash to buy 21,454 BTC . In December 2020, Strategy issued $650M in convertible notes and committed its purpose to buying BTC. Thereafter, Strategy transformed itself into a levered Bitcoin financial vehicle rather than a straightforward enterprise software business. Using leverage and issuing various forms of equity, Strategy has grown to hold 2.7% of Bitcoin’s total supply, corresponding to $61B at the time of writing. Strategy’s stated aim is to maximize the price of MSTR by increasing the BTC “backing” of each common share. By issuing debt or equity, Strategy accretes the amount of BTC per share and terms this dynamic as “Bitcoin Yield.” Leverage and additional equity issuance are added opportunistically when investor appetite is high during periods of Bitcoin price appreciation. As a result, Strategy’s BTC exposure and leverage are recursive in nature because it is expected to grow over time. As BTC appreciates, the value of Strategy’s BTC stack appreciates so it can re-lever itself by issuing debt to buy more BTC. On the equity side, bull markets in BTC drive favorable capital markets for MSTR common stock, which enables the Strategy to sell equity for additional Bitcoin. The result is that MSTR stock offers accelerating exposure to BTC that advances in tandem with BTC price appreciation. Therefore, the price dynamics of MSTR somewhat resemble a call option on BTC. Understanding the Sources of MSTR’s Equity “Premium” MSTR’s common equity currently trades at a premium (“The Premium”) to the combined value of its BTC NAV and Strategy’s underlying software business. At the time of writing, MSTR common equity trades at (+ 112% ) to the fair value of its cache of underlying assets (BTC Holdings + Core Business). Mathematically, we define this as: Source: VanEck Research as of 3/25/2025 Many debate the causes of MSTR’s Premium, but we believe it is driven by four components: Expectations of Strategy’s future BTC holdings Limited investor options for BTC exposure Leverage to BTC and the advantages of Strategy’s leverage Speculation The first component of MSTR’s Premium is market expectations around Strategy’s future Bitcoin holdings. The expected future value of Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings can be estimated using three key factors: the “terminal” number of Bitcoins held, the projected future price of Bitcoin, and the discount rate applied to those holdings. A significant portion of the Premium on MSTR stock comes from market recognition that the company will likely continue purchasing more Bitcoin over time. A positive Premium suggests that each BTC will also grow in value and therefore reflects the discounted future price of BTC. The second component, which can be described as a \""regulatory premium,\"" stems from structural limitations in the investment landscape. Many institutional and individual investors are restricted from directly purchasing Bitcoin due to regulatory constraints, investment mandates, distribution bottlenecks, or the lack of secure custody solutions. Since many investors cannot access capital-efficient, leveraged exposure to Bitcoin, they invest in MSTR. Numerous jurisdictions treat Bitcoin unfavorably for tax treatment and capital holding requirements, which causes investors to favor a publicly traded equity vehicle like MSTR. Because it is a common stock, MSTR also offers financial advantages as a collateral asset. These investor limitations render MSTR an attractive proxy for Bitcoin exposure, particularly for investors otherwise excluded from the asset class. The third component of MSTR’s Premium is the market's recognition of Michael Saylor’s ability to use financial leverage in ways that most investors cannot. Saylor has demonstrated the capacity to raise large amounts of capital at low interest rates , and his corporate structure provides resilience during Bitcoin market drawdowns. Unlike typical margin traders, who are often forced to liquidate in downturns, Saylor can sustain losses and maintain long-term positions. During parts of 2022 and 2023, even as Strategy’s equity deficit reached hundreds of millions of dollars, MSTR's market capitalization remained in the billions, reflecting investor confidence in the long-term leverage structure offered by Strategy. MSTR’s unique dynamics turbocharge its 30-day historical volatility to an astronomical ~ 113% compared to BTC’s at ~55% . In summary, MSTR equity gives investors convenient access to a levered BTC vehicle that trades on public equity venues. The Premium contributes the bulk of the volatility and performance of MSTR’s stock. We find these figures by deconstructing the weights, correlations, and volatilities in the portfolio that is MSTR (BTC + Business + Premium). The total contribution to returns is 96.5%, while its volatility contribution is around 87.5% . 1/2/2025-3/25/2025 Premium (%) Business ( QQQ ) (%) BTC (%) Weight 49.45 1.12 49.44 Return 30.85 0.00 2.21 Volatility 192.17 20.94 43.21 Return Contribution 96.56 0.00 6.92 Volatility Contribution 87.48 0.14 12.39 Correlations Premium (%) Business ((QQQ)) (%) BTC (%) Premium 1.00 0.54 0.47 Business ((QQQ)) 0.54 1.00 0.48 BTC 0.47 0.48 1.00 We use QQQ (Invesco’s NASDAQ-100 ETF) as a proxy for tech sector exposure, particularly large-cap software and cloud companies, to represent the characteristics of MSTR’s core business.

These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. The fourth component of MSTR’s Premium stems from speculative trading dynamics tied to MSTR’s volatility and capital structure. Since the Premium contributes heavily to MSTR’s returns and volatility, any disruption in the core drivers of the Premium would be very detrimental to MSTR’s share price. This is because Saylor harvests MSTR volatility to fund purchases of BTC. As we expand upon below, Saylor’s preferred method of financing BTC purchases is, in order, preferred equity, convertible preferred equity, convertible debt, and common equity. This order is based on the “BTC Gains” afforded to common shareholders, which are driven by the BTC attributable to each common share. Selling preferred equity, for example, adds share dilution, and the proceeds are cycled directly into BTC gains for common shareholders. These securities that Strategy markets are popular with investors because MSTR’s high volatility translates into numerous trading opportunities across Strategy’s capital stack and options on MSTR. In fact, Strategy is able to maintain low interest costs on its convertible debt because MSTR’s volatility makes the convertible debt’s option component very valuable. Arguably, Strategy prices this option value cheaply to appeal to relative value trading entities. These sophisticated arbitrageurs make relative value volatility trades between the various slivers of Strategy’s securities. The result is a circular relationship between Strategy’s Premium and its ability to finance more BTC purchases. The Premium provides the bulk of MSTR’s volatility. However, the Premium is largely a function of the ability of Strategy to finance BTC buys. The market is only willing to buy Strategy’s securities because its capital stack is volatile, and Strategy arguably sells this volatility cheaply. On the 1Q2025 earnings call, Saylor calls this reinforcing dynamic a “ crypto reactor that can run for a long, long period of time.” The Premium shows a clear positive relationship with the price of Bitcoin. Over the past year, it has maintained a correlation of 0.52 to BTC ( T-Stat = 9 ) and an approximate beta of 1.77 to BTC. This indicates that as Bitcoin’s price increases, the Premium tends to expand, further enhancing MSTR’s stock performance. The link between BTC price, speculation, financing ability, and MSTR’s valuation forms a self-reinforcing cycle that is central to the company’s strategy.

Funding the Bitcoin Treasury Strategy In October 2024, Strategy announced the ambitious 21/21 capital plan to buy BTC with $42B raised by selling $21B of MSTR equity and $21B of fixed income securities by 2027. In the original plan, Strategy would sell $5B of equity in 2025, $7B in 2026, and $9B in 2027. Meanwhile, it would sell fixed income securities at a similar pace of $5B , $7B, and $9B in 2025, 2026, and 2027. These debt issuances targeted a leverage ratio between 20-30%. Strategy leader Michael Saylor calls this “intelligent leverage,” not for speculation, but to strategically acquire a “dominant digital asset.” Thanks to an unprecedented crypto bull market following the start of the 21/21 plan, by May 2025, it sold all $21B worth of MSTR stock offered in its At-The-Market (ATM) program. In his fixed-income bucket, Saylor has sold $5B in convertible notes, $875M in STRK convertible preferred stock, and $850M in non-convertible preferred stock. During Strategy’s earnings call on May 1, 2025, the firm announced it would be expanding the financing program to $84B, including a new $21B MSTR ATM program, the existing $21B STRK ATM, and an additional $14B in new convertible debt offerings. 42/42 Capital Raising Plan - 32% Complete Source: Strategy as of 5/7/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. With BTC trading at ~ $95k and Strategy’s holding at 555,450 BTC , we calculate Saylor’s leverage ratio ((Debt + Pref)/(Market Cap)) to be 9% . This figure represents the lowest leverage ratio that the Strategy has undertaken since 2020. Given Saylor’s lower-than-average leverage ratio and his stated desire for debt that is “convertible, unsecured and non-recourse,” it is reasonable to expect more capital will be raised through convertible debt in the very near future.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. MSTR stock is highly volatile because it is leveraged to BTC, and that leverage is likely to increase as Strategy finances more BTC purchases. Most investors view taking additional leverage to purchase volatile assets like BTC unfavorably and would, therefore, demand a high interest rate. Strategy addresses this by issuing convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock, which derive much of their value from the embedded option features within these securities. Sophisticated investors prefer these issuances because they allow them to engage in activities like convertible stock arbitrage. In this risky and complex trading strategy, experienced investors buy convertible bonds against shorting MSTR stock and/or MSTR options to profit from differences in realized volatility, implied volatility, and other components of option pricing models. This trading dynamic helps Strategy solve the cash flow issues by ensuring lower interest payments on its debt. Because there is great demand for highly volatile convertible securities, Strategy can promise investors very low future interest rate payments. A complex dance occurs between Strategy’s capital markets strategy and the market appetite of potential investors.

The 2024 Common ATM has been substantially depleted and the sales agreement for this program has been terminated by its terms. This involves Strategy pricing the implied volatility, setting a strike price, and adding a redemption price to maximize the tradability of each issuance. For example, a somewhat near-the-market redemption price allows Strategy to place a ceiling on the upside on the option component of its bond. The result is that the derivative behaves more like a “capped call,” which can exhibit a lower delta than vanilla call options. Choosing strike prices far out of the money on the converts can also lower the value of the option component and thus the delta. Lowering the delta means reducing the number of shares of MSTR stock (or options) needed to hedge the option within the convert. Many convertible arbitrage players favor lower delta issuances because these are less capital-intensive for trading balance sheets. Evaluating Strategy’s Financing Sustainability While Strategy’s core business generates some operational income, its BTC purchases using financing will bring significant cash demands. Based on Strategy’s documents and statements, we project total debt to reach $13B by the end of 2025 (up from ~ $8B in April 2025) and $19B by the end of 2026. We also expect preferred equity to grow to $7.5B in 2025 and $15.5B in 2026. By year-end 2025, we forecast annual interest payments to reach $48M and rise to $87M by 2026. Meanwhile, preferred stock ((STRK)) dividend payments are expected to rise from $217M in 2025 to $904M in 2026. We estimate these figures based on anticipated market demands for MSTR’s debt coupon and preferred dividend figures. While Strategy retains the option to pay STRK preference dividends in common shares, doing so would dilute existing MSTR holders by reducing BTC per share. With a projected revenue of $475M in 2025, Strategy depends on financing to cover its fixed income obligations. Of course, the ability to raise new capital is contingent upon the price of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin’s price continues on an upward trajectory, securing new capital will prove easy. Between August 2024 and May 2025, Strategy grew its holdings from 226,000 BTC to 555,450 BTC by obtaining $28.7B in financing. On the other hand, during a crypto downturn between June 2022 and December 2022, Strategy was only able to raise $49M and $11M from equity and debt sales, respectively. With increased cash outlays materializing due to new fixed income securities offerings, a bear market could prove challenging for Strategy. MSTR is a convexity bet on BTC price Investing in MSTR is somewhat akin to investing in call options on BTC due to MSTR’s leveraged sensitivity (or ‘torque’) to BTC price movements. However, it is actually much more similar to trying to dynamically replicate a call option on BTC by adding leveraged exposure as the price increases. Strategy’s gambit is to increase its BTC position as financing becomes available, and this typically occurs when the price of BTC is on an upswing. The risk of this strategy is not just prices dropping, but also the contraction of the Premium based upon the collapse of financing BTC purchases. Additionally, this strategy deploys capital at arguably inopportune times, i.e., when BTC reaches highs.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. Strategy’s local top buys accrue “losses” compared to other strategies because they skew higher the average price of Strategy’s BTC buys than if BTC is bought randomly. Whether or not Strategy buying is the reason for the local “highs and lows” is another question. Regardless, this buying strategy at local tops comes at the expense of shareholders as compared to a naïve, randomly implemented BTC buying strategy. However, the flip side is that MSTR provides recursive upside to BTC price because of its “positive convexity,” where BTC price changes cause increasingly higher dollar value of BTC per share, and new financing causes the amount of BTC held per share to also increase. Thus, an investor is exposed to an increasing BTC position as the price of BTC increases. Replicating Saylor’s strategy as an individual investor without a corporate “wrapper” for the strategy is nearly impossible. While an investor buying BTC futures can see their margin balance grow as BTC rises, enabling more BTC buying, they cannot hold that leverage \""patiently\"" during downturns in price. Futures contracts are marked to market daily, meaning gains and losses are settled regularly, and margin calls must be met immediately in the event of a drawdown. A margin trader will be liquidated if BTC retraces past their margin balance. So, while a savvy trader might mimic Saylor’s strategy and scale into BTC as it appreciates, even a modest pullback could trigger forced liquidations, wiping out this trader’s position. This daily margin requirement makes it extremely difficult for individual investors to replicate the Strategy’s long-term accumulation strategy using futures. Therefore, Strategy has a substantial financial advantage, enabling it to run a leveraged BTC strategy more effectively. MSTR’s Capital Strategy and Bitcoin Yield Strategy’s financial engineering has added substantial debt and shares to its balance sheet to gain more BTC exposure for each common share. This is because Strategy’s core goal is to increase the exposure of common shares to the BTC price. Saylor calls the increasing amount of BTC per share “BTC Yield.” This key performance indicator (KPI) for Strategy is calculated by comparing BTC holdings per common share over time. As of May 2025, the YTD BTC yield is approximately 14% using issued common shares and around 13% on a fully diluted basis. Strategy’s minimum target for BTC yield in 2025 is 25% . This would correspond to increasing the amount of BTC per 1,000 MSTR shares from ~ 1.79 BTC , its ratio as of 5/8/2025, to ~ 1.99 BTC by the end of the year. Strategy's Bitcoin ((BTC)) Yield Faces Tough Forward Comps Source: VanEck Research as of 5/8/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The management team of Strategy has many options for creating BTC yield. They can sell various financial products to acquire BTC to increase the numerator or buy common shares to reduce the denominator. Since MSTR trades at a Premium, it is more logical to sell “expensive shares” or issue debt to acquire BTC. Selling common shares through an ATM to buy BTC may be the simplest method, but it is also the most dilutionary and involves buying the most BTC. Saylor mentions this dynamic on the 1Q2025 Earnings Call, noting they prefer to acquire BTC using sales of perpetual, non-convertible equity stock.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. If Saylor were to add no additional common shares to achieve Strategy’s yield targets, he would have to buy 58,312 BTC, which would be around $5.9B at current prices . On the other hand, if Saylor were to add the exposure using only common stock, he would need to issue ~ 25.8M shares to buy 106,305 BTC worth $10.8B at today’s BTC prices. Given the capital markets’ voracious appetite for Strategy’s capital stack, it would seem likely that Strategy will easily achieve a 25% yield for 2025. High BTC Yield is Unsustainable Dollars ($M) required to increase MSTR Yield by 1 Basis Point (90-Day Moving Average) Source: VanEck Research as of 4/11/2025. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The reality of Saylor’s Bitcoin gambit is that high Bitcoin yields are unsustainable due to decreasing returns to scale. As Strategy accumulates more BTC, generating meaningful additional Bitcoin yield becomes significantly harder. This is because the amount of BTC required to produce each incremental basis point of yield increases disproportionately as the total stack of BTC grows. For instance, in August 2021, MicroStrategy needed just 2.6 BTC to generate one basis point of Bitcoin yield. By May 2025, that figure had ballooned to 58 BTC . Measured in dollar terms, the capital needed rose from approximately $126k to $5.5M for the same unit of yield. This reflects a fundamental mathematical reality: as the Bitcoin base of Strategy grows, each new BTC contributes less marginal yield, and the capital required to generate yield increases exponentially. This compounding inefficiency creates a declining ceiling on sustainable yield.

Convertible bonds are hybrid securities that combine the characteristics of fixed income with the upside potential of equity. Specifically, they consist of a traditional bond and an embedded call option that allows holders to convert the bond into MSTR common stock under certain conditions. The total value of a convertible bond equals the value of the bond plus the value of the conversion option. Thus, investors who buy a convertible bond are allocating part of their principal to a corporate bond and part of the principal to a call option. As a result, the prices of convertibles are sensitive to option pricing variables like underlying price, delta, gamma, etc., as well as bond pricing factors like interest rates and credit spreads. Strategy’s convertible notes have added special provisions that cap upside from the attached option and also allow investors some protection on principal. Strategy embeds “redemption options” which permit the company to buy back the notes at face value plus unpaid accrued interest after the redemption date. The most common provision across Strategy’s converts allows the company to redeem the bonds if MSTR is trading at 130% of the strike price of the convertible bond. This stipulation caps upside on the option value of the bond once the redemption date passes. Strategy also gives its convert holders, except for the 3/1/2030 issue, the ability to sell back their bonds at face value to Strategy for cash past the holder redemption date. This can be considered a bond price floor if Strategy runs into financial trouble.

Due to the underlying equity’s extreme volatility, MicroStrategy’s convertible bonds carry substantial embedded option value. Depending on the issuance, the share of a bond’s total value attributable to the option can be as high as 74% . The higher this proportion, the more exposure the investor has to MSTR stock price movements. This exposure changes materially as MSTR’s volatility oscillates and as the options move in or out of the money. Among the outstanding convertibles, the March 2030 B notes have the risk profile most closely aligned with MSTR’s stock. In high-volatility scenarios (e.g., MSTR VOL > 80 ), whether the stock moves up or down, this issue exhibits the most sensitivity to MSTR’s price. Conversely, the December 2029 bonds exhibit the least sensitivity, as their embedded option is the furthest out of the money. This results in the option contributing a smaller portion to the overall value of the security, reducing its impact on the bond's price movements.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. The bond component of Strategy’s convertible debt is a point of contention due to the high credit spread priced in each of the bonds. The wide credit spreads reflect the market’s risk assessment of Saylor’s bonds and thus price the bonds “cheaply.” As Saylor notes on his 1Q2025 earnings call, Strategy’s fixed income securities have credit spreads that range between 500 bps and 1,250 bps . This places Strategy’s bonds in the same credit spread category as “double or triple junk bond credit spreads.” Saylor contends these credit spreads are so immense because the market does not properly evaluate the value of the BTC collateral backing them. Because credit agencies do not adequately assess Strategy’s bonds, Saylor claims, many long-term investors do not purchase the bonds due to the perceived risk. This lowers their market price and contributes to the wide credit spreads. Saylor uses option pricing models to create his own analysis of Strategy’s converts to make his case that the bonds are underpriced due to incomplete collateral consideration. Saylor creates the concepts of “BTC Rating” and “BTC Risk” to describe the potential risk of Strategy’s debt. BTC Rating is the multiple of a bond’s par value backed by Bitcoin holdings at current BTC market prices. This metric is applied across all bonds and adjusted for seniority preference in the event of a liquidation of Strategy’s BTC holdings. For example, the 9/14/2028 bond’s BTC Rating is 52.1x because the value of Strategy’s BTC, at current BTC prices and according to the bond’s seniority, is 52.1x the par value of the bond. Saylor employs a “BTC Rating” in tandem with an options pricing model, using the current BTC price and volatility to determine the probability that BTC would trade below the BTC liquidation price, making each bondholder whole. He calls this calculated probability “BTC Risk,” which he then inputs into a bond pricing model to generate a new “Credit Spread,” which he terms “BTC Credit.” As the table above demonstrates, Saylor believes the market is wildly overpricing Strategy’s probability of default on each bond, causing the bonds to trade cheaper than if the bonds were “properly” assessed.

Any projections shown are those of VanEck and based on the firm’s own research, are for illustrative purposes only, are valid as of the posting date of this content and are subject to change without notice. A key concern with Strategy’s convertible notes is the outsized influence of the embedded option components on their pricing. As a result, many issuances currently trade well above their par value, which acts as a downside backstop. This means that significant portions of the bonds’ values can decline if the option premium erodes. For instance, the 2028 Convertible Note is priced at $227.15 as of 5/7/2025. If MSTR's stock falls below the bond’s conversion price of $183.19 at maturity, the bond would be worth only $100, assuming all other factors remain constant. This reflects the substantial option premium embedded in these instruments. Another notable risk associated with the embedded option is sensitivity to changes in volatility, among other factors in option pricing. We estimate that if volatility declines from 85 to 50 , the bonds will fall in value by approximately ( -13% ) on average. A further drop in volatility from 85 to 30 would lead to an average price decline of around ( -20% ). MSTR’s stock performance is heavily influenced by its Premium, which accounts for 87% of the stock’s volatility and 96% of its total return. In our view, this suggests that investors in MSTR convertibles are not just purchasing an option on the stock itself. They are effectively buying an option on the continued existence of the Premium. This Premium is largely driven by the price of Bitcoin. As Bitcoin rises, the company gains greater ability to finance additional purchases, which in turn inflates the projected value of its holdings and supports speculation in MSTR’s stock. If Bitcoin's value declined, the Premium would also likely fall. We estimate the relationship has a beta of approximately 1.77x , meaning the premium's value could drop significantly relative to Bitcoin. This decline would erode the value of the convertible’s option component. The fixed income portion of the convertible bonds is also at risk due to the same factor: the premium. The straight bond’s value depends in part on the company’s ability to raise future financing. Strategy does not generate sufficient revenues to service its fixed income obligations, let alone repay principal at maturity. A decline in the Premium would weaken Strategy’s financing capacity and likely result in wider credit spreads. This would reduce the value of the corporate bond portions of the convertibles. The precipitating cause of the attrition of the Premium would likely be a fall in BTC price. This decline in Bitcoin also aggravates the value of Strategy’s converts because of the lowered probability of full recovery value in the event of a BTC liquidation. This downside scenario is not presented as inevitable, but rather to highlight that both components of the convertible bond, the option and the bond itself, are tied to the same underlying drivers: the price of Bitcoin and the MSTR Premium. While some investors may be able to hedge these risks, many will struggle to understand them, let alone manage them effectively. MSTR convertibles may appeal to investors seeking yield with potential upside, but they involve many risks. These instruments may be suitable for sophisticated investors capable of executing dynamic hedging strategies and analyzing the behavior of equity-linked debt.

Any projections shown are those of VanEck and based on the firm’s own research, are for illustrative purposes only, are valid as of the posting date of this content and are subject to change without notice. However, Strategy’s converts provide an exciting vehicle for speculating on the advancement of crypto accounting practices. If credit rating agencies take a more favorable view of Bitcoin as collateral for debt, this could cause the credit spread to tighten dramatically. This should increase the value of Strategy’s converts significantly by increasing the bond portions. If Strategy’s bonds reach even Saylor’s least sanguine estimations of their “true” credit spreads, we calculate the median increase in convert value to be ( +16% ). In fact, the converts with a greater portion of bond value will see their prices increase the most. The two most appealing targets would be the 12/1/2029 ( +31% upside ) and the 3/1/2030 ( +26% upside ). Given that the 3/1/2030 is nearer to being in-the-money on its option, the combination of upside from the conversion of its credit spread to Saylor’s “BTC Credit” and its high option value may prove attractive to the intrepid speculator. However, for traditional long-only investors, these bonds present a bundle of risk exposures that may be too challenging to manage. On a relative basis, we believe they are less attractive than other parts of MSTR’s capital structure.

STRK Overview and Analysis STRK is called a “preferred perpetual convertible equity,” with several concepts rolled into one security. It provides a perpetual dividend at 8% of face value, and this dividend is payable in cash or common shares. However, there are restrictions on remitting common shares instead of dividends. These include capping the total number of shares that can be paid to satisfy the dividends, such as if MSTR’s value falls below 35% of its 1/27/2025 price of $347.92 . STRK also provides an option on MSTR shares with no maturity date (no theta decay to option component value) and liquidation rights typically associated with preferred equity. Like a convertible bond, but lower in seniority, it is a fixed income security with an attached call option that is deeply out of the money with a strike price at $1000, which is 2.5x higher than the price where MSTR currently trades (as of 5/7/2025). At the time of writing, we calculate that 36% of STRK’s price is derived from the call option, giving holders upside exposure to MSTR. Because MSTR’s volatility is so high and the option is perpetual in duration, STRK’s option on MSTR already trades at a delta near 1 despite it being deeply out-of-the-money. This means that the price fluctuations of STRK already closely mirror those of MSTR (in the option component of STRK). Until MSTR’s equity price approaches the conversion strike, we expect STRK to exhibit asymmetric sensitivity to changes in volatility, skewed heavily to the downside. For example, if implied volatility increases from approximately 80% to 120% , we estimate STRK would appreciate less than ( +0.01% ). However, if volatility declines from 80% to 40% , we project STRK’s price would fall by ( -3% ), and a further decline in volatility to 20% would result in a loss of approximately ( -19% ). This asymmetry arises because the embedded call option in STRK is currently far out of the money and perpetual in nature. In such cases, increases in volatility beyond a certain point do little to increase the option’s probability of finishing in the money, which flattens the upside response. Conversely, reductions in MSTR’s current volatility can sharply reduce the probability of finishing in the money, leading to disproportionately large price declines. This convex volatility exposure, limited upside, and substantial downside are key features of STRK’s risk profile. Stepping back, it is interesting to consider STRK as a security that pays you to be long a call option, but that upside is capped compared to even simply buying MSTR. STRK Value Falls Asymmetrically Lower with Volatility Declines Source: VanEck Research as of 4/7/2025. Any projections shown are those of VanEck and based on the firm’s own research, are for illustrative purposes only, are valid as of the posting date of this content and are subject to change without notice. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities named herein. From a pricing standpoint, we expect STRK’s price movements to be significantly muted relative to changes in MSTR’s equity price, both on the upside and the downside. For instance, we compute that a ( +100% ) increase in MSTR’s stock price would, all else equal, result in approximately a ( +37% ) increase in STRK’s price. Conversely, a ( -50% ) decline in MSTR’s stock would lead to an estimated ( -17% ) drop in STRK’s value. However, in downside scenarios, it is likely that STRK’s credit spread will also widen, which is an important factor that impacts the value of its preferred equity component. For example, if the credit spread increases by 500 basis points , rising from 700 bps to 1,200 bps , alongside a ( -50% ) decline in MSTR’s equity price, the combined effect could drive STRK’s price down by approximately ( -30% ). We believe this occurrence is likely because Strategy’s credit spread direction tends to follow MSTR price. Interestingly, STRK’s implied credit spread is closer to Saylor’s BTC-based estimation than Strategy’s converts. This implies there is less upside from STRK’s credit spread converging to Saylor’s calculations.

Assuming 200 bps embedded call option value in STRK. As noted above, Strategy intends to sell approximately $20B of additional STRK. These future issuances would further increase claims on the dividends generated by Strategy and thus its risk profile. Even without additional STRK sales, Strategy’s capacity to pay existing dividends in cash appears constrained. STRK is even further down the capital stack than Strategy’s suite of convertible notes, and the result is that Saylor classifies STRK’s BTC Risk for STRK to be much higher than the converts. In Strategy’s baseline assessment (not BTC price appreciation), there is a 46% chance that the value of Strategy’s BTC holdings will fall below the implied backing of STRK within a year. In our view, several structural elements of STRK present considerable downside risk without commensurate upside potential. These include weak BTC backing, the ability to suspend dividends, and the small option component of the bonds. Additionally, there is little opportunity to see price appreciation from credit spread re-rating. As a result, we believe the risk-reward profile of STRK is suboptimal for long-term investors, particularly when compared to the profile offered by MSTR equity. However, very active investors with a strong aptitude for hedging out STRK’s risk may find the volatility and dividend profile enticing. Income-oriented, active investors who would still like some upside from MSTR equity may be very enticed by STRK. Furthermore, very bullish long-term investors on Strategy may find STRK more interesting because its option component gives a delta of near 1 while also providing an attractive yield. STRF Overview and Analysis STRF is a plain-vanilla preferred equity instrument that pays a fixed 10% annual cash coupon. Unlike STRK, it does not have the flexibility to pay dividends in common shares. Currently, STRF trades at $94.30, so its effective annual yield is around 10.6% . Its valuation is primarily driven by prevailing interest rates and Strategy’s credit spread. Under the terms of the agreement between Strategy and STRF holders, each missed dividend payment results in a 100 basis point increase in the coupon rate, up to a maximum of 18% . If four consecutive payments, or eight in total, are missed, STRF holders gain the right to elect a director on the Strategy’s board. This right is revoked once all missed dividends are repaid. STRF ranks higher in the capital structure than both STRK and MSTR common equity, giving it stronger claims in the event of liquidation. However, that claim is weak as its BTC Rating is 5.8x compared to STRK’s at 5.3x. These protections are meaningful given that MSTR has not generated meaningful cash flow since 2021, but are still rather weak given BTC’s volatility. If MSTR’s core business deteriorates further or the company loses access to capital markets, it may suspend dividend payments. In such a case, STRF begins to resemble a long-duration, subordinated bond with significant credit risk but no equity upside. If this event happens concurrently with the decline in BTC, which is a likely scenario, the value of STRF will be materially affected. The largest challenge with STRF is that it will not benefit from the upside of Bitcoin while exposed to sharp BTC price declines. Since lower Bitcoin prices can impair Strategy’s ability to meet its cash obligations, it will increase its credit spreads. This view is backed up empirically because STRF is correlated 50% with MSTR and 55% with BTC. We calculate STRF credit spreads to be ~ 6.1% based on current market prices. If this credit spread approaches even the median of those of the convertible bonds, 10.25% , this would decrease the value of STRF by ( -28% ). Like STRK, STRF is heavily exposed to the price of BTC and the MSTR Premium. In our view, STRF presents a risk profile that does not make an ideal investment for a long-only investor because it is exposed to factors that are difficult to underwrite given STRF’s upside ceiling. However, the risk profile of STRF may be ideal for a very advanced investor who can apply the STRF dividends towards buying options for some BTC upside exposure or downside protection. Conclusion on Strategy’s Capital Stack The entire structure of Strategy’s capital stack is highly related to: BTC’s Price Strategy’s ability to raise more funds to buy BTC BTC’s and MSTR’s Price Volatilities MSTR offers an asymmetric investment profile that combines leveraged BTC exposure, regulatory accessibility, and public market liquidity. While the capital structure is complex and carries material risks, MSTR’s design gives investors a unique vehicle to participate in Bitcoin’s upside through difficult-to-replicate leverage and strategic optionality. For those unable or unwilling to hold Bitcoin directly or manage futures strategies, MSTR serves as a more practical and effective alternative. Continued investor confidence, stable access to capital markets, and disciplined execution remain essential to maintaining this investment thesis. Recommendations for Firms Considering a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy From a strategic standpoint, Strategy offers several key lessons for firms considering implementing a Bitcoin treasury strategy. First, there must be a clearly defined objective behind adopting a Bitcoin treasury. Strategy exemplifies this through its singular focus on increasing BTC holdings per share, rather than adhering to traditional financial metrics such as dilution or enterprise value in fiat terms. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, the firm has reoriented its valuation framework around Bitcoin itself. Saylor views success not in terms of dollar-based returns, but in the amount of Bitcoin each MSTR share represents. This clarity of purpose has enabled consistent, long-term decision-making, even amid market volatility. Second, a company must develop a well-structured financing strategy that leverages market dynamics to support BTC accumulation. Strategy accomplishes this aim by tapping into investor appetite for volatility and embedded optionality. Saylor has built a financial ecosystem that attracts retail investors and active traders through a mix of convertible bonds, preferred equity, and common stock issuances. The volatility of BTC feeds into MSTR’s volatility, which in turn sustains demand for its securities. For example, the open interest in MSTR’s equity options, which are used to trade against MSTR’s capital stack, is greater than [[GOOG]]’s and [[AMZN]]’s ( $95B vs $80B and $84B ). This dynamic exists despite GOOG’s market capitalization being 15x that of MSTR’s. This flywheel effect has allowed Strategy to finance its Bitcoin purchases at favorable terms, with low cash obligations, and without relying solely on traditional debt or equity issuance. Finally, firms pursuing similar strategies must recognize that market demand for BTC-linked securities will not materialize automatically. Investor engagement, innovative structuring, and transparent communication will be critical. Whether through traditional issuance, structured products, or digital asset integration, companies must craft financial instruments that provide both yield and/or substantial upside to attract capital. Because implementing the Bitcoin Treasury strategy will contradict most planks of financial theory, HOLDers must build an ironclad investment narrative that supports a Bitcoin strategy. Michael Saylor’s outsized public profile is no accident and demonstrates implicit recognition that the market needs to believe in the Bitcoin Treasury strategy to succeed. Key Risks to Strategy’s Bitcoin-Financing Model A range of macro, structural, and execution risks could impair Strategy’s ability to sustain its Bitcoin accumulation strategy and support MSTR’s valuation. 1. Decline in bitcoin price a. Strategy’s business model is predicated on BTC appreciation. A sustained drop in BTC price could undermine both the value of existing holdings and the viability of future financing. 2. Reduced volatility in BTC or MSTR a. Lower volatility diminishes investor interest in MSTR’s convertible bonds and preferred shares, which rely on optionality to attract capital. 3. Collapse of MSTR’s Premium to NAV a. The market premium above NAV fuels much of MSTR’s upside and its ability to issue accretive equity. A sharp contraction would impair capital-raising capacity and shareholder returns. 4. Deterioration of core business operations a. Though increasingly de-emphasized, Strategy’s software business still contributes to cash flow. Further erosion could limit financial flexibility during market downturns. 5. Regulatory changes enabling leveraged BTC products a. New ETFs or structured products offering leveraged BTC exposure could reduce demand for MSTR as a proxy vehicle. 6. Emerging competition from copycat strategies a. New firms adopting similar BTC treasury models may fragment investor interest and saturate capital markets seeking BTC exposure through leverage. b. New competitive upstarts can achieve higher BTC Yield and BTC per share than Strategy with less capital because they are smaller in size relative to Strategy 7. Forced liquidations to meet debt obligations a. In the event of severe drawdowns or financing shortfalls, Strategy could be compelled to sell BTC holdings to service debt, negatively impacting BTC per share. 8. Weakened demand for Strategy’s securities a. Strategy intends to raise over $22 billion to continue its BTC purchases. A drop in investor demand would compromise its ability to execute this plan. 9. Dilution of BTC per share holdings a. Actions such as issuing new shares to meet dividend or financing obligations could reduce BTC per share, undermining Strategy’s core KPI: Bitcoin yield. 10. Capital market instability a. MSTR’s business model depends on continuous access to functioning, liquid capital markets. Disruptions could threaten both operations and treasury expansion. 11. Rising interest rates a. Higher rates increase the cost of debt issuance and reduce investor appetite for low-yield convertibles, limiting Strategy’s ability to fund BTC acquisitions.

DISCLOSURES Definitions Bitcoin ((BTC)) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. The MVIS ® Global Digital Assets Equity Index (MVDAPP) tracks the performance of the largest and most liquid companies in the digital assets industry. BTC Yield is the % change, during a period, of the ratio between Bitcoin Holdings and Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding. BTC Gain is the number of bitcoins held by the Company at the beginning of a period multiplied by the BTC Yield for such period. BTC $ Gain is the dollar value of the BTC Gain calculated based on the market price of bitcoin as of the end of the period. BTC $ Income is the dollar value of the unrealized gain or loss in value of the portion of bitcoin acquired with any given financing that is reflected in the BTC Gain with respect to such financing, less the dividend or interest costs associated with the financing, during the applicable period. For example, if a $1 million financing results in a BTC Gain of 5, BTC $ Income would be the unrealized gain or loss in value on these 5 bitcoins, less the dividend or interest costs associated with such financing, during the applicable period. For any debt or liability with a maturity, BTC $ Income assumes refinancing of such debt or liability on the same terms on or prior to such maturity. BTC $ Income is presented for illustrative purposes only, and it does not represent \""income\"" in the traditional financial context. BTC $ Value is the sum of BTC $ Gain and BTC $ Income. BTC $ Value is presented for illustrative purposes only, and it does not represent “value” in the traditional financial context. BTC $ Equity is BTC NAV less BTC $ Value. BTC $ Equity is presented for illustrative purposes only, and it does not represent “equity” in the traditional financial context. BTC Torque is the ratio of BTC $ Value to BTC Capital. BTC Multiple is the ratio of BTC NAV to BTC $ Equity. BTC Risk is the annual probability of a liability with a given BTC Rating having a BTC Rating less than 1. This probability is based on a put option-implied probability using a Black-Scholes model to estimate the probability of an asset drawdown, as sourced from Bloomberg as of the dates presented. BTC Risk does not represent an actuarial risk rating or a rating from any rating agency, and it is not a risk rating in the traditional financial context. This metric is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not form the basis for an investment decision. BTC Credit is the credit spread necessary to offset BTC Risk for a given security. This metric is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not form the basis for an investment decision. BTC Credit Hurdle is the BTC ARR% necessary to create investment grade BTC Credit, based on the framework presented in this presentation. This metric is presented for illustrative purposes only and should not form the basis for an investment decision. BTC ARR% is an assumed annualized rate of return on BTC expressed as a percentage. This metric is presented for illustrative purposes only, and no prediction as to the price of bitcoin is being made. BTC Volatility is the assumed standard deviation of daily return of BTC expressed as a percentage. This metric is presented for illustrative purposes only, and no prediction as to the volatility of bitcoin is being made. BTC Price is the current market price of one bitcoin. BTC Hurdle is the BTC ARR% necessary to generate positive BTC $ Income with respect to any given financing. BTC Breakeven is the BTC ARR% necessary to generate positive BTC $ Value with respect to any given financing. BTC Premium is the embedded premium in market capitalization relative to BTC NAV. BTC Capital is the proceeds used from capital raised for the purpose of acquiring bitcoin. BTC Spread is the BTC Gain with respect to a given financing represented as a percentage of BTC Capital. BTC Spread is presented for illustrative purposes only, and it does not represent “spread” in the traditional financial context. BTC Parity is the BTC Price at which any given offering would result in no BTC Yield. BTC NAV represents the total number of bitcoin the Company holds as of a specified date multiplied by the current market price of one bitcoin (or the price of one bitcoin as of the date indicated). It does not take into account or include the Company’s indebtedness or the liquidation value of its perpetual preferred stock. As such, it is not equivalent to “net asset value” or “NAV” or any similar metric in the traditional financial context. Although it incorporates the label “NAV,” it is not a measure of either the net asset value of the Company or the value of the bitcoin held by the Company net of indebtedness, perpetual preferred stock liquidation preference and other obligations. Moreover, this Bitcoin NAV metric is not comparable to either net asset value or NAV metrics that may be reported by other companies, including ETFs, ETPs and mutual funds. Investors should rely on the financial statements and other disclosures contained in the Company’s SEC filings. This metric is merely a supplement, not a substitute. It should be used only by sophisticated investors who understand its limited purpose and many limitations. mNAV represents a multiple of Bitcoin NAV, as of the specified date, calculated as the Company’s enterprise value (as we define it) divided by Bitcoin NAV. The Company’s enterprise value is calculated as the sum of (a) the total market value of all outstanding MSTR common stock, including class A common stock and class B common stock, calculated by multiplying the number of outstanding shares of class A common stock and class B common stock by the closing price of the class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the applicable date, (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Company’s indebtedness and (c) the aggregate notional value of the Company’s outstanding perpetual preferred stock, less (d) the Company’s most recently reported cash balance value. As with Bitcoin NAV, although mNAV incorporates the label “NAV,” it is not equivalent to “net asset value” or “NAV” or any similar metric in the traditional financial context. Additionally, it is not a measure of the amount by which the enterprise value exceeds net asset value in the traditional financial sense of those terms. Investors should rely on the financial statements and other disclosures contained in the Company’s SEC filings. This metric is merely a supplement, not a substitute. It should be used only by sophisticated investors who understand their limited purpose and many limitations.

General Digital Assets Disclosures Investments in digital assets and Web3 companies are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: the technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; intense competition; slow adoption rates and the potential for product obsolescence; volatility and limited liquidity, including but not limited to, inability to liquidate a position; loss or destruction of key(s) to access accounts or the blockchain; reliance on digital wallets; reliance on unregulated markets and exchanges; reliance on the internet; cybersecurity risks; and the lack of regulation and the potential for new laws and regulation that may be difficult to predict. Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly. If their value goes down, there’s no guarantee that it will rise again. As a result, there is a significant risk of loss of your entire principal investment. Digital assets are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank and are not covered by FDIC or SIPC insurance. Accounts at digital asset custodians and exchanges are not protected by SPIC and are not FDIC insured. Furthermore, markets and exchanges for digital assets are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in traditional equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing.

The New York-listed company announced on May 23 that it purchased 21 BTC in exchange for 254,333 company shares— marking a $2.28 million investment into the flagship cryptocurrency. This purchase is just the beginning of a larger strategy laid out by DDC. On May 15, the company revealed plans to acquire a total of 5,000 BTC over the next three years, with a goal of purchasing 500 BTC before the end of 2025. In the near term, the firm said it expects to buy another 79 BTC in two separate transactions “in the coming days,” which would bring its short-term holdings to 100 BTC. DDC’s Bold Bitcoin Strategy DDC’s plan to accumulate thousands of Bitcoin positions it to potentially become one of the largest public corporate holders of the digital asset. If the company were to hold 5,000 BTC today, it would rank just outside the top 10 public firms with the largest Bitcoin reserves, behind Japan’s Metaplanet, which holds 7,800 BTC , according to Bitbo data. Despite its Bitcoin ambitions, DDC’s stock performance has struggled recently. On the same day as the Bitcoin announcement, DDC shares closed 14.5% lower but saw a slight after-hours recovery, climbing 2.43% to $3.79. Year-to-date, the company’s stock is down over 27%. Still, the decision to invest in Bitcoin reflects a growing trend among Asia-based companies and investors looking to diversify beyond traditional U.S. dollar-based assets. A recent report indicated that high-net-worth individuals across Asia are increasingly favoring cryptocurrencies, gold, and China-centric assets in response to global financial uncertainties. Rising Crypto Interest in the Region DDC is not alone in its crypto pivot. On May 22, Chinese electric vehicle retailer Jiuzi Holdings revealed a plan to acquire 1,000 BTC over the next year, either by issuing shares or through direct purchases. This marks a notable shift in sentiment, particularly given China’s ongoing ban on crypto transactions. Meanwhile, regulatory clarity is also emerging. Hong Kong recently passed its Stablecoin Bill , which will allow institutions to apply for stablecoin issuance licenses by the end of the year—further signaling the region’s cautious but growing embrace of digital assets. With Bitcoin making its way into the books of traditional businesses like DayDayCook, Asia’s crypto landscape appears to be quietly undergoing a major transformation.

The market’s recent recovery from a steep May 24 dip has turned attention back to whether bulls can muster enough momentum to pierce through $111,287 and retest the yearly high at $112,000. What’s driving this shift in tone?

This has extended a six-week streak to $10.5 billion and pushed year-to-date totals to a record $10.8 billion. Total assets under management briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion. These numbers come as investors appear to be diversifying amid a surge in concerns over the US economy following Moody’s downgrade. The United States dominated global cryptocurrency investment flows with $3.2 billion in weekly inflows. The economic uncertainty stems from Moody’s recent downgrade of US debt. Germany followed the US with $41.5 million in inflows, while Australia contributed $10.9 million and Hong Kong added $33.3 million to the positive flow column. In contrast, Swiss investors took a different approach, using recent price strength as an opportunity to secure profits. Switzerland recorded $16.6 million in outflows as investors apparently chose to lock in gains rather than maintain exposure during the current market conditions. Other regions showed mixed results, with Canada experiencing $25.6 million in month-to-date outflows despite maintaining $131 million in year-to-date inflows. Sweden continued its outflow trend with $12.1 million. This left the market weekly and $41.7 million monthly and contributed to $754 million in year-to-date outflows. Bitcoin dominates inflows According to CoinShares report , Bitcoin attracted $2.9 billion in weekly inflows and has maintained its position as the dominant digital asset for institutional investment. Ethereum also posted strong performance with $326 million in weekly inflows. This marks its highest single-week total in 15 weeks. This is the fifth consecutive week of positive flows for Ethereum. Interestingly, some investors viewed recent price gains as an opportunity for contrarian positioning. Short- Bitcoin products attracted $12.7 million in weekly inflows, the highest amount since December 2024. Source: CoinShares Other cryptocurrencies showed mixed results as Solana received modest inflows of $4.3 million weekly while XRP faced its first outflows in 80 weeks. Sui recorded $2.9 million in weekly inflows and $23.9 million month-to-date, while Cardano brought in $0.6 million weekly. Multi-asset products experienced minor weekly outflows of $1.9 million. However, they maintained positive month-to-date flows of $3.5 million. The total weekly inflows across all digital assets reached $3.29 billion, with total assets under management hitting $183.7 billion. XRP’s 80-week inflow streak ends XRP experienced a sharp shift in investor sentiment and concluded its historic 80-week consecutive inflow run with a historic outflow of $37.2 million in the week. It is the largest single-week outflow ever in the history of XRP investment products. The outflows were beyond a weekly horizon as XRP had $28.6 million in month-to-date outflows and still had $226 million in year-to-date inflows. Provider-specific data indicate mixed results in investment products. iShares ETFs/USA led the charge with $2.568 billion in week-on-week inflows, followed by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin F with $210 million of week-on-week inflows and $92 million year-to-date. Grayscale Investments posted continued outflows of $145 million month-to-date and $1.614 billion year-to-date. The XRP inflow streak is ending while the overall market remains healthy. This means that the outflows are specific to XRP and not representative of the overall cryptocurrency sentiment. Total digital asset investment product assets under management remained resilient at $183.7 billion.

The funding round was led by Blockstream CEO and Bitcoin veteran Adam Back, who personally invested $1.4 million. This bold move is turning heads across the health tech and financial worlds and could even inspire more companies across Europe to follow suit. 21,000,000 SEK has been raised in a convertible round led by the legendary @adam3us Accelerating our Bitcoin treasury strategy and strengthening our focus on sovereign health — let’s build! pic.twitter.com/SrpbKM2TID — H100 (@H100Group) May 25, 2025 Backed by Bitcoin Pioneer Adam Back Adam Back, a respected figure in the Bitcoin space and CEO of Blockstream, led the funding round with a personal contribution of $1.4 million. The rest of the capital – $800,000 – came from investment firms including Morten Klein, Alundo Invest AS, Race Venture Scandinavia AB, and Crafoord Capital Partners. The funds were raised through convertible loans with zero interest, maturing on June 15, 2028. These loans can be converted into H100 shares at a price of 1.3 SEK (around 11 US cents) per share. Bitcoin Strategy in Action H100 didn’t waste any time. The company announced its Bitcoin treasury strategy on May 22 and immediately bought 4.39 BTC. With the newly raised funds, it plans to purchase around 20.18 more Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to roughly 24.57 BTC. The market responded quickly. H100’s stock surged 37% on the day of the announcement, followed by another 5.33% gain the next day, closing at 1.29 SEK (14 US cents), according to Bloomberg data. Sweden’s First Public Company to Hold Bitcoin H100’s move marks a first for Sweden. No other public company in the country has added Bitcoin to its corporate treasury. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET, only about ten public companies in Europe currently hold Bitcoin, with 112 companies doing so globally. CEO Sander Andersen explained the reasoning behind the move. H100 develops health tools for people who prefer to avoid traditional healthcare systems. He believes Bitcoin’s values of personal freedom and decentralization align closely with H100’s mission. MicroStrategy Continues Its Bitcoin Buying Spree While H100 is just getting started, MicroStrategy is already deep into the Bitcoin game. On May 19, the company acquired another 7,390 Bitcoin worth nearly $765 million. That brings its total to an eye-catching 576,230 BTC. Co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at more purchases, saying he only buys Bitcoin with money he can’t afford to lose. His comments followed Bitcoin’s drop from its May 22 high of $112,000. Financial analyst Jeff Walton believes MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin strategy could eventually push the company’s valuation to $10 trillion . The company has made Bitcoin purchases for seven straight weeks as of May 26. Cardone Capital Mixes Bitcoin with Miami Real Estate Another sign of growing interest in Bitcoin is Cardone Capital’s latest fund.

His remarks were highlighted in a tweet posted by crypto analyst and social media figure CryptoSensei, who shared the clip with the caption: “BREAKING: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse breaks down in under a minute why crypto ETFs are a game-changer. #XRP.” BREAKING: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse breaks down in under a minute why crypto ETFs are a game-changer. #XRP pic.twitter.com/qtE1EHplpR — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) May 24, 2025 Limited Access Kept Institutions on the Sidelines Garlinghouse began the video by acknowledging the irony of his inclusion on the platform after having been overlooked for some time. He then explained the core reasons driving institutional excitement around crypto ETFs. According to Garlinghouse, two primary developments make these financial products a turning point for the industry. Garlinghouse noted that institutional investors—particularly those operating within the traditional finance ecosystem on Wall Street—have historically lacked a straightforward path to enter the cryptocurrency market. Previously, participation in the digital asset space required self-custody solutions or onboarding through centralized exchanges, both of which come with limitations and, in many cases, compliance concerns. These constraints had prevented various institutions, such as endowments, pension funds, and mutual funds, from directly engaging with digital assets. ETFs Provide Regulatory On-Ramps for Capital Inflows Garlinghouse emphasized that crypto ETFs change this equation by offering a regulated, accessible investment vehicle that institutions can utilize without the complexity of direct custody. Through ETFs, entities effectively sidelined from the digital asset space due to operational or regulatory barriers can now participate. He described this access as an “unlock,” enabling capital previously on the sidelines to enter the market through compliant, traditional financial infrastructure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This structural change allows a broader array of financial participants to include crypto exposure within their portfolios, all while operating within the same frameworks they already use for stocks, commodities, and bonds. For many institutions, this marks the first time they can invest in digital assets without deviating from established protocols or assuming added technical risk. Industry Legitimacy and Rapid Growth of Crypto ETFs Garlinghouse also addressed the broader implications for the cryptocurrency sector itself, suggesting that the advent of ETFs contributes to the institutionalization of the industry. He pointed to the performance of the Bitcoin ETF as evidence, stating it was the fastest ETF to reach $1 billion in assets under management. Furthermore, he claimed that it surpassed $10 billion faster than any other ETF and projected that it would eventually approach the scale of the gold ETF, which has long served as a benchmark for institutional-grade commodity investment. His statements support the view that crypto ETFs do more than increase access—they affirm the legitimacy of digital assets within mainstream finance. As regulatory clarity improves, ETFs will likely serve as a model for how the sector integrates into global capital markets. Expectations for XRP and the Broader ETF Landscape While Garlinghouse’s remarks did not specifically address the potential for an XRP ETF , using the hashtag “#XRP” in CryptoSensei’s tweet signals the interest surrounding this possibility. Supporters of XRP have long advocated for the asset’s inclusion in regulated investment vehicles, arguing that it would allow institutions to gain exposure to one of the most widely used digital assets in cross-border payments. Garlinghouse concluded the video by noting that these developments are occurring rapidly and their cumulative impact is substantial. His statement reflects the growing consensus among many digital asset proponents that ETFs are not merely about accessibility—they are about integration into the broader financial system.

2025-05-26T10:37:30.000Z,"BITO: Buy For Upside And Income With Risks","Summary BITO offers indirect bitcoin exposure with substantial recent payouts, but its dividend policy lacks clarity and reliability for income-focused investors. BITO outperforms option-based income ETFs in total returns, especially during bitcoin bull runs, while preserving more NAV than aggressive yield products like YBIT. Despite futures-based inefficiencies and tracking error, BITO is attractive for investors seeking bitcoin exposure with potential income, especially in brokerage or IRA accounts. BITO is a Buy for bullish bitcoin investors prioritizing total returns over income stability; for others, spot ETFs like IBIT or FBTC may be better choices. The ProShares Bitcoin ETF ( BITO ) is a derivative based indirect ownership vehicle for bitcoins, and potentially the only one. The recent payouts are substantial. The use case is to enable investors seeking bitcoin exposure to allow transactions from regular broker accounts. The Dividend Rush The dividend or payout yield in the past year has been ~55% - material for a direct exposure, non option income generating ETF. I do not see any income or dividend policy details in the prospectus . An income plan will usually explicitly mention the income objective, but BITO only talks about tracking bitcoins. It appears that the payout heavy approach is a recent strategy. There is no mention of this change being a part of why the name changed from Bitcoin Strategy ETF to simply Bitcoin ETF somewhere around July to September 2024. But in the first year and half, we did not see any dividends. Payouts started only after that and has seen an even further increase around the time the name was changed. Data by YCharts Given the unsolved official communication around the payout policy, we can assume that the payouts are definitely a return of capital invested. And more importantly, we cannot rely on the dividend payout as a policy if evaluating BITO as an income ETF. Even if the dividends are likely to be paid out in future as well, the quantum and strategy remains vague until the fund officially communicates its policy. The Concept of Paying Out on Capital Conceptually, in a lot of income ETFs I have analyzed, I have repeatedly highlighted how income ETFs relying on option premium income does worse than a vehicle like BITO. The underlying theory is this. Covered calls restrict upsides, but ideally do better when the underlying asset corrects or stagnates. However, the downside protection is not commensurate to the upside opportunity loss. If you are overall bullish in the underlying, investing directly in it and withdrawing periodic income will outperform the option writing income avatar. If you are not bullish, then you will anyway face the downside erosions. It is hard to support a use case for such ETFs in flat markets, where it works best. Withdrawing income from regular direct exposures is where active payout management becomes a deterrent for some investors. That is where ETFs like BITO become useful. I expect such a vehicle to combine the best of both worlds. Overall total returns should be higher than the income ETF equivalent. Management overhead of generating income is taken out. So, income seeking investors will benefit in the long run from BITO. Only that the income commitment from the management is not reliable and consistent, unless you go by the fact that there are payouts made today. To see how the total return of such a vehicle outperforms the income variant, take a look at BITO vs YBIT below. In the common period of existence, spanning only about a year, the total return of BITO is ~52% vs ~8% from YBIT. Certainly, this large outperformance has been helped by a bull run in the past year overall on bitcoins, but you are likely to see outperformance in BITO, although to a lesser degree (but still significantly higher), when bitcoin runs through different market cycles over the years. Data by YCharts NAV Retention One of the benefits of a payout plan, depending on the outlook of the investor, is the fact that such ETFs continually de-risk investors from the underlying. Imagine investing $100 and receiving income of $100 over a few years, and then riding the underlying for free. Of course, there is a loss of the compounding effect till this breakeven point is reached (say 2 years for BITO at current rate) - which is why I said this benefit depends on what the investor wants. Also, I assume de-risking from an underlying is mostly helpful for a case where the income proceeds are re-invested in less risky assets. Now, all income plans do de-risk investors from the underlying, but I think a non option investment vehicle like BITO preserves more NAV while paying out aggressively. And this is where I am also unsure about what BITO's objective function is. An income ETF may prioritize payouts, as seen in most YieldMax products. It could also prioritize preserving NAV. Looking at the share price or NAV alone, it does look like BITO prioritizes maintaining a decent exposure versus payout. See how YBIT NAV has collapsed by ~47% in one year in a bid to keep aggressive payouts. BITO NAV has only eroded by ~18%. IF that is the case, it means two things. One, as said earlier, BITO's dividend payouts will only be aggressively high as seen today when bitcoin outperforms or rallies. Two, investors will retain a decent interest in the underlying bitcoin asset over time. Data by YCharts Other Alternatives There are alternatives now with direct exposure to bitcoin like IBIT and FBTC which do not use the futures route and hence potentially save on costs. A total return comparison also shows the expected underperformance for BITO. The best vehicle would be if IBIT and FBTC paid out like BITO. Then we would have not had BITO's futures based inefficiencies, yet an income generating plan with no upside cap. But that is not the case, and we will have to choose between these variants, unless we invest in IBIT and FBTC and derive income ourselves. Data by YCharts Buy BITO Despite its Inefficiencies The case for Buy BITO is very interesting. It is not the most efficient bitcoin rider due to its futures based underlying structure. But it does provide an investment option with income generating capabilities (without management hassles of deriving income on your own). It is certainly better than the option selling equivalents in terms of total returns. There are other corner case uses of BITO as well. It is useful for short-term traders and investors who want exposure to Bitcoin price movements without owning spot Bitcoin or using crypto exchanges. It can be traded in IRAs and brokerage accounts, and avoids the custody, wallet, and tax complexities of direct crypto ownership. BITO may also be beneficial in rising interest rate environments, as it generates dividend income from cash collateral as well. Options traders may prefer BITO because it has an active and liquid options market, enabling a wide range of strategies like covered calls, puts for downside hedging, straddles, and spread trades, all within a regulated ETF wrapper. However, due to futures roll costs, tracking error, and higher expense ratios, it’s not ideal for long-term holding. Bottom line, BITO is a Buy for the investor outlined below is bullish bitcoin prioritizes higher total returns over income stability can wade through periods of potentially low income For all other cases, better alternatives are available. IBIT FBTC for long-term ownership and YBIT for pure income outlook.",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789812-bito-buy-for-upside-and-income-with-risks?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING","BITO",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T10:30:00.000Z,"Decentralization in Question After Cetus Hack and Ledger Scam Letters","The cryptocurrency ecosystem is grappling with two major security crises that shed light on the growing concerns around decentralization and evolving attack vectors. On May 22, decentralized exchange Cetus was exploited for $223 million due to a flaw in its automated market maker (AMM) code—prompting a controversial decision by Sui network validators to freeze a majority of the stolen funds. Meanwhile, scammers impersonating hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger have taken phishing into the physical realm, mailing fake letters via the United States Postal Service (USPS) in an attempt to extract sensitive user data. Cetus DEX Hack Exposes Critical Vulnerabilities in Web3 Infrastructure as Debate Over Decentralization Intensifies In a sobering reminder of the persistent vulnerabilities plaguing decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain security firm Dedaub has published a detailed post-mortem report on the recent $223 million hack of Cetus, a decentralized exchange (DEX) operating on the Sui Network. The attack , which unfolded over a 24-hour period on May 22, saw hackers exploit a critical flaw in Cetus’ automated market maker (AMM) code, leveraging an unchecked overflow in its liquidity parameters. The breach not only resulted in one of the largest DeFi losses of 2025 but has also sparked a heated controversy within the crypto community over the actions taken by Sui validators to freeze a significant portion of the stolen funds, a move that many argue undermines the principles of decentralization. Dedaub Report: A Critical Overflow in the AMM Code According to the report released by Dedaub, the root cause of the hack was a vulnerability in the AMM’s liquidity parameter code, specifically, an ineffective ”most significant bits” (MSB) check. This flaw allowed attackers to artificially inflate their liquidity positions with just a minimal input of tokens, creating an imbalance they could exploit to drain liquidity pools. ”This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input,” Dedaub’s security researchers wrote. ”Subsequently, they were able to drain pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens.” The exploit represents a particularly dangerous type of overflow bug where the parameters used to validate transactions fail to properly check the size of numeric values. By manipulating these values to astronomical proportions, the attackers could bypass normal safeguards and execute transactions that effectively broke the AMM’s logic. $223 Million Drained—But $163 Million Frozen Within hours of the attack being discovered, Cetus and the Sui Foundation acted swiftly. Working with Sui network validators and ecosystem partners, they managed to freeze approximately $163 million of the stolen $223 million. The rapid response significantly blunted the full potential impact of the exploit, but it also set off a firestorm of debate across the crypto community. While the freezing of assets was celebrated by some as a necessary step to mitigate user losses, it drew harsh criticism from decentralization purists who viewed it as a troubling act of censorship. On X, several users accused the Sui validators of undermining the very ethos of blockchain technology. One user wrote, ”Sui validators are actively censoring transactions across the blockchain. This completely undermines the principles of decentralization and transforms the network into nothing more than a centralized, permissioned database.” Others pointed to what they saw as a growing trend among VC-backed Web3 projects relying on centralized interventions while still branding themselves as decentralized. Steve Bowyer, a prominent blockchain developer, commented , ”It’s interesting how many Web3 projects backed by VCs lean heavily on centralization, despite borrowing Bitcoin’s ethos.” The Cetus hack joins a growing list of high-profile exploits that continue to shake confidence in DeFi systems. In the past year alone, billions have been lost across bridges, DEXs, and lending platforms, often through similar overflow or unchecked math errors buried deep in smart contract code. Industry executives and security researchers alike have stressed that unless protocols begin prioritizing robust auditing, stress testing, and formal verification, the cycle of exploit and patch will continue. Moreover, the industry faces the looming shadow of increased regulatory oversight. Many experts argue that if projects fail to implement adequate user protections, regulators will step in to do it for them, potentially in ways that are incompatible with blockchain’s permissionless vision. Cetus’ Path Forward and Sui’s Growing Pains Despite the controversy, Cetus has vowed to improve its codebase and restore user trust. The team has stated that it will work with Dedaub and other third-party auditors to revamp its AMM logic and enhance overall protocol security. Meanwhile, the Sui Foundation has defended the validators’ decision to freeze funds, framing it as an emergency measure necessary to protect the broader ecosystem. In a statement, a spokesperson emphasized that the network's flexibility allowed for swift action that ultimately saved users from greater losses. Still, the damage—both reputational and financial—is done, and the hack stands as a defining moment for the Sui ecosystem as it balances innovation with operational maturity. Fake Ledger Letters Mark New Era in Phishing Attacks as Crypto Scammers Go Physical Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency industry is facing a new and unsettling evolution in phishing attacks, as scammers posing as hardware wallet maker Ledger have begun sending physical scam letters to unsuspecting users in an attempt to trick them into ”validating” their wallets or risk losing access to their funds. The letters, delivered via the United States Postal Service (USPS), represent a significant shift in phishing tactics, adding a real-world component to an industry that has long battled digital deception. First revealed by BitGo CEO Mike Belshe, the scam includes a QR code that allegedly redirects victims to a phishing website designed to capture their seed phrases and private keys, ultimately draining their wallets. A copy of the scam Phishing letter (Source: Mike Belshe ) The physical phishing letter, designed to resemble official Ledger correspondence, urges users to scan a QR code to ”validate” their wallets, claiming they risk losing access if they fail to do so. But as BitGo’s Belshe and others quickly warned, this is a malicious scam attempting to take advantage of user trust in Ledger’s brand and reputation. The fact that the letters were mailed through USPS adds an element of authenticity to the attack. Unlike email or SMS phishing, which can be filtered or flagged, postal mail bypasses digital defenses and taps into an older form of psychological manipulation: official-looking documents with urgent warnings. At the time of writing, Ledger has not responded publicly to the latest phishing campaign, though the company has in the past dealt with related incidents, including data breaches that exposed customer information and led to phishing emails, fake websites, and malicious applications. This most recent attack highlights the long-term fallout from Ledger’s 2020 data breach, in which over 270,000 users' personal information was leaked, including names, addresses, and phone numbers, giving scammers a years-long head start on their social engineering efforts. Phishing Evolves: A Bigger, Bolder Threat Phishing has long been a scourge in the cryptocurrency world, but 2025 has already seen a notable escalation. Earlier this year, $330 million in Bitcoin was stolen from a single elderly victim, according to blockchain sleuth ZackXBT, who identified two suspects involved in the elaborate social engineering heist. This incident suggests growing professionalization of crypto crime, with scammers establishing entire call centers, hiring developers, and exploiting psychological vulnerabilities at a scale previously unseen. Just weeks later, on May 15, Coinbase disclosed that it had been the target of a $20 million ransom attempt following a significant internal leak. According to the company, contractors working in customer service had leaked sensitive user data to threat actors, resulting in a partial breach. The leaked data included names, physical addresses, contact information, and other non-critical account details of a small subset of users. Coinbase stated that no private keys, login credentials, or access to Coinbase Prime accounts were compromised, and that the contractors involved had been terminated. Still, the breach drew sharp criticism from industry figures, including TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, who warned of the potential for real-world violence against exposed users.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9262/decentralization-in-question-after-cetus-hack-and-ledger-scam-letters,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|WALLET|SUI","News|Crypto",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T10:28:43.000Z,"Pakistan Assigns 2 GW Power to Crypto and AI Centers","Pakistan is starting a massive initiative to use surplus electricity to support bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence-powered data centers. According to the Finance Ministry, 2,000 megawatts of electricity will be allocated for this purpose in the first phase. The new project is a response to growing difficulties in the national energy sector, where electricity tariffs remain high and production capacity markedly exceeds demand. In recent years, the rapid development of solar energy has further exacerbated the situation, with more and more consumers switching to alternative power sources to reduce their costs. This has resulted in a significant surplus in the country's energy market. The government is now looking for ways to effectively monetize the excess energy. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), a government body that promotes the development of digital infrastructure and the introduction of new technologies, is coordinating the initiative. The main objectives of the project are not only to capitalize on surplus generation but also to create new high-tech jobs and attract foreign investment to this promising sector. The announced distribution of 2,000 megawatts of electricity marks the first stage of a larger project aimed at the phased deployment of modern digital infrastructure in Pakistan. Authorities expect that successful implementation of this strategy will stabilize the energy market and help turn Pakistan into a regional hub for mining and data processing. Global Trends in Using Surplus Energy for Digital Innovation Pakistan’s move to channel surplus electricity into bitcoin mining and AI-powered data centers mirrors a growing global trend. Around the world, countries with abundant or excess energy supplies are seeking innovative ways to monetize this resource and foster technological advancement. For example, Iceland and Canada, with their plentiful renewable energy, have become attractive destinations for cryptocurrency mining operations. These countries benefit from cooler climates that naturally reduce the costs of cooling large data centers, making such ventures even more economically viable. Similarly, nations in the Middle East, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, are investing heavily in digital infrastructure, using surplus energy from their vast oil and solar resources to power advanced data centers and blockchain projects. These initiatives not only help balance national energy grids but also drive economic diversification, create high-skilled jobs, and attract foreign investment. By following this international trend, Pakistan is positioning itself to become a key player in the digital economy of the region. The country’s efforts to harness surplus energy for technology-driven industries could pave the way for greater innovation, enhanced energy management, and a stronger presence on the global stage.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/9263/pakistan-assigns-2-gw-power-to-crypto-and-ai-centers,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|COMMODITY|MARKET|MINING","News|Crypto",cryptocompare

At first, the victim tried to move 843,166 Tether (USDT) to another wallet but ended up transferring it to the wrong address. However, the victim again sent out $1.7 million worth of USDT to the same wrong address. Data shows that the victim (0x86C0300Fc369E) had moved $838,611 worth of USDT to a correct address (0x4668D1Fe87444a4d7508e83c89bfDAF1117e6B76) just before falling prey to scammers. Transactions show that the suffer’s wallet received zero assets from a wallet address 0x4668EE748c88DA4FEc595773b22f96f366eD6B76, which led to a major mistake. Scam Sniffer in a post suggested that it is a prime display of Transaction History Poisoning. In this con trick, scammers send a fake or dust transfer with a similar address. As their fake address appears in the ledger history, a victim copies the address from history thinking it’s legitimate but the funds get sent to a scammer instead. According to a report, crypto users lost $5.29 million to phishing scams in April 2025. It was a 17% drop from March. However, the number of victims jumped 26% to 7,565 addresses hit, which is up from 5,992 in March. 🚨 ScamSniffer April 2025 Phishing Report April losses: $5.29M | 7,565 victims VS March: -17% in losses | +26% in victims Key insight: Notable spike in victim count despite lower total losses.

This implies that even the savviest, high-value players remain vulnerable. For comparison, the top March loss was $1.82 million, again via phishing signatures. The second-biggest April attack saw one user lose $700,000 after copying the wrong address. Another user lost $150,000, while 0xEFc4f1d5 also sent over $467K to the wrong address in the same way. SlowMist flags another security alert SlowMist has also issued a security alert in a post where multiple users have reported receiving SMS messages from “well-known exchanges”. The message says that “Your withdrawal verification code is xxx. If you did not request this transaction, call xxx immediately for assistance.” Once calling back to the number, a user is being told that it’s a “security breach” and get connected to someone claiming to be from “hardware wallet support.” Later, the scammers guide the victims to a phishing site and trick them into entering their mnemonic phrase. This has resulted in cold wallet thefts worth over $1 million, till now. Recently, one of the most infamous phishing gangs in crypto, Inferno Drainer, exploited Ethereum’s latest upgrade to drain wallets. On May 24, Scam Sniffer flagged a case where a wallet recently upgraded to EIP-7702 lost nearly $150,000. EIP-7702 is a part of the Pectra upgrade which allows Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to temporarily act like smart contract wallets during transactions. Slowmist founder Yu Xian stated that the Inferno Drainer carried out the theft using a more sophisticated version of traditional phishing. It was unlike any earlier scams that hijack user wallets directly. He mentioned that the scammer used a delegated MetaMask wallet, one already authorized under EIP-7702. This allowed the hackers to approve token transfers silently through a batch authorization process. In this process, the victim unknowingly triggered an “execute” command within MetaMask that led to processing malicious batch data in the background. In the end, tokens were drained. The digital assets industry witnesses such attacks when the market is trading high and traders are all in with the hunger to bag more profits. The crypto market has registered several highs over the last week, while the fear and greed index is flashing “Greed” among the traders. The cumulative crypto market cap is running up to hit the $3.5 trillion mark, and Bitcoin, the biggest digital asset, posted its fresh ATH of over $111,900 on May 22.

2025-05-26T10:12:53.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Brushes Off Geopolitical Jitters: Here Is the Next Target in Sight","Bitcoin clawed back losses on Monday, rising to nearly $110,000 after US President Donald Trump’s unexpected EU tariff announcement rattled markets over the weekend. A key technical pattern has now emerged, which could potentially hint at the next major move in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing price trend. Bitcoin’s Double Bottom Formation Bitcoin may be on track to reach $112,000 following the activation of a classic double bottom pattern, according to CryptoQuant’s report . The pattern—often viewed as a strong bullish reversal signal—formed around key support levels at $106,800 on May 23 and $106,600 on May 25, with a neckline at $109,000. The price has since broken above the neckline and is currently trading above $109,400. CryptoQuant noted that this breakout occurred with strong trading volume, thereby indicating growing bullish momentum. If the breakout level continues to hold as support, analysts believe a move toward the pattern’s projected target of $112,000 is likely. “Double bottoms are where the market says: ‘We’ve sold enough.’ When buyers defend the second bottom, it sends a message: Now it’s our turn. But remember, not every pattern plays out. Know your risk, make your decision.” As Bitcoin holds firm above key technical levels, gauging the on-chain metrics reveals a quiet tug-of-war unfolding beneath the surface. Bullish Continuation Likely Bitcoin’s recent price action reveals a growing divergence between retail behavior and whale activity, as per the latest on-chain analysis . Despite prices grinding higher, exchange netflows remain negative, which implies that more BTC is leaving exchanges than entering. At the same time, the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio has dropped below 1.0. This figure signals that aggressive selling continues, which is likely driven by retail investors de-risking. However, the absence of large inflow spikes suggests there’s no widespread panic or major distribution. Analysts have interpreted this as a potential stealth accumulation phase by smart money. If prices hold amid rising sell pressure, a short squeeze and bullish continuation could follow.

Kiyosaki predicts Bitcoin could reach $1 million by 2035. Robert Kiyosaki, author of the best-selling personal finance book Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again endorsed Bitcoin, calling it the “easiest way to get rich” in today’s economic environment. In a post shared Sunday night, Kiyosaki urged followers to consider even fractional ownership of the digital asset. “Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me,” he wrote. “Even 0.01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years… and maybe make you very rich.” Bitcoin is Approaching the ‘Banana Zone’ Kiyosaki warned that with only 2 million BTC left to be mined, the price is poised to enter what macro investor Raoul Pal calls the “Banana Zone” — a phase of explosive growth driven by scarcity and demand. He advised followers not to be “yellow bananas,” but instead to open their eyes and minds by following thought leaders like Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano, and platforms like Bitcoin Zella, which promote the long-term value of decentralized money. I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years…. and maybe make you very rich. Sure Bitcoin goes up and down….but so does real life.… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) May 26, 2025 The comments came as Bitcoin traded around $109,600, rebounding after a brief dip linked to global trade tensions. Prices stabilized following U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to delay a threatened 50% tariff on European Union goods, which offered short-term relief to financial markets, including digital assets. Kiyosaki’s post adds to a growing list of statements he’s made over the years in support of Bitcoin . On May 10, he criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve by quoting former Congressman Ron Paul, who equated central bank interest rate controls with “price fixing” and likened them to Marxist-style economic intervention. Echoing Paul’s views, Kiyosaki warned that fiat currencies and central banking mechanisms breed systemic dishonesty and undermine individual freedom. He encouraged people to protect their wealth by holding decentralized, non-government assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. “Fake money leads to dishonest leaders and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki wrote. “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard.” Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Sees $1M Bitcoin by Next Decade A longtime advocate of hard assets, Kiyosaki sees Bitcoin as a modern hedge against inflation and a tool for preserving wealth over time. In his latest prediction , Kiyosaki said he “strongly believes” the Bitcoin price will reach $180,000 to $200,000 by the end of this year. Over the next decade, he sees BTC at $1 million, gold at $30,000 per ounce, and silver at $3,000. Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Last week, crypto analyst Scott Melker said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure.

Besides, if Ripple acquires Circle, XRP’s utility could skyrocket as it becomes deeply integrated with one of the largest stablecoins. This would boost demand for XRP as a key bridge asset in global payments and DeFi. But if the case continues to drag on, then it may stay between $2-$3. In a worst-case scenario, like losing in court or a crypto market crash, XRP could drop to $1-$2. Meanwhile, xAI’s Grok gave a slightly more bullish outlook, predicting XRP could hit $3.50–$4.50. June Could Be The Game Changer Analysts also point out that three events are set to take place in mid-June that could send XRP soaring. From June 10 to 12, Ripple’s Developer Summit (XRPL Apex) is expected to reveal major tech updates such as AI-powered payments, real-world asset tokenization, and super simple cross-chain swaps. These upgrades could boost XRP’s real-world utility. On June 17, the SEC might approve a spot XRP ETF. This could impact XRP’s price similarly to how spot Bitcoin ETFs pushed BTC past $100 K. On the same day, the Federal Reserve may announce an interest rate cut, increasing liquidity in the markets. Historically, such moves boost risky assets like cryptocurrencies, driving prices higher. XRP could run 5-6x, climbing from around $2 now up to $10-$12 by late summer 2025 . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price to Hit New All-Time Highs Soon, Expert Says ‘It’s Realistic’ , Delays Possible? However, the rally could be delayed as well if the ETF is pushed back again, or if the Fed holds a rate cut. However, analysts claim that these are just delays and not denials, as the long-term growth prospects remain strong. If all goes well, XRP could jump from $2 to $12, matching its previous 6x surge. Analysts believe that the downside risk to $1.50 is limited, but the upside is massive. However, Veteran trader Peter Brandt warns that XRP could soon drop to $1.07, over a trend reversal after its recent gain of 5%. But the fundamentals are strong for Ripple. And despite the SEC delays, the odds of XRP ETF approval have climbed to 83% , which shows a bullish outlook for XRP’s future. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-05-26T10:00:00.000Z,"MUTM could be your best shorter-term bet of 2025: here is why","Every crypto investor desires to find a winning opportunity that could help make huge instant profits. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the opportunity you have been looking for. It is one of those rare opportunities in crypto to make short-term gains by trading outside of well-known names like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly picking up pace based on a variety of factors, all of which have ignited a fierce debate online about how fast one could 10x their investment with this project. Most commentators believe that in just a few days after it goes public, the MUTM token’s value will increase 10 times. There are many reasons to believe this school of thought, chief among them being the performance of the ongoing presale. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, which is in phase 5, has thus far raised over $9.25 million from over 11,100 investors. Nearly 5% of tokens set aside for the phase 5 presale have already been taken off the table, with a steady increase in pace experienced in the past 48 hours. The increase in uptake comes despite the 200% increase in price from the phase 1 price of $0.01, and the 20% increase in price from the phase 4 price of $0.025. At the current price of $0.03, buyers are guaranteed a 100% return on their investment, based on the expected listing price of $0.06. Further gains are to be expected, with the team working to get a listing on several mainstay crypto exchanges. While nothing is confirmed yet, a listing on one or two of these leading global exchanges could guarantee the price rises by over 10x in just a few days after it gets listed. To take full advantage of this upcoming opportunity, now would be the best time to participate in the presale before the price rises by 16.67% in phase 6 to $0.035 per token. Real world utility will drive growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a new breed of projects that has become rarer in recent months. It focuses on long-term gains and solid rewards for its holders, which will ensure a sustained momentum that could make it the most valuable project in the DeFi space. The main utility of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) derives from its lending protocol, which is designed as a decentralized noncustodial liquidity protocol where lender and borrowers can engage with each other. Its lending protocol comes with two modes, which are the P2P and P2C. With the P2C mode, lenders deposit assets, which could be $10,000 worth of ETH, and in exchange, they receive an annual percentage interest, which is based on the lending pool’s utilization rate. Borrowers, on the other hand, gain easy access to overcollateralized loans. When using the P2P mode, lenders and borrowers interact directly without a third party and set the terms for loans. For lenders, it creates an opportunity to set higher interest rates, while for borrowers, it is an opportunity to set loan terms that are more favorable to them. To ensure fair price discovery for all parties, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will use a robust oracle infrastructure, with the main source of data planned to be the Chainlink data feeds. These feeds are widely utilized in the DeFi world as a source of verifiable, and reliable price data. The feeds can provide price data based on YS, and various native crypto assets like MATIC, AVAX, and ETH. Consequently, it will give the team the ability to flexibly integrate them across multiple chains. The team also plans to implement fallback oracles, which will serve as a backup in case the primary source of price data goes down. That will ensure the highest uptime possible for all participants. They are also looking into using aggregate feed, which combines multiple oracles to reduce overreliance on one source of truth. Additionally, where there is sufficient on-chain liquidity, Mutuum Finance plans to utilize the data as an additional reference point. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rewards users With the deep understanding of how important early adopters can be to the success of an ecosystem, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has prioritized making them feel special. On the project’s dashboard, they have a leaderboard, where the top 50 contributors to the ongoing token presale receive spot bonus rewards in MUTM tokens. The project is also hosting a $100K giveaway, targeting to give away $10K each to 10 lucky winners. The entry barrier for this rewards program is quite low, with the main requirement being the purchase of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not holding back when it comes to rewarding its early adopters. Not only do you stand to make a 100% guaranteed return on your investment at the current price of $0.03 per token, but you also stand to win thousands of dollars’ worth of MUTM by participating in the presale.

2025-05-26T09:56:00.000Z,"Bitcoin Price Prediction: Are $250K Targets Too Conservative For BTC In 2025?","The BTC price has been on the fly recently, skyrocketing to flirt with its recent highs in the $107k to $111k zone. But top analysts say that BTC is just warming up, predicting it could easily smash $250k amid huge institutional inflows and pro-crypto developments in the U.S. Let’s examine what’s likely to happen as the BTC ushers the crypto market into its next leg up and one notable crypto gem that has been dominating the market’s attention in recent weeks. Bitcoin price rockets to a new ATH Bitcoin reached a high of $109k in January in a massive post-election rally following the election of pro-crypto president Donald Trump. After a deep pullback to the $74k region, Bitcoin is at it again, skyrocketing nearly 50% in the past two months to print a new ATH in the $111k zone. Source: CoinMarketCap The crypto bellwether is now up over 55% year-to-date as its market cap rolls to a cool $2.13 trillion. Though BTC is expected to slow down and accumulate near its recent highs, analysts predict it could pull another massive rally toward new heights. Bitcoin price prediction: Can BTC smash $250 this year? One market pundit, Fred Krueger , posits that BTC could scale new heights in the $150,000 to $600,000 zone in 90 days! While $600k might be overambitious, data-driven BTC price predictions from CoinCodex spell a bright future for the crypto king. According to the data, BTC is forecasted to remain bullish through 2025, potentially pulling another 67% upsurge to print a new ATH in the $180k zone! Surging institutional inflows are cited as the major bullish factor likely to drive BTC to these new price thresholds. In May, investors poured a landmark $3.6 billion into spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting strong institutional confidence in BTC’s prospects. Companies like Metaplanet and MicroStrategy have also been going big, continuing their aggressive accumulation spree with a recent purchase of $870 million in BTC. Recently, Metaplanet issued $15 million in zero-interest bonds to facilitate its acquisition of 21,000 BTC as MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stash reaches 576,230! Bitcoin is also expected to draw significant momentum from the pro-crypto White House. Since President Trump vowed to make the US the crypto capital of the world, several states have been racing to pass Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bills to pave the way for Bitcoin’s integration into government financial systems. In fact, analysts view this current bull cycle as stable and structurally sound, associating it with improving crypto regulations in the US. Supportive crypto policies have sparked interest from traditional financial institutions. Even Jamie Dimon recently said that JPMorgan will start allowing Bitcoin investments! BTC investors are also piling into utility tokens The insane interest from institutional investors and pro-crypto regulatory developments in the U.S. make a $250 price target appear like small potatoes for BTC. But even if Bitcoin hits that target, it will just be a 133% yield. That’s big for institutions investing billions; crypto shrimps looking to turn $1000 into $100,000 are better off using BTC to gauge market direction and then turning to low-cap presale gems like RTX, which is predicted to skyrocket over 100x if BTC hits $250k. This emerging cross-border payments token is tipped to shake the massive $190 trillion cross-border settlements market. It provides a groundbreaking crypto-to-fiat payment network that facilitates real-time international money transfers at low costs. To date, whales have pumped in over $15.3 million into the Remittix presale, stockpiling over 539 million RTX tokens.

A lot of people are starting to believe in it … This is really something that may be special — who knows, right? Who knows — but it may be special.”Others complained about how Trump left immediately after his short speech instead of sticking around to hand the top token investors new watches, Pinto noted.Related: Senators plan to amend GENIUS Act to address Trump family's stablecoinMeanwhile, 35 Democrats have called for the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s crypto dinner, as they suspect he may be accepting foreign investments in violation of federal bribery statutes and the foreign emoluments clause of the Constitution.Under the emoluments clause, the US president is barred from accepting any gift from a foreign state without the approval of Congress.Source: Peter SchiffTrump invited those who were among the top 220 largest holders of the TRUMP memecoin to his event at the Trump National Golf Club in Virginia — many of whom came from all around the world, according to Trump himself.Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-crypto-dinner-guests-say-food-was-worst-ever?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research“Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said.“But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.”Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Meanwhile, the trading week ending May 23 saw approximately $2.75 billion inflows into US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, coinciding with Bitcoin reaching a new all-time high of $111,970 on May 22.Cathie Wood spoke to ETF analyst Eric Balchunas at Solana Accelerate on May 23.

Meanwhile, spot Ether (ETH) ETFs have seen approximately $2.77 billion in inflows since launching in July 2024.Wood said that spot Ether ETFs were “less successful than people were expecting” because the US Securities and Exchange Commission did not allow staking. On May 21, the SEC delayed its decision on Bitwise’s application to add staking to its Ether exchange-traded fund.However, Wood still views Ether as the entry point for new investors to familiarize themselves with smart contracts before exploring other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL). “So they might start in the smart contract world with Ether, but once they study the technology, and follow the developers, and see the uptake by consumers, I think they will get there,” Wood said.Related: ‘We are worried about a recession,’ but there’s a silver lining — Cathie WoodWood said that the launch of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), in January on the Solana network may have caused investors to be skeptical of Solana.“Institutions and you’re saying 60-year-olds…I think they might be a little turned off by what happened with the Trump memecoin,” Wood said.

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Violators can face fines or up to six months in prison.Trump, who arrived at the club aboard a military helicopter, praised attendees and took aim at the Biden administration’s crypto stance.When asked about potential conflicts of interest, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president’s involvement was personal. “It is not a White House dinner,” she told reporters. “It’s not taking place here at the White House.”Related: Pictures give glimpse inside Trump’s memecoin holder dinnerTrump features presidential seal at private propertiesThis isn’t the first time Trump has featured the presidential seal at his private properties.

He explained that, since half of all capital in the world is essentially seeking the best store of value, more capital will “osmotically flow” into Bitcoin over time.“Over the last 2 years, an exodus from fiat assets (bonds and money) has already begun. Hard money assets (Bitcoin and gold) are where things are shifting,” he said.Source: Jesse MyersMyers said that there is around $318 trillion of capital in bonds “looking for greener pastures.” He said most of this capital is tied up in fixed-income institutional vehicles with “strict mandates.” “That’s where Bitcoin Treasury Companies come in,” Myers said.“Treasury Cos will be the primary bidders for BTC over the coming decades, deploying an ocean of SoV capital to BTC.”Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high, and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetWhile Strategy has been accumulating Bitcoin since 2020, other treasury companies are starting to emerge.On April 24, Twenty One Capital formed, which is a Bitcoin treasury company led by Strike founder Jack Mallers with the support of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald.

Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico. FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024.

2025-05-23T20:00:00.000Z,"Crypto Biz: From shorting the Venezuelan Bolivar to shorting the US dollar","When Venezuela was experiencing hyperinflation, Ledn co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo hedged against the collapsing local currency by shorting it in favor of the more stable US dollar. Today, he’s using a similar strategy — this time borrowing against his Bitcoin (BTC) to hedge against the crumbling US dollar.Di Bartolomeo connected with me during Canada Crypto Week in Toronto, where he talked about the advantages of Bitcoin-backed loans and the rapid growth of collateralized BTC lending. In our interview, he made a compelling case for continuing to stack sats, even as Bitcoin’s price keeps rising.This week’s Crypto Biz dives into our conversation with the Ledn co-founder and covers the latest business news from the blockchain world.A lesson from hyperinflationBefore Bitcoin, di Bartolomeo’s most successful investment was shorting the Bolivar with US dollars, referring to his experience in Venezuela during the hyperinflationary 2010s. “I was borrowing Bolivars and buying dollars with them, holding the hard dollars and having a borrow [position] on the weaker currency,” he said.He then founded Ledn, a company that lets Bitcoin investors access dollar liquidity without parting ways with their BTC. By borrowing against Bitcoin, “you’re basically doing the same thing, but you are in effect holding the hard money, which is Bitcoin, and taking a borrow [position] on dollars, which is a weaker currency,” he said.Many Bitcoiners have found this to be a winning strategy. By the end of Q4, Ledn’s loan book value was valued at $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.Cointelegraph’s Sam Bourgi and Ledn’s Mauricio di Bartolomeo.Guatemala’s largest bank integrates “invisible” crypto infrastructureBanco Industrial, Guatemala’s largest bank, has integrated crypto infrastructure SukuPay into its mobile banking app, enabling users to receive US dollars more easily.SukuPay said this integration is the first time a major Latin American retail bank has used a crypto-native protocol for its payment services.Banco Industrial has more than 1,600 service locations across Guatemala and has also expanded into neighboring countries. The “key to mainstream adoption of blockchain technology is making it invisible to the end-user,” SukuPay CEO Yonathan Lapchik told Cointelegraph. With SukuPay’s technology, Banco Industrial app users can receive dollars from the US for a flat fee of $0.99, significantly lower than the typical 6% to 10% they currently pay, said Lapchik.Bankers are panicking about stablecoins, NYU professor claimsAmerica’s banking lobby sees yield-bearing stablecoins as a threat to its business model, which relies on taking deposits, paying depositors minimal interest and using those funds for higher-risk investments, according to NYU professor Austin Campbell.In a May 21 social media post, Campbell claimed that he’s heard rumblings of “panic” over new stablecoins offering holders interest payments and other monetary rewards. He told Democratic lawmakers that “banks want you to protect their cartel so they can keep screwing your voters.”Although Campbell didn’t mention any stablecoin assets by name, Cointelegraph reported in February that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the country’s first yield-bearing stablecoin security by Figure Markets. At the time of its launch, the YLDS stablecoin offered a yield of 3.85%.Pi Protocol and Spark Protocol have also developed interest-bearing tokens. Source: Austin CampbellStrategy continues to stack satsWith Bitcoin back above $100,000, Michael Saylor’s business intelligence firm, Strategy, has resumed its buying spree by acquiring 7,390 BTC last week for approximately $765 million.The latest purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 576,230 BTC, with an unrealized gain of around $20 billion.The announcement came just two days before Bitcoin surged past its previous all-time high, climbing above $109,000 for the first time since January.

That could pull the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($103,652).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewA solid bounce off the 20-day EMA suggests that the sentiment remains positive and traders are buying on dips. The bulls will then again attempt to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $111,980. If they can pull it off, the BTC/USDT pair could dash toward the target objective of $130,000.The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. That clears the path for a drop to the psychologically crucial level of $100,000. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the $100,000 level because a break below it could sink the pair to the 50-day simple moving average ($94,001).Ether price predictionEther (ETH) turned down from the $2,738 resistance, indicating that the bears are vigorously defending the level.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000. There is resistance at $2,850, but it is likely to be crossed.This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price continues to fall and breaks below the 20-day EMA.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls. That increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.60 and subsequently to $1.27.BNB price predictionBNB (BNB) turned down sharply from the $693 resistance on May 23, signaling aggressive selling by the bears.BNB/USDT daily chart.

If they manage to do that, the pair could skyrocket to the $732 to $761 resistance zone.Instead, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it suggests that the bulls are booking profits. The pair may then plummet to the 50-day SMA ($612).Solana price predictionSolana (SOL) climbed above the $180 resistance on May 23, but the bears are posing a strong challenge at $185.SOL/USDT daily chart.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds. The move is aimed at aiding recovery, yet critics say it exposes centralization risks in the network.CETUS immediately dropped around 35% following the hack.

The Solana project hasn’t posted on its X account since March 2023, and its trading platform now sees negligible volume, but it still didn’t end well for the hacker.Crema suffered an approximately $9-million hack in 2022. Much like the Cetus case, the Crema hacker was offered a deal to return the funds while keeping $1.6 million in exchange for not reporting the attack to law enforcement.Cetus offers a $6-million reward and exemption from further legal action from the project if the remaining funds are returned.

Around $63 million had already been bridged to Ethereum before these controls were implemented.Although the coordinated effort has been effective in preventing the funds from being laundered, the cryptocurrency community has criticized Sui for being too centralized.“SUI’s validators are colluding to CENSOR the hacker’s TXs right now! Does that make SUI centralized? The short answer is YES; what matters more is why? The ‘founders’ own the majority of supply & there are only 114 validators!” Justin Bons, founder of Cyber Capital, wrote on X.Some users challenge Bons’ claim, arguing that decentralization doesn’t mean a free-for-all. Source: Squatch/Justin BonsAs Bons pointed out, Sui has just 114 validators — far fewer than its more established smart contract peers. Ethereum has over 1 million validators, while Solana has 1,157.Meanwhile, members of the Sui community defended the move, arguing that this is how real-world decentralized chains should function.“Decentralization isn’t about standing by while people get hurt, it’s about the power to act together, without needing permission,” said one member of the Sui community.Related: WLFI’s DeFi credentials under fire after Sui partnershipFollowing the hack, Sui developers committed code for a proposed function that would have allowed specific transactions to bypass all signing and safety checks by adding them to a whitelist. While the function could have been used to help recover stolen funds, it also raised concerns about centralized control and the erosion of decentralization. The code was ultimately not merged and is not live on the network.SUI’s price has also been damaged by the Cetus exploit. Source: CoinGeckoSui and Cetus backlash contrasts recent hacksThe Cetus exploit has spotlighted the persistent security challenges in DeFi while raising deeper questions around who holds the reins in supposedly decentralized networks like Sui.The team’s $6-million offer to the hacker mirrors the playbook it used with Crema — but this time, the crypto community isn’t as forgiving. With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto.

Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research.

Despite the correction, there are mixed signals about whether the price rally is overheated or whether this is a healthy pullback. Bitcoin “still not overheated” — analystBitcoin is not showing any signs of being overheated despite reaching new all-time highs this week, with several analysts pointing to fundamentals suggesting Bitcoin could rise further.“Overheating indicators such as the funding rate and short-term capital inflow remain low compared to previous peaks, and profit-taking by short-term investors is limited,” said CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan in a May 22 Quicktake note. Crypto Dan pointed out that Bitcoin’s funding rate, an indicator of market overheating, shows an increase in long bets. However, these bets “remain much smaller compared to previous peaks,” suggesting “futures market overheating is negligible.”Bitcoin funding rates and STH SOPR.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Bank of America, CitiGroup, and Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.On May 20, the US Senate voted 66-32 in favor of advancing discussion on the stablecoin-regulating Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The bill outlines a regulatory framework for stablecoin collateralization and mandates compliance with Anti-Money Laundering laws. The bill is now headed to debate on the Senate floor.Earlier this week, White House crypto czar David Sacks said he expects the bill will be passed and that it will receive bipartisan support.However, high-ranking Democrats plan to amend the bill to include a clause prohibiting President Donald Trump and other US officials from profiting from stablecoins.Trump and his family launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which created the USD1 stablecoin in March.

However, one of the examples examined by Moonlock did not feature the full anti-Ledger phishing functionality advertised. The firm speculates those features could “still be in development or is forthcoming in future updates.” Moonlock says hackers are offering malware for would-be thieves to steal from Ledger users. Source: Moonlock“This isn’t just a theft. It’s a high-stakes effort to outsmart one of the most trusted tools in the crypto world. And the thieves are not backing down,” Moonlock said. “On dark web forums, chatter around anti-Ledger schemes is growing. The next wave is already taking shape. Hackers will continue to exploit the trust crypto owners place in Ledger Live.” Related: Ledger secures Discord after hacker bot tried to steal seed phrasesTo avoid falling prey to similar malware scams, the cybersecurity firm recommends being wary of any page that warns of a critical error and asks for a 24-word recovery phrase.At the same time, never share a seed phrase with anyone or input it on any website, no matter how legitimate it looks, and only download Ledger Live from its official source. Ledger didn’t immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. Magazine: ChatGPT a ‘schizophrenia-seeking missile,’ AI scientists prep for 50% deaths",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/hackers-fake-ledger-apps-to-steal-seed-phrases?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
