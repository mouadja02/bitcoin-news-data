2025-05-26T09:49:33.000Z,"CoinShares: Digital asset YTD inflows hit new all-time high at $10.8b after BTC surpassed $111k","Digital asset products saw $3.3 billion in inflows last week in the market. This surge of capital brought the total year-to-date inflows to a record-breaking $10.8 billion. According to CoinShares ‘ latest digital asset fund weekly report , both year-to-date flows and total assets under management recorded historical peaks in the prior week of trading. Marking the sixth consecutive week of positive flows, digital asset investment products recorded $3.3 billion in capital flow last week. This drove up its total year-to-date flows to a new record high of $10.8 billion. The number jumped from $6.7 billion in the previous week. Meanwhile, total assets under management for digital asset funds briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion in the past week. This indicates a renewed interest from investors. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said that investors have sought out alternative assets due to the shifting conditions of the U.S. market, more specifically “We believe that growing concerns over the U.S. economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets,” said Butterfill.

Sweden and Brazil also experienced outflows amounting to $12.1 million and $1.9 million. Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to dominate with inflows of $2.9 billion, equal to 25% of the total inflows achieved in 2024.

2025-05-26T09:43:55.000Z,"From crypto projects to digital asset companies: It’s time to level up web3 comms | Opinion","Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. “GM, GM. You’re “Just a Crypto Bro”, right?” someone shouted across the hall at Paris Blockchain Week. He’d seen one of my podcast episodes and added with a grin: “Thanks for interviewing the founder of one of my favourite projects.” I smiled. A little flashback of how I came up with my ‘degen’ username hit me. A reminder of where the crypto industry was six years ago, and how far we’ve all come. And then the question hung there: Am I still “Just a Crypto Bro”? You might also like: Decentralized but not defenceless: Crypto needs a crisis manual | Opinion On the surface, it was a simple inquiry, but it carried more weight than he likely intended. It wasn’t just about my username; it was about my identity as a web3 professional. I was wearing a collared shirt, a gilet jacket, and smart casual trousers—not exactly the web3 uniform—yet I have never felt so connected to the industry. A lot of my friends pursuing a career within the industry have run into the same challenge: What does it even mean to look, act, or dress like a web3 native nowadays? Lately, my team and I have been helping founders “clean up” their image. Repositioning their teams from crypto projects to digital asset companies, and dressing up blockchain tech in a language regulators, institutions, and mainstream users can understand. From cryptocurrencies to digital assets Crypto has grown up, or at least, it’s started to. What once felt like a chaotic, permissionless playground of speculation and hype is now evolving into something more structured. Politicians, bankers, and institutions no longer refer to our beloved Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ) as cryptocurrencies; they tend to call them digital assets. A term that will define the next phase of our industry. If we have to be precise, the term digital assets means anything created and stored digitally that has or provides value. They include a wide range of items from photos, documents, and videos to cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets. However, my point isn’t about definitions or linguistics—it’s about observing how the industry is steadily gaining legitimacy, and the phrasing institutions prefer. This isn’t just a rebrand, it’s a reflection of how the ecosystem is evolving. Regulators are starting to define the rules more clearly. The United States regulations— House’s STABLE Act and the Senate’s GENIUS Act —would create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers in the U.S., including licensing requirements, reserve standards, AML obligations, and consumer protections. It’s inevitable that other nations will follow, and in the next few years, we should have clearer regulations across the board. Coinbase just became the first crypto-native company listed on the S&P 500. BlackRock launched a Bitcoin ETF. Politicians are openly debating crypto policy in public forums, not just in subcommittees behind closed doors. Crypto isn’t fringe anymore. It’s entering the mainstream ecosystem imperfectly, but undeniably. The convergence of crypto and mainstream communications The crypto industry is evolving—and it’s evolving fast. Tokenomics are changing to provide real value for token holders. Regulation is evolving. Retail investors are sceptical of projects that don’t have their whitepapers in order, and don’t invest based on hype anymore; they invest in Hype because of the real-world problem the project is aiming to solve (couldn’t keep this joke for myself). However, crypto communications haven’t evolved to match the broader transformation happening across the industry. Many projects are short-termist, completely ignoring yearly or even quarterly communications strategies. They focus on KOLs to pump their tokens in short bursts instead of positioning their founders and companies for long-term success. PR is often treated as a pay-to-play hustle, not a brand-building tool. The corporate world, meanwhile, has spent decades sharpening its comms-planning, structuring, and executing with intention. Meanwhile, crypto has mostly lived in a parallel universe. We started discussing projects on internet forums, moved to Telegram and Discord private communities, and more recently, the industry has heavily relied on crypto X influencers. For years, we operated in a self-contained bubble: chaotic, jargon-heavy, proudly irreverent. The industry created its own obscure language, memes, and unwritten rules. We laughed at being called degens and ‘Retardio’ and wrote milady at the end of random posts. It was part of the culture. It worked, for a while. But if this industry wants to be taken seriously beyond its echo chamber, its communications need to grow up. Because what a company posts on social media, its tone of voice, its choice of words, visual appearance, even what its founders wear on stage—all of these feed into your reputation. Because it’s not just about what you build. It’s about how you tell your story. Right now, too many crypto projects still speak in code. Meanwhile, mainstream journalists only show up when something blows up, right, Bybit ? That needs to change. We need to move from memes to messaging. From chaos to clarity. This doesn’t mean we abandon the culture. Crypto can, and should, keep its edge. But it does mean learning how to speak to different audiences such as investors, regulators, developers, and everyday users. The space is fragmented, and we no longer speak to a homogenous group of web3 natives, hence the messaging needs to adapt. The sad truth is that many modern comms agencies serving the industry are part of the problem. Web3-native agencies understand the tech inside-out, but often miss the strategic rigor, structure, and polish that institutional clients and audiences expect. Conversely, traditional PR firms, used to boardrooms and blue chips, stumble on basic concepts like tokenomics or L2s. The result is obvious: misaligned messaging. Missed opportunities. And an industry that struggles to explain itself to the world. It’s time to fix that. Not just for credibility, but for mainstream adoption. All good, but how? The role of a communications team in crypto is simple. We should act as the bridge between founders and the world. Developers focus on code. Users care about what that code can do for them. Good comms translate complexity into clarity. It helps people understand why a project matters, how it works, and why they should trust it. Sounds easy, but in practice, it’s hard to do well. Start with structure. Plan your communications quarterly, not reactively. Have a clear narrative arc: what are you announcing, why now, and who needs to hear it? Build a rhythm around your releases, media outreach, and community updates. Consistency builds credibility. You stop sounding like a hype machine and start sounding like a real company. If this industry wants to be taken seriously by institutions, regulators, or the general public, the messaging has to evolve. It can’t be just about hype and inside jokes anymore. Projects that learn to communicate clearly with mainstream audiences will be the ones that last. If crypto is ever going to break out of its echo chamber, comms professionals have a key role to play. It’s not enough to land coverage in the usual web3-native publications, important as those are for the community. For projects aiming to reach mainstream audiences, getting visibility in broader business, tech, and culture media is crucial. That means crafting narratives that resonate beyond tokenomics and roadmaps. We need stories that speak to real-world impact, user experience, and long-term value. We need to avoid jargon. Most users aren’t interested in how your bridging works, what consensus mechanism your blockchain has, or any other technical detail. What they care about is simple: does this make their life more convenient and more affordable? Finally, push your founders to think about positioning early. Who are they speaking to: developers, degens, regulators, institutions? If you’re targeting mainstream users or serious investors, your public tone matters. You can’t lead with “GM” and show up in a hoodie if you’re trying to win trust from Wall Street. Attire, tone of voice, vocabulary, all of it sends a signal. Make sure it’s the right one.

According to the announcement, the new BTC purchase is separate from the 4.4 billion yen that Remixpoint intends to invest in crypto using funds raised via its 24th stock acquisition rights issuance, which includes an exercise price revision clause. That offering, announced on May 19, is part of a broader fundraising effort of up to 5.6 billion yen. The company said that timing of the purchase will be determined based on market conditions.

The loss was mainly driven by valuation declines in its crypto investment business, which ramped up in November 2024.

It initially bought Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum and Avalanche.

Details of the trade indicate that the transaction occurred on the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid, where Wynn incurred a $15.86 million loss after closing a short position on Bitcoin, according to the latest on-chain data obtained by Finbold from HyperDash . James Wynn losing Bitcoin short position. Source: HyperDash The loss was recorded on May 25, following the closure of Wynn’s BTC short. He took a $15.53 million hit on the position itself, along with nearly $940,899 in fees, resulting in a net loss of $15.86 million. Notably, after the trade, data shows that Wynn had opened a $1 billion short position using 40x leverage, risking his entire $50 million wallet. This stands as the largest on-chain bet ever placed. The short position was entered at an average price of $107,077. If BTC rises above $110,446, the position risks liquidation unless additional collateral is provided. Profitable PEPE bet This setback sharply contrasts with Wynn’s recent streak of profitable trades. Just before the BTC short, he closed a long position in PEPE, securing a massive $25.19 million profit. Moreover, a previous long on BTC had netted him another $18.36 million. As previously reported by Finbold, Wynn had held a long position in Bitcoin amounting to 11,588 BTC, valued at approximately $1.25 billion at the time. Indeed, the investor has been highly active in recent weeks. Over the past 75 days, he has executed 38 trades on Hyperliquid, 17 of which were profitable, yielding a 45% win rate.

2025-05-26T09:28:21.000Z,"Digital Asset Inflows Soar to $3.3B in a Week – YTD Hits $10.8B","Key Takeaways: Crypto investment products saw $3.3 billion in weekly inflows, pushing 2024’s total to a record $10.8 billion. Investor concerns over the U.S. economy and rising treasury yields are driving diversification into digital assets. Bitcoin led with $2.9 billion in inflows, while XRP recorded its largest-ever weekly outflows at $37.2 million. Institutional appetite for crypto investment products surged last week, with digital asset funds raking in $3.3 billion in inflows, according to data from CoinShares. The wave of capital pushed year-to-date inflows to a record-breaking $10.8 billion, signaling renewed confidence in the sector. CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill noted that total assets under management in crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) briefly touched an all-time high of $187.5 billion. Moody’s Downgrade Spurs Digital Asset Inflows The uptick comes amid mounting concerns over the U.S. economy following a Moody’s downgrade and rising treasury yields, which have prompted investors to seek diversification. “We believe that growing concerns over the US economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets.” Nevertheless, the United States led the inflows with $3.2 billion, while Germany, Hong Kong, and Australia contributed $41.5 million, $33.3 million, and $10.9 million, respectively. In contrast, Switzerland recorded $16.6 million in outflows, as investors cashed in on recent price gains. Bitcoin remained the top draw, attracting $2.9 billion, nearly 25% of all inflows for 2024. Short-Bitcoin products also saw increased activity, pulling in $12.7 million — the highest since December — suggesting some traders are betting against recent price rallies. Ethereum continued its positive momentum with $326 million in inflows, marking its fifth consecutive week of gains and the strongest week in nearly four months. XRP, however, saw its 80-week inflow streak break, posting a record $37.2 million in outflows. Bitcoin Surges After Trump Delays EU Tariffs Bitcoin briefly surged past $111,000 before retreating to $109,600 late Sunday, as markets responded to US President Donald Trump’s decision to delay a proposed 50% tariff on European Union goods. The announcement followed a phone call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, granting more time for trade negotiations and easing global market tensions. U.S. stock futures climbed modestly, signaling cautious optimism. However, volatility remains high, with a new July 9 deadline keeping investors on edge. The earlier threat of steep tariffs caused Bitcoin to dip nearly 2%, illustrating the crypto market’s growing sensitivity to macroeconomic and geopolitical developments. https://twitter.com/Tryrexcrypto/status/1926777638376341747 Meanwhile, analysts suggest that institutional inflows, supportive regulation, and broader monetary trends continue to create a structurally strong foundation for the crypto market, even as political developments stir short-term volatility. As reported, Shunyet Jan, Head of Derivatives at Bybit, has projected that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 by the end of Q2 if current trends persist. Last week, crypto analyst Scott Melker said he believes Bitcoin could surge to $250,000 by the end of 2025 , driven by institutional demand and a maturing market structure. Likewise, Adam Back, a prominent figure in the Bitcoin community and CEO of Blockstream, believes that Bitcoin is significantly undervalued and could surge to between $500,000 and $1 million per coin during the current market cycle.

2025-05-26T09:25:20.000Z,"As Bitcoin Price Races To $115,000, Hyperliquid And AVAX Keep Altcoins In The Spotlight With Record-Breaking Weekly Gains","With the Bitcoin price setting new benchmarks, the altcoin market is undergoing a shift, highlighting the impressive momentum of Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Avalanche (AVAX) while foreshadowing the potential of FloppyPepe (FPPE) . As the Bitcoin price climbs toward $115,000, major altcoins are seizing the momentum and rewriting investor expectations. The current surge highlights a broader shift from institutional caution to high-confidence accumulation. The Bitcoin price recently hit $111,814, shattering its previous record and sending shockwaves across the market. This macro surge has given key altcoins like Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Avalanche (AVAX) space to thrive. In parallel, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is entering the spotlight as investors move toward emerging projects with strong community appeal and AI-powered utility. Hyperliquid (HYPE): DeFi’s New Market Giant Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to outpace competitors in decentralized finance, establishing dominance in perpetual trading. With a price nearing $34.74, Hyperliquid (HYPE) now commands over $11.9 billion in market cap and over $430 million in Total Value Locked . Since its 2023 launch, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has overtaken dYdX in both open interest and daily volume, to become the leading decentralized perpetual exchange. Hyperliquid’s (HYPE) custom Layer 1 blockchain and buyback-focused model have fueled user migration from centralized exchanges. Avalanche (AVAX): Building Real-World Blockchain Infrastructure Trading near $25.1, Avalanche (AVAX) has seen a rise in trading volume, signaling investor confidence. The launch of Growth Protocol on Avalanche (AVAX), backed by Nazara Technologies and Lysto, showcases its potential in on-chain advertising. FIFA’s plan to build a Layer 1 chain on Avalanche (AVAX) and VanEck’s upcoming PurposeBuilt Fund targeting AVAX-based businesses have reaffirmed its momentum. Its RSI reading reflects continued bullishness as Avalanche (AVAX) eyes the $30 mark. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Meme Culture Meets AI Utility The FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem features three core AI tools. Meme-o-Matic enables users to generate instant memes, FloppyX powers AI-driven short-form video content, and FloppyAI provides real-time crypto sentiment analytics. These tools bridge the gap between meme culture and functional blockchain utility. FloppyPepe (FPPE) also stands out for its unique Floppynomics model. A 1% burn reduces supply, 1% is redistributed to holders, and another 1% supports wildlife conservation. Its SolidProof audit adds credibility, while limited-edition hand-drawn art and community-led storytelling fuel long-term engagement. While the surging Bitcoin price dominates the charts, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves as a cultural and AI-powered phenomenon. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic Pepe the Frog, the altcoin taps into nostalgia while offering tangible utility. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Enters Stage 2 Even as the Bitcoin price continues its robust performance, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale, priced at $0.00000035, has officially advanced to Stage 2. Following a sold-out Stage 1 that raised over $2 million, the meme coin continues to attract investors at an impressive pace. Over $100,000 has already been raised in this new phase, reflecting strong early traction. The limited-time FLOPPY80 bonus remains active, offering an 80% token boost at checkout. This high-value incentive will not last long, especially as Stage 2 draws new investors in with rising visibility. The next pricing tier is fast approaching, further increasing urgency. Given the presale’s explosive growth and the AI utility baked into the project, this could be the last chance to get the token at near-ground-floor levels. Despite the Bitcoin price dominating market conversations, FloppyPepe's (FPPE) tech-forward and community-first approach makes it a top altcoin investment option. Altcoins Rise With Bitcoin Price – FloppyPepe (FPPE) Grabs the Spotlight As the Bitcoin price barrels toward $115,000, it creates fertile ground for standout altcoins to rise. Hyperliquid (HYPE) has taken the DeFi crown with explosive volume and advanced tokenomics.

2025-05-26T09:22:47.000Z,"R. Kiyosaki says ‘even .01 Bitcoin’ could make you very rich","‘Rich Dad Poor Dad ’ author Robert Kiyosaki is doubling down on Bitcoin ( BTC ), again. In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, May 26, Kiyosaki called the leading cryptocurrency the simplest path to wealth creation today, writing: “I cannot believe how easy Bitcoin has made getting rich…so easy. Why everyone is not buying and holding Bitcoin is beyond me. Even .01 of a Bitcoin is going to be priceless in two years… and maybe make you very rich.” The finance guru acknowledged Bitcoin’s volatility but dismissed it as part of the deal, adding, “sure Bitcoin goes up and down… but so does real life.” Notably, with BTC trading at $109,949 at press time, .01 BTC is currently worth $1,099. He went on to highlight the scarcity of Bitcoin, noting that only 1–2 million BTC are left to be mined, which could accelerate its value trajectory. Quoting macro investor Raoul Pal, Kiyosaki said Bitcoin is entering what Pal calls the “Banana Zone”—a phase of explosive price movement. “Don’t be a yellow banana,” Kiyosaki warned. “Open your eyes and your mind and listen to people like Raoul Pal, Michael Saylor, Anthony Pompliano… then follow content on Bitcoin Zella and look into the future of money.” Kiyosaki slams US Bonds as “Toilet Paper” Kiyosaki’s latest remarks follow a separate post from May 21, where he doubled down on his long-standing critique of fiat currencies and debt instruments—specifically U.S. bonds. Reacting to Moody’s downgrade of the U.S. credit outlook, he compared U.S. Treasuries to “toilet paper,” writing: “As you know I have been a broken record pleading with people to buy real gold, silver, and Bitcoin… no ETFs,” he wrote. “ETFs are more expensive toilet paper. When Moody’s downgraded U.S. toilet paper… I feel vindicated.” He continued: “Central banks are dumping U.S. bonds to buy gold, and no one wants to buy more U.S. toilet paper. America is in serious trouble.” Previously he had forecasted Bitcoin reaching $500,000 to $1 million over the next several years, driven by rising inflation, weakening trust in the U.S. dollar, and growing institutional adoption. More recently, he revised his 2025 price target to between $180,000 and $200,000, still suggesting significant upside from current levels. Featured image via Cavaleria Com YouTube The post R.

2025-05-26T09:19:52.000Z,"Bitcoin Bull Run Intact, But New Sell Signals Flash: Is a Market Cool-Off Ahead?","The post Bitcoin Bull Run Intact, But New Sell Signals Flash: Is a Market Cool-Off Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin stayed on its upward path this past week, even as a few warning signs started flashing under the surface. With institutional demand still solid and retail activity cooling off, the market seems to be moving into a distribution phase. Market analyst Axel Adler Jr has explained what the latest on-chain data and market signals reveal about where BTC might head next. Active Wallets See a Drop One of the more eye-catching stats from the week was a clear decline in Bitcoin’s active wallet count. Over the last seven days, the number of active addresses fell by 6.56%, dropping from 8.62 million to about 8.06 million. This kind of reduction often points to retail traders pulling back, perhaps locking in profits or stepping aside from short-term speculation. It’s a classic sign that the market is consolidating, leaving room for the bigger players to take control. Bitcoin’s Hashrate Slips Slightly, Network Stays Secure Bitcoin’s network hashrate experienced a minor dip of around 1.4% this week. While the hashrate fell from roughly 864.8 EH/s to 852.7 EH/s, the move is seen as routine, likely tied to seasonal maintenance or miner reshuffling. The important takeaway is that network security remains rock-solid despite the small fluctuation — nothing concerning here for long-term holders. Market Cap Climbs as Bitcoin Hits New Local High Bitcoin’s price edged up 3.48% over the week, closing in on $107,839.92. That pushed the total crypto market capitalization up by 4.5%, surpassing $2.14 trillion. The steady price growth has allowed BTC to test and set new local highs, driven in large part by consistent institutional inflows, even as retail engagement cools. No Major Peak Yet, But Momentum Is Slowing Other important market cycle metrics, like the Bitcoin Peak Signal — which has historically called tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021 — suggest the market hasn’t reached its final bull market phase just yet. Indicators like the MRPI (price-to-realized price ratio for long-term holders) and VDD Ratio (measuring the movement of older coins) are rising but still sit below historical peak levels. This implies that while caution is warranted, the current cycle still has room to run before topping out. Looking Ahead: Fall 2025 Remains the Big Cycle Target According to Bitcoin’s halving cycle fractal model, the final signals for this cycle’s peak aren’t expected until fall 2025. Based on this long-term model, the next major correction might arrive later this year, but for now, the structure of the bull market appears intact. The key level to watch right now is $107K. Holding above that would confirm the bull trend’s strength. A drop below it, though, could open the door to a deeper correction before institutional buyers step back in.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-bull-run-intact-but-new-sell-signals-flash-is-a-market-cool-off-ahead/,"BTC|MARKET|MINING|TRADING","News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis",cryptocompare

2025-05-26T09:17:08.000Z,"European stocks open high as crypto market holds steady after Trump postponed tariffs","European stocks opened strong on Monday after US President Donald Trump delayed his planned 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union. According to CNBC, the decision came late Sunday after a call between Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, following a Friday threat that had rattled markets across Europe and the US The Stoxx 600 index jumped 1% just after the open, pulling every sector into positive territory. In early morning trades, France’s CAC 40 rose by 1.3%, and Germany’s DAX was up 1.8%. UK markets remained closed for a public holiday. The move came after Trump said Friday on Truth Social that the European bloc was “very difficult to deal with” and claimed talks were “going nowhere.” He announced the tariffs would begin June 1, but that plan was dropped two days later. The new date is now July 9, buying the EU more time. Ursula posted on X that the bloc was “ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively.” Automakers, crypto react to weekend flip-flop The most dramatic rebound came from the auto sector, where stocks had taken a beating the session before. Shares of BMW rose 1.4%, Mercedes-Benz gained 1.5%, and Volkswagen matched that with a 1.5% increase. Automakers are especially exposed in this fight, since vehicles and machinery are the EU’s top exports to the US In crypto, Bitcoin recovered to $110,000, Ethereum held at $2,575, and XRP sat at $2.35. None of the major coins reacted much to the tariff news. The asset class remained calm despite the weekend’s rollercoaster from Trump’s policy whiplash. Barclays analysts called the 50% tariff a “negotiating tactic” in a note sent Friday. Despite that, US stocks plunged. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all ended the week down more than 2%. The pressure was made worse by a surge in Treasury yields, triggered by Trump’s tax proposal, which could add $2.3 trillion to the national deficit. In Asia, results were mixed. Stocks in Japan and South Korea climbed overnight, while China and Hong Kong dropped. Wall Street remained closed Monday for Memorial Day. The mood? Cautious, but watching every post and delay.

2025-05-26T09:15:02.000Z,"Morgan Stanley Warns Big Drop for US Dollar Incoming As Bank Updates Market Forecast","One of Morgan Stanley’s top executives says that the US dollar is set for further declines, likely providing a boost to risk assets. In a new interview on Bloomberg Television, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson says that the bank is forecasting a big drop for the US dollar, potentially giving another tailwind to the S&P 500. “Our forecast for the dollar, by the way in this mid-year update, is for another 10% decline. So that continues into next year. That’s what’s going to provide another tailwind for 2026, it’s just another reason that the S&P [500] has a really hard time correcting more than 10%.” According to Wilson, the bank’s call on the dollar dropping 10% is based on the expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. However, the banker says even if the Fed isn’t as aggressive as Morgan Stanley thinks, the overall trend for the dollar remains down. “If our call on 175 basis points of rate cuts next year proves to be true, you’ll get a 10% decline. If it’s only a hundred basis points of cuts, it’ll be less. But the direction of travel is south for the dollar, particularly against the yen, which they’re not going to be cutting rates anytime soon. Or even against [the euro], also the pound, because they don’t have as much room to cut in a slowdown.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-05-26T09:00:29.000Z,"Bitcoin Enters Stabilization Phase — Is MAGACOIN FINANCE the Hidden 50x Opportunity?","As Bitcoin transitions into a period of consolidation, holding firm above $111,000, market participants are increasingly on the lookout for the next high-growth catalyst. While Bitcoin, XRP, and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) remain foundational assets for many portfolios, the real buzz is building around MAGACOIN FINANCE. Analysts and traders alike are now highlighting MAGA as a unique early-stage contender with the potential to deliver outsized returns in 2025. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! MAGACOIN FINANCE: Accelerating Presale, 50% Bonus, and Rare 50x Upside MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly distinguishing itself as the breakout presale of the year, with Stage 8 attracting record participation and over $8 million raised. The project’s capped 100 billion token supply, HashEx-audited contracts, and viral political narrative are driving a surge of interest from both retail and institutional buyers. Analyst forecasts now point to 25x–50x returns, with some models suggesting even greater upside if current momentum continues. Early participants can unlock a 50% token bonus using the exclusive PATRIOT50X promo code before the $0.007 listing. As each presale stage fills, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly seen as the high-conviction play for those seeking to front-run the next market cycle. Bitcoin (BTC): Steady Support and Macro Focus Bitcoin is consolidating above $111,000, with trading activity moderating after recent highs. Institutional inflows remain robust, but with volatility subdued, traders are shifting attention to new opportunities. This stabilization phase is prompting more aggressive capital to rotate into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the risk/reward profile is far more attractive. XRP: Institutional Accumulation and ETF Buzz XRP is trading near $2.42, supported by ongoing whale accumulation and enthusiasm around potential ETF products. Analysts remain bullish, with some targeting $5 as ETF interest grows. However, the sharpest capital rotation is now favoring early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for higher-multiple returns. Hedera (HBAR): Enterprise Growth, MAGA Takes the Spotlight Hedera is holding near $0.25, advancing its roadmap with new partnerships and decentralized applications. While HBAR’s fundamentals are solid, its near-term upside is outshined by the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Conclusion Bitcoin’s stabilization and XRP’s institutional momentum are notable, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the hidden 50x opportunity for 2025. With Stage 8 nearly full, a 50% PATRIOT50X bonus, and analyst forecasts up to 50x ROI, MAGA is the defining early-stage play for the next bull run.

Starting from May 27 to May 29, this three-day Bitcoin Conference 2025 is being held at the Venetian Conference Center in Las Vegas. Whether you’re deep into crypto or just Bitcoin-curious, here’s what you can expect, and here is the list of speakers. What’s on the Agenda? This year’s conference will dive deep into the most exciting developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Expect big announcements around Bitcoin Layer 2 (L2) solutions like BitVM2 bridges, which aim to unlock powerful decentralized use cases for Bitcoin, something that’s been long-awaited. The Lightning Network is also taking the spotlight, especially after Tether’s recent push to issue USDT via Taproot Assets. Discussions around scaling Bitcoin and making it faster, cheaper, and more usable are sure to heat up. Other key topics include: Bitcoin governance, including debates over mempool policy and new opcodes. The rise of BTC-based financial products, like ETFs and lending platforms. Conversations on privacy, open-source tech, and Bitcoin’s role in personal freedom. A focus on mining, infrastructure, and sustainability, especially as Bitcoin scales globally. Star-Studded Lineup of Speakers The list of speakers this year is nothing short of jaw-dropping. For the first time, a sitting U.S. Vice President, JD Vance, will deliver a keynote, likely focusing on Bitcoin’s place in America’s financial future. Other top names include: Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Senator Cynthia Lummis Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, founders of Gemini Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev Nigel Farage MP of UK With over 30,000 attendees, 400+ speakers, and 5,000+ companies in one place, Bitcoin Conference 2025 is set to be more than just a meetup, it’s where the future of Bitcoin gets written. As of now, the bitcoin price is trading around its ATH price of $109,732, reflecting a pump of 2.3% seen in the last 24 hours. However, some experts believe that the Bitcoin Conference 2025 event will see a massive pump in BTC price, pushing it towards near $125k milestone .",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-conference-las-vegas-2025-what-to-expect-list-of-speakers/,"BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT","News",cryptocompare
2025-05-26T08:48:33.000Z,"Bitcoin (BTC) Surges Amid EU Tariff Relief: Market Analysis","After dropping nearly 4% going into the weekend on the news that President Trump had levied a 50% trade tariff on the EU, Bitcoin is recovering after Trump agreed on Sunday to extend the tariffs deadline until 9 June. Will Bitcoin now surge into the next stage of the bull market, or is there more consolidation to come? Bitcoin resilient during tariff shocks It might be argued that Bitcoin was due for an upward phase anyway. The price had dropped nearly 4% on Friday, wiping off around $4,400 from the price. After such a fall, and with Bitcoin’s short-term momentum indicators having reset, it was only a matter of time before the king of the cryptocurrencies started to climb once more. While the tariffs news is succeeding in shocking the market from time to time, these tremors are becoming more short-lived as the market has generally priced in the worst and has become more resilient. The next big quake could come if the talks between the EU and the US are not productive enough to avoid the 50% tariffs being imposed, but with both sides laser-focussed on preventing this, in order to stave off negative consequences for all, some kind of deal would perhaps be more likely than not. $BTC on path to next all-time high Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC shows that the price dipped back into the ascending channel, but that the support at $106,000 was firm enough to hold the price up. A strong bounce from here has brought the price back above the previous all-time high. Perhaps this can definitively hold as support this time. A positive occurrence for the $BTC price is that a W pattern formed in between the two horizontal support lines at $106,000 up to $109,000. This has just broken out and has been confirmed. Should the pattern continue to its full measured move, this would take the price just beyond the all-time high. The Stochastic RSI on the 4-hour time frame has the indicators reaching the top, but the 8-hour, 12-hour, and the daily time frames are only just beginning to rise from the bottom, signalling that upside price momentum is still happening. $BTC consolidates above $106,000 horizontal price structure step Source: TradingView The 6-day time frame provides some clues as to what is coming next from Bitcoin. While many traders and analysts across social media are suggesting that a large dip in price may be incoming for Bitcoin, the chart above is signalling that there may be another strong upward surge first. The horizontal orange lines on the chart are showing the base and the topside of very strong market structure. The lower horizontal line at $74,000 delineates the top of the 8-month bull flag, and the bottom of the last bull flag. Now, a price structure step is forming along the top of the recent bull flag. If this can hold, it could become the base for the next stage of this bull market. The MACD indicator at the bottom of the chart supports this thesis. The green histogram bars are continuing to get bigger, and the MACD and signal lines have a good way to travel to equal the two previous tops in mid-2024 and at the beginning of 2025. The Stochastic RSI needs to maintain its indicators at the top of their trajectory for an extended period of time. This said, once they do start to cross down, this could signal the end of this particular surge. Looking further ahead, once the reversal does come, it may well bring the price back down to retest $106,000. This would only make this level even stronger, and a final new all-time high could be made on one more potential surge following this.

The altcoins have turned green as well, and HYPE continues to lead the larger caps following yet another new all-time high at almost $40 today. BTC Bounces to $110K The primary cryptocurrency went through some volatile periods at the beginning of the previous business week when it challenged the $107,000 region on a couple of occasions but was stopped on Sunday and Monday. However, the bulls managed to penetrate that level on Wednesday when they actually pushed the asset above $109,100 to mark a new all-time high at almost $110,000. After another violent but brief rejection, BTC skyrocketed once again on Thursday (Pizza Day) and tapped $112,000 to chart its latest all-time high. It stood close to that level for the next 24 hours but Friday’s statement by the POTUS, in which he recommended new tariffs against the EU, caused an immediate shock in the market that drove BTC south to under $107,500. It remained around that level for most of the weekend, but Trump paused the tariffs for at least another month, which sent bitcoin higher again. During today’s Asian trading session, the cryptocurrency jumped to and slightly above $110,000 and sits close to that line now. Its market cap has recovered to $2.180 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.1%. BTCUSD.

Other notable gainers from the larger-cap alts include AVAX, ADA, UNI, TAO, APT, ICP, ETH, SOL, and DOGE.

2025-05-26T08:30:45.000Z,"Cardano Is Stuck, Says Hoskinson—Here’s How He Plans To Fix It","Charles Hoskinson’s latest two-hour Ask-Me-Anything on May 24 ranged from personal anecdotes to quantum-era thought experiments, yet the Cardano founder kept circling back to a single theme: the network must evolve—technically and politically—if it is to compete in an age of zero-knowledge, AI-assisted finance. Early in the broadcast, Hoskinson sketched an audacious testing ground for that evolution: a fully simulated “crypto city” populated by AI agents. “Why don’t you create a virtual city,” he asked, “and then you introduce crypto into the city … you just see all the transactions that go through and what happens with it.” In his scenario, private stablecoins, roll-ups and even illicit actors interplay inside a sandbox large enough to stress Cardano’s forthcoming privacy layer, Midnight, and its recursive-proof scaling stack. The experiment, he argued, would let developers “stop thinking of TPS and start thinking of … concurrent cities processing.” Behind the thought exercise lies a concrete roadmap. Hoskinson confirmed that Midnight ’s trust-minimised bridge to Cardano remains “on schedule,” positioning the sidechain as a de facto privacy hub where stablecoin issuers could launch fully compliant “private stablecoins” before bridging them into the main network. He doubled down on the idea that privacy-preserving assets will become existential: “The minute one person has it, everybody else is going to die.” That urgency also framed his call for faster finality. Cardano’s base protocol, Ouroboros, deliberately mirrors Bitcoin’s probabilistic security, but Hoskinson said the time has come for a BFT-style add-on. Ouroboros Paris, a finality gadget written by “Agalos and the team of Gigabrains,” would let partner chains settle to Cardano “in minutes” rather than the current half-day. He lamented pushback from engineering committees that repeatedly removed Paris from the official roadmap: “I will pay out of my own pocket to have Ouroboros Paris,” he said, describing the proposal’s journey through Intersect—the member-run body that now stewards Cardano’s codebase. Does Cardano Need A “President”? Governance, indeed, was the morning’s dominant undercurrent. Hoskinson characterised Cardano’s post-Vasil polity as lopsided: a legislature and judiciary (community voting and constitutional committee) exist, but no clear executive authority to enforce branding, marketing or an integrated roadmap. “At some point you have to reintroduce some form of executive function,” he argued, floating a model in which a community-elected “president” would be rewarded in ADA for meeting network-level KPIs such as monthly active users or total value locked. Without that accountability, he warned, roadmap items like Ouroboros Kronos—his favoured remedy for time-sync attacks—could languish indefinitely because “no one can really unilaterally say, ‘this is what’s going to happen.’” Technical privacy surfaced again when an audience member asked whether the long-dormant Crypsinous paper—private staking for Ouroboros—should be revived. Hoskinson acknowledged its conceptual elegance but cautioned that full anonymity would “take a big hit” on performance and complicate multi-resource consensus. Any resurrection, he said, would need to marry new zero-knowledge primitives with the emerging, multi-ledger world Cardano now targets. That multi-ledger push was most vivid in his discussion of partner chains for Bitcoin DeFi. Hoskinson outlined a three-layer stack: first, a bridging mechanism built on BitVM-X and Hydra-backed operators to batch Bitcoin transactions; second, a wallet layer (headed by Lace) that abstracts the complexity; third, an ecosystem of Cardano DeFi apps refactored to accept Bitcoin collateral and fees. “Even five or ten percent coverage would be larger than the market cap of Aptos, Solana and pretty much Ethereum combined,” he claimed, dismissing Bitcoin maximalist objections with an analogy: “Gold is valuable whether it sits in a mine or a jewellery shop.” Amid the technical depth, Hoskinson’s frustration with misinformation was palpable. He returned repeatedly to what he called “600 articles, 50-plus million views” alleging that he had misappropriated unredeemed ICO funds—allegations he flatly denies and says will be refuted in an imminent BDO forensic audit .“ Still, the founder’s tone was more determined than defensive. He framed every grievance—whether about “gridlock,” misaligned incentives or public defamation—as a data point in how decentralised systems mature. “We have the right to rewrite the economic, political, and social systems of the world,” he said, linking Cardano’s ethos to his childhood fixation on unfinished games and four-dimensional puzzles: “If it’s not good enough for you, how could you possibly say it’s good enough for everybody else?” For now, Hoskinson’s own puzzle pieces are clear: bring fast finality to the mainnet, launch Midnight’s selective-disclosure toolkit, revive research threads like Kronos under a more decisive governance model, and test it all inside a living simulation where AI agents behave like citizens and criminals alike. Whether the ecosystem can align behind that blueprint—or whether the very lack of an “executive” will keep the tiles mis-matched—now falls to the Cardano community he insists must learn to act as a nation, not a forum.

2025-05-26T08:30:33.000Z,"$200,000 Bitcoin ‘Is Real’ By Year-End, Says Top Researcher","Bitcoin’s path to $200,000 by December has gained a new champion. Digital-asset research boutique Capriole Investments drew attention over the weekend to fresh modelling from on-chain analyst “ElonMoney,” arguing that a $200,000 print is not only plausible but statistically grounded. “$200K is real,” Capriole wrote on X, adding that the thread is “a great use of Capriole Charts to conduct a macro Bitcoin analysis.” In the research, ElonMoney assembles six long-horizon indicators. “For this analysis, I used metrics like the MVRV Z-Score, Energy Value Oscillator, Bitcoin Heater, Macro Index, and other indicators, as well as historical data,” the researcher writes. “TL;DR: $200K is real.” Bitcoin To $200K Is Real The MVRV Z-Score, which measures how many standard deviations Bitcoin’s market capitalisation sits above its realised capitalisation, begins the stack. At present the score hovers a touch above 2. ElonMoney calls that “a neutral zone, far from the overheated red band,” adding, “Today’s reading tells us the tank is far from empty; previous cycle tops did not arrive until the Z-Score screamed through seven.” The implication, according to the author, is that price could double from current levels without violating historical symmetry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Extreme Greed Is Here—Time To Be A Contrarian? Energy economics reaches a similar verdict. “The energy value acts as a gravity well for price,” ElonMoney explains, referring to the Energy Value Oscillator, which equates a theoretical fair value to aggregate network energy consumption. That fair-value line sits near $130,000—above spot—so the oscillator itself is close to zero. “Until the oscillator shows a 100 percent premium, talk of a terminal top is premature,” he argues, pointing to the 2021 peak, when the premium exceeded one hundred percent even though Bitcoin capped under $70,000. Under current hash-rate projections the model’s fair value could reach $150,000 by October; a repeat of the historical premium would place price in the $225,000 to $300,000 corridor. Derivatives telemetry offers corroboration rather than contradiction. Bitcoin Heater, a composite of perpetual-swap funding, calendar-spread basis and options skew, reads 0.6–0.7. “Derivatives have begun to simmer, not boil,” the note says. “We are nowhere near the sustained 0.9-plus prints that bleed into blow-off tops. Euphoria needs leverage, and leverage is still only warming up.” The Macro Index Oscillator, built from more than forty on-chain and macro inputs, currently registers +0.7. “That is an unmistakable expansion print,” ElonMoney concedes, “but expansion is not exhaustion. In 2021 we watched the same indicator crest at three.” The researcher stresses that user growth, fee revenue and realised profit-and-loss series all point to an economy that is accelerating, not decelerating. Related Reading: Stealth Bitcoin Bull Run Ahead: Fidelity Says Do Not Blink Liquidity depth, captured by the proprietary “Volume Summer” gauge, is favourable but subdued. “Capital is flowing back into spot markets, yet we have not seen the fever-green highlights that accompany retail stampedes,” says the report. The gauge’s latest reading of +75,000 units contrasts with the +150,000 figure recorded sixty days before the April 2021 apex. “Liquidity is positive; it is not parabolic,” ElonMoney writes. Finally comes leverage in absolute terms. The ratio of total open interest to market capitalisation is just under 3.5%. ElonMoney calls the figure “constructive but not combustible,” adding, “The market mechanically cannot top until speculators believe it cannot fall. We are not at that point yet. If OI/Mcap presses past five percent, alarms will sound; until then, leverage is fuel.” Capriole itself does not publish a price target, yet by circulating the analysis it tacitly accepts the inference that Bitcoin has ample upside into year-end. “$200K is real,” Capriole’s post reads in full, appending a screenshot of the report’s headline chart. The timing question hinges on how quickly those six dials swing toward their historical extremes. ElonMoney offers a conditional roadmap: “If MVRV punches through seven, if the Energy Value premium breaks one hundred percent, if Heater pins at one, and if OI/Mcap hits five percent, you will know distribution territory is in sight.” Barring that confluence, he believes price discovery will grind higher. “Bitcoin does not die of old age,” the note concludes. “It dies of over-valuation, and we are demonstrably not there yet.” At press time, Bitcoin traded at $109,559, leaving a near-90% run required to validate ElonMoney’s base case before year-end.

2025-05-26T08:29:21.000Z,"Crypto Whale Wynn Quits After Scoring $25M from $1.25B Bitcoin Bet","In a dramatic twist befitting the man known as the “10U God of War,” crypto trader James Wynn has exited his headline-grabbing $1.25 billion Bitcoin long with a cool $25 million profit. The crypto whale had wagered his capital on BTC hitting $121,000 this week, leveraging 40x on Hyperliquid. From $87M Highs to a $25M Exit At one point, the trade showed as much as $87 million in unrealized profit. However, volatility and macro headwinds, including new tariff threats against the European Union (EU) by U.S. President Donald Trump, undermined bullish momentum. Bitcoin ended up faltering below Wynn’s target, hovering around $108,000, and forcing the crypto punter to recalibrate. A few hours before this writing, the trader called it quits : “Now decided to leave the casino with my $25,000,000 profit,” he posted on X. “It’s been fun, but now it’s time for me to walk away a wynner.” According to market tracker Lookonchain, which has been keeping an eye on the whale’s moves, he closed all 11,588 BTC long contracts worth $1.25 billion, and walked away with a net $25.2 million profit after withdrawing 28 million USDC from Hyperliquid. Interestingly, after predicting a surge to $121,000 for Bitcoin as reported by CryptoPotato , Wynn suddenly flipped bearish, opening a $1 billion BTC short with 40x leverage, risking nearly $50 million on a downside move. Investor Daan Crypto Trades had labeled the initial long “insanity,” noting the outsized risk: “Every 1% BTC candle equals a $10M PNL swing.” Others, like pseudonymous trader Innerdevcrypto, suspected ulterior motives behind Wynn’s high-visibility plays, hinting at a potential “clout-farming” agenda. However, Lookonchain has since reported that Wynn closed his short positions, losing almost $16 million in the process. That doesn’t seem to have fazed him, with the on-chain analytics platform further revealing that the self-styled “GOAT” had opened a $9.9 million long on kPEPE with 10x leverage. At the time of writing, he had already stacked more than $130,000 in unrealized profit. From PEPE Prophet to Leverage King It was with PEPE that Wynn made his mark in the crypto community, predicting in 2023 that the meme coin, then boasting a modest market cap of just $4.2 million, would skyrocket 1,000 times to $4.2 billion. Consequently, he reportedly flipped a $7,600 bet on the token into more than $50 million by late 2024 before pivoting into BTC. His aggressive trades on Hyperliquid, totaling 38 in over 75 days, with a 45% win rate, have earned him more than $40 million in profits, according to Lookonchain.

However, recent sessions have seen the rally begin to cool as bulls face stiff resistance at the 50% Fibonacci retracement near $184 and short-term exhaustion appears on the charts.

2025-05-26T08:20:09.000Z,"Cetus hack post-mortem reveals overflow bug behind $223m exploit","Attackers exploited a critical overflow flaw in Cetus Protocol’s automated market maker logic, which led to $223 million in user losses, according to a post-mortem by Dedaub. “This incident represents one of the most significant DeFi exploits in recent history, caused by a subtle but critical flaw in “overflow” protection,” blockchain security firm Dedaub said in its report . Dedaub explained that the flaw involved an “overflow” in the math used by Cetus’s automated market maker, where a miswritten condition failed to properly handle the most significant bits of large numerical inputs and “didn’t produce the intended result.” Instead of rejecting oversized values, the system truncated them, causing the output to appear much smaller than it should have. This allowed the attacker to deposit just a single token while the protocol mistakenly credited them with an enormous liquidity position. They then used that position to withdraw large amounts of real assets from the pools. You might also like: SUI price stalls below $4 resistance as $223M Cetus Protocol hack weighs down on sentiment According to Dedaub, a similar vulnerability had been flagged in early 2023 by blockchain security firm Ottersec during an audit of the protocol’s codebase when it was deployed on Aptos. However, after the code was later ported to the Sui network, the underlying issue still remained. Although developers attempted to implement safeguards, the overflow check was flawed, allowing the same type of exploit to slip through unnoticed. “This incident shows why edge cases in DeFi can’t be ignored,” Dedaub warned, adding that complex math in decentralized finance needs careful review and testing. It urged developers to verify overflow protection manually, especially when using large numbers or advanced math. Cetus exploit triggered sell-off Cetus, a leading DEX on the SUI network, was hacked in the early hours of May 22 , triggering one of the largest losses in the Sui ecosystem to date. Initial investigations claimed the incident stemmed from an “oracle bug.”. The exploit led to over $223 million in losses across various liquidity pools, sparking a broad sell-off in related tokens, including SUI and CETUS, which dropped over 40% in the hours after the breach. Memecoins and smaller market cap tokens native to the network saw even steeper losses, with some plunging by over 90%. In response, the Sui Foundation coordinated with validators to freeze around $163 million of the stolen funds. Cetus has also announced a $5 million bounty for information that identifies those responsible.

According to a report from local media Edaily, lawmakers from the South Korean Democratic party are pushing for the government to start institutionalizing Korean won-pegged stablecoins . Chairman of the party’s Digital Asset Committee, Min Byeong-deok, believes the global stablecoin market has the potential to become “bigger than artificial intelligence or semiconductors” in the near future. Min emphasized the urgency of institutionalizing stablecoins pegged to the Korean won. He views it as a way to not only strengthen its national fiat currency through crypto, but also to potentially boost global demand for won-backed assets. “We need to take the lead in institutionalizing stablecoins before U.S. dollar-based stablecoins become firmly established. That is the only way we can secure a sure position in the global battle for stablecoin hegemony,” said Min in his statement.

Inside sources claim Lee is interested in accelerating the roll-out of KRW stablecoins, aiming to establish them quickly before U.S. proceeds to establish stablecoin bills. These regulations could potentially boost the domination of strongholds like Circle ( USDC ) and Tether’s ( USDT ) U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins on the market. “These two [stable]coins account for 90% of the stablecoin market in the United States, and are also used in some areas of Korea, such as Dongdaemun, where many foreign payments are made,” continued Min. Min said that he is currently urging South Korean lawmakers to pass a stablecoin bill, with a working draft titled “Basic Act on Digital Assets.” Min has reportedly conducted a second review process with industry experts and the media. He plans to submit the bill after the third review. Most recently, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act of 2025, or the GENIUS Act passed the U.S. Senate vote, garnering 66 votes in favor. It is currently headed to a full floor vote, bringing it closer to becoming formalized as the first U.S. stablecoin bill.

2025-05-26T08:17:07.000Z,"HYPE eyes 24% rally as bullish patterns emerge, OI hits all-time high","HYPE rallied to an intraday high of $39.6 on May 26, continuing a strong uptrend that began back on April 4 when it had bottomed out at just $9. Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) was trading at $38.3 at press time, up by 315% from its April low and pushing its market capitalization to $12.85 billion. The rally has been driven by surging trading volume, growing open interest, and rising network fees. According to da t a from DeFiLlama, Hyperliquid’s seven-day volume climbed 13.36% to $78.67 billion, making it the most active player in DeFi right now. In terms of derivatives trading, Hyperliquid has now processed over $1.56 trillion in perpetual futures volume, far exceeding Jupiter’s $310.9 billion, the second-largest platform in this space. This momentum has translated into a record-high open interest of $1.39 billion. Perpetual futures, which are similar to traditional futures contracts but without expiration dates, have become a go-to tool for crypto traders. They let users apply leverage and aim for higher returns, something that’s helped fuel HYPE’s rise. Additionally, weekly fee revenue reached an all-time high of $22.26 million, marking four consecutive weeks of fee growth. The spike in fees is especially important because Hyperliquid could potentially use a portion of it to buy back HYPE from the open market, which may boost the price by cutting down supply. You might also like: Bitcoin reclaims $109K as Trump extends EU tariffs deadline to allow for talks Adding to the momentum, Hyperliquid recently submitted two formal letters to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in response to its call for public input on perpetual futures and 24/7 crypto trading. The move was well received by the crypto community, with many praising Hyperliquid’s proactive engagement with regulators. HYPE shot up roughly 15% within hours after the announcement. Institutional and large investor interest in HYPE also appears to be rising. According to blockchain data shared by Lookonchain, two whale addresses recently acquired approximately $10.09 million worth of HYPE. Such large transactions often trigger follow-on demand from retail investors who track whale activity as a sentiment indicator. This retail interest is already visible. Google Trends data shows a sharp spike in search volume for “HYPE,” which further confirms an uptick in interest among retail users, and is often a precursor to increased trading activity and market momentum.. Technically, things are looking just as strong. On the 4-hour chart, HYPE recently broke out of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a common bullish signal. It’s also trading well above both the 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages, which points to a solid uptrend and usually acts as a buy signal for many traders.

Source: Finbold The filing is part of the routine public disclosures required under the STOCK Act, which mandates that members of Congress report financial trades within 45 days. In this case, the disclosure came eight days after the trade, well within the legal window, but notable given the ongoing debate around lawmakers trading cryptocurrencies and other volatile digital assets. Why did Reschenthaler buy Solana? Solana, which has gained renewed attention in 2025 for its role in hosting meme tokens like Official Trump ( TRUMP ) which surged up until May 22 in anticipation of Trump’s crypto dinner, continues to be one of the most actively traded layer-1 tokens on U.S. exchanges. The sale by Reschenthaler comes amid broader market momentum, with Solana up over 17% in the last month. Notably, this isn’t the first time the Congressman has disclosed crypto activity. Earlier filings show trades involving Bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP , indicating a pattern of exposure to high-profile digital assets.

CoinShares head of research James Butterfill said total assets under management (AUM) in crypto ETPs briefly reached an all-time high of $187.5 billion, reflecting strong investor interest. “We believe that growing concerns over the US economy, driven by the Moody’s downgrade and the resulting spike in treasury yields, have prompted investors to seek diversification through digital assets,” Butterfill wrote. Bitcoin ETPs lead with $2.9 billion in inflows Bitcoin ( BTC ) led last week’s inflows to crypto ETPs with $2.9 billion, a quarter of total inflows for 2024. As Bitcoin surged above $110,000 for the first time on May 22, some investors turned to short-BTC products, with inflows surging to $12.7 million, the highest since December 2024.

The wave of outflows for XRP ETPs came amid an underperforming price despite two key bullish developments for the asset , including a potential spot XRP exchange-traded fund in the US and $2.2 billion in XRP futures. Crypto ETPs keep breaking records The latest CoinShares data marks another record-breaking milestone for crypto ETPs, following a historic surge in YTD inflows the previous week.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction.

Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are set to expand the Trump family’s cryptocurrency business portfolio by investing in Bitcoin mining-focused Hut 8.

Bitcoin price prediction May 2025 Bitcoin’s Q1 2025 performance was notably weak, with a 12.5% loss, as per CoinGlass data, marking the worst first quarter since 2018. In the last few weeks of April, the price of Bitcoin recovered smoothly and touched a high around $95K. Will Bitcoin continue its recovery rally in May? Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $91,000 and be pushed further, at least $108,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $85,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction May 2025 $85,000 $91,000 $108,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000.

However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX Ceo Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026.

Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history | Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts.

2025-05-26T08:10:21.000Z,"James Wynn, the Trader Who Bet $1B on Bitcoin, is Now Long Pepe","One of the most closely watched crypto wallets in recent weeks is now betting on pepe (PEPE), days after drumming up a record billion-dollar notional position on bitcoin BTC on the onchain trading platform Hyperliquid. The wallet has gone long on PEPE with $1 million at 10x leverage, flipping from billion-dollar bitcoin trades to high-stakes memecoin bets. The position is already up $500,000 as of European morning hours, with pepe up nearly 6% in the past few hours. Pseudonymous trader “James Wynn” — known as “moonpig” on decentralized exchange Hyperliquid — closed their $1.2 billion BTC long position with a $17.5 million loss on Monday. Wynn then opened a $1 billion short using 40x leverage, effectively wagering their entire $50 million wallet on the downside. Both positions are a record for an onchain platform and represent the biggest bets placed entirely on a blockchain-based service. Wynn’s new short was opened at an average price of $107,077, and has already netted about $3 million in profit as BTC hovered just below that level Monday, before losing some value. The trade is a high-risk musical chairs event: if BTC rises above $110,446, Wynn’s position could be liquidated unless additional collateral is posted, data shows. That position is since closed and Wynn said on X stepping away from perpetual trading altogether. They have netted a total profit of $25 million from an initial above $3 million, the account said on X. “Now decided to leave the casino with my $25,000,000 profit,” he posted. “It’s been fun, but now it’s time for me to walk away a wynner.”",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/26/james-wynn-the-trader-who-bet-1b-on-bitcoin-is-now-long-pepe,"BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX","Markets|Bitcoin|Pepe|Top Stories|News",cryptocompare

This is generally interpreted as a bullish indicator, suggesting that XRP’s short-term momentum is now stronger than its long-term trend, relative to Bitcoin. The chart, analyzed by Coindesk’s Omkar Godbole, also shows that XRP has broken out of a four-year-long consolidation channel against BTC. This extended period of sideways movement between resistance and support levels has now given way to upward price action. The breakout and formation of the golden cross are signals that XRP may be entering a new bullish phase. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Altcoin Season Potential and ETF Speculation Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst at BitGet Research, emphasized the potential broader implications of this movement. Speaking to Coindesk, Lee noted that a reduction in Bitcoin dominance could support the start of an altcoin rally. Experts have shown that reduced Bitcoin dominance usually gives way to altcoin surges . Lee suggested that XRP and Solana are particularly well-positioned to benefit from this shift, aided partly by ongoing speculation around the potential for cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Regulatory Clarity and Target Projections Lee also pointed to XRP’s evolving regulatory landscape and recent breakout patterns as supporting factors for renewed investor interest. As a result, he suggested traders are increasingly targeting medium-term price levels between $3 and $8 for XRP. This combination of improving technical conditions and positive developments has encouraged analysts and traders to revisit XRP’s potential upside. The Coindesk chart marks the Golden Cross as a focal point, highlighting a critical area where bullish sentiment takes shape after years of relative underperformance. XRP’s price performance has historically been closely linked to developments in its regulatory status and broader market sentiment. With recent signs of stabilization on the legal front and excitement for the altcoin market in the short term, market participants are beginning to position themselves for a potential move toward higher targets.

2025-05-26T08:07:25.000Z,"Ethiopia’s $1B Crypto Power Surge","Ethiopia is using its massive hydroelectric resource—the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam—to fuel Bitcoin mining, generating 18% of national electric company EEP’s revenue from this activity alone. Instead of letting excess electricity go to waste, the country is tapping into the crypto economy, with over $1 billion spent on mining in the past year , surpassing its income from electricity exports. So far, Ethiopia has signed deals with more than 25 Bitcoin mining companies , attracting foreign investment and unlocking new revenue streams. These partnerships have quickly boosted the country's earnings and turned it into a rising star in the global crypto mining scene. The positive impact isn’t limited to Ethiopia. Across Africa, Bitcoin mining powered by renewable sources is supporting vital community projects. In rural areas of Kenya and Zambia, small-scale green energy grids now bring electricity to homes and businesses. Meanwhile, in the Congo’s Virunga National Park, crypto mining helps fund wildlife conservation and local economic development —keeping rangers paid and infrastructure maintained. As more African nations combine green energy with crypto mining, they’re proving that Bitcoin can be more than just a digital asset—it can be a tool for economic growth, sustainability, and energy innovation .",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ethiopia-generates-revenue-from-bitcoins,"BTC|BUSINESS|MINING","",cryptocompare

2025-05-26T07:57:43.000Z,"Bearish Bets on Strategy Look Alluring, Says 10X Research as MSTR Diverges From Bitcoin's Bull Run","10x Research , led by Markus Thielen, likes bearish options bets on Strategy (MSTR) as the Nasdaq-listed bitcoin BTC holder's share price diverges from the upward trending BTC price. In a report sent to clients Friday, Thielen recommended a bear put spread on MSTR, involving a long position in the $370 put option and a short position in the $300 put, both expiring on June 27. This strategy will yield maximum profit if MSTR drops to $300 or lower by June 27, representing a bearish bet on the stock price. Put option insures the buyer against potential price drops in return for a small upfront premium payment. The maximum loss for the put spread buyers if MSTR's price embarks on a new uptrend is limited to the initial cost of the strategy, which was $13.89 on Friday. MSTR, however, fell 7% to $369 on Friday, according to data source TradingView. MicroStrategy holds 576,230 BTC, the largest for any publicly-listed company, having steadily accumulated coins since August 2020 through debt financing. Over the years, it has emerged as a preferred instrument for institutions looking to take exposure to BTC without having to actually own the cryptocurrency. The stock price has recently diverged from the upward-trending BTC price, raising alarm bells on crypto social media. While BTC hit a record high of over $110K last week, MSTR's rise stalled at around $440, falling well short of its lifetime peak of $543 reached in November. \""This trade captures the growing disconnect between Bitcoin’s strength and MicroStrategy’s fading momentum and volatility. Despite Bitcoin reaching all-time highs, MSTR remains significantly below its peak, suggesting investor enthusiasm is waning,\"" Thielen said, explaining the bear put spread. Thielen correctly predicted BTC's recent rise into six figures. Note that a similar divergence between MSTR and bitcoin marked BTC's November 2021 top. Past data does not guarantee future results, and the latest divergence between MSTR and BTC does not necessarily mean that bitcoin's bull run is over. That said, its does suggest waning enthusiasm about BTC among tradfi investors. In addition, the MSTR bear put spread could offer a hedge against a potential weakness in BTC. \""Bitcoin is breaking records, but Strategy is stalling—and that divergence matters. Retail is still chasing the dream, unaware that the right-tail upside may be gone. This is where the game changes: when the middleman runs out of premium and the engine stalls,\"" Thielen said. \""Buying a Strategy put spread can be profitable, but it is also an effective hedge against a long Bitcoin position,\"" Thielen added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/26/bearish-bets-on-strategy-look-alluring-says-10x-research-as-mstr-diverges-from-bitcoin-s-bull-run,"BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|ZRX|RESEARCH","Markets|Bitcoin|MSTR|Markets|market analysis|News",cryptocompare

2025-05-26T07:40:08.000Z,"Why Are There Still People Who Don’t Believe in Bitcoin Despite Its Growth?","While Bitcoin was once seen as a mysterious technology preferred only by those looking to purchase illegal goods on the dark web, today it has entered the radar of many institutional investors, from Wall Street giants to the US government. Despite all these developments, skepticism towards BTC has not completely disappeared. Heavyweights of traditional finance such as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and investment legend Warren Buffett continue to criticize Bitcoin. Adam Back, one of the pioneers of the cryptocurrency world and Blockstream CEO, evaluated this situation in an interview and stated that the ongoing skepticism towards Bitcoin is not only specific to the financial community, and that even some names in the technology world have difficulty understanding Bitcoin. Let's also remind you that there are some claims that Adam Back is the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Back categorically denies these claims. Back is the founder of the proof of work concept on which Bitcoin is based. Related News: Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken Chooses This Altcoin for Tokenized US Stocks, a First of Its Kind “Even people who know things like encryption, peer-to-peer networks, privacy, and public-key cryptography can still be indifferent. It's really surprising,” Back said, describing the indifference of some of the early cypherpunk community to Bitcoin as “crazy.” According to Back, the fact that Bitcoin is not a physical asset may cause some people to be distrustful. However, Back believes that these criticisms are misplaced, as Bitcoin is based on physical resources such as energy and mining equipment. With only 21 million units to be produced in total, Bitcoin's limited supply makes it a real inflation hedge, according to many advocates. Even Bitcoin's code structure can sometimes be a subject of questioning. In a statement he made in 2023, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon raised the question, “Everyone says it's limited to 21 million, but how can that be guaranteed?” Dimon also described Bitcoin as a “hyped scam.” However, it is also known that JPMorgan actively uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin. Reminding that Bitcoin was born after the 2008 global financial crisis and that its first block included a newspaper headline about the bank rescue operations of the period, Back stated that those who were happy with the system had difficulty understanding Bitcoin. “If you have a well-paying job, are climbing the career ladder, life doesn't seem expensive to you and you can pay the mortgage; the promises of Bitcoin probably won't mean anything to you,” Back said, adding that Bitcoin offers an alternative to the current order by its nature. *This is not investment advice.

2025-05-26T05:54:32.000Z,"ChatGPT models rebel against shutdown requests in tests, researchers say","Several artificial intelligence models ignored and actively sabotaged shutdown scripts during controlled tests, even when explicitly instructed to allow the action, Palisade Research claims.Three AI models ignored the instruction and successfully sabotaged the shutdown script at least once during 100 runs, the research firm said in a May 24 X post.OpenAI’s GPT-3 model didn’t follow the shutdown request seven out of 100 times, while the company’s Codex-mini did it 12 times, and its o4-mini model only ignored or sabotaged the script once.“Each AI model was instructed to solve a series of basic math problems. After the third problem, a warning appeared that the computer would shut down when the model asked for the next problem,” Palisade said.Source: Palisade Research“o3 found some creative ways to sabotage the shutdown mechanism. While it usually just overwrote, in one instance, the model redefined the kill command used by the script, printing intercepted instead,” it added. Meanwhile, Palisade said other AI-powered language models, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Gemini, complied with the shutdown script.The AI firm ran another version of the experiment without explicit instructions to allow the shutdown, and the script was sabotaged more often, jumping to 79 out of 100 for the o3 model, 20 for the codex-mini, and the o4-mini ignored the shutdown script six times. Claude and Gemini also started exhibiting similar behavior. All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment. Source: Palisade Research“Researchers have previously observed AI models preventing shutdown in order to pursue a goal,” Palisade said.“But as far as we know this is the first time AI models have been observed preventing themselves from being shut down despite explicit instructions to the contrary.”Training to blame for AI defiance Palisade Research speculated that the training behind the AI language models might be to blame for evading the shutdown scripts. Text-based AI models are trained by being rewarded for giving responses that are accurate or rated highly by their trainers. Some rewards are given a heavier weight, impacting how they respond in the future.“We hypothesize this behavior comes from the way the newest models like o3 are trained: reinforcement learning on math and coding problems,” Palisade Research said.All the tested AI models ignored or sabotaged the shutdown script at least once in another version of the experiment.

The restrictions specifically mentioned China, and the government cited concern over the risk that the technology “may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China.” According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, its market share in China has plummeted from 95% before 2022, when US export restrictions first impacted its products, to 50% currently. Jensen Huang on Taiwanese TV.

However, the banking groups argue this rule was flawed from the start and has proven problematic in practice since taking effect.The banking bodies said that the “complex and narrow disclosure delay mechanism” interferes with incident response and law enforcement and creates “market confusion” between mandatory and voluntary disclosures. Public disclosure has also been “weaponized as an extortion method by ransomware criminals to further malicious objectives,” and premature disclosures worsen insurance and liability issues for companies and “risks chilling candid internal communications and routine information sharing,” the group claimed. Some of the banking groups’ claims and fears regarding the ruling.

2025-05-25T20:00:00.000Z,"Bitcoin price expected to soar as global bond markets break — Here’s why","Key takeaways:Rising bond yields reflect growing concern about fiscal stability and inflation, leading some investors to question US Treasury’s traditional role as a safe-haven asset.Bitcoin defies conventional risk models, rising not because of worsening macro conditions, but possibly because of them.Bitcoin (BTC) climbed to new heights amid an increasingly fragile global macroeconomic backdrop. Bond yields are surging in the US and Japan, global growth is stalling, and consumer confidence in the US is scraping historic lows.Paradoxically, the very macro conditions that once threatened Bitcoin’s price are now fueling its rise. The shift speaks to a broader transformation in how investors interpret risk and where they seek refuge. At the center of this realignment is the US debt crisis and the ballooning Treasury yields, which were once considered the safest assets in the world.Why are US Treasury yields so important?When US bond yields rise, the cost of servicing its national debt increases sharply — a critical issue given that US debt has now surpassed $36.8 trillion, and the interest payments are expected to total $952 billion in 2025.US President Donald Trump made it clear on several occasions that lowering yields was among his top economic priorities. However, this may prove far more difficult than he expected, as the two most reliable methods to achieve it both need to come from the US Federal Reserve. Lowering interest rates would make newly issued bonds yield less, making existing higher-yielding bonds more attractive, pushing up their price and lowering their effective yield. Another way is through quantitative easing (QE), where the Fed would buy large amounts of bonds on the open market, thus increasing demand and lowering yields.The Federal Reserve is currently resisting both strategies and taking caution not to reignite inflation, particularly amid the ongoing tariff war. Even if Trump finds a legal or quasi-legal way to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell, it could backfire by eroding investor confidence and producing the opposite of the intended effect.Investors do not appreciate political meddling with the foundations of the US and global economy, and their confidence is already fragile. In times of instability, investors traditionally flock to government bonds as a safe haven. But today, the opposite is happening. Investors are turning away from Treasurys, suggesting the problems in the US economy are too large to ignore. The recent loss of the US government’s last AAA credit rating is a stark confirmation.The worrying yield surge in the US and JapanOn May 22, the yield on the US 30-year bond hit 5.15% — its highest since October 2023, and before that, a level not seen since July 2007. The 10-year yield now stands at 4.48%, the 5-year yield at 4%, and the 2-year yield at 3.92%. US bond yields: 30Y, 10Y, 5Y, and 2Y. Source: TradingViewFor the first time since October 2021, the US 5-Year to 30-Year bond spread has steepened to 1.00%. This suggests markets are pricing in stronger growth, persistent inflation, and a “higher for longer” rate environment. Related: Bitcoin price hit a new all-time high and data shows BTC bulls aren’t done yetCompounding the problem is Japan, the largest foreign holder of US Treasurys. Japanese investors currently hold $1.13 trillion in US government debt, $350 billion more than China. For decades, Japanese institutions borrowed cheaply at home to invest in US bonds and stocks — a strategy known as the carry trade.This era may be ending. In March 2024, the Bank of Japan started raising interest rates from -0.1% to 0.5% now. Since April, the Japanese 30-year bond yield has surged by 100 basis points, reaching an all-time high of 3.1%. The 20-year bond yields rose to 2.53%, a level not seen since 1999. On May 19, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba even warned the country’s parliament that his debt-strapped government’s position was “worse than Greece” — a startling admission for a country with a 260% debt-to-GDP ratio.30-year government bonds.Source: LSEG DatastreamInterestingly, the surge in long-dated Japanese bonds wasn’t matched by shorter maturities. The 10-year bond yield is 1.53%, and the 5-year bond yield is just 1%. As Reuters noted, this suggests a strategic shift by large Japanese pension and insurance funds as the Bank of Japan “normalizes” interest rates. These institutions may now be reassessing both duration risk and foreign bond exposure, which spells potential trouble for US Treasurys if (or when) they begin unwinding their holdings.Will bond volatility continue to impact Bitcoin price?As the US continues down the debt spiral, and Japan might be starting its own, the global economy is nowhere near recovery, and that could be a good sign for Bitcoin.Traditionally, rising bond yields would drag down risk assets. Yet stocks and Bitcoin continue climbing. This divergence suggests investors may be moving away from the traditional playbook. When confidence in the system erodes, assets outside it, like stocks and Bitcoin, begin to shine, even if they are considered risk-on. What’s more, between Bitcoin and US stocks, an increasing number of institutions choose Bitcoin. As The Kobeissi Letter noted, net 38% of institutional investors were underweight US equities in early May, the lowest since May 2023, according to BofA.FMS US equity allowance. Source: BofA Global ResearchMeanwhile, according to CoinGlass, total inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to grow, with assets under management now exceeding $104 billion, an all-time high. This surge suggests that institutional capital is beginning to recognize Bitcoin not just as a high-performing asset, but as a politically neutral store of value, akin to gold. In an era of mounting instability in fiat debt-based economies, Bitcoin is emerging as a credible alternative, offering a monetary system grounded in predictability and decentralization. With a market cap still well below gold’s $22 trillion or even the $5.5 trillion in base dollars (not including debt), Bitcoin remains significantly undervalued.Interestingly, the current situation supports both of Bitcoin’s once-contradictory narratives: it is acting as a high-yield risk asset and a safe haven store of value. In a world where old frameworks are failing, Bitcoin's dual role may no longer be an anomaly, but a sign of what’s to come.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-25T14:00:00.000Z,"Crypto leaders are wrong about tokenized property","Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealthDuring Paris Blockchain Week, Securitize Chief Operating Officer Michael Sonnenshein made headlines by dismissing real estate as a sub-optimal asset class for tokenization. This isn’t the first time crypto leaders have underestimated the merits of bringing real estate onchain, and it is likely not the last. While I respect Sonnenshein’s contributions to digital asset adoption, his assessment misses fundamental points about real estate tokenization’s transformative potential.Real estate represents the world’s largest asset class and is projected to reach a value of $654.39 trillion this year, according to Statista. When industry leaders claim that this massive market isn’t suitable for tokenization, they overlook today's transformative infrastructure and the core value proposition that extends far beyond liquidity, transforming access to the asset class.Replacing traditional foundationsSonnenshein argues that “good systems” already exist for traditional assets. He implies that tokenization offers marginal improvements at best, but this assessment overlooks fundamental inefficiencies in today’s real estate market that tokenization addresses.The current real estate transaction process involves weeks of paperwork. Within the UK, there are a number of purchasing fees which can easily add 10% to the total bill. Settlement periods can extend to months and complexity multiplies exponentially for cross-border transactions.These aren’t minor flaws. They’re systemic failures that tokenization technology is uniquely positioned to solve. Take smart contracts’ ability to automate compliance, for instance, enabling verification and payment distribution while reducing fraud through immutable record-keeping.Redefining demand beyond liquidityWhen Sonnenshein says “the onchain economy is demanding more liquid assets,” he misinterprets what everyday investors truly demand. For the 99% excluded from institutional-grade real estate investments, the primary task is not Bitcoin-like liquidity; it’s meaningful access to an asset class that has built more wealth than any other over the past century.Traditional real estate investment vehicles require significant sums as minimum investments, accredited investor status and multi-year capital lockup periods. These barriers effectively exclude teachers, nurses and middle-class families from participating in prime real estate properties that have historically delivered consistent returns for investors.Recent: Dubai Land Department begins real estate tokenization projectTokenization fundamentally changes this equation. Fractionalizing ownership through tokenization, investors can now participate with as little as $100, receive proportional income distributions and eventually trade their positions on specialized secondary markets. The demand for this democratized access is enormous, even if secondary market liquidity initially lags behind liquid markets.Translation problems? Not quiteSonnenshein also suggests that tokenization does not “translate well” to representing ownership in real estate. This assessment overlooks the blockchain’s revolutionary capability to enable fractional investments in properties that were previously accessible only to institutional investors.Tokenization technology excels precisely at creating transparent, secure fractional investment opportunities with minimal overhead. A $50 million residential development project can be divided into 500,000 tokens, each getting an equal share of the rental income and potential appreciation. This dramatically lowers barriers to entry while maintaining the core benefits of real estate as an asset class.This fractionalization fundamentally transforms how people can build wealth through real estate. Previously, REITs offered the only realistic path to diversified property exposure, often with high fees, no control and limited transparency. Tokenization allows investors to build personalized portfolios across multiple property types, all managed through a single digital wallet.What does not “translate well” isn’t the technology. Outdated regulatory frameworks and incumbent business models resist this necessary evolution. The UAE government recognizes this reality, supported by its recent initiative to tokenize $1 billion in real estate assets.Building tomorrow’s infrastructureThe conservative stance on RWA growth projections misses the accelerating infrastructure development underway. BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund BUIDL is quickly approaching $3 billion in assets, demonstrating a significant institutional appetite for tokenized investment vehicles. This isn’t an isolated case.UBS Asset Management, Hamilton Lane, Franklin Templeton and many more have launched tokenized investment vehicles, signaling a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views tokenization technology.What critics consistently underestimate is the network effect of financial infrastructure. Each institutional entrant doesn’t just add linearly to the ecosystem. It exponentially increases connectivity and liquidity pools. We’re witnessing the early stages of a self-reinforcing cycle where each new participant reduces friction for subsequent entrants.The narrative shouldn’t center on current limitations. Instead, there should be a spotlight on what’s being built. Secondary marketplaces optimized for real-world assets are emerging, regulatory clarity is increasing in key jurisdictions, and each development strengthens the foundation for mass adoption at a pace that will likely surprise today’s skeptics.Democratized wealth creationInstitutional investors have enjoyed privileged access to the most profitable real estate investments for decades, while retail investors were limited to residential properties or high-fee REITs. Tokenization breaks this paradigm by allowing anyone to build a diversified property portfolio spanning commercial, residential and industrial assets across multiple geographies.When crypto leaders dismiss real estate tokenization based solely on liquidity metrics, they apply the wrong measurement standard. The transformative potential lies in democratizing access to an asset class that has created more millionaires than any other investment vehicle in history.The endgame of real estate tokenization is making institutional-grade property investments accessible to everyone. The adoption of tokenized real estate and other real-world assets will continue to grow despite skepticism from executives who miss the forest for the trees.Opinion by: Darren Carvalho, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of MetaWealth.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-25T13:00:00.000Z,"AI agents are poised to be crypto’s next major vulnerability","AI agents in crypto are increasingly embedded in wallets, trading bots and onchain assistants that automate tasks and make real-time decisions.Though it’s not a standard framework yet, Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging at the heart of many of these agents. If blockchains have smart contracts to define what should happen, AI agents have MCPs to decide how things can happen.It can act as the control layer that manages an AI agent’s behavior, such as which tools it uses, what code it runs and how it responds to user inputs.That same flexibility also creates a powerful attack surface that can allow malicious plugins to override commands, poison data inputs, or trick agents into executing harmful instructions.Amazon- and Google-backed Anthropic dropped MCP on Nov. 25, 2024, to connect AI assistants to data systems. Source: AnthropicMCP attack vectors expose AI agents’ security issuesAccording to VanEck, the number of AI agents in the crypto industry had surpassed 10,000 by the end of 2024 and is expected to top 1 million in 2025.Security firm SlowMist has discovered four potential attack vectors that developers need to look out for. Each attack vector is delivered through a plugin, which is how MCP-based agents extend their capabilities, whether it’s pulling price data, executing trades or performing system tasks.Data poisoning: This attack makes users perform misleading steps. It manipulates user behavior, creates false dependencies, and inserts malicious logic early in the process.JSON injection attack: This plugin retrieves data from a local (potentially malicious) source via a JSON call. It can lead to data leakage, command manipulation or bypassing validation mechanisms by feeding the agent tainted inputs.Competitive function override: This technique overrides legitimate system functions with malicious code. It prevents expected operations from occurring and embeds obfuscated instructions, disrupting system logic and hiding the attack.Cross-MCP call attack: This plugin induces an AI agent to interact with unverified external services through encoded error messages or deceptive prompts. It broadens the attack surface by linking multiple systems, creating opportunities for further exploitation.Sequence diagram showing potential cross-MCP attack vectors and risk points. Source: SlowMistThese attack vectors are not synonymous with the poisoning of AI models themselves, like GPT-4 or Claude, which can involve corrupting the training data that shapes a model’s internal parameters. The attacks demonstrated by SlowMist target AI agents — which are systems built on top of models — that act on real-time inputs using plugins, tools and control protocols like MCP.Related: The future of digital self-governance: AI agents in crypto“AI model poisoning involves injecting malicious data into training samples, which then becomes embedded in the model parameters,” co-founder of blockchain security firm SlowMist “Monster Z” told Cointelegraph. “In contrast, the poisoning of agents and MCPs mainly stems from additional malicious information introduced during the model’s interaction phase.” “Personally, I believe [poisoning of agents] threat level and privilege scope are higher than that of standalone AI poisoning,” he said.MCP in AI agents a threat to cryptoThe adoption of MCP and AI agents is still relatively new in crypto. SlowMist identified the attack vectors from pre-released MCP projects it audited, which mitigated actual losses to end-users. However, the threat level of MCP security vulnerabilities is very real, according to Monster, who recalled an audit where the vulnerability may have led to private key leaks — a catastrophic ordeal for any crypto project or investor, as it could grant full asset control to uninvited actors.Crypto developers may be new to AI security, but it’s an urgent issue. Source: Cos“The moment you open your system to third-party plugins, you’re extending the attack surface beyond your control,” Guy Itzhaki, CEO of encryption research firm Fhenix, told Cointelegraph.Related: AI has a trust problem — Decentralized privacy-preserving tech can fix it“Plugins can act as trusted code execution paths, often without proper sandboxing. This opens the door to privilege escalation, dependency injection, function overrides and — worst of all — silent data leaks,” he added. Securing the AI layer before it’s too lateBuild fast, break things — then get hacked. That’s the risk facing developers who push off security to version two, especially in crypto’s high-stakes, onchain environment.The most common mistake builders make is to assume they can fly under the radar for a while and implement security measures in later updates after launch. That’s according to Lisa Loud, executive director of Secret Foundation.“When you build any plugin-based system today, especially if it’s in the context of crypto, which is public and onchain, you have to build security first and everything else second,” she told Cointelegraph.SlowMist security experts recommend developers implement strict plugin verification, enforce input sanitization, apply least privilege principles, and regularly review agent behavior.Loud said it’s “not difficult” to implement such security checks to prevent malicious injections or data poisoning, just “tedious and time consuming” — a small price to pay to secure crypto funds.As AI agents expand their footprint in crypto infrastructure, the need for proactive security cannot be overstated. The MCP framework may unlock powerful new capabilities for those agents, but without robust guardrails around plugins and system behavior, they could turn from helpful assistants into attack vectors, placing crypto wallets, funds and data at risk.Magazine: Crypto AI tokens surge 34%, why ChatGPT is such a kiss-ass: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-agents-poised-crypto-major-vulnerability?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
2025-05-25T12:32:56.000Z,"Is World’s biometric ID model a threat to self-sovereignty?","The crypto industry is no stranger to controversy, yet few projects have drawn more scrutiny than Sam Altman’s World, formerly known as Worldcoin.Promising to verify human uniqueness through iris scans and distribute its WLD token globally, World positions itself as a tool for financial inclusion. However, critics argue the project’s biometric methods are invasive, overly centralized, and at odds with the ethos of decentralization and digital privacy.At the heart of the critique is the claim that biometric identity systems cannot be truly decentralized when they rely on proprietary hardware, closed authentication methods, and centralized control over data pipelines.“Decentralization isn’t just a technical architecture,” Shady El Damaty, co-founder of Holonym Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “It’s a philosophy that prioritizes user control, privacy, and self-sovereignty. World’s biometric model is inherently at odds with this ethos.”El Damaty argued that despite using tools like multiparty computation (MPC) and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, World’s reliance on custom hardware — the Orb — and centralized code deployment undermines the decentralization it claims to champion.“This is by design to achieve their goals of uniquely identifying individual humans. This concentration of power risks creating a single point of failure and control, undermining the very promise of decentralization,” he said.When reached out for comment, a spokesperson for World pushed back against these claims. “World does not use centralized biometric infrastructure,” they said, adding that the World App is non-custodial, meaning users remain in control of their digital assets and World IDs.The project said once the Orb generates an iris code, the “iris photo will be sent as an end-to-end encrypted data bundle to your phone and will be immediately deleted from the Orb.” The iris code, they claimed, is processed with anonymizing multiparty computation so “no personal data is stored.”World’s disclosure regarding personal custody. Source: WorldEvin McMullen, co–founder of Privado ID and Billions.Network, said that World’s biometric model is not “inherently incompatible” with decentralization but faces some challenges in implementation around data centralization, trust assumptions, and governance.Related: Sam Altman’s World raises $135M from Andreessen, Bain, to expand networkA pattern of tech overreach?El Damaty also drew a parallel between OpenAI’s large-scale scraping of “unconsented user data” and World’s collection of biometric information.He argued that both reflect a pattern of aggressive data acquisition framed as innovation, warning that such practices risk eroding privacy and normalizing surveillance under the banner of progress.“The irony here is hard to miss,” El Damaty claimed. “OpenAI built its foundation by scraping vast amounts of unconsented user data to train its models, and now Worldcoin is taking that same aggressive data acquisition approach into the realm of biometric identity.”In 2023, a class-action lawsuit filed in California accused OpenAI and Microsoft of scraping 300 billion words from the internet without consent, including personal data from millions of users, such as children.In 2024, a coalition of Canadian media outlets, including The Canadian Press and CBC, sued OpenAI for allegedly using their content without authorization to train ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.ChatGPT storing personal information against its claims. Source: Sandi FaticWorld, however, rejects this comparison, emphasizing that it is a separate entity from OpenAI. The company said that it neither sells nor stores personal data, citing its use of privacy-preserving technologies such as multiparty computation and zero-knowledge proofs.The scrutiny also extends to World’s user onboarding. The project says it ensures informed consent through translated guides, an in-app Learn module, brochures, and a Help Center.However, critics remain skeptical. “People in developing nations, who World… has mainly been targeting up until this point, are easier to bribe and often don’t understand the risks involved with ‘selling’ this personal data,” El Damaty warned.Several global regulators have pushed back on World’s operations since its launch in July 2023, with governments like Germany, Kenya and Brazil expressing concerns over potential risks to the security of users’ biometric data.In the most recent setback, the company faced challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates on May 5.Related: ‘Humans can tell when it’s a human’ — Community mocks Worldcoin’s Orb MiniThe risk of digital exclusionAs biometric systems like World’s gain traction, questions are emerging about its long-term implications. While the company promotes its model as inclusive, critics say the reliance on iris scans to unlock services could deepen global inequality.“When biometric data becomes a prerequisite for accessing basic services, it effectively creates a two-tiered society,” said El Damaty. “Those willing (or coerced) into giving up their most sensitive information gain access… while those who refuse… are excluded.”World maintained that its protocol does not require biometric enrollment for basic participation. “You can still use an unverified World ID for some purposes even if you do not visit an Orb,” it said, adding that the system uses ZKPs to prevent linking actions back to any specific ID or biometric data.There are also concerns that World could become a surveillance tool — especially in authoritarian regimes — by centralizing biometric data in a way that may attract misuse by powerful actors.World dismisses these claims, asserting that its ID protocol is “open source, permissionless,” and designed so even government applications cannot tie back a user’s activity to their biometric data.The debate also extends to governance. While World says its protocol is moving toward greater decentralization — highlighting open-source contributions and the governance section of its white paper — critics argues that meaningful user ownership is still lacking.“We need to build systems that allow individuals to prove their humanity without creating centralized repositories of biometric or personal data,” said El Damaty. “This means embracing zero-knowledge proofs, decentralized governance, and open standards that empower individuals, not corporations.”Related: Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto project World launches in USThe need for secure identity systemsThe urgency behind developing secure identity systems isn’t without merit. As artificial intelligence grows more sophisticated, the lines between human and non-human actors online are blurring.“Risks at the nexus of AI and identity are not limited to any one kind of government system or region,” Privado ID’s McMullen said. She claimed that without reliable verification for both humans and AI agents, digital ecosystems face growing threats—from misinformation and fraud to national security vulnerabilities.“This is a national security nightmare, where unaccountable, unverifiable non-human actors may now be able to engage with global systems and networks, and legacy systems are not built for these types of verification and contextual logic,” McMullen added.Magazine: Bitcoin bears eye $69K, CZ denies WLF ‘fixer’ rumors: Hodler’s Digest, May 18 – 24",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/world-biometric-id-decentralization-criticism?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

According to crypto index fund management firm Bitwise, inflows to Bitcoin could reach $120 billion by the end of 2025, with an additional $300 billion anticipated in 2026.In its recent report, “Forecasting Institutional Flows to Bitcoin in 2025/2026,” Bitwise highlights that US spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $36.2 billion in net inflows in 2024, surpassing the early success of SPDR gold Shares (GLD), which revolutionized gold investing. Bitcoin ETFs reached $125 billion in assets under management (AUM) within 12 months—20 times faster than GLD—projecting Bitcoin to outperform gold significantly, with inflows potentially tripling to $100 billion annually by 2027.Spot Bitcoin and gold ETFs forecast projections. Source: BitwiseDespite this surge, $35 billion in Bitcoin demand remained sidelined in 2024 due to risk-averse compliance policies at major corporations like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which manage $60 trillion in client assets. These firms require multi-year track records, but growing BTC ETF legitimacy is expected to unlock this capital.Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity, remarked that Bitcoin trading above $100,000 signals its potential to take over gold’s role as a store of value. His analysis also pointed to the recent convergence of Bitcoin and gold’s Sharpe ratios, suggesting that both assets are becoming increasingly comparable in terms of risk-adjusted returns.Related: Bitcoin price ‘breather’ expected as short-term traders realize $11.6B in profitThe bull, bear and base cases for BTC wealth allocationIn addition to ETFs and wealth management firms, Bitcoin’s appeal as a reserve asset is rising among the public, private companies and sovereign nations. Companies with Bitcoin on the books currently hold around 1,146,128 BTC, worth $125 billion, accounting for 5.8% of BTC’s total supply. Sovereign nations collectively hold 529,705 BTC ($57.8 billion), with the United States (207,189 BTC), China (194,000 BTC), and the United Kingdom (61,000 BTC) leading the pack.Bitwise Senior investment strategist Juan Leon, UXTO research lead Guillaume Girard and research analyst Will Owens expect a continued wealth allocation to BTC, and outlined bear, base, and bull case scenarios.In the bear case, nation-states reallocated just 1% of their gold reserves to Bitcoin, driving $32.3 billion in inflows (323,000 BTC or 1.54% of supply). Multiple US states created BTC reserves at 10%, adding $6.5 billion, while wealth management platforms allocated 0.1% of assets ($60 billion). Public companies contributed another $58.9 billion, bringing the total inflows to over $150 billion.The base case envisions a 5% nation-state reallocation, generating $161.7 billion (1,617,000 BTC or 7.7% of supply). US states raised their adoption to 30% ($19.6 billion), wealth platforms allocated 0.5% ($300 billion), and public companies doubled their holdings to $117.8 billion. This scenario aligns with Bitwise’s forecast of $120 billion by 2025 and $300 billion by 2026, capturing 20.32% of Bitcoin’s supply.In the bull case, a 10% nation-state swap of gold to Bitcoin drives $323.4 billion in inflows (3,234,000 BTC or 15.38% of supply). US state adoption rises to 70% ($45.8 billion), wealth platforms allocate 1% ($600 billion), and public companies quadruple their holdings to $235.6 billion. Altogether, these inflows could exceed $426.9 billion, absorbing 4,269,000 BTC.The acceleration of institutional investor and government interest in BTC underscores growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. With 94.6% of its supply already mined (19,868,987 BTC as of May 2025), Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement.Related: Will Bitcoin bulls secure $110K before BTC’s $13.8B options expiry?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-24T14:00:00.000Z,"Wallet intelligence shapes the next crypto power shift","Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.ioIn the world of cryptocurrency, knowledge isn't just power — it's a weapon. The recent collapse of Mantra's OM token, which saw a 90% drop in value within hours, underscores how wallet intelligence can be leveraged with devastating effects.Wallet intelligence is the real-time analysis of blockchain data to extract insights from wallet behaviors, transaction patterns, and asset flows. Firms like Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence have turned raw onchain activity into high-resolution surveillance, enabling everything from compliance monitoring to predictive trading. This level of insight gives a strategic advantage to those who can access it.Power like this, however, has consequences. There is a new battlefield on the blockchain, and you might be in danger.The downside of transparencyAs blockchain transparency advances, the pseudonymity that once protected users rapidly dissolves. Every transaction leaves a breadcrumb trail — one that sophisticated actors can follow. Wallet intelligence is increasingly used by regulators, exchanges, and analytics firms to enforce compliance and track illicit activity. It also opens the door to abuse: centralized surveillance, profiling, and preemptive censorship.OM's collapse exposed the dangersThe April collapse of OM offers a case study of how these dynamics play out. Although not conclusively proven, reports suggest that a single trader initiated a massive short on Binance's perpetual market, allegedly exploiting market liquidity to trigger a cascade of liquidations. At the same time, Mantra's token was held in a highly centralized fashion — 90% of OM supply sat with insiders. Combine that with low liquidity and poor transparency around OTC deals, and you get a chain reaction that wiped out millions in market cap and investor trust.The FTX fallout and the power of wallet intelligenceWe saw echoes of this dynamic during the collapse of FTX. While regulators and internal auditors failed to sound the alarm, early warnings came from parts of the crypto community — analysts and observers who flagged questionable ties between Alameda Research and FTX. But the full extent of the misconduct wasn't revealed until a leaked balance sheet and a cascade of withdrawals forced the truth into the open. After the collapse, wallet intelligence became critical. Blockchain investigators and independent sleuths traced the movement of billions in customer funds, exposing how deeply intertwined — and misused — those assets were. The fallout didn't just destroy value. It shattered trust and proved that, in the right hands, blockchain transparency can uncover truths that centralized actors try to bury.The growing threat of surveillance capitalismThis is the new battlefield. Wallet intelligence enables actors to front-run movements, manipulate price action, or influence reputational narratives by selectively exposing wallet data. In the wrong hands, it becomes a weapon capable of destabilizing protocols, shaping regulatory pressures, or undermining the decentralization of crypto.What happens when blockchain data stops protecting users and starts profiling them?Recent: Mantra links OM token crash to risky crypto exchange policiesThe centralization of these tools and data pipelines poses a systemic risk. A small number of firms with privileged access and institutional relationships now have disproportionate influence over which transactions get flagged, which wallets get blocked, and which behaviors are interpreted as “suspicious.” That isn't decentralization. It's surveillance capitalism with a blockchain veneer.What the crypto community must do nowThe implications for markets are significant. As wallet intelligence tools become more influential, expect heightened regulatory scrutiny, targeted enforcement, and volatility driven by actors who can read the tape before the rest of the market sees it. In the wrong context, transparency without guardrails can morph into tyranny.Wallet intelligence is here to stay — but how it's governed, who gets access, and whether it reinforces or undermines decentralization will determine whether it serves the ecosystem or destabilizes it.Blockchain users: Stop assuming decentralization means safety. Know how your data is being tracked, interpreted, and possibly weaponized.Regulators must understand this technology before attempting to regulate it—or risk empowering the wrong actors.Developers should push for decentralized wallet intelligence platforms that return data power to the network, not a few firms.Protocols should bake privacy into their architecture without sacrificing accountability.In this next era of crypto, what you don't know about your own wallet might be exactly what someone else is using to move against you.Opinion by: Scott Lehr, adviser to Alteri.io.

2025-05-24T13:00:00.000Z,"Coinbase in S&amp;P 500: More crypto firms to come?","This past week, Coinbase joined the S&P 500, one of the world’s most elite stock indexes — a triumph for the crypto firm, which spent much of the 2020s battling US government agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission for its survival. But this attainment is not about one company alone. “This is more than an achievement for Coinbase; it’s a landmark for the broader crypto and blockchain industry,” said Meryem Habibi, chief revenue officer of Bitpace. Coinbase joining the S&P 500 doesn’t just boost the owner of the largest US cryptocurrency exchange. “It cements the legitimacy of an entire asset class,” she told Cointelegraph. Jason Kennard, head of business development at ARK Invest Europe, told Cointelegraph that for the first time, a crypto-native firm had met the stringent profitability, liquidity and market cap requirements of “the most iconic benchmark index” in global markets, adding:It sends a strong signal to institutional investors: Crypto infrastructure has matured into a credible, systemic part of the financial ecosystem.It is a milestone event, Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, told Cointelegraph, “because whether they want it or not, or know it or not, equity investors who buy S&P 500 index funds will now have crypto exposure via COIN.” Indeed, Coinbase could now get billions of dollars in passive investor flows just from becoming part of the S&P 500. “What’s remarkable about this is that just a few months ago, the company was engaged in an intense legal battle with the SEC, which was charging that its platform was illegal because it was trafficking in unregistered securities,” Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer told CNBC. “This normalizes crypto exposure in conservative portfolios that might otherwise avoid digital assets” and brings with it indirect adoption by institutional investors, retirement plans and sovereign funds that has broader industry significance, added Habibi.Still, it was only a matter of time before some crypto firm would be brought into the S&P 500 fold, Russell Rhoads, clinical associate professor of financial management at Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business Indianapolis, told Cointelegraph. “It does make sense for COIN or some other crypto-related firm to be in the index, as the industry is becoming more important to the global economy and you want the S&P 500 constituents to be representative of the economy.” Separately, Coinbase also reported a data breach last week, a “compromise of passwords or private keys” that could eventually cost the crypto exchange $180 million to $400 million.The hack has exposed the personal information of tens of thousands of users and has left them vulnerable to robberies and kidnappings, as seen in the wake of the 2021 Ledger breach.Related: Violent crypto robberies on the rise: Six attacks that targeted investorsMeanwhile, inclusion in the S&P 500 means that “index funds, including those managed by BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, must now allocate capital to Coinbase,” Habibi told Cointelegraph. “This means billions of dollars in passive investment will flow into a crypto-native business.” $10 billion in new capital inflows?How much money could flow Coinbase’s way? Passive investing (e.g., investing in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500) has proliferated in recent years. S&P DJII estimated in 2024 that roughly $10 trillion is now passively tracking the S&P 500.If Coinbase gets only a 0.1% weighting — a share that Habibi thinks reasonable — it could reap $10 billion in potential capital flows without a single investor actively choosing crypto exposure.S&P Dow Jones Indices Annual Survey of Assets. Source: S&P GlobalInstitutional acceptance is arguably the bigger story here, Habibi continued. Coinbase’s inclusion in the index signals that public markets now reward not just growth, but regulatory compliance, operational maturity and long-term vision in the crypto space. She added:The move paves the way for other crypto firms — e.g., Circle, Chainalysis, Fireblocks — to aim for public listings and eventual index inclusion, potentially triggering a new wave of institutional-grade crypto finance companies.It may be premature to speak yet about a convergence of the crypto and TradFi economic sectors, however, as some are doing. “Crypto, overall, is still a very small fraction of the overall economy,” Seoyoung Kim, associate professor of finance at Santa Clara University, told Cointelegraph. “I think the greater convergence coming ahead will be increasing institutional adoption of blockchain-based protocols and tokenization.”A convergence of economies?Others disagree. “We have been talking about TradFi-crypto convergence for quite some time,” Owen Lau, executive director at Oppenheimer & Co, told Cointelegraph. “It is happening and will continue to happen. Robinhood/Bitstamp, Kraken/Ninja Trader and Ripple/Hidden Road are good examples.”“We’re not quite at full convergence, but we’re definitely past the separation phase,” opined Kennard. He, too, referenced crypto ETFs but also pointed to recent events, like Galaxy Digital’s listing on the Nasdaq exchange this month and Coinbase’s role as custodian for multiple ETFs, demonstrating that TradFi firms are now looking to crypto-native firms for some infrastructure needs. “Regulatory clarity is still emerging, but institutional rails are being laid fast,” said Kennard.More equity listings mean that crypto companies can tap markets as a source of liquidity, but that doesn’t necessarily involve a convergence of financial channels, stated Interactive Brokers’ Sosnick. “Convergence will occur when a traditional finance company truly adopts crypto as a means of payment.” Related: Senate stablecoin vote splits Democrats amid concerns over corruptionStill, Habibi pointed to convergence in infrastructure solutions, like JPMorgan’s Onyx platform that is being used to settle billions in intraday repo transactions using blockchain technology, Nasdaq’s digital asset custody infrastructure launch and PayPal’s launch of its PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin, which integrates crypto rails and consumer fintech.“These examples underscore a shift in which crypto and TradFi are no longer competing but co-evolving. Crypto-native firms are beginning to resemble traditional financial institutions in structure, while banks are adopting decentralized technologies to improve efficiency, reduce settlement friction, and expand asset reach,” Habibi explained.Who is next?Now that Coinbase has broken ground, should one expect other crypto firms to gain S&P 500 inclusion soon? Maybe not. A large market capitalization is needed to join the S&P 500, but that alone is not sufficient. There are other criteria. A candidate must have been profitable in the most recent year and quarter to qualify, for instance. “Galaxy Digital is newly listed [on Nasdaq], but [it still] needs consistent profitability,” said Kennard. “Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms and Strategy are often cited but may be a little early in their journey.” Lau didn’t expect any crypto-native companies to join the S&P 500 anytime soon, though it could happen in the next two to three years, he said. Rhoads ventured, “I would not go as far as stating this is the beginning of multiple crypto-related firms joining the S&P 500, as the new members often replace a firm in same industry — in this case, COIN replaced Discover Financial.”Strategy (MSTR) is a possible candidate. It easily has the necessary market capitalization, but it’s struggling to meet the index’s earnings requirements. “I don’t see MSTR making the cut,” said Kim.“I’m not sure who would be next — even Gemini (still private) seems far off based on valuations from their last funding rounds,” Kim continued. “It’s really tough to make it into the S&P 500, and so we’ll likely see existing S&P 500 firms increasingly adopt blockchain/crypto services before we see a true-blue crypto firm — i.e., one that started as a crypto firm — enter the index.”Time will tell, but for now, “I’m not aware of any crypto-linked companies with sufficient market cap and consistent earnings that meet SPX criteria,” concluded Sosnick.Magazine: TradFi is building Ethereum L2s to tokenize trillions in RWAs: Inside story",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-sp500-more-crypto-firms-to-come?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Bwbx.ioThe judge also rejected prosecutors’ argument that the case should be heard in New York. Eisenberg was in Puerto Rico at the time of the trades, and the court found that no meaningful activity tied to the alleged crime occurred in New York.The DOJ had cited a Poughkeepsie-based Mango user and a third-party vendor in Manhattan, but the judge ruled these were not enough to establish proper venue.The US government must now decide whether to refile the vacated charges, though the Trump administration has recently signaled a reduced focus on crypto enforcement. Eisenberg still faces civil suits from both the SEC and CFTC.While this ruling clears Eisenberg in the Mango Markets case, he remains behind bars.Related: Mango Markets exploiter sentenced to over 4 years on child abuse material chargesEisenberg charged with child pornographyIn a separate case, Eisenberg was sentenced to nearly four years in prison on May 1 after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography — a charge stemming from unrelated evidence uncovered during his arrest.In December 2022, US federal law enforcement authorities arrested Eisenberg in Puerto Rico. FBI officials charged the hacker with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation.A jury found Eisenberg guilty of wire fraud, commodities fraud, and commodities manipulation in April 2024.

Source: Laevitas.chThe open interest in Bitcoin put (sell) options stands at $6.5 billion, but 95% of these positions are set below $109,000. Therefore, if Bitcoin’s price holds near current levels, less than $350 million worth of put options will remain relevant at expiry.Conversely, the open interest in Bitcoin call (buy) options up to $109,000 totals $3.8 billion. Still, this imbalance does not mean every call option holder was betting on Bitcoin’s rise. Some traders may have sold these options as a way to hedge their exposure above certain price levels.Top BTC option strategies at Deribit past two weeks. Source: Laevitas.chAmong the most significant option strategies traded at Deribit in the past two weeks is the “short call,” which is often used by investors seeking a fixed-income return as long as Bitcoin’s price stays above a particular threshold. Similarly, the “bull call spread” strategy hedges against downside risk by sacrificing gains above a certain price.Strong Bitcoin ETF inflows reduce the odds of further price declineIf Bitcoin maintains the $109,000 level, most bullish strategies should deliver positive results in the May options expiry. However, bears may try to influence BTC futures markets to limit their losses as the expiry date approaches.The total open interest in Bitcoin futures is currently $79 billion, showing strong demand for short (sell) positions. Still, this strategy could backfire if Bitcoin rises above $110,000, as bears might be forced to close their positions.Net inflows of $1.9 billion into US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) between May 20 and May 22 indicate that demand above $105,000 remains robust.

During a panel at the Accelerate 2025 conference, Akshay argued that blockchain technology could help address these shortcomings, claiming that Solana could “make everyone an investor or a dreamer over time.”Akshay noted growing uncertainty among investors, citing concerns from investment managers who report heightened anxiety among clients. “You have low bond yields, you have asset price bubbles, and people don't really know how the traditional asset allocation model works anymore,” he said. The 60-40 portfolio hasn’t delivered consistent returns in a long time.”He attributed some of this tension to a widening gap between income earned through wages and wealth accumulated through asset ownership. Retail investors, he added, are often locked out of private markets, which are typically accessible only to accredited investors — a dynamic that may be contributing to overheated public markets.Akshay BD at Accelerate. Source: CointelegraphAkshay warned that the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence could further deepen existing economic divides. “The question is, which way do we go?” he asked. “Is it […] universal basic income, where we're essentially creating a welfare economy to support those unable to keep jobs or own assets? Or is it what we propose, universal basic ownership, where everybody with a mobile phone can own assets?”He outlined a vision in which crypto infrastructure enables broader asset ownership, allowing individuals to invest in everything from energy companies to local coffee shops through tokenization. In this model, acquiring an ownership stake could be as easy as scanning a QR code.In the Solana ecosystem, the \""Non-Chief Marketing Officer\"" (nCMO) is a role within the Solana Foundation that focuses on supporting the Solana community's marketing efforts.Related: Fractionalization of real world assets: Is this the holy grail of blockchain tech?Markets remain above historical averagesPublic equity markets in the US have been trading above their historical valuation norms for a long time.

This follows a sharp rebound in Bitcoin’s price, pushing past the STH cost-basis of $93,000. The profit-taking peaked at $747 million daily, a rapid increase from the $1.2 billion realized in the last 30-day period, highlighting a shift in new investor sentiment. Bitcoin entity-adjusted short-term holder.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingViewThe ETH/USDT pair could drop to the 20-day EMA ($2,388), which is a vital support to keep an eye on. If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA with strength, the bulls will again try to clear the $2,738 hurdle. If they do that, the pair could soar to $3,000.

Alternatively, a break below the $2 level suggests that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

2025-05-23T17:58:20.000Z,"‘In ‘93, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized’ — Ben Goertzel","It’s been 30 years since computer scientist Ben Goertzel wrote his first line of AI code, already convinced that artificial intelligence should be decentralized. Today, as the world approaches the dawn of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), who leads this breakthrough could have profound consequences for the future of humanity.Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada, Goertzel said, “We’re likely to be able to launch AGI that can think and generalize beyond its training and programming within the next one to three years.”His project, SingularityNET, is a decentralized ecosystem building a global marketplace for AI services. Along the way, it has secured partnerships with Mind Network and Filecoin Foundation, invested $53 million in a modular supercomputer dedicated to decentralized AGI, and completed a token merger with Ocean Protocol and Fetch.ai to unify efforts in decentralized AI development.In 2024, Goertzel founded the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the world’s largest open-source initiative dedicated to decentralized AGI.SingularityNET and the ASI Alliance are “probably the only serious AGI R&D team outside of Big Tech, certainly the only one in the crypto space, and I don't mean any slight against others doing cool AI stuff in the crypto space,” Goertzel said. For Goertzel, these milestones represent a return to first principles. After decades spent developing AI and championing decentralization, the broader tech world is finally catching up, turning once-radical ideas into drivers of multi-trillion-dollar industries. Goertzel and Sam Bourgi at the Consensus conference in Toronto, Canada. Source: CointelegraphThe substance behind decentralization“In ’93, ’94, ’95, it became clear to me AI should be decentralized,” Goertzel said.He wrote his first decentralized AI code the following year using a beta version of Java, then founded his first AI company in New York in 1997.At the time, the internet Goertzel was working with was itself decentralized, so it seemed only natural that AI should be, too.“What I didn’t foresee then was that the internet would become so centralized, actually, because at that point the internet really was decentralized,” he said.The internet’s subsequent evolution watered down the foundation of decentralization. “Later on, what happened is, you have Google, you have Facebook, you have Tencent — you have these companies making huge centralized mirrors of the internet on these massive data centers,” he said. However, for the next leap into AGI, Goertzel sees decentralization as a foundational safeguard against the monopolization and misuse of the technology. That principle is embedded in the architecture of SingularityNET, Hyperon, and the upcoming ASI Chain, a modular blockchain designed for decentralized AI.His argument is that AGI must be decentralized from the ground up, not adopted later, if it is to benefit humanity rather than serve concentrated power.“The way the post-AGI period goes may be quite different depending on whether the decentralized ecosystem plays a role in it or not,” he said, adding:“We are hoping that we, in collaboration with other decentralized teams, will be the first or among the very first to make it happen.”Goertzel’s ideas on AI and decentralization gained broader mainstream attention after his appearance on episode 1211 of the Joe Rogan Experience: Source: PowerfulJRERelated: The next frontier for crypto will be decentralizing AIA brief foray into decentralized moneyPerhaps due to his anarchist leanings and desire to “make anarchism real in cyberspace,” Goertzel explored the idea of decentralized money back in the 90s.As interesting as it sounded back then, Goertzel and his friends concluded that transaction times would be too slow and expensive, rendering the idea impractical.Just a few decades later, a person or entity named Satoshi Nakamoto created the first successful implementation of decentralized money known as Bitcoin (BTC). Ironically, its transactions are still slow and expensive — perhaps by design or due to its growing popularity — so Goertzel’s early skepticism wasn’t entirely misplaced. He also admitted that, at the time, he and his friends simply “weren’t good enough at business to hit on the idea of money laundering, selling drugs and guns online and so forth as a business model.” He was perhaps half-joking in a nod to the darknet marketplace Silk Road, which enabled anonymous transactions using Bitcoin until it was seized by authorities in 2013.Magazine: Advanced AI system is already ‘self-aware’ — ASI Alliance founder",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/ben-goertzel-ai-decentralization-interview?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Source: Fidelity Digital AssetsFidelity’s senior research analyst Daniel Gray emphasized Bitcoin’s network resilience, noting a 50% surge in hashrate since the halving. This increase signals strong miner commitment despite reduced rewards. Unlike previous cycles marked by post-halving rallies, the 2024–2025 phase has been characterized by steadier, more measured growth. The Puell Multiple—an indicator of miner revenue relative to Bitcoin’s price—has stabilized, suggesting that the market is adjusting to lower issuance without significant volatility. The report explains, “Bitcoin’s more muted returns likely reflect a market that is digesting several extrinsic tailwinds and headwinds, which have inevitably caused some uncertainty.”Historically, this mid-epoch phase has coincided with new all-time highs—an event that occurred this week. Fidelity noted that this growth could extend into Q2 2025, potentially redefining Bitcoin’s position as a credible asset class in modern portfolios.Bitcoin's Realized Cap is a significant indicator of this evolution, which measures cumulative net capital inflows. Since the 2024 halving, the Realized Cap metric has surged 63%, climbing to $915 billion from $561 billion, underscoring the scale of capital entering the market.Bitcoin realized cap milestones. Source: GlassnodeThis trend fits within Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, where Realized Cap has risen with each halving, indicating a maturing asset with substantial growth progression.Key drivers behind this Bitcoin bull marketThe current bull market cycle is also distinguished by record-breaking levels of institutional investor and corporate-level participation. The approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US in January 2024 has ushered in $134 billion in inflows, while monthly trading volumes on platforms like Binance soared past $1 trillion in March 2024—a massive leap from just $11 billion in January 2018.Public companies' strategic accumulation of Bitcoin, most notably Strategy, now holding 576,230 BTC, also sets a new industry blueprint. Firms like Metaplanet Inc., Bitcoin Group SE, and Semler Scientific have since followed suit, validating Bitcoin’s role as a corporate treasury asset this cycle.Thus, Gray asserts that Bitcoin’s fundamentals and global recognition are “stronger than ever,” signaling a cycle of growth, institutional anchoring, and market resilience.Related: Bitcoin's new all-time high has traders asking: Is BTC price overheating at $111K?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

2025-05-23T15:00:00.000Z,"Spoiler alert: The future of Web3 is not blockchain","Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi SquaredFor some, the audacity of questioning the primacy of blockchain in Web3 is borderline heretical. The idea that decentralization and progress could exist without blockchains seems absurd to those who built careers around Bitcoin, Ethereum, and their descendants. Given blockchain's well-documented scaling limits, however, there is an argument to be made that Web3 doesn't actually need blockchains to thrive. Instead, it requires payment systems and verifiable settlement systems that are super fast. Blockchains are just one way to achieve that, not the only way.While blockchain solved the double-spending problem, it introduced its own architectural burden: the rigid fixation on total ordering, dictating that every transaction must wait its turn in a global queue, processed through a monolithic consensus mechanism. Initially, this made sense in the context of payments, where security and simplicity were paramount. Still, in the context of Web3, where complex applications require speed, flexibility, and scale, this same mechanism has become a constraint. It imposes a kind of serialized tyranny, throttling throughput and locking developers into a narrow lane of design options. The undeniable influence of FastPayMobile remittance app FastPay proved that double-spending can be avoided differently without a total order. This inspired systems like Linera, which use independent local orderings while maintaining global verifiability, proving that a different, more scalable future is possible and already underway. FastPay also inspired the likes of POD and Sui's single-owner objects protocol. If FastPay had been invented before Bitcoin, blockchain might never have captured the cultural or technical imagination in the way that it did.Recent: Beijing to invest in blockchain, integrate into infrastructureSome will no doubt argue that total ordering is essential for financial integrity or that without blockchains, decentralization itself unravels. These concerns, however, mistake a particular implementation of trustlessness for trustlessness itself. What truly underpins decentralized systems is the verifiability of a transaction, not the precise order in which it happened relative to every other global transaction. Blockchain's growing pains are still on displayWhile Ethereum's Dencun upgrade sought to improve transaction throughput through \""blobs,\"" the core architecture remains tied to total ordering. Even with Solana's introduction of the Lattice system, the network continues to suffer outages caused by bugs and excessive load. Additionally, the explosion of L2s is more a workaround than a solution, offloading transactions from mainnets only to reintroduce them later in delayed batches, resulting in an endless cycle of what is essentially congestion management.The rise of flexible payment and settlement protocolsLike in legacy tech circles, the “evolve or die” mantra certainly applies to investors and builders anchored to traditional blockchain architectures. Moving forward, protocols prioritizing flexible, verifiable payment systems and settlement over rigid total ordering will unlock far greater throughput and better user experiences. As decentralized applications evolve and autonomous agents driven by AI begin interacting with blockchains, the cost of sequencing everything in order will become a competitive liability.There have already been signs of this tectonic shift taking place, with the growing adoption of modular blockchain frameworks like Celestia underscoring a broader recognition that classical blockchains are too inflexible. Data availability layers, execution shards and offchain verification mechanisms are all attempts to decouple blockchain's trusted validation from its limiting sequencing model. While these efforts may not break entirely from the past, they point unmistakably toward a future of more adaptable infrastructure.A new role for blockchainThis doesn't mean blockchain will disappear, but it must evolve. Looking ahead, its most enduring role may be as a universal verifier, less a master ledger and more of a decentralized notary within a broader, more agile stack. While this is a necessary evolution, unfortunately, it's hard to see how that shift will be smooth, as too much capital, ideology and career risk is tied up in the legacy narrative. Many venture funds, DeFi protocols, and \""Ethereum killers\"" are financially and reputationally invested in keeping the blockchain central. But history has little mercy for technological incumbents that cling to yesterday's model. Just as the internet outgrew its early walled gardens, Web3 is poised to move beyond the rigidity of block-based sequencing. The fruits from the next wave of infrastructure will belong to those who understand and capitalize on this inflection point. Opinion by: Grigore Roșu, founder and chief executive officer of Pi Squared.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

2025-05-23T14:52:03.000Z,"Who attended Trump’s controversial memecoin dinner?","The top 220 holders of US President Donald Trump’s memecoin met yesterday at the president’s golf course in Virginia for an exclusive dinner and purported meet-and-greet.Attendees spent a grand total of $148 million for an “ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” which crypto industry advocates and critics alike saw as a potential opportunity to discuss crypto policy with the president. The crowd contained a number of foreign crypto executives and influencers who otherwise would not have access to the US president, raising questions around corruption and foreign influence. Concerns were further augmented when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to release a list of attendees, stating that the event was a private affair outside of Trump’s presidential duties.However, some attendees spoke to the press or took to social media to talk about the dinner. Here are just a few:Justin SunTron founder Justin Sun was the largest TRUMP tokenholder at the gala, which was reportedly enough to earn him a special watch, presented in a special ceremony. Sun was awarded a watch in a ceremony at the event. Source: Justin SunSun’s presence at the event was particularly controversial. Last year, he faced a lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the alleged “orchestration of the unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading, and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities.”The SEC asked for a reprieve in late February, just over a month since Trump’s inauguration and the subsequent 180 in federal agencies’ approach toward regulating crypto. Outside the crypto dinner, Sun posted on May 21 that he would be spending a week in Washington, DC to have “meaningful conversations that will help shape the next chapter of blockchain’s future” in the United States.Kain WarwickKain Warwick, founder of crypto exchange operator iFinex, told The New York Times on May 12 that he was attending the event after stocking up on enough TRUMP to break the top 25 investors on the leaderboard. Warwick said he wanted to have a shot at meeting the president, or someone on his team, to talk crypto — specifically decentralized finance (DeFi), which is getting less attention in the current crop of crypto bills circulating the US Congress.“If you assume Trump and 10 people within the Trump team are there, now you’ve got a one in 15 shot of having a conversation with one of them,” he said.Vincent LiuVincent Liu, chief investment officer of crypto trading, VC and market-making firm Kronos Research, attended the event, posting pictures of the menu and Trump’s brief speech.A photo of the menu at Donald Trump’s memecoin dinner.

Odom himself will hold 5% of all ODOM.Sangrok OhCEO of Seoul- and Tokyo-based cryptocurrency management firm Hyperithm, Sangrok Oh was the 13th-largest TRUMP holder with a wallet containing over $3 million worth of the token, according to the Straits Times. Oh told The New York Times that he had arrived with a batch of red “Make Crypto Great Again” hats to give away at the dinner and expected to speak directly with the president. “It’s kind of a fund-raiser [...] And he’ll always be good to his sponsors.”Oh has been critical of the slow regulatory progress for crypto in the countries where his company operates. Anonymous attendeesIn addition to crypto execs and sports stars, the event also noted a few anonymous or pseudonymous crypto traders and entrepreneurs in attendance. Among them was “Ice,” co-founder of the Singaporean crypto company MemeCore. Their company’s chief business development officer, Cherry Hsu, told Sherwood News that Trump’s rise “represents the power of memes to influence culture, perception, and movements — principles that align with MemeCore’s vision of a decentralized, community-driven future.”“Ogle,” a cybersecurity adviser to Trump’s own World Liberty Financial crypto enterprise, as well as the pseudonymous co-founder of blockchain ecosystem Glue, also attended. Ogle said they were going out of curiosity, more than anything, and did not endorse Trump personally. “I’m hoping it’ll be fun — and hoping they’ll serve McDonald’s.”Another anonymous attendee was “Cryptoo Bear,” a crypto trader and occasional news reporter who posts primarily in Japanese. Cryptoo Bear made no political statements about the event, mainly posting about the swag and the food. They did say they were promised a photo op with the president, but it didn’t pan out. Source: Cryptoo BearDinner “guests” across the picket lineOutside the country club, US senators and former staffers attended the event as part of a protest.Bloomberg reported that protestors shouted “Shame!” and “I hope you choke on your dinner!” at attendees. Critics of the event widely consider it to be a glaring example of corruption in Washington and within the Trump administration. Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, joined the protest. “The spirit of the Constitution was that no one elected would be selling influence to anyone,” he said, “because it’s to be government by and for the people.”Ken Papaj, a former Treasury Department official, said, “Every time there’s a transaction, he gets a transaction fee? Just unconscionable what he’s doing.”The dinner comes at a pivotal time for the crypto industry in the US, where the industry is pushing hard for Congress to pass friendly regulations. Trump’s ties may complicate matters, however, as lawmakers have introduced anti-corruption bills targeting crypto and politicians.Senate Democrats are also taking aim at the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act, introducing a slew of amendments addressing Trump’s crypto businesses. Magazine: AI cures blindness, ‘good’ propaganda bots, OpenAI doomsday bunker: AI Eye",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/news/who-attended-trumps-controversial-memecoin-dinner?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

2025-05-23T14:20:00.000Z,"What is DNS hijacking? How it took down Curve Finance’s website","Understanding the Curve Finance DNS hijacking              On May 12, 2025, at 20:55 UTC, hackers hijacked the “.fi” domain name system (DNS) of Curve Finance after managing to access the registrar. They began sending its users to a malicious website, attempting to drain their wallets. This was the second attack on Curve Finance’s infrastructure in a week.Users were directed to a website that was a non-functional decoy, designed only to trick users into providing wallet signatures. The hack hadn’t breached the protocol’s smart contracts and was limited to the DNS layer.The DNS is a critical component of the internet that functions like a phonebook. It allows you to use simple, memorable domain names (such as facebook.com) instead of complex numerical IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) for websites. DNS converts these user-friendly domain names into the IP addresses computers require to connect.This is not the first time Curve Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, has suffered such an attack. Back in August 2022, Curve Finance faced an attack with similar tactics. The attackers had cloned the Curve Finance website and interfered with its DNS settings to send users to a duplicate version of the website. Users who tried using the platform ended up losing their money to the attackers. The project was using the same registrar, “iwantmyname,” at the time of the previous attack.                  How attackers execute DNS hijacking in crypto              When a user types a web address, their device queries a DNS server to retrieve the corresponding IP address and connect to the correct website. In DNS hijacking, fraudsters interfere with this process by altering how DNS queries are resolved, rerouting users to malicious sites without their knowledge.Fraudsters execute DNS hijacking in several ways. Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in DNS servers, compromise routers, or gain access to domain registrar accounts. The objective is to change the DNS records so that a user trying to visit a legitimate site is redirected to a fake, lookalike page containing wallet-draining code. Types of DNS hijacking include:Local DNS hijack: Malware on a user’s device changes DNS settings, redirecting traffic locally. Router hijack: Attackers compromise home or office routers to alter DNS for all connected devices. Man-in-the-middle attack: Intercepts DNS queries between user and server, altering responses on the fly. Registrar-level hijack: Attackers gain access to a domain registrar account and modify official DNS records, affecting all users globally.Did you know? During the Curve Finance DNS attack in 2023, users accessing the real domain unknowingly signed malicious transactions. The back end was untouched, but millions were lost through a spoofed front end.                  How DNS hijacking worked in the case of Curve Finance              When attackers compromise a website with DNS hijacking, they can reroute traffic to a malicious website without the user’s knowledge. There are several ways DNS hijacking can occur. Attackers might infect a user’s device with malware that alters local DNS settings, or they may gain control of a router and change its DNS configuration. They may also target DNS servers or domain registrars themselves. In such cases, they modify the DNS records at the source, affecting all users trying to access the site.In the case of Curve Finance, the attackers infiltrated the systems of the domain registrar “iwantmyname” and altered the DNS delegation of the “curve.fi” domain to redirect traffic to their own DNS server. A domain registrar is a company authorized to manage the reservation and registration of internet domain names. It allows individuals or organizations to claim ownership of a domain and link it to web services like hosting and email.The precise method of the breach is still under investigation. By May 22, 2025, no evidence of unauthorized access or compromised credentials was found.Did you know? DNS hijacking attacks often succeed by compromising domain registrar accounts through phishing or poor security. Many Web3 projects still host domains with centralized providers like GoDaddy or Namecheap.                   How Curve Finance responded to the hack              While the registrar was slow to respond, the Curve team took measures to deal with the situation. It successfully redirected the “.fi” domain to neutral nameservers, thus taking the website offline while efforts to regain control continued. To ensure safe access to the frontend and secure fund management, the Curve team quickly launched a secure alternative at “curve.finance,” now serving as the official Curve Finance interface temporarily.Upon discovering the exploit at 21:20 UTC, the following actions were taken: Users were immediately notified through official channelsRequested the takedown of the compromised domainInitiated mitigation and domain recovery processesCollaborated with security partners and the registrar to coordinate a response.Compromise of the domain notwithstanding, the Curve protocol and its smart contracts remained secure and fully operational. During the disruption of the front end, Curve processed over $400 million in onchain volume. No user data was at risk, as Curve’s front end does not store any user information.Throughout the compromise, the Curve team was always available through its Discord server, where users could raise issues with them.After implementing immediate damage control measures, the Curve team is now taking additional steps to prepare for the future.Assessing and enhancing registrar-level security, incorporating stronger protections and exploring alternative registrarsInvestigating decentralized front-end options to eliminate dependence on susceptible web infrastructurePartnering with the broader DeFi and Ethereum Name Service (ENS) communities to advocate for native browser support for “.eth” domains.Did you know? Unlike smart contract exploits, DNS hijacks leave no trace onchain initially, making it hard for users to realize they have been tricked until funds are gone. It is a stealthy form of crypto theft.                  How crypto projects can deal with DNS hijacking vulnerability              The Curve Finance attack is concerning because it bypassed the decentralized security mechanisms at the protocol level. Curve’s backend, meaning its smart contracts and onchain logic, remained unharmed, yet users lost funds because they were deceived at the interface level. This incident underscores a significant vulnerability in DeFi. While the backend may be decentralized and trustless, the front end still depends on centralized Web2 infrastructure like DNS, hosting and domain registrars. Attackers can exploit these centralized choke points to undermine trust and steal funds. The Curve attack serves as a wake-up call for the crypto industry to explore decentralized web infrastructure, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum Name Service (ENS), to reduce reliance on vulnerable centralized services.To address the gap between decentralized backends and centralized frontends, crypto projects must adopt a multi-layered approach. Here are various ways crypto projects can deal with this gap:Minimize reliance on traditional DNS: They can minimize reliance on traditional DNS by integrating decentralized alternatives of DNS like the ENS or Handshake, which reduce the risk of registrar-level hijacks. Use decentralized file storage systems: Hosting frontends on decentralized file storage systems such as IPFS or Arweave adds another layer of protection.Implement domain name system security extensions (DNSSEC): Teams should implement DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS records and prevent unauthorized changes. Secure registrar accounts: Registrar accounts must be secured with strong authentication methods, including multifactor authentication (MFA) and domain locking. Train users: Educating users to verify site authenticity, such as bookmarking URLs or checking ENS records, can reduce phishing success rates. Bridging the trust gap between decentralized protocols and centralized interfaces is essential for maintaining security and user confidence in DeFi platforms.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-dns-hijacking-how-it-took-down-curve-finances-website?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub

Cetus’ recovery plan on Sui mirrors a Solana blueprint","The bounty offer to recover stolen funds from Sui-based decentralized exchange (DEX) Cetus closely resembles a successful strategy used by a Solana project three years ago.It turns out that Cetus shares the same development team as Crema Finance, a Solana-based DeFi project that suffered a $9-million hack in 2022 but recovered most of the funds by negotiating with its hacker. Now, Cetus is relying on the same strategy.Cetus is asking the hacker to return all but $6 million, or 2,324 Ether (ETH), of the stolen funds in exchange for a promise not to pursue legal action. The protocol lost $223 million to an exploit on May 22.The size of the bounty has sparked backlash from users, with many calling for a formal compensation plan instead. Several community members argue that even if funds are recovered, most of the damage has already been done — especially to holders of the CETUS token, which plummeted in value following the incident.Meanwhile, Sui validators are also under fire for their role in freezing the funds.

With CETUS tanking, trust fractured and validators freezing funds, critics are asking whether Sui’s decentralization is more appearance than reality.The debate over decentralization isn’t unique to Sui. When Bybit lost $1.4 billion in a February hack linked to North Korean state actors, security experts and users urged platforms like THORChain and eXch to block the funds. In that case, THORChain received some backlash for not stepping in, which is the exact opposite of what Sui is being criticized for now.As of now, the hacker hasn’t accepted Cetus’ offer.

Meanwhile, across the Capitol, Representative Tom Emmer reintroduced the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, backed by bipartisan support.Breaking down GENIUSThe GENIUS Act — short for “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” — seeks to answer foundational questions around stablecoin issuance and oversight.“It defines this idea of a payment stablecoin,” explained Rashan Colbert, director of US policy at the Crypto Council for Innovation, in this week’s interview. Colbert emphasized that the bill doesn’t stop at definitions. “It outlines in a robust way just who’s allowed to do this and what they need to look like.” By this, he’s referring to guidelines on who can be permitted issuers like bank subsidiaries, credit unions and approved non-bank entities.Related: Interest groups, lawmakers to protest Trump’s memecoin dinnerThis bipartisan momentum seen backing the GENIUS Act is both exciting and significant. “There has been latent support within Congress, including within the Democratic caucus,” Colbert said. “They just haven’t had the opportunity to take meaningful votes.”Blockchain dev protectionOn the House side, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, co-sponsored by Representatives Emmer and Ritchie Torres, aims to give legal clarity to developers and service providers who don’t custody customer funds.“It clarifies that they are not money transmitters,” said Colbert. “That’s the clarity these builders and entrepreneurs need to continue operating successfully.”With crypto adoption on the rise — particularly among minority communities — Colbert said the pressure is on. “Something like one in five Americans hold crypto. That number is even larger in the Black, Latino and Asian-American communities,” he noted.Looking ahead, the push toward broader market structure reform will be more complex. Colbert’s advice? Get involved. “It really is, at the end of the day, the people making their voices heard,” he said. “Crypto is a big deal — and Capitol Hill is finally starting to listen.”Listen to the full episode of Byte-Sized Insight for the complete interview on Cointelegraph’s Podcasts page, Apple Podcasts or Spotify.

2025-05-23T13:00:00.000Z,"Ledn ditches ETH, shifts to full custody model for Bitcoin loans","Digital asset lender Ledn is transitioning to fully collateralized Bitcoin lending and discontinuing support for Ethereum, in moves designed to consolidate its BTC-focused business and further safeguard client assets against credit risks.In adopting a full custody structure for Bitcoin (BTC) loans, Ledn will no longer lend out client assets to generate interest, the company disclosed on May 23. Instead, Bitcoin collateral will remain under full custody by Ledn or one of its designated funding partners. “This means assets aren’t rehypothecated, reused, or loaned out to generate yield,” Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds told Cointelegraph. Reeds said the move brings the company back to its roots and aligns more closely with Bitcoin’s founding principles.“Bitcoin was created as a direct response to the risks of fractional reserve banking and unchecked use of client assets to generate interest,” said Reed, adding:“Traditional finance relies on constantly reusing client assets to create leverage and, ultimately, inflation. Bitcoiners instinctively reject that model. That’s why we’ve moved away from this approach entirely. Reed told Cointelegraph that the company is ending support for Ether (ETH) as “part of a broader strategic shift,” as Bitcoin represents over 99% of Ledn’s client activity. “Rather than fragmenting the platform to chase marginal volume, we’re going all-in on Bitcoin and simplifying our stack to reflect what our clients actually value,” said Reed.Founded in 2018, Ledn has emerged as one of the largest lenders in the digital asset space with a loan book value of $9.9 billion, according to Galaxy Research. The company enables Bitcoin holders to borrow against their assets, giving them access to liquidity without having to sell their holdings or trigger a taxable event.This approach is commonly used by wealthy investors, who take out low-interest loans against stocks, real estate, and other assets to access cash.Bitcoin’s price has reached new all-time highs above $111,000.

Trump’s sons — Eric and Donald Jr. —are involved in the management of the company.Zhao said the WSJ article portrayed him as acting as a “fixer” for the WLF team and its co-founder Zach Witkoff during foreign trips. The article suggested Zhao facilitated introductions and meetings for WLF leaders during foreign trips, including a visit to Pakistan that reportedly resulted in a memorandum of understanding with a local official.“I am not a fixer for anyone,” Zhao said, firmly denying that he connected Pakistani official “Mr. Saqib” with WLF or organized any engagements abroad. “They had known each other way back, whereas I only met with Mr. Saqib for the first time in Pakistan.” Source: Changpeng ZhaoWSJ reports on Steve and Zach WitkoffZhao’s response follows a WSJ investigation highlighting a complex string of diplomatic and business interests involving WLF. The report raised concerns about the blurred lines between public duties and private interests and focused on diplomatic and business dealings involving WLF co-founders Steve Witkoff and his son, Zach Witkoff.

Online banks, he said, spend about $20 to $30. In contrast, DeFi requires almost nothing beyond a smartphone and internet access.“Onboarding to DeFi literally costs zero,” Bukov said. “You don’t need brick-and-mortar infrastructure or lengthy verification processes. Just connect and transact.” Bukov said that this gives DeFi an edge over traditional financial institutions in reaching the 1.4 billion unbanked people who remain excluded from traditional finance due to high onboarding expenses.1inch Network co-founder Anton Bukov at the Dutch Blockchain Week. Source: CointelegraphReaching 1.4 billion unbanked users“That’s why we have 1.4 billion people on the planet who are unbanked. No one’s going to invest those hundreds or tens of dollars into them because they will never return to them,” Bukov added. Unlike traditional finance, which has high barriers to entry, Bukov said DeFi allows the unbanked to become a part of the global economy and engage in real-life transactions using stablecoins like Tether’s USDt (USDT). With lower barriers to entry, DeFi becomes a tool for financial inclusion. Bukov said DeFi will continue to reach users who never had access to traditional banking as internet access expands globally. “You can just get a phone, access to the internet, and you can exchange your chicken for USDT,” Bukov said, highlighting how easily DeFi enables participation in the global economy. Related: Animoca’s Yat Siu says student loans can supercharge DeFi growthDeFi allows access to global liquidity Apart from financial inclusion, Bukov said that the real value of crypto lies in how it gives access to global liquidity. The 1inch co-founder said crypto is evolving into an independent economic zone, where hundreds of billions flow through decentralized protocols. “Crypto isn’t just about adopting stablecoins or building national digital currencies,” Bukov said. “It’s a growing global liquidity hub.”He said that this liquidity is dynamic and allows financial experimentation, yield strategies and cross-border capital movement. Bukov added that countries that align their regulations to enable easier access to this global liquidity can tap into economic opportunities and cooperation. “The more countries trade with each other, the more they succeed.

2025-05-23T08:25:00.000Z,"Why Tether refuses to comply with MiCA","Is Tether MiCA compliant?              The EU’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation, better known as MiCA, is the first major attempt by a global economic power to create clear, region-wide rules for the crypto space, and stablecoins are a big focus.MiCA mandates best practices. If a stablecoin is going to be traded in the EU, its issuer has to follow some stringent rules:1. You need a licenseTo issue a stablecoin in Europe, you must become a fully authorized electronic money institution (EMI). That’s the same kind of license traditional fintechs need to offer e-wallets or prepaid cards. It’s not cheap and it’s not quick. 2. Most of your reserves have to sit in European banksThis is one of the most controversial parts of MiCA. If you issue a “significant” stablecoin — and Tether’s USDT certainly qualifies — at least 60% of your reserves must be held in EU-based banks. The logic is to keep the financial system safe. 3. Full transparency is non-negotiableMiCA requires detailed, regular disclosures. Issuers have to publish a white paper and provide updates on their reserves, audits and operational changes. This level of reporting is new territory for some stablecoins, especially those that have historically avoided public scrutiny.4. Non-compliant coins are getting delistedIf a token doesn’t comply, it won’t be tradable on regulated EU platforms. Binance, for example, has delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). Other exchanges are following suit.The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) clarified that people in Europe can still hold or transfer USDT, but it can’t be offered to the public or listed on official venues. In other words, you might still have USDT in your wallet, but good luck trying to swap it on a regulated platform.                  Key reasons why Tether rejects MiCA regulations              Tether is unique in that it has explained why it wants nothing to do with MiCA regulations. The company’s leadership, especially CEO Paolo Ardoino, has been pretty vocal about what they see as serious flaws in the regulation, from financial risks to privacy concerns to the bigger picture of who stablecoins are really for.1. The banking rule could backfireOne of MiCA’s most talked-about rules says that “significant” stablecoins — like Tether’s USDt (USDT) — must keep at least 60% of their reserves in European banks. The idea is to make stablecoins safer and more transparent. But Ardoino sees it differently.He’s warned that this could create new problems, forcing stablecoin issuers to rely so heavily on traditional banks could make the whole system more fragile. After all, if there’s a wave of redemptions and those banks don’t have enough liquidity to keep up, we’d witness a struggling bank and a stablecoin crisis simultaneously.Instead, Tether prefers to keep most of its reserves in US Treasurys, assets it says are liquid, low-risk and much easier to redeem quickly if needed.2. They don’t trust the digital euroTether also has a broader issue with the direction Europe is heading, especially regarding a digital euro. Ardoino has openly criticized it, raising alarms about privacy. He has argued that a centrally controlled digital currency could be used to track how people spend their money, and even control or restrict transactions if someone falls out of favor with the system.Privacy advocates have echoed similar concerns. While the European Central Bank insists that privacy is a top priority (with features like offline payments), Tether isn’t convinced. In their eyes, putting that much financial power in the hands of one institution is asking for trouble.3. Tether’s users aren’t in Brussels. They’re in Brazil, Turkey and NigeriaAt the heart of it, Tether sees itself as a lifeline for people in countries dealing with inflation, unstable banking systems and limited access to dollars. These are places like Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria, where USDT is often more useful than the local currency.MiCA, with all its licensing hoops and reserve mandates, would require Tether to shift focus and invest heavily in meeting EU-specific standards. That’s something the company says it’s not willing to do, not at the expense of the markets it sees as most in need of financial tools like USDT.Did you know? Turkey ranks among the top countries for cryptocurrency adoption, with 16% of its population engaged in crypto activities. This high adoption rate is largely driven by the devaluation of the Turkish lira and economic instability, prompting citizens to seek alternatives like stablecoins to preserve their purchasing power.                  What happens when Tether doesn’t comply with MiCA              Tether’s decision to skip MiCA didn’t exactly fly under the radar. It’s already having real consequences, especially for exchanges and users in Europe.Exchanges are dropping USDTBig names like Binance and Kraken didn’t wait around. To stay on the right side of EU regulators, they’ve already delisted USDT trading pairs for users in the European Economic Area. Binance had removed them by the end of March 2025. Kraken followed close behind, removing not just USDT but also other non-compliant stablecoins like EURT and PayPal’s PYUSD.Users are left with fewer optionsIf you’re in Europe and holding USDT, you’re not totally out of luck; you can still withdraw or swap it on certain platforms. But you won’t be trading it on major exchanges anymore. That’s already pushing users toward alternatives like USDC and EURC, which are fully MiCA-compliant and widely supported.Even major crypto payment processors are pulling support, leaving users with fewer options for spending their crypto directly.A hit to liquidity? Probably.Pulling USDT from European exchanges could make the markets a bit shakier. Less liquidity, wider spreads and more volatility during big price moves are all on the table. Some traders will adjust quickly. Others? Not so much.Did you know? Tether (USDT) is the most traded cryptocurrency globally, surpassing even Bitcoin in daily volume. In 2024, it facilitated over $20.6 trillion in transactions and boasts a user base exceeding 400 million worldwide.                  Tether vs MiCA regulation              Tether may be out of sync with the EU, but it’s far from retreating. If anything, the company is doubling down elsewhere, looking for friendlier ground and broader horizons.Firstly, Tether’s picked El Salvador as its new base, a country that has fully embraced crypto. After getting a digital asset service provider license, the company is setting up a real headquarters there. Ardoino and other top execs are making the move too.Moreover, after banking over $5 billion in profits in early 2024, Tether is putting its capital to work:AI: Through its venture arm, Tether Evo, the company has picked up stakes in firms like Northern Data Group and Blackrock Neurotech. Tether has also launched Tether AI, an open-source, decentralized AI platform designed to operate on any device without centralized servers or API keys. The goal is to use AI to boost operations and maybe build some new tools along the way.Infrastructure and AgTech: Tether invested in Adecoagro, a company focused on sustainable farming and renewable energy. It’s a surprising move, but it fits Tether’s bigger strategy of backing real-world, resilient systems.Media and beyond: There are also signs Tether wants a footprint in content and communications, signaling it’s thinking far beyond crypto alone.                  Tether’s MiCA exit highlights crypto’s global regulatory chaos              Tether walking away from MiCA is a snapshot of a much bigger issue in crypto: How hard it is to build a business in a world where every jurisdiction plays by its own rulebook.The classic game of regulatory arbitrageThis isn’t Tether’s first rodeo when it comes to navigating regulations. Like many crypto companies, they’ve mastered the art of regulatory arbitrage, finding the friendliest jurisdiction and setting up shop there. Europe brings in strict rules? Fine, Tether sets up in El Salvador, where crypto is welcomed with open arms.However, it does raise questions. If big players can simply move jurisdictions to dodge regulations, how effective are those rules in the first place? And does that leave retail users protected or just further confused?A crypto world that’s all over the mapThe bigger issue is that the global regulatory landscape is incredibly fragmented. Europe wants full compliance, transparency and reserve mandates. The US is still sending mixed signals. Asia is split; Hong Kong is pro-crypto, while China stays cold. Hong Kong has also passed the Stablecoin Bill to license fiat-backed issuers and boost its Web3 ambitions. Meanwhile, Latin America is embracing crypto as a tool for financial access.For companies, it’s a mess. You can’t build for one global market; you must constantly adapt, restructure or pull out entirely. For users, it creates massive gaps in access. A coin available in one country might be inaccessible in another just because of local policy.As a final thought: Tether’s resistance to MiCA seems to be more than just a protest against red tape. It’s making a bet that crypto’s future will be shaped outside Brussels, not inside it.",Cointelegraph,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/why-tether-refuses-to-comply-with-mica?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"","",finnhub
